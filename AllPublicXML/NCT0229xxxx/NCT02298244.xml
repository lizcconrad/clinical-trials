  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Some patients with a long history of AF develops PH &quot;reactive&quot; type with an increase in
      pulmonary vascular resistance due to vasoconstriction or structural changes of the vascular
      wall. RFA PVI + RFA GP is the &quot;gold standard&quot; in the treatment of patients with persistent
      AF, do not respond to optimal therapy. The rear area of the pulmonary artery bifurcation is
      adjacent to the roof and part of the front of the left atrium. In the projection of this area
      are ganglionic plexus of the left atrium, the sympathetic nerve fibers of the pulmonary
      artery and baroreceptors main pulmonary artery.Recent studies have shown that radiofrequency
      denervation of the pulmonary artery improves the quality of life in patients with PH.

    <description>In real time builds the 3D card LA using nonfluoroscopic navigation system.Left and right PVs encircle in 1 lesion line by circumferential PV isolation.Radiofrequency energy delivered at 43◦C,35 W,0.5 cm away from the PV ostia at the anterior wall,and reduced to 43◦C,30 W,1 cm away from the PV ostia at the posterior wall,with a saline irrigation speed of 17 ml/min.Each lesion of ablation continuously until the local potential amplitude decreased by &gt;80% or RF energy deliveries exceeded 40 seconds.The endpoint of circumferential PV isolation is PV isolation;this confirm when Lasso mapping show the disappearance of all PV potentials or the dissociation of PV potentials from left atrial activity.To accomplish ganglionated plexi ablation,LA target sites were identified as the anatomic locations where vagal reflexes were evoked by transcatheter HFS.Rectangular electrical stimuli were delivered at a frequency of 50 Hz,output amplitude 15V and pulse duration of 10 ms,for 5 sec</description>

    <description>The procedure of AF ablation is the same like in the circumferential PV isolation + GP Ablation.
8-Fr sheath is carried through the right heart into the pulmonary artery trunk. Using ablation electrode constructed 3D map of the pulmonary artery trunk and the right and left main branches. Further HFS performed with the tip ablation electrode at the bifurcation of the pulmonary artery and in the ostium of the left and right pulmonary arteries (less than 2 mm distal to the bifurcation) 20 Hz, duration of each stimulus 10 ms. A positive response would be considered an increase in the RR interval of more than 50% of baseline within 10 seconds. In areas with a positive response to HFS, will be performed RFA Efficiency criterion: no previously described responses to HFS in the ablation area. Parameters RFA: 8-10 watts for 60 seconds duration at one point, the irrigation speed of 5 ml / min.</description>
