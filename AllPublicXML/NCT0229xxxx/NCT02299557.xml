  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an double blinded, cross-over study to determine the effect of Oxymetazoline gel on
      anal resting pressure and fecal incontinence in patients with spinal cord injury.
      Approximately 17 subjects are expected to complete this 10 weeks study that will include two
      treatment periods of 4 weeks each, and one 2 weeks wash out period.
