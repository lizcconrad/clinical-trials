      Background and aims: Glidescope and Airtraq were designed to facilitate intubation and to
      improve teaching intubation. The investigators want to find their efficacy in normal airway,
      tongue edema and face-to-face orotracheal intubation models by novice personal.

      Material and Methods: After Kocaeli Human Researches Ethics Committee approval, thirty six
      medical students who were on the beginning of their third year were enrolled in this study.
      After watching a video about the intubation of one of these devices, they attempted to
      intubate an adult manikin in three different airway models in a random order; first in normal
      airway, second, tongue edema and finally, in an entrapped manikin by face-to-face approach
      with Glidescope or Airtraq. Intubation attempts, insertion and intubation times, success
      rates, Cormack-Lehane grades, need of maneuvers of these devices were recorded.

      Trauma victims mostly had to be intubated at the scene of the area with the paramedics. In a
      suspect of a cervical trauma, patients must be intubated with the least movement.
      Videolaryngoscopic techniques had several advantages at this condition. We want to
      investigate which can be used easily by novice personnel.
