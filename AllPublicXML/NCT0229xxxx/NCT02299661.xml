  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      DS-1093a is an inhibitor of hypoxia-inducible factor prolyl hydroxylases, and is expected to
      produce transient dose / exposure dependent increases in erythropoietin levels in subjects
      with chronic kidney disease (CKD). This study will be conducted in 2 parts. Part A will
      involve subjects with stage 3b or 4 CKD, and will be an open, non-controlled parallel group
      investigation of three single doses of DS-1093a (6 subjects/dose), in which allocation to
      dose will be randomised. On completion of this part of the study an optional fourth dose may
      be tested to gain a more complete understanding of the PK/PD behaviour of DS-1093a. Part B
      will be an open, non-controlled investigation of a single dose of DS-1093a in CKD subjects
      (n=6) receiving haemodialysis. The dose for Part B will be determined based on the data from
      Part A.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Male and female patients aged 18 - 70 years (inclusive).

          -  Female patients must be of non-childbearing potential (post-menopause or surgical
             sterilization). In women younger than 60 years a follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH)
             test will be conducted to confirm post-menopausal status (i.e., FSH ≥ 30 mU/mL).

          -  Part A: CKD stage 3b (eGFR: &lt; 45 to ≥ 30 mL/min) or stage 4 (eGFR: &lt; 30 to ≥ 15
             mL/min). The CKD-EPI equation will be used for the eGFR estimation.

          -  Part B: Patients on chronic haemodialysis for at least 6 months and stable Hb levels
             (i.e., +/- 1 g/dL) for the last 6 months.

          -  Patient can be washed out from ESAs for at least 3 weeks (2 weeks prior to dosing and
             1 week post-dose).

          -  Baseline Hb level ≥10 g/dL.

          -  Willingness to give written consent to participate after reading the ICF, and after
             having the opportunity to discuss the trial with the Investigator or his delegate.

          -  Male patients must be willing to use a reliable method of contraception during the
             trial, and for 4 months afterwards

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Use of ESAs within 2 weeks prior to dosing.

          -  Uncontrolled hypertension despite optimal medical therapy, defined as &gt; 160/100 mmHg
             after 10 minutes of rest at screening, and &gt; 180/110 mmHg after 10 minutes of rest on
             Day -1 pre-dose.

          -  Known haemoglobinopathy.

          -  Acute renal failure (as judged by the Investigator).

          -  History of kidney transplant regardless of functionality.

          -  Start of any new medication or any changes to a current dosage within 7 days prior to
             study drug administration.

          -  Chronic liver disease.

          -  Positive hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) or hepatitis C virus (HCV) antibody test.

          -  A history of gastrointestinal bleeding.

          -  History of a thrombotic event (e.g., myocardial infarction, stroke or transient
             ischemic attack, peripheral embolism, venous thromboembolism, etc.)

          -  Patients with poorly controlled diabetes despite optimal medical therapy.

          -  A history of cancer, except basal cell skin cancer, squamous cell skin cancer, or
             cervical cancer (if judged by the Investigator to be in full remission).

          -  Hypersensitivity to any components of the study drug.

          -  Requirement for any concomitant medication that cannot be withheld on Day 1 until 4
             hours post-dose (insulin is allowed to cover the breakfast, if necessary).

          -  Clinically relevant abnormal medical history, physical findings, ECG, or laboratory
             values at the screening assessments that could interfere with the objectives of the
             trial or the safety of the patient.

          -  Participation in another investigational drug trial within 30 days prior to dosing (or
             5 times the half-life of the drug, whichever is longer) or exposure to more than three
             new investigational agents within 12 months prior to enrolment.

             screening and/or Day -1.

          -  Patients who smoke more than 10 cigarettes per day (or equivalent), and who would not
             be able to abstain from smoking during the in-house period.

          -  Concomitant use of medications known to affect the elimination of serum creatinine
             (e.g., trimethoprim or cimetidine) and competitors of renal tubular secretion (e.g.,
             probenecid) within 30 days before dosing.

          -  Use of a strong inducer or inhibitor of CYP enzymes, during the 30 days before dosing.

          -  Use of any other prohibited medication.
