  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy, safety and tolerability of
      JNJ-38518168 in participants with moderate to severe plaque-type psoriasis (common
      genetically determined, chronic, inflammatory skin disease characterized by rounded
      erythematous, dry, scaling patches).

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized (study medication assigned to participants by chance), double-blind
      (neither the researchers nor the participants know what treatment the participant is
      receiving), parallel-group, placebo-controlled (an inactive substance; a pretend treatment
      [with no drug in it] that is compared in a clinical trial with a drug to test if the drug has
      a real effect) study. The study consists of Screening Phase (maximum of 42 days prior to Week
      0), Treatment Phase (Week 0-12) and Follow-up Phase (up to Week 16). Participants will be
      randomly assigned to receive JNJ-38518168 (3 milligram [mg] or 30 mg or 60 mg) or placebo
      once daily. The initial group of the participants will be randomized to either JNJ-38518168
      30 mg or placebo. The dose assignments for the subsequent participants will depend on the
      results of up to 2 interim analyses. Efficacy will be primarily assessed by percentage of
      participants who achieve a Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) 75 response at Week 12.
      Participants' safety will be monitored throughout the study.

    <description>The PASI score is a combined assessment of lesion severity and area affected into single score. Body will be divided into 4 sections:head, arms, trunk, and legs.

Final PASI=sum of severity parameters for each section*area score*weight of section (head:0.1,arms:0.2,body:0.3,legs:0.4);total possible score range: 0=no disease to 72=maximal disease.

    <description>The PSSD is a questionnaire designed to measure the severity of psoriasis symptoms and signs over the previous 7 days for the assessment of treatment benefit. The PSSD is a self-administered patient-reported outcome (PRO) instrument that includes 11 items covering symptoms and patient-observable signs. The psoriasis symptom score includes itch (Q1), pain (Q11), stinging (Q10), burning (Q9) and skin tightness (Q4) and average value of all 5 items will be converted into 0-100 score, where 0= least severe to 100=most severe. The psoriasis sign score includes skin dryness (Q2), cracking (Q3), scaling (Q5), shedding or flaking (Q6), redness (Q7) and bleeding (Q8) and average value of all 6 items will be converted into 0-100 score, where 0= least severe to 100=most severe. Total score includes all 11 individual items (both symptom and signs) and average value of all 11 items will be converted into 0-100 score, where 0= least severe to 100=most severe.</description>
