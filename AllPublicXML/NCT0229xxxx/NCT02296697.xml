  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients admitted in the Emergency Service that have pressure ulcers will be selected by
      eligibility criteria and randomized into three groups according to the adopted therapy: wound
      dressing (CG); wound dressing + high-frequency generator group (GAF); and wound dressing +
      low-level laser therapy group (GLBP).

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Wound dressing is considered the standard treatment for pressure ulcers, however, despite its
      proven efficacy, it's a long-term healing process. Among Physiotherapy resources available
      for pressure ulcers treatment, the most used are low-level laser therapy and high-frequency
      generator. Even though the individual effects of both are evidenced on literature, there are
      no randomized clinical trials evidencing the effects of low-level laser therapy and
      high-frequency generator in comparison to wound dressing on pressure ulcers treatment.
