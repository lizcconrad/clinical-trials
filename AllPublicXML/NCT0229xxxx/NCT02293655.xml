    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the effects of receiving and then discontinuing methylphenidate (MPH) in
      children with ADHD. After receiving MPH for 8 weeks, participants will be randomized to
      either discontinue MPH (and receive placebo) OR remain on MPH for 4 weeks.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The stimulant methylphenidate (MPH) is the most commonly prescribed psychoactive medication
      in children. An abundance of studies attest to the efficacy of MPH for attenuating
      inattentive, hyperactive, and impulsive symptoms in children with ADHD. Despite its efficacy,
      most children with ADHD who are prescribed MPH have poor continuity of treatment for a
      variety of reasons, including forgetting to administer the medication and delays obtaining
      refills. In addition, it is an accepted clinical practice for physicians to omit MPH for
      periods of time, such as during the summer or on weekends (i.e., drug holidays). Since MPH
      discontinuation is considered to be benign, many clinicians do not employ any special
      procedures or inform families of any special precautions in regard to its cessation. However,
      increasing evidence suggests that the pharmacological effects of MPH cause lasting changes in
      brain neurochemistry that persist beyond medication discontinuation. Moreover, these
      neurobiological effects of discontinuation appear to have neurobehavioral consequences. There
      is a critical need to better understand the breadth and magnitude of the neurobehavioral
      effects caused by MPH discontinuation as well as to better understand the temporal trajectory
      of these deleterious effects. Hence, the primary goal of the proposed research is to conduct
      the first randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial specifically designed to study
      the negative effects of MPH discontinuation at multiple time points. 180 children diagnosed
      with ADHD will participate across two recruitment sites. After undergoing a 4-week MPH
      titration trial and 4-week MPH maintenance phase, participants will be randomized to either
      discontinue MPH (and receive placebo) OR remain on MPH for 4 weeks. Comprehensive multi-time
      point, multi-informant (parents, teachers, study staff) and multi-modal (behavior/mood/affect
      ratings scales, direct behavior observations, standardized testing) assessments will be used
      to assess a broad range of neurobehavioral outcomes. We will examine the magnitude and time
      course of effects of MPH discontinuation on behavioral as well as cognitive and academic
      functioning in children with ADHD. Furthermore, we will examine moderators of the adverse
      effects of MPH discontinuation on these outcomes to aid in the identification of those who
      are at increased risk.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. ADHD Diagnostic Status: Meets DSM-V criteria for ADHD, with Clinical Global Impression
             (CGI) rating corresponding to at least &quot;moderately ill.&quot;

          2. Cognitive and Academic Functioning: Intelligence Quotient (IQ) of &gt;80 as estimated by
             Vocabulary and Block Design subtests of the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for
             Children-4th Edition and scaled scores &gt;80 on the Wechsler Individual Achievement
             Test-2nd edition Reading and Math subtests

          3. Physical Health: Physical exam and ECG findings are judged to be normal for age and
             sex by study physician and/or medical consultant, and there is no co-existing
             condition for which MPH is contraindicated 4. School: Enrolled in a school setting
             rather than a home-school program. This ensures that we can obtain parent and teacher
             ratings from separate individuals for diagnosis and outcome assessment

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Psychiatric Medications: Current or prior use of any medication for
             psychological/psychiatric problems

          2. Behavioral Interventions: Current active participation in ADHD-related behavioral
             interventions, given that improvements due to these interventions may confound our
             group comparisons

          3. Psychiatric or Neurobehavioral Conditions: Children with mania/hypomania,
             schizophrenia, or severe depressive disorder, as determined by the K-SADS, will be
             excluded since ADHD medications may not be an appropriate first line of treatment for
             children with these comorbid disorders

          4. Organic Brain Injury: History of head trauma, neurological disorder (including
             epilepsy), or other disorder affecting brain function due to potential differences in
             neurophysiology of ADHD phenotype

          5. Cardiovascular Risk Factors: Children with a personal history or family history of
             cardiovascular risk factors will be excluded, or given the option of participating in
             the study after obtaining an EKG and verification from a pediatric cardiologist
             regarding the safety of their participation in a trial of methylphenidate. In this
             case, families will be responsible for the costs of EKG and any necessary cardiologist
             evaluation

          6. Pregnancy: The safety of MPH use during pregnancy has not been established
