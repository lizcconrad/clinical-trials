      Neuromuscular electrical stimulation in pectoral muscles (fibres of the pectoralis major
      muscle bilaterally) and rectus abdominis muscles (bilaterally) preserves / decreases the loss
      of muscle mass.

      Introduction: Neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES) has recently began to be used as an
      early treatment method for Intensive Care Unit (ICU) patients on invasive mechanical
      ventilation (IMV) to compensate for or reduce muscle mass losses and muscular atrophy.

      Objective: To evaluate the effects of early mobilization with neuromuscular electrical
      stimulation in critical care patients on invasive mechanical ventilation.

      Methods: Randomized clinical trial to be conducted in the ICU at the hospital de clínicas of
      Porto Alegre, RS, Brazil, with two groups, one intervention group (conventional physiotherapy
      and NMES) and one placebo group (conventional physiotherapy and placebo NMES). Patients on
      mechanical ventilation who meet the inclusion criteria will be recruited and the intervention
      will be administered using a 4-channel Ibramed® Neurodyn Functional Electrical Stimulation
      (FES) machine, every day for thirty minutes until extubation or death. Outcomes will be
      muscle thickness of pectoral and abdominal muscles and diaphragm excursion measured with
      ultrasound, before intervention, on the seventh day of intervention and soon after
      extubation. Additionally, blood lactate and heart rate variability will be assessed.
      Statistical analysis will be conducted using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences
      (SPSS) 20.0 and the significance level will be p&lt;0.05.

    <description>Neuromuscular electrical stimulation will be applied Functional Electrical Stimulation (FES) machine. The electrodes will be placed over the motor points of the following muscles: pectoral muscles (fibres of the pectoralis major muscle) and rectus abdominis muscles (bilaterally) The first training session will have a duration of 30 minutes , which will then be extended by 1 minute for every 2 days of administration. The intensity will be increased until muscle contraction is visible or palpable or, intensity will be adjusted according to tolerance associated conventional physiotherapy. Neuromuscular electrical stimulation will be applied held until extubation end conventional respiratory and motor physiotherapy until discharge from the ICU.</description>

    <description>Conventional physiotherapy will be administered by professionals from the physiotherapy department twice a day, for 30 minutes. The protocol will include upper and lower extremity functional diagonals from the proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation method (two series of 10 repetitions for each bilateral diagonal), manual bronchial hygiene exercises, such as thoracic vibrocompression, manoeuvres with a manual resuscitator (bag squeezing) and aspiration of secretions where necessary. Associated will receive placebo electrical stimulation, in this case the procedure is the same, but intensity is set to a sensory level, not high enough to provoke either visible or palpable muscle contractions.</description>
