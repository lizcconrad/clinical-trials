  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Damage control laparotomy (DCL) has proven to be a successful means to improve survival in
      severely injured patients.1-5 However, the consequences of not being able to close the fascia
      after the initial operation due to significant resuscitation leading to bowel and
      retroperitoneal edema, abdominal compartment syndrome, and continued acidosis, coagulopathy
      and hypethermia6-7 has led to a new challenge. Delays in primary fascial closure (PFC)
      contributes to increased fluid losses and nutritional demands,8-9 abdominal wall hernias,
      enterocutaneous fistula, and intra-abdominal infections.10-13 Hypertonic saline (HTS) use
      after DCL has been suggested to reduce bowel edema and resuscitation volumes, thus allowing
      for a quicker time to closure.14 Investigators will randomize patients to receiving HTS or
      standard crystalloid solutions after DCL and compare the time to PFC, rate of successful
      closure, and rate of complications associated with an open abdomen. The current failure rate
      of PFC after DCL is approximately 25%. Investigators believe they can improve PFC rates using
      hypertonic saline.

      The use of HTS after DCL may decrease the rate of failure to achieve PFC and reduce the
      number of complications associated with an open abdomen.

      Research Questions:

        1. Primary Objective: Is there a higher rate of PFC among patients who undergo DCL and
           temporary abdominal closure when using HTS versus standard crystalloid resuscitation?

        2. Secondary Objectives: Does successful and faster PFC reduce ICU, ventilator and hospital
           days?

        3. Does faster and more successful PFC result in lower morbidity to include enterocutaneous
           fistula (ECF), intra-abdominal abscess (IAA), abdominal wall hernia, and anastomotic
           failure?

      DCL is a common procedure wounded warriors undergo due to blast and other blunt and
      penetrating mechanisms of injury. This results in a significant population of warriors at
      risk for all of the complications and comorbidities that accompany an open abdomen. Thus,
      finding ways to not only achieve PFC but also to decrease the time to PFC will reduce these
      unwanted events.

      The protocol design is a multi-institutional, prospective, double blind, randomized
      controlled trial of patients who undergo DCL for abdominal trauma requiring temporary
      abdominal closure and return to operating room for definitive treatment. All participating
      facilities are Level I Trauma Centers. Currently, the standard of care for damage control
      resuscitation involves all intravenous fluid solutions utilized in this study; normal saline,
      Ringer's lactate, Plasmalyte, and 3% saline (HTS). However, the type of fluid is selected
      based on surgeon preference alone. Investigators will randomize patients to normal saline at
      a resuscitation rate of 30 cc/hr or to 3% saline (HTS) at a resuscitation rate of 30cc/hr
      which will be initiated upon arrival to the ICU.
