      This is a Phase III, double-blind, randomised study assessing the efficacy and safety of
      AZD9291 (80 mg orally, once daily) versus a standard of care (SoC) Epidermal Growth Factor
      Receptor (EGFR) Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitor (TKI) (either gefitinib [250 mg orally, once daily]
      or erlotinib [150 mg orally, once daily]) in patients with locally advanced or metastatic
      Non-small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) that is known to be EGFR sensitising mutation (EGFRm)
      positive, treatment-naïve and eligible for first-line treatment with an EGFR-TKI.
