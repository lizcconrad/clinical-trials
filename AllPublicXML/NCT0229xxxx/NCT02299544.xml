    <description>Patients with overactive bladder (OAB) with or without urge incontinence.
Two patient populations will be enrolled in the study:
Patients with no previous treatment with percutaneous tibial nerve stimulation (PTNS) [de novo patient group] and Patients with a documented success on PTNS therapy [prior-PTNS group]. Documented success on PTNS is defined by a ≥50% reduction in urinary frequency, and/or ≥50% fewer incontinence episodes, or a return to normal voiding frequency [&lt;8 voids/day], based on retrospective diary review.
All patients will be treated with BlueWind Medical System.</description>
