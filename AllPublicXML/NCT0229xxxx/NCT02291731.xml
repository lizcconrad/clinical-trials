      To evaluate the clinical effect of combination of topical 20% (v/v) autologous serum eye
      drops and a silicone-hydrogel contact lens (CLs) in the treatment of recalcitrant persistent
      epithelial defects (PEDs) and the recurrence rate of epithelial breakdown with or without
      continued use of autologous serum eye drops.

    <textblock>
      Dealing with persistent epithelial defects (PEDs) of the cornea is a challenge for
      ophthalmologists, and surgical intervention is occasionally indicated for the management of
      recalcitrant cases that are unresponsive to medical therapy. Bandage contact lenses (BCLs),
      especially silicone-hydrogel CLs with high oxygen permeability and transmissibility, are
      useful for treating PEDs. Over the past several years, autologous serum eye drops (ASEs) are
      gaining popular and widespread acceptance as adjuvant therapy for various ocular surface
      disorders, including PEDs recalcitrant to standard medical therapies.The combination of BCLs
      and ASEs for PEDs treatment have also been reported with satisfactory results in a few small
      series' of PED patients. In this study, we will conduct a prospective interventional study to
      investigate the therapeutic effects of the combination of topical 20% ASEs and
      silicone-hydrogel CLs for recalcitrant PEDs, as well as to compare the recurrence of
      epithelial breakdown with or without continuous usage of autologous serum eye drops after CL
      removal. Patients with PEDs for more than 4 weeks without improvement despite previous
      conventional treatment were treated. Silicone-hydrogel SCLs combined with 20% (v/v)
      autologous serum eye drops were used until complete re-epithelialization. SCLs were removed
      after total re-epithelialization and patients were subsequently randomized divided into two
      groups: (1) with and (2) without continuous use of topical autologous serum for an additional
      2 weeks. PED healing rate and epithelial defect recurrence during a 3-month follow-up were
      evaluated.
