  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Breast cancer is the most common cancer and the second leading cause of cancer related death
      in American women. Regular screening, early diagnosis, and timely treatment initiation have
      been shown to reduce breast cancer morbidity and mortality. However, disparities continue to
      exist across the breast cancer continuum for underserved women, particularly minority women.
      The reduction of disparities in breast cancer outcomes is a major goal of Healthy People 2020
      and the National Cancer Institute. However, the preventable burden of late stage breast
      cancer will continue until the investigators close the gap between what is known about
      prevention and what is implemented in the community. Although many sources of information
      exist about theory and [theory-] and evidence-based interventions (EBIs) to promote
      mammography screening, their adoption and use in the community has been limited and haphazard
      at best.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In order to effectively reach underserved women and reduce breast cancer disparities, D&amp;I
      efforts should target the healthcare delivery system where these women receive service - the
      so called &quot;safety net&quot;. Within the safety net, federally qualified health centers (FQHCs),
      provide comprehensive primary health care services for underserved communities regardless of
      ability to pay, including mammography screening. Our team has successfully pilot tested a
      National Cancer Institute research tested intervention program (RTIP) with underserved women
      and were able to reduce no-show rates from 44% to 19%. In order to accelerate the adoption
      and implementation of our EBI within the safety net, the investigators will use a two-step
      approach based on the consolidated framework for implementation research (CFIR), and
      intervention mapping. The investigators will actively disseminate the EBI through a unique
      breast health collaborative with a wide membership of FQHCs, support implementation through
      training and evaluate the adoption, implementation, sustainment and effectiveness of the EBI.
      The investigators will use a clinic clustered stepped wedge design for implementation in
      FQHCs.

The call is conducted by a trained patient navigator using an adapted NCI RTIP to increase mammography appointment adherence.</description>

    <description>The Peace of Mind Program (PMP) is a telephone counseling program based on the Transtheoretical Model of Change, with messages matched to readiness (assessed with a stage of change question)and barriers identified by women who are non-adherent to mammography. The program telephone protocol guides counselors to assess a woman's readiness to be screened and counsel her through barriers to increase appointment keeping.</description>
