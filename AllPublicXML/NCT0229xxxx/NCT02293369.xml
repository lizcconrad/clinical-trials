  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) advises minimally invasive
      methods in gynecological surgery to ensure increased benefits to the patient and reduce
      potential hospitalization costs.

      Laparoscopic hysterectomy has become the standard approach in gynecological benign disorders.
      During laparoscopic hysterectomy, vaginal cuff can be closed with different sutures,
      techniques and approaches, which is one of the challenges of this surgery. Data is limited on
      potential impact of different sutures, techniques and approaches for vaginal cuff closure on
      female sexual function in relation to vaginal length.

      Various studies in the literature evaluated different approaches (abdominal, vaginal,
      laparoscopic, robotic-assisted laparoscopic). In addition, for cuff closure, different
      techniques (interrupted, continuous) and sutures (barbed, Vicryl) were compared. Measures
      like operation time, cuff healing, complications, cost effectiveness, etc. were usually
      measured. However, there is no prospective randomized clinical study in the literature that
      compares laparoscopic approach with vaginal route for cuff closure in terms of female sexual
      function in relation to vaginal length.

    <description>For vaginal cuff closure both in laparoscopic approach and vaginal route, we will use the same horizontal method, which can be described as closing the vagina anterior to posterior by leaving a horizontal scar. The repair will start at one end of the vaginal cuff, taking care to incorporate the uterosacral ligament into the initial bite and will continue toward the surgeon until the other uterosacral ligament will be incorporated into the repair, using a continuous 0-Vicryl suture in the vaginal route.</description>

    <description>For vaginal cuff closure both in laparoscopic approach and vaginal route, we will use the same horizontal method, which can be described as closing the vagina anterior to posterior by leaving a horizontal scar. In the laparoscopic approach, needles will be introduced through the umbilical trocar and removed through the peripheral trocars and intracorporeal knots will be utilized.</description>
