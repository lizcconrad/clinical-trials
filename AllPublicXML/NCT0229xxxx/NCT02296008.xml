    <textblock>
      3D high resolution anorectal manometry (3DHRAM) is the most precise tool to assess function
      and 3D topographic picture of pressures along the anal canal.

      Until now, it has been used only in adult population to evaluate defecatory disorders.

      Congenital anorectal disorders are severe conditions and may present wide spectrum of
      symptoms from gastrointestinal tract.

      The usefulness of the 3DHRAM hasn't been evaluated in children after surgery for anorectal
      disorders such as Hirschsprung's disease and anorectal malformations.

      It may help for better understanding of pathophysiology of anorectal area and allow for
      planning improved procedures in these patients.

      Moreover, the investigators study may elucidate the real usefulness of the procedure in
      management of disorders of gastrointestinal tract in pediatric population.
