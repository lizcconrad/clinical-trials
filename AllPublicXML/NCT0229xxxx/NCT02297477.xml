      This is a two-arm, randomized, open label Treatment Study evaluating the therapeutic
      efficacy, safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of a three-day course of
      Atovaquone-Proguanil (AP) or a three-day course of Atovaquone-Proguanil combined with 3 days
      of Artesunate (ASAP) in patients with uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum malaria at selected
      sites in Cambodia. Atovaquone-proguanil, soon to adopted as a first line antimalarial agent
      by the National Malaria Control Program (CNM) in Cambodia in provinces with confirmed
      multidrug resistance, will be given with or without artesunate (AS) as a directly observed,
      standard three-day fixed dose combination treatment to all volunteers enrolled. The efficacy
      and safety of both drug combination as well as evidence for in vivo and in vitro resistance
      to their components will be monitored during the treatment period. All volunteers will
      receive a single dose of 15mg of primaquine as recommended by WHO with the first dose of AP
      or ASAP to block the transmission of malaria to mosquitoes. Resistance to AP and ASAP will be
      assessed by a combination of clinical, pharmacologic, and parasitological parameters
      including genomic signatures of selection during careful weekly follow-up visits for 6 weeks.
      Investigators will also be able to evaluate the effects of primaquine on the sexual stages of
      malaria (gametocytes).
