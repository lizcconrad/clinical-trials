  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aims of this study are to determine whether a group-based parent support program (&quot;Family
      Startup&quot;) can lead to early improved parental sense of competence, family relations, and
      child development. Evaluation is based on a randomized controlled trial, with half of the
      participants receiving Family Startup and the other half receiving treatment as usual.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Some knowledge exists about effectiveness of high-intensity delivery of parenting support to
      subsets of at risk families. To the best of our knowledge, however, little is known about
      effects of universal primary prevention programs.

      The Family Startup Program is a structured format for implementing pre- and postnatal
      parenting support groups that prepare new families for their roles as parents as well as
      focus on enhancing parents' social network. The Family Startup Program gathers couples in
      groups and introduces participants to informal sources of support (e.g. by meeting and
      interacting with other new families) and to a broad range of community resources (e.g.
      financial advisers, child dentist, local solicitors, family counselors) providing them with
      information and parenting skills. The program content includes handling family finance,
      choice of paternity leave, couple communication, breastfeeding, network formation, ensuring
      dental health, sensitivity toward child signals, child rearing discipline, help-seeking
      behavior, home safety, and more.

      A second formulated rational behind the program is that strengthening father involvement,
      social network formation and access to family services will serve to enhance family
      relationships, including parenting, coparenting and couple relationship quality. Through
      participation in Family Startup, families receive a long term connection with a health
      visitor in the community and are introduced to a broad range of community services. This can
      be expected to benefit optimal health service utility and ease access to resources for
      families and children with need. Improved child outcome are the ultimate goal. No scientific
      evaluation of program effects of the Family Startup program on child or family outcome was
      previously conducted.

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

        -Parents, mothers as well as their partners, expecting their first child in the
        municipality of Aarhus are eligible for the study. This is because of the universal nature
        of the original program. Mothers are included if interested regardless of the fathers'
        decline. Biological fathers, registered partners, as well as non-registered partners are
        eligible.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Parents are excluded from the study if they are under the age of 18 years

          -  Not capable of managing own legal affairs

          -  Choose not to accept any routine pregnancy scans. These exclusion criteria are chosen
             to secure that study participants are legally responsible and that we are able to
             recruit them via the Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology in connection with the
             nuchal translucency scan around week 12

          -  The father or partner is not included if the mother declines participation. The mother
             can choose to attend the Family Startup Program with a friend (i.e. a sister, friend
             or neighbor) but friends are not eligible for the study

          -  Finally, individuals are excluded if they are not able to understand the Danish oral
             presentation of the study information and hence cannot give informed consent
