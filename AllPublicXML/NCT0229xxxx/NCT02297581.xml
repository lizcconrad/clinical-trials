    <textblock>
      The study will assess patients with at least one major AE related to treatment /
      hospitalization / immobilization in the Geriatric Fracture Center (GFC) group compared to the
      usual care group.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients aged ≥ 70 years or older with an osteoporotic hip fracture treated with an
      osteosynthesis or endoprosthesis will be included in this study.

      The primary objective of the study is to assess the difference in the numbers of pre-defined
      major adverse events (AE) which are related to the treatment, hospitalization and/or
      immobilization between patients who were treated in a geriatric fracture center or in a usual
      care center.

      As a secondary objective, health economic implications and cost-effectiveness comparison
      analyses will be performed.

      In order to be able to analyze data based on the geographic regions as well as globally, in
      each participating country, both a Geriatric Fracture Center (GFC) and a Usual Care Center
      (UCC) will be included.
