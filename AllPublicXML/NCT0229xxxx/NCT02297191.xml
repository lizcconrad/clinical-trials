  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to determine the effectiveness of a new approach to numbing
      (anesthetizing) nerves in the back and to measure how far the area of anesthesia extends on
      the skin of the back.

      This research aims to define a novel field-infiltration nerve block. We will use ultrasound
      guidance to inject local anesthesia into the potential space between the muscle bodies of the
      erector spinae. The medial branch of the dorsal ramus of each thoracolumbar nerve innervates
      the muscle and skin overlying the erector spinae muscle to the midline. By anesthetizing each
      nerve we believe minimally invasive (1-2 level) back surgery may be completed with less pain
      and preclude the side-effect laden opioid analgesics.

    <time_frame>The day of procedure (up to 15 minutes)</time_frame>
    <description>At time zero (pre injection), 5 minutes, and 15 minutes point-discrimination to pain and temperature will be evaluated by blunt-needle prick and ice (in plastic bag). A &quot;map&quot; of each will be drawn and photographed for analysis.
Photos will only include surface anatomy of the low-to-mid back.
Participants will be assessed for evidence of adverse reaction to local anesthesia (tinnitus, disorientation, or perioral numbness) with each 5cc dose of local anesthetic.</description>

    <description>All participants will have two injections at the same vertebral level on each side of the back. Each injection will consist of four 5cc incremental injections with aspiration prior to each 5cc of injectate of 0.5% Ropivicaine. . Each side of the back will be injected with 20cc of .05% Ropivicaine. Ultrasound will be used in real time to guide the needle, evaluate for &quot;spread&quot; of local anesthesia and to minimize the risk of Ropivicaine being injected intravascularly.
