  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Despite the literature showing cognitive behavioural therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) to be
      effective in a variety of populations including postpartum women, as well as the demonstrated
      harmful consequences of sleep disturbances in late pregnancy, no trials have investigated its
      efficacy during pregnancy. This project will investigate the efficacy and acceptability of
      cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) in pregnancy.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Actigraphy indices from baseline to post-treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Week 1), Post-treatment (Week 7)</time_frame>
    <description>Actigraphy is recommended as a reliable and useful method of objective sleep assessment, providing information about indices of sleep efficiency, sleep latency, total sleep time, and number and frequency of awakenings</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Sleep Diary variables from baseline to post-treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Week 1), Treatment (Weeks 2-6), Post-treatment (Week 7)</time_frame>
    <description>Participants complete a daily, standardized sleep diary on a weekly basis both during the treatment period, and at baseline and final assessment times to corroborate actigraphy data. Dependent variables derived from this data include total sleep time, time in bed, sleep efficiency, and sleep quality</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) scores from baseline to post-treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Week 1), Post-treatment (Week 7)</time_frame>
    <description>The ISI can be used to assess the severity of sleep onset, sleep maintenance and early wakening problems, sleep dissatisfaction, and one's perceived distress caused by sleep problems. Scores on the ISI range from 0 to 28, with scores â‰¥ 15 indicating clinical insomnia.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) scores from baseline to post-treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Week 1), Post-treatment (Week 7)</time_frame>
    <description>The PSQI instrument is used in assessing one's sleep quality in the preceding month. It is comprised of 19 self-rated items and 5 questions rated by the roommate or bed partner. The PSQI possesses seven components: subjective sleep quality, sleep latency, sleep duration, habitual sleep efficiency, sleep disturbances, use of sleeping medications and daytime dysfunction. PSQI scores range from 0 to 21, with scores greater than 5 indicating poor sleep quality.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Edinburgh Postpartum Depression Scale (EPDS) scores from baseline to post-treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Week 1), Post-treatment (Week 7)</time_frame>
    <description>The EPDS serves as a valuable and efficient way of identifying women at risk for prenatal depression, and can be used for screening both anxiety and depressive symptoms</description>
