  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the clinical performance of the ReLeaf infusion
      catheter &amp; wound drain in patients following lumbar spinal fusion surgery. One half of the
      patients will receive continuous local analgesic fusion during the post-operative period
      while the other half will received continuous local saline.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Posterior lumbar spinal fusion is commonly used in the management of a wide array of spinal
      disorders ranging from instability to degenerative disc disease. However, severe
      postoperative pain is a significant adverse outcome in patients who have undergone a lumbar
      spinal fusion procedure. This pain may delay mobilization and decrease compliance with
      physical, occupational, or pulmonary physiotherapy.

      Pain symptoms may worsen with activity and ambulation due to reflex spasms of the paraspinal
      muscles elicited by pain from the wound. A local anesthetic agent administered immediately
      after surgery into the tissue surrounding the wound addresses the pain source for less than
      four hours. Therefore, it is reasonable to consider continuous local anesthetic infusion,
      which may limit local pain mediators for a longer duration.

      Continuous local anesthetic infusion into the paraspinal musculature with the ReLeaf catheter
      has the potential to reduce pain, narcotic demand &amp; usage, and accelerate the rate of
      recovery in lumbar spinal fusion patients.
