  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a pilot randomized controlled trial intervention to improve lifestyle behaviors
      (physical activity and health diet) for Filipino Americans with type 2 diabetes on metformin.
      If the PilAm Go4Health intervention demonstrates potential efficacy, it may identify
      effective intervention strategies to significantly reduce risks for heart disease risks
      (i.e., metabolic syndrome) in Filipino Americans.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Filipino Americans are the second largest Asian population and fastest growing racial group
      in the United States. They have one of the highest rates of insulin resistance (type 2
      diabetes = T2DM) and central obesity (fat distributions primarily in the abdominal region).
      T2DM and central obesity are two of five major risk factors for metabolic syndrome that lead
      to cardiovascular disease and stroke. Key factors contributing to obesity and T2DM in
      Filipinos are their physical inactivity, and a diet high in fat and soda intake. However,
      there are very few research studies on improving health behaviors to reduce risks for
      metabolic syndrome in Filipino Americans. To help reduce the risk of developing metabolic
      syndrome in overweight/obese Filipino Americans with T2DM, the proposed project will test a
      culturally appropriate health behavior intervention program to reduce weight and waist
      circumference, blood glucose levels (evaluating insulin resistance) through increasing
      physical activity, and lowering fat and sugar sweetened beverage intake. This intervention
      uses a mobile phone health app and social networking to encourage adherence to target health
      behaviors. The goals are to:

        1. To assess feasibility and acceptability of the culturally appropriate PilAm Go4Health
           Weight Loss Program

        2. To obtain preliminary estimates of the effect of the intervention on weight, BMI, and
           insulin resistance

        3. To conduct post-program process evaluations too improve the intervention relevancy for
           the target population.

    <description>This is a 3-month lifestyle intervention program promoting weight loss through physical activity and health diet using a mobile health application (app), pedometer to track daily step-counts, and social networking (in-person and virtual social networking through Facebook) to reduce risks for metabolic syndrome in Filipino Americans with type 2 diabetes on metformin. Subjects will be asked: 1) to use a mobile app diary every day to input their weight, and calories (food and drink intake) and 2) wear a pedometer everyday to monitor their physical activity (step-counts).</description>

    <ipd_description>Data generated under this project will be administered in accordance with both University and NIH policies, including the NIH Data Sharing Policy and Implementation Guidance of March 5, 2003. That data set will be made available to qualified investigators within one year after completion of our investigators' data analyses and publication of papers presenting the results of those analyses.
Requests will be reviewed and acted on by the PI.This dataset will be carefully screened to make certain that all identifying information has been removed, including information that could be combined so as to identify an individual.
