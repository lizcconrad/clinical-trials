        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Diagnosis of SLE ncluding a positive antinuclear antibodies (ANA) test at least 6
             months before randomization; any concurrent SLE pharmacologic regimen (including
             leflunomide, methotrexate, and anti-malarials) was stable for at least 30 days before
             randomization; prednisone ≤ 20 mg/day (or equivalent) was permitted; 1 increase or
             decrease of ≤ 5mg/day prednisone equivalent was allowed within 30 days before
             randomization

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects who, in the clinical judgment of the investigator, had severe disease;
             subject who had at least 1 BILAG 'A' score or 2 BILAG 'B' scores in any of the organ
             systems at screening; signs or symptoms of a viral or bacterial infection within 30
             days of study randomization, or recent history of repeated infections, evidence of
             liver disease; concurrent receipt of mycophenolate mofetil or azathioprine; prior
             administration of another biologic that primarily targets the immune system within 1
             year
