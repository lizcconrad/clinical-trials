      Objectives:

      Objectives

      The primary objective of this study is to:

      To assess 4-month disease control rate (DCR) in pre-treated patients with unresectable
      malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM) treated with alisertib

      The secondary objectives of this study are to:

      To assess the response rate (confirmed and unconfirmed complete + partial responses) To
      assess the progression-free survival. To assess overall survival. To evaluate the side
      effects and toxicities associated with this treatment regimen.

      To collect archival tissue, blood, pleural effusion fluid and plasma for correlative studies.

      Exploratory Objectives:

      To collect archival or new tissue, blood and pleural effusion fluid for correlative studies.
      Tissue biomarkers to be evaluated include aurora kinase pathway and c-myc gene amplification.

      Next generation sequencing (NGS) will be conducted on adequate tumor tissue specimens.

      Study Drug Administration:

      If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will take alisertib tablets
      by mouth 2 times each day on Days 1-7 of each 21-day study cycle. You must take your doses of
      alisertib at least 6 hours apart with 1 cup (about 8 ounces) of water.

      If you miss or vomit a dose of alisertib, do not retake that dose. Wait and take the next
      dose as scheduled.

      Study Visits:

      On Day 1 of Cycles 1-3 and then every odd-numbered cycle after that (Cycles 5, 7, 9 and so
      on):

        -  You will have a physical exam.

        -  Blood (about 4 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests.

      Every 6 weeks while you are on study, you will have a PET-CT scan of your chest, abdomen, and
      pelvis to check the status of the disease.

      Length of Study:

      You may continue taking the study drug for as long as the doctor thinks it is in your best
      interest. You will no longer be able to take the study drug if the disease gets worse, if
      intolerable side effects occur, or if you are unable to follow study directions.

      Your participation on this study will be over after you have completed follow-up.

      Follow up:

      Your study doctor or study team will follow you up 30 days after your last dose by reviewing
      your medical chart or calling you to see if the side effects are resolved. After that, you
      will continue to be followed up at 3 months, 6 months and every 6 months beyond that.

      The study doctor can explain how the study drug is designed to work.

      Up to 58 participants will be enrolled in this study. All will take part at MD Anderson.

    <description>Participants re-staged every 2 cycles of therapy. 1 cycle = 21 days or 3 weeks. Imaging studies consist of any of the following studies: PET-CT scans, chest CT scans, abdominal-pelvic CT scans. Modified RECIST (preferred) or RECIST (if modified RECIST cannot be used) measurements performed after every 2 cycles of therapy. The radiologist or the PI will review and determine response based on the RECIST.</description>
