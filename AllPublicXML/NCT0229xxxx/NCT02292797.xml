        Part I:

        Subjects will be screened from the general population by questionnaires mainly focusing on
        detection of signs and symptoms of rosacea.

        Subjects' answers will be submitted to a pre-defined algorithm to identify the potential
        subjects with rosacea (screened positive for rosacea, Screened R+).

        Part II:

        A subgroup of subjects (100 maximum per country) will be randomly selected among those who
        screened positive for rosacea and will be referred to the closest investigational site
        (dermatologist practice).
