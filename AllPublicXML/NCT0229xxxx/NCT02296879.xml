  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Mesenchymal epithelial transition factor (c-MET) is a receptor tyrosine kinase that, when
      engaged by its ligand hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), has been implicated in various cellular
      process including development as well as oncogenesis.

      SAIT301 is a novel humanized monoclonal antibody targeting the alpha chain of extracellular
      domain of c-MET. Binding of SAIT301 to c-MET blocks HGF binding and inhibits HGF-mediated
      signaling. Furthermore, SAIT301 also induces efficient c-MET internalization from the cell
      surface and subsequent degradation, resulting in inhibition of growth of the c-MET addicted
      cancer cells.

      The sponsor decided to enroll subjects with tumors that express c-MET (by
      immunohistochemistry [IHC]) for this study, as the subjects with no c-MET expression are
      unlikely to benefit from SAIT301 treatment.

      Stage 1 of this Phase I study is designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability,
      pharmacokinetic (PK) profile, and anti-tumor activity of SAIT301 administered as a single IV
      infusion in 21 day cycles, for up to 4 cycles. Subjects without evidence of tumor progression
      after 4 cycles will be eligible to continue on SAIT301 treatment if there is no evidence of
      tumor progression for a further 4 cycles (Cycles 5 to 8). Biomarkers related to SAIT301
      and/or tumor response will also be evaluated.Stage 2 will further evaluate the safety and PK
      profile of SAIT301 in select types of cancers. Dosing frequency may be adjusted based on the
      PK profile obtained during Stage 1.

      The primary objectives of the study are as follows:

        -  To evaluate the safety and tolerability of SAIT301.

        -  To determine the MTD of SAIT301 and the dose level of SAIT301 where dose limiting
           toxicity (DLT) is observed in subjects with advanced solid tumors or define recommended
           Phase II dose (RP2D) as an alternative to establishing the MTD.

      Methodology: This first in man study will consist of 2 stages. Stage 1 will be a dose
      escalation study with a 3 + 3 design and will evaluate the safety, tolerability, PK profile,
      biomarkers, and preliminary anti-tumor activity of ascending doses of SAIT301 in subjects
      with c-MET + advanced solid tumors and define the MTD (or recommended Phase II dose [RP2D])
      of SAIT301. If the PK trough levels exceed the minimum acceptable trough level for SAIT301
      (25 μg/mL), the Safety Review Committee (SRC) may elect to terminate further dose escalation
      and declare a recommended Phase II dose (RP2D) and schedule as an alternative to establishing
      the MTD. In Stage 2 the MTD (or RP2D) defined in Stage 1 will be administered to additional
      subjects with selected diagnoses, 15 subjects per selected diagnosis, to further evaluate the
      safety and PK profile, and any evidence of anti tumor activity of SAIT301 in these
      populations. The tumor types to be included in Stage 2 will be defined in a protocol
      amendment at a time close to study execution based on information available at that time.

      The treatment period will consist of 21-day cycles. On Day 1 of each cycle, SAIT301 will be
      administered as an intravenous (IV) infusion.

      For dose level 1, the first subject will receive an IV infusion of SAIT301 on Cycle 1 Day 1
      and will be followed for 21 days (Cycle 1).

      If the first subject at dose level 1 experiences a DLT during Cycle 1, 1 additional subject
      will be enrolled and will receive dose level 1, which is 50% of dose level 1. If this subject
      at dose level -1 does not experience a DLT during Cycle 1, 2 more subjects will be enrolled
      at dose level -1.

      If the first subject at dose level 1 does not experience a DLT during Cycle 1, the second and
      third subjects will receive SAIT301 at dose level 1 and will be followed for 21 days (Cycle
      1). At the discretion of the SRC, if the first 3 subjects at dose level 1 do not experience a
      DLT during Cycle 1, dose level 2 may be administered in the next cohort. If one of these
      subjects experiences a DLT, the cohort will be expanded and evaluated as described below.

      For dose level 2 and each subsequent dose level, 3 subjects will receive SAIT301 on Day 1 of
      Cycle 1 and will be followed for 21 days (Cycle 1). If none of the 3 subjects experience a
      DLT, the next dose level can be administered in the next cohort. If 1 or more of the first 3
      subjects experience a DLT, 3 more subjects will receive the same dose level. Dose escalation
      will continue until at least 2 subjects in a cohort of 3 to 6 subjects experience a DLT
      (i.e., ≥33% of subjects with a DLT at that dose level). Considering the possibility of
      relatively low efficacy, each subjects of dose level 1 and 2 can be administered with higher
      dose level after their first administration. This individual dose escalation can be
      determined by Investigators when safety data of the higher dose level are available.

      For both Stage 1 and 2, subjects will continue to receive the assigned dose level of SAIT301
      until unacceptable toxicity, documented progression of disease, another criterion for
      discontinuation is met, or until 4 cycles have been completed.

      Subjects without evidence of tumor progression after 4 cycles may continue on SAIT301
      treatment if there is no evidence of tumor progression for a further 4 cycles (Cycles 5 to
      8). Subjects without evidence of tumor progression at the completion of Cycle 8 will be
      eligible for a follow-on protocol.

      Subjects who experience a DLT will be discontinued from further treatment. At the completion
      of the dose escalation stage, the SRC may for Stage 2 alter the dosing interval between
      cycles based on emerging PK data from lower SAIT301 dose levels.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Aged 18 years or older.

          2. Have a histologically or cytologically confirmed advanced solid tumor that has
             recurred or progressed following standard therapy, or that has not responded to
             standard therapy, or for which there is no standard therapy, or the subject is not a
             candidate for standard therapy.

          3. Tumor positive for c-MET expression as determined by IHC. Results should be available
             before the subject can proceed in the study.

          4. Adequate tumor biopsy material should be available for IHC and fluorescence in situ
             hybridization (FISH) of c-MET and biomarker analysis at the time of enrollment
             (formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tumor block or 20 fresh cut unstained slides).

          5. At least 28 days must have elapsed since the subject's prior systemic therapy,
             radiotherapy, or any major surgery (excluding diagnostic biopsy or venous access
             device placement). Surgery requiring local/epidural anesthesia must be completed at
             least 72 hours before the first administration of SAIT301. For concomitant medications
             with a known half-life of less than 36 hours (e.g., tyrosine kinase inhibitors), the
             duration of time since prior therapy can be reduced to 14 days provided any
             drug-related toxicities have resolved to Grade 1 or better. Hormonal therapy for
             prostate or breast cancer are allowed during the study.

          6. For dose levels 1 to 3, subjects must, at a minimum, have evaluable disease according
             to RECIST 1.1 guidelines. For dose levels above level 3, subjects must have

             within 7 days of the first administration of SAIT301. For the purpose of this study,
             female subjects of childbearing potential are defined as all female subjects after
             puberty unless they are postmenopausal for at least 1 year, or are surgically sterile
             (hysterectomy or bilateral oophorectomy or tubal ligation).

         12. Willing and able to provide written informed consent and to comply with the protocol,
             visit schedule, and requirements.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Subjects will not be entered in the study for any of the following reasons:
