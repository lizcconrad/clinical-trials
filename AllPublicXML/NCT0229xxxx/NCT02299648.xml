      This protocol is a screening protocol only. No drug intervention study will be included in
      this protocol. However, based on the molecular profiling, patients may be eligible for
      targeted agents. However, the molecular profiling doesn't guarantee the enrollment onto the
      clinical trial. Currently, the available drugs are AKT inhibitor, MEK inhibitor, Wee1
      inhibitor, MET inhibitor. ATR inhibitor and other agents may be available in the context of
      clinical trials depending on the availability.

      To screen metastatic GC patients who failed or progressed on first-line chemotherapy.
      Patients will undergo biopsy of their tumor and will be analyzed using cancer
      panel/nanostring CNV and immunohistochemistry. This protocol is a screening protocol and
      informed consent form will be obtained again according to the biomarker profiled on this
      protocol if eligible. Informed consent will be obtained from patients with gastric
      adenocarcinoma and analysis of fresh tissue or archival FFPE at Samsung Medical Center will
      be performed. Patients who have prior to or completed or during the first-line chemotherapy
      (fluoropyramidine/platinum-based) will be eligible for screening.

      After the analysis, pathologic and molecular biologic verification process about validity of
      the result will proceed. The biopsies will be performed before or after or during first-line
      treatment for molecular analysis. The patients who are screened through this protocol will
      undergo baseline biopsy before or after or during first-line therapy.
