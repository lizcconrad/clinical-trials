  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Extracorporeal shockwave lithotripsy (ESWL) for urinary stone is common and widespread
      nowadays. Approximately 80% of urinary stones are treated by ESWL. Traditionally distal
      ureteric stones are treated with ESWL in the prone position. However, as some patients cannot
      tolerate lying in the prone due to medical illness such as chronic obstructive pulmonary
      disease (COPD), some authors have reported using the supine approach of ESWL for treatment of
      distal ureter stones. No serious complications had developed in the patients who underwent
      supine approach. Only minor complications such as self-limiting blood in the urine, painful
      passage of urine, or local pain that had responded to oral painkillers. There were no serious
      complications encountered in children as well. In the most recent retrospective review by
      Tolley et al, they had revealed that patients who had underwent supine ESWL for distal
      ureteric stones had an improved stone-free rate compared with the traditional prone approach.

      Patient with radio-opaque distal ureteric stones (stones below the sacroiliac joint) on KUB
      X-ray, who have opted for ESWL treatment, are randomized into two groups: one undergoing ESWL
      in the supine position and the other undergoing ESWL in the prone position. Patients will be
      observed for two hours after ESWL before being discharged. Oral painkillers as necessary will
      be provided to the patient. The patients will have a KUB Xray at 2 weeks post-ESWL, and then
      monthly afterwards if required. If there are residual stones at the 2-week follow-up, the
      patient will be offered ESWL again. Patients are free to withdraw from the study at any time
      and will continue to be managed as per usual.

      The investigators aim to have 130 patients, with 65 patients in each group with an interim
      analyses to be performed when 66 patients have been recruited (33 patients in each group).

      Previous authors have reported using the greater and lesser sciatic foramina as a pathway for
      the shockwaves to reach the distal ureter. No serious complications had developed in the
      patients who underwent transgluteal approach. Only minor complications such as self-limiting
      hematuria, dysuria, or pain that had responded to oral analgesics. There were no serious
      complications encountered in children as well. In the most recent retrospective review by
      Tolley et al, they had revealed that patients who had underwent transgluteal ESWL for distal
      ureteric stones had an improved stone-free rate of 78% in the transgluteal group versus 40%
      in the prone group after one session of shockwave lithotripsy and a stone-free rate of 92%
      versus 63% respectively after two sessions of shockwave lithotripsy. This has been speculated
      to be due to the presence of bowel gas attenuating the shockwaves as well as a long
      skin-to-stone distance in the prone position.
