      Part A: (ADXS11-001 + MEDI4736 Combination Therapy) will determine the safety and
      tolerability of the combination and to identify a RP2D.

      Part B:

      Phase 2 design which will randomize subjects 1:1 to either MEDI4736 alone or
      MEDI4736+ADXS11-001 in subjects who have failed at least 1 prior systemic treatment for their
      recurrent/persistent or metastatic cervical cancer.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Have histological diagnosis of squamous cell cancer of the head &amp; neck with
             confirmation of HPV positivity or squamous, non-squamous, adenosquamous, carcinoma or
             adenocarcinoma of the cervix which HPV positivity is not required

          2. Have measurable and/or evaluable disease by RECIST 1.1

          3. Have ECOG performance status of 0 or 1

          4. Have adequate organ function defined by the protocol.:

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Has any prior Grade â‰¥3 immune-related adverse event (irAE) while receiving
             immunotherapy, including anti-CTLA-4 treatment, or any unresolved irAE &gt;Grade 1.

          2. Has a diagnosis of immunodeficiency or is receiving any systemic steroid therapy or
             any other form of immunosuppressive therapy within 7 days prior to Day 1 of trial
             treatment.

          3. Has any concurrent chemotherapy, immunotherapy, biologic or hormonal therapy for
             invasive malignancy within 2 years. Concurrent use of hormones for non-cancer-related
             conditions (eg, insulin for diabetes and hormone replacement therapy) is acceptable.

          4. Has an active autoimmune disease requiring systemic treatment within the past 3 months
             or a documented history of clinically severe autoimmune disease, or a syndrome that
             requires systemic steroids or immunosuppressive agents.

          5. Has implanted medical device(s) that pose a high risk for colonization and/or cannot
             be easily removed (e.g., prosthetic joints, artificial heart valves, pacemakers,
             orthopedic screw(s), metal plate(s), bone graft(s), or other exogenous implant(s)).
             NOTE: More common devices and prosthetics which include arterial and venous stents,
             dental and breast implants, and venous access devices (e.g., Port-a-Cath or Mediport)
             are permitted. Sponsor must be contacted prior to consenting any subject who has any
             other device and/or implant
