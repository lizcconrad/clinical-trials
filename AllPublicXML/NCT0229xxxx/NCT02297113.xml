    <textblock>
      All patients undergoing emergent endotracheal intubation (RSI) at the Emergency Department
      will be screened for inclusion in this clinical study. The indication of endotracheal
      intubation is an exclusively clinical decision and is not affected by this study protocol in
      any aspect.

      If fulfilling the In- and exclusion criteria's, patient will be randomly assigned to one of
      two groups

        1. C-MAC Videolaryngoscope in appropriate size

        2. conventional endotracheal intubation using Macintosh Blade in appropriate size

      Randomization (1:1) will be based on computer-generated codes maintained in sequentially
      numbered opaque envelopes that will be opened immediately before randomization.
