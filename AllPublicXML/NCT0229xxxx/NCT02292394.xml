  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Caring for dependent persons can give rise to depression in non-professional caregivers,
      placing a burden on health care services and threatening the quality of the care dispensed to
      the dependent. Unfortunately, the ability of these patients to attend therapy sessions is
      often limited precisely by their role as caregivers. Preventive measures that are accessible
      to caregivers are thus called for. The primary aim of this project is to evaluate the
      efficacy of telephonic administration of a brief indicated preventive psychological
      intervention for depression that in previous work proved effective when administered in
      person in group sessions. With a view to optimizing resource usage by maximizing
      interventional efficacy, the secondary aim is to determine the contribution to overall
      efficacy of that part of the intervention that consists in increasing pleasant activities. To
      these ends, some 180 informed, consenting caregivers satisfying appropriate criteria for
      inclusion in the study will be randomized to one of three interventions (≈ 60 participants
      per intervention): the full cognitive-behavioural programme; a program focused only on the
      component of pleasant activities; or a usual care condition. Both programmes will be
      administered in five 90 minute sessions by audio tele-conference. All sessions will be
      recorded for verification of adherence to the intervention protocols. Participants will be
      re-evaluated at the end of their intervention (when participant satisfaction with the
      cognitive-behavioural programmes will also be assessed) and also 1, 3, 6 and 12 months later;
      all evaluations will be performed by trained interviewers who will be blind to the aims of
      the study, the interventions employed, and the group to which any given participant belongs.
      Analyses of these evaluations will compare the short- and long-term efficacies of the three
      groups. Factors that mediate participant improvement or predict results will also be
      investigated, and the cost-effectiveness of the interventions will be estimated.The central
      hypothesis of the proposed study is that a multicomponent cognitive-behavioral telephone
      intervention and a protocol assessing participation in pleasant activities will both
      significantly reduce the incidence of depression and depressive symptoms compared to a
      control group with usual care immediately after treatment and at 1-, 3-, 6-, and 12-month
      follow-up visits.

    <time_frame>Pre- and post-intervention (6 weeks) with follow-ups at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The presence of a major depressive episode will be assessed with the Structured Clinical Interview for Axis I Disorders from the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM)-IV Clinical Version (Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV, Clinician Version [SCID-CV]; First, Spitzer, Gibbon and Williams, 1997/1999). This is a semi-structured interview that provides a DSM-IV diagnosis and must be administered by a clinician. It consists of six modules of diagnostic interviews: mood episodes, psychotic symptoms, psychotic disorders, mood disorders, substance use disorders, anxiety disorders, and other disorders. The SCID-CV has good test-retest reliability and adequate reliability for psychiatric patients (kappa index = 0.61)</description>

    <description>Depressive symptoms as measured by the Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale [CES-D] (Radloff, 1977; Spanish version of Vazquez, White, and Lopez, 2007). This 20-item scale is self-administered and assesses depressive symptoms. The person evaluates each item based on how often they have experienced it in the last week using a Likert scale with four response options ranging from 0 (rarely or none of the time) to 3 (most of the time). The total score ranges from 0 to 60, and higher scores correspond to greater depressive symptomatology. Internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha) of the scale ranges from .85 and .90, with .89 for the Spanish version (Vazquez et al., 2007 and 2014).</description>

    <description>Socio-demographic characteristics were collected via the Care Characteristics and Status of Caregiver questionnaire that was developed in a previous study (Vazquez et al., 2014). The data of caregivers (sex, age, marital status, number of children, social class, family monthly income per household, level of education, main occupation, province and area of residence), the care situation, health of the caregiver, and contact information (landline home phone)</description>

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline Automatic negative thoughts to post-treatment (6 weeks)</measure>
    <time_frame>Pre- and post-intervention (6 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>The occurrence of automatic negative thoughts will be assessed through the 30-item Automatic Negative Thoughts Questionnaire (ATQ-N, Hollon and Kendall, 1980). The subject must indicate the frequency for which a number of thoughts have suddenly arisen in their mind over the last week on a five-point scale from 1 (never) to 5 (always). Scores range between 30 and 150, and there is a direct relationship between the score and the frequencies of certain types of thoughts, with a higher score indicating more negative thoughts experienced by the subject. The internal consistency for the ATQ-N subscale is .96.</description>

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline Behavioral activation to post-treatment (6 weeks)</measure>
    <time_frame>Pre- and post-intervention (6 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>To assess behavioral activation, we will use the Environmental Reward Observation Scale (EROS, Armento and Hopko, 2007; Spanish version Barraca and Pérez-Álvarez, 2010). It is a self-administered 10-item scale that assesses the degree of positive reinforcement contingent on the response received from the media. Each item is evaluated based on the degree to which the individual believes applies to them, according to a Likert scale with four response options ranging from 1 (strongly disagree) to 4 (strongly agree), with higher scores indicating a greater degree of positive reinforcement. The total score ranges from 10 to 40. The Spanish version of EROS is reliable (Cronbach's alpha = .86) and valid (high correlations with the BDI-II, BADS, STAI-S/R, AAQ, significant differences between participants and non-clinical subjects).</description>

    <measure>Change from baseline Social contacts to post-treatment (6 weeks)</measure>
    <time_frame>Pre- and post-intervention (6 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>To evaluate the participants' weekly social contacts we will use the Register of Social Networking (developed and used in the previous study by Vazquez et al., 2014) that asks the participants to report the number of people they had daily contact with.</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline Self-efficacy to post-treatment (6 weeks)</measure>
    <time_frame>Pre- and post-intervention (6 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>Self-efficacy will be evaluated with the 10-item version of the General Self-Efficacy Scale (GSES, Jerusalem and Schwarzer, 1992; Spanish version Baessler and Schwarzer, 1996). This self-administered 10-item scale was designed to assess the feeling of personal competence to deal with difficult life situations. Each item is evaluated based on the degree to which the subject believes that the statement about their ability to solve problems is true on a Likert 4-point scale ranging from 1 (false) to 4 (true). Higher scores indicate a greater expectation of self-efficacy. Internal consistency for the Spanish version, estimated by Cronbach's alpha was .81.</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Dropout and treatment adherence</measure>
    <time_frame>During the intervention sessions (5 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>We will construct a registry of dropouts from each group to assess their response to the interventions over the duration of the study. In addition, treatment adherence will be assessed by recording the number of meetings each caregiver attends and whether they complete homework assignments.</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Satisfaction with the service received</measure>
    <time_frame>Post-intervention (6 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>Participant satisfaction with the service received will be evaluated upon intervention completion. We will use the Client Satisfaction Questionnaire ([CSQ-8]; Larsen, Attkisson, Hargreaves, and Nguyen, 1979; Spanish version Vazquez, Torres, and Otero, 2009). It is an 8-item scale with 4 possible answers and a final ranking score ranging from 8 to 32, where a higher score implies greater satisfaction with the service received. It is a widely used tool with an internal consistency between .83 and .93 (Attkisson and Greenfield, 2004).</description>

    <description>In this study, we will apply a telephone intervention that is a modified version of a brief prevention intervention for depressed caregivers that previously was applied in person in a group format during five 90-minute sessions (Vazquez et al., 2014). During the intervention, participants will be trained in various behavioral and cognitive abilities such as increasing pleasant activities, self-reinforcement, relaxation techniques, assertive communication, strategies to increase social contacts and social skills, and strategies to increase positive thoughts and decrease depressive ones.</description>
