  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims at evaluating efficacy and safety of berberine-containing quadruple
      therapy(berberine, esomeprazole, clarithromycin and amoxicillin) versus bismuth-containing
      quadruple therapy (bismuth,esomeprazole,clarithromycin and amoxicillin) in H. pylori
      eradication. It is hypothesized that berberine-containing quadruple therapy is non-inferior
      to bismuth-containing quadruple therapy. Patients with confirmed H. pylori positive status
      will be randomized to one of the treatments described above. At week 2 and 6 follow-up
      visits, a urea breath test(UBT) will be performed to confirm eradication.

  <detailed_description>

      The study will include three phases: screening, treatment and follow-up. Screening: this
      phase will last a maximum of 28 days and subjects eligibility will be evaluated after
      informed consent signature. Endoscopy and Urea Breath test will be performed in addition to
      the baseline routine evaluations.

      Treatment: Subjects are randomly assigned to treatment and will be treated for 14 days. A
      randomization visit will take place on Day 0 and an end-of-treatment visit will take place
      between day 12 and 14.

      Follow-up: includes two visits. approximately 14 days of treatment and 28 days after the end
      of treatment. Eradication of H. Pylori will be confirmed through urea breath test(UBT).

    <description>The primary end point of this study is H.pylori eradication,established by negative [13C] urea breath test 28 days after the end of eradication.</description>

    <measure>symptoms effective rates</measure>
    <time_frame>14 days of treatment, and 28 days after treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Evaluation effective rate of symptoms 2 weeks of treatment and 4 weeks after the end of treatment.
Symptom effective rate =（total score before treatment - total score after treatment）/total score before treatment x 100%. Total score = frequency + severity.
Frequency score is calculated by all the frequency of heartburn,reflux,abdominal pain,and flatulence. Severity is accumulated by the degree of symptoms described above,which is divided to 4 degree as 0 presenting none,and 3 presenting most severe.</description>
