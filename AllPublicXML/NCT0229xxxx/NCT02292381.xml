  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Glaucoma is one of the leading causes for blindness in industrialized countries. It is
      characterized by a progressive loss of retinal ganglion cells, morphological changes in the
      optic nerve head and a characteristic loss of visual field. Although increased intraocular
      pressure has been identified as the major risk factor for the development and the progression
      of the disease it has been speculated for a long time that impaired ocular blood flow may
      contribute to the pathogenesis of the disease. This concept has been supported by several
      epidemiological studies showing that low ocular perfusion pressure and small retinal vessel
      caliber are associated with the disease.

      The proposed study tests the hypothesis that patients with glaucoma have reduced total
      retinal blood flow as compared to healthy subjects. Additionally, autoregulation of blood
      flow will be investigated during an increase in ocular perfusion pressure. This is of
      importance because it may clarify the degree of vascular involvement in glaucoma.
