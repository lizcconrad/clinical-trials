      Mediterranean diet is relatively poor in calcium (about 700 mg/daily) whilst there are
      several reports indicating beneficial effects of calcium-rich diets. Aim of the preset study
      is to evaluate the effects of a low-sodium, low-lipid diet enriched in calcium, mainly from
      vegetables instead of dairy products, on blood pressure, body weight a main parameters of the
      glucose and lipid metabolisms.

      This study is a randomized, parallel group trial that will be performed in the Outpatient
      Clinic. At least 150 patients with arterial hypertension and/or increased body weight (IMC&gt;
      28 kg/m2) will enter the study program. After a 3 month low-lipid low-salt diet that will be
      prescribed to all patients, they will be divided in two groups. The first will change the
      diet to that similar for total calories, percent composition of macronutrients and salt but
      enriched in calcium (about 1200 mg/daily) whilst the alternative group will continue the
      first diet. The observation period will be of 1 year with anthropometric (body weight and
      height, waist circumference), hemodynamic (blood pressure and heart rate) and metabolic
      (cholesterol, triglycerides, fasting blood glucose, uric acid, calcium, phosphorus, sodium
      and potassium) controls after 3-6 and 12 months.

      The DASH Study showed that the antihypertensive effects of a low-salt, low-lipid diet were
      significantly potentiated when the diet was enriched in calcium. This target may be reached
      either increasing the daily consumption of low-lipid milk and dairy products or increasing
      the daily consumption of calcium-rich vegetables.

      In the Italian population the mean daily consumption of calcium is rather low, not exceeding
      700 mg/daily whilst it would be desirable a daily consumption of 1200 mg/daily. Unfortunately
      there are in Italy very few dairy products (particularly low-lipid cheese) that would ensure
      a variable and palatable calcium-rich diet.

      Aims of the present study are:

        1. to prepare a low-sodium (about 3 g/daily) diet enrich in calcium (about 1200 mg/daily)
           and to compare the effects on blood pressure with those of a low-sodium diet similar to
           it in macronutrients but with a calcium content typical of the Mediterranean diet (no
           more than 700 mg/daily) (see Table 1);

        2. to verify if this diet is able to improve the control of body weight and of the main
           parameters of the glucose and lipid metabolisms;

        3. to evaluate if this diet is palatable enough to be prescribed in a long term study.

      Patients:

      At least 150 patients with arterial hypertension and/or overweight /obesity (IMC &gt; 28 kg/m2)
      will be enrolled.

      Methods:

        1. evaluation of nutritional habits by an adequate frequency questionnaire at baseline,
           after a 3-month low-lipid low-sodium diet;

        2. anthropometric measures (body weight, height, waist circumference);

        3. measurements of blood pressure and heart rate;

        4. measurements of serum total and HDL cholesterol serum triglycerides, fasting blood
           glucose, serum sodium potassium calcium and phosphorus.

      Design of the study:

      This is a randomized parallel-group study performed in the Outpatient Clinic. Patients
      enrolled in the study will be prescribed a low-sodium low-lipid diet for 3 months. At the end
      of the first phase they will be randomly divided in two groups:

        1. Group A: patients will change their diet in a diet similar for total daily calories,
           sodium and macronutrients but enriched in calcium (1200 mg/daily) and will be followed
           up to 1 year with an intermediate control after the first 3 months;

        2. Group B: patients will continue the low-lipid, low-sodium diet up to 1 year with an
           intermediate control after the first 3 months.

      At baseline, after 3, 6 and 12 months of observation, patients will repeat the measurements
      1-4 described in the Methods.
