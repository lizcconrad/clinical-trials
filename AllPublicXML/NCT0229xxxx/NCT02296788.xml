  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In the present study, we seek to elucidate the effects of aerobic exercise on fecal
      microbiota following the aforementioned no exercise control group and two doses of aerobic
      exercise training (the exercise training spans ~24 wks) in a cross-sectional sample.

      We will collect ancillary data for the ongoing Examination of Mechanisms of exercise-induced
      weight compensation (E-Mechanic; RCT; Martin CK and Church TS Co-PI's; R01 HL 102166) to
      investigate the independent aim and hypothesis of this pilot and feasibility (P &amp; F) grant
      examining if there are differences in colonic microbial populations from a fecal sample
      following supervised and controlled aerobic exercise.

      The proposed study seeks to better understand the role of colonic microbial populations as a
      mechanism of change in body weight during aerobic exercise. E-Mechanic is examining the
      effects of 2 tightly controlled and supervised doses of aerobic exercise, and a no-exercise
      control group, on energy balance and body weight over 24 wks in overweight and obese persons.
      The two aerobic exercise doses were: 1) 8 kcal/kg of body weight/week (KKW) (~900 kcal/wk)
      and 2) 20 KKW (~2250 kcal/wk) compared to a no exercise control group. The low dose of
      exercise (8 KKW) represents the American College of Sports Medicine (ACSM) recommendation for
      overall health and the higher dose (20 KKW) the recommendation for weight loss and weight
      loss maintenance.

      Aim 1 To investigate if colonic bacterial populations differ between the exercise groups and
      the healthy living control group following aerobic exercise.

      It is hypothesized that participants in the exercise group will have different bacterial
      populations than those in the healthy living control group.

    <description>The exercise expenditure goals were calculated by multiplying the participants' body weight by the exercise dose (8 or 20 KKW) divided by the number of sessions (3-5 sessions/wk). The speed and grade were monitored and documented to keep participant heart rate at 65-85% of tested VO2 peak and entered into ACSM equations for energy expenditure.</description>
