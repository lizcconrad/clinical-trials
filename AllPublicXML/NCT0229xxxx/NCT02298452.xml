  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The reason for this study is to evaluate a new hearing aid product generation replacing the
      one on the market. The goal is to evaluate the audiological performance, usability as well as
      features and functions.

      This is a controlled, single blinded comparative study which is conducted monocentric at
      Phonak Headquarters in Staefa. The focus is to compare a new hearing aid product generation
      with the one on the market as well as with competitor devices regarding the audiological
      performance, usability as well as features and functions with the aid of 382 mild to profound
      hearing impaired subjects (18-90 yrs). The subjects, all of them native (Swiss) German
      speakers, individually conduct a number of laboratory standard tests and home trials
      (questionnaires) during nine weeks including weekly appointments of 2 hours.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Difference of speech intelligibility between devices based on Quest platform and Venture platform for different hearing aid styles</measure>
    <time_frame>3 years</time_frame>
    <description>For the objective measurements in laboratory situation, both a standard German speech sentence test in noise (SRT in dB) and a standard German monosyllable word test in quiet (speech discrimination in percent) are used to compare the speech intelligibility for both platforms. The results of the Venture platform of both tests should be at least the same or better than with the Quest platform.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Subjective ratings of speech intelligibility during home trials</measure>
    <time_frame>3 years</time_frame>
    <description>For the subjective rating of speech intelligibility, questionnaires are used to compare the current platform Quest with the new platform Venture. The subjective impressions are rated by rating scales (e.g. Speech intelligibility in quiet: everything - most - half - little - nothing).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Subjective ratings of sound quality during home trials</measure>
    <time_frame>3 years</time_frame>
    <description>For the subjective rating of sound quality, questionnaires are used to compare the current platform Quest with the new platform Venture. The subjective impressions are rated by rating scales (e.g. Sound quality for speech in quiet: good - dull - sharp - thin - echo - scratchy - unclear - noisy).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Subjective ratings of usability during home trials</measure>
    <time_frame>3 years</time_frame>
    <description>For the subjective rating of usability, questionnaires are used to compare the current platform Quest with the new platform Venture . The subjective impressions are rated by rating scales (e.g. Rating of the opening and closing of the battery door: very easy - easy - neither - difficult - very difficult).</description>
