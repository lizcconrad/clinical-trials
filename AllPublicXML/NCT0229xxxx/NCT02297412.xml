    <textblock>
      This randomized pilot trial studies how well minocycline hydrochloride works in reducing
      chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy and acute pain in patients with breast cancer
      undergoing treatment with paclitaxel. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as paclitaxel, may
      cause damage to nerves that result in aches, pains, and tingling or numbness of fingers and
      toes. Minocycline hydrochloride may help lessen nerve damage from paclitaxel and improve the
      quality of life in breast cancer patients.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To estimate whether minocycline hydrochloride (minocycline) can alleviate
      paclitaxel-induced peripheral neuropathy.

      II. To estimate whether minocycline can alleviate paclitaxel acute pain syndrome (P-APS).

      III. To examine the possible relative toxicities related to minocycline therapy in this study
      situation.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.

      ARM I: Patients receive minocycline hydrochloride orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 1-7.
      Treatment repeats every 7 days for up to 12 courses in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      ARM II: Patients receive a placebo PO BID on days 1-7. Treatment repeats every 7 days for up
      to 12 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of the study, patients are followed up every month for 6 months.
