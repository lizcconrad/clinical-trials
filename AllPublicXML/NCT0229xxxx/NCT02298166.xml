  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main trial is a double-blinded, placebo-controlled, randomized, phase III, multi-center
      trial in adult patients with relapsed or refractory AML harboring an activating FLT3 mutation
      as defined in the inclusion /exclusion criteria.

      An initial open label dose-finding run-in phase I of the study will be performed
      administering the study drug crenolanib with salvage chemotherapy consisting of mitoxantrone
      and cytarabine (MC) in 18 patients according to the experimental arm of the study. After
      completion of this dose-finding run-in phase I, toxicity and response data will be provided
      to the external Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) and the Trial Committee by the
      Coordinating Investigator. The Trial Committee will decide on the basis of these data and the
      recommendation of the DSMB on dose modification and the further conduct of the study with
      regard to the double-blinded, placebo-controlled, randomized phase of the study.

      The double-blinded, placebo-controlled randomized portion will start after the completion of
      the dose-finding run-in phase I and positive opinion of the Trial Committee.

      Crenolanib starts on day 7 of MC and is given continuously until 48 hours prior to the next
      chemotherapy; if receiving allogeneic HCT, crenolanib is held 48 hours prior to conditioning
      and restarts no sooner than 30 days and not later than day 100 after transplant.

      Sample size randomized phase: 276 patients

      Primary objective: To evaluate the impact of crenolanib given in combination with salvage
      chemotherapy and consolidation including allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation and
      ongoing single agent maintenance therapy with crenolanib on event-free (EFS) and overall
      survival (OS) in adult patients with relapsed or refractory AML harboring FLT3 activating
      mutations.

    <intervention_name>Allogeneic stem cell transplantation</intervention_name>
    <description>In patients achieving a CR or CRi after salvage-reinduction chemotherapy allogeneic HCT from a matched related or unrelated donor is the preferred form of consolidation. Preferred source of allogeneic HSC are mobilized peripheral blood stem cells. Other forms of allogeneic transplantation (haploidentical donor; cord blood) are allowed.
Allogeneic HCT should be conducted at the earliest time point after the start of the last chemotherapy but no later than after 56 days. A delay of transplant beyond this time window need to be discussed with the Coordinating Investigator. Patients can receive allogeneic HCT directly after salvage re-induction chemotherapy with MC, but also later on following consolidation with IDAC.</description>
