  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Forty six patients with knee osteoarthritis will be randomly allocated into two groups:
      water-based exercises and land-based exercises. Both of them will receive a strengthening
      exercise protocol for lower limb muscles. A blind investigator will assess the patients
      before and immediately after, 3 months and 6 months following the interventions. The main
      outcomes will be pain, function and strength.
