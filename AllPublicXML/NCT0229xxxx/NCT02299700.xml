  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the usability of the Janssen Autism Knowledge Engine
      (JAKE) as a system to monitor clinical outcomes in autism spectrum disorder (ASD) (severe
      abnormalities in the development of many basic psychological functions that are not normal
      for any stage in development. These abnormalities are manifested in sustained social
      impairment, speech abnormalities, and peculiar motor movements).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an observational (study in which participants identified as belonging to study groups
      are assessed for biomedical or health outcomes) and prospective (study following participants
      forward in time) study to determine JAKE in children and adults with ASD. The study will be
      conducted in 2 stages and each stage consists of 2 parts: Screening Phase (14 days), data
      collection Phase (Stage 1: 1 week and Stage 2: 4 weeks) and, stage 2 has follow-up Phase (up
      to 4 weeks post-data collection). The maximum study duration for each participant will not
      exceed 1 week for stage 1 and 8 weeks for stage 2. Primarily, the usability of JAKE as a
      system to monitor clinical outcomes in ASD will be assessed. Participants' safety will be
      monitored throughout the study.

    <measure>Stage 1: Usability of the Janssen Autism Knowledge Engine (JAKE) in Measuring Clinical Symptoms of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD)</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 1</time_frame>
    <description>The JAKE personal healthcare record (pHR) encompasses various modules for use by clinicians, caregivers, participants and the sponsor. The JAKE is accessible both through a web interface for computers and applications for mobile devices. The modules are medical/developmental history, symptom tracker, journal/ASD events, treatment tracker, dashboard, healthvault, research data warehouse and workbench. Results of several parent and clinician questionnaires will be compared with the findings of the mentis symptom tracker and biosensors. An exit survey will assess overall usability of the system.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 1 in Stage 1, and Baseline and Week 4 in Stage 2</time_frame>
    <description>The JAKE Symptom Tracker is a series of 97 questions related to the core and associated symptoms of ASD. Questions are answered on two 4-point scales, either frequency and intensity, frequency and context, or quality and context.</description>

    <description>An adverse event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence in a participant who received study drug without regard to possibility of causal relationship. A serious adverse event (SAE) is an AE resulting in any of the following outcomes or deemed significant for any other reason: death; initial or prolonged inpatient hospitalization; life-threatening experience (immediate risk of dying); persistent or significant disability/incapacity; congenital anomaly.</description>
