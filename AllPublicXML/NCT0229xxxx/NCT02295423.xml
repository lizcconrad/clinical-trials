  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators hope to survey anesthesiologists who have participated in a non-CME
      regional anesthesia workshop at VAPAHCS over the past 4 years on the number and types of
      nerve block procedures that they performed, nerve localization method (e.g., ultrasound,
      electrical stimulation, or both), and whether the nerve blocks performed were
      single-injection or catheter-based.

      The investigators expect to recruit approximately 100 participants through the use of an
      IRB-approved survey and cover letter which will be distributed to anesthesiologists who have
      participated in a non-CME regional anesthesia workshop at VAPAHCS over the past 4 years.
      Prospective subjects will provide consent to participate by completing the requested survey.
      Subjects will not receive monetary remuneration for their participation. Selection for
      inclusion will not be based on gender, race, or socioeconomic status. There will be no
      recruitment of participants from vulnerable populations. Participants will receive a link to
      an online survey and if they prefer an alternate method, the investigators will send the
      participant the survey in Word document format or survey by telephone. The survey will ask
      for the number and types of nerve block procedures that the participant performed, nerve
      localization method (e.g., ultrasound, electrical stimulation, or both), and whether the
      nerve blocks performed were single-injection or catheter-based.

        We intend to enroll approximately 100 subjects (one site only) based on the estimated
        number of practicing anesthesiologists who have participated in a regional anesthesia
        workshop at VAPAHCS within the last 4 years. Subjects who are practicing anesthesiologists
        out of residency and will likely be 40-70 years of age. We expect to recruit subjects of
        both genders and all ethnic backgrounds.
