  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pain is an unpleasant sensory experience associated with actual or potential tissue damage.
      Acute pain management is an important aspect of perioperative anesthetic care. Moreover, it
      is the most important factor related to patient discomfort after surgery. Adequate pain
      management, ideally resulting in the complete absence of postoperative pain, not only
      provides comfort to patients, but may also contribute to improved healing and a reduction in
      the incidence of postoperative complications. Inadequate postoperative analgesia has been
      shown to contribute to adverse outcomes, including, but not limited to, immunosuppression,
      hyperglycemia, poor rehabilitation, and progression to chronic pain.

      Patients who are scheduled for submucosal resection of nasal septum with or without
      turbinectomy will be recruited for the study The patients will be will be assigned to either
      the treatment group who will be administered ketamine prior to the operation or the control
      group who will receive a normal saline injection, both in identicle syringes.

      All patients will be operated on by the same surgoens and by the same method of dissection
      and hemostasis (2-5 2 ml lidocadrain carpules, monopolar suction-cautery set on 25).

      Patients folow-up will be reported in their medical charts. The post operative analgetic
      effect will be assessed by the amount of analgesia required in the post-operative period and
      by regular pain measurements using VAS (Visual Analogue Scale) - at 0.5 hours post operation
      in the recovery room, 8 hours post operation and the morning of first post operative day in
      the otolaryngology - head and neck department
