      A Multicenter, Double-Blind, Placebo Controlled, Phase Ⅱa clinical trial to enroll 120
      patients with Vertigo Caused By Posterior Circulation Infarction during 7 days, then to
      evaluate the efficacy of different dose of Levophencynonate Hydrochloric, and provide the
      effective dosage for phase IIb clinical study, to study the safety of Levophencynonate
      Hydrochloric.

      This study will conduct in 15 sites to enrolled 120 patients with vertigo under 7 days
      treatment and 7 days follow-up. The study includes three arms: high dose, low dose and
      placebo control.To observe the efficacy by change of vertigo severity and duration,and safety
      by vital sign,adverse event,etc.
