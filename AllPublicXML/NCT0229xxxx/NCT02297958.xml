  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Ovarian carcinoma has poor prognosis and new therapeutic strategies are required. Many
      patients with ovarian carcinoma showed resistance to chemotherapy. Cleaved FasL is known for
      induced atypical response when is binding to Fas such as avoiding apoptosis and inducing cell
      motility.
