  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Although there is evidence that low calorie sweeteners (LCS) do not stimulate hunger or
      appetite, divergent opinions appear regularly both in the scientific literature and in the
      popular press. The goal of this study is to examine the effects of LCS containing beverages
      on appetite and intake in healthy individuals.

      The study will be a monocentric randomized controlled open trial including two parallel
      groups to examine effects of LCS beverages as compared to water on daily intakes of energy
      and macronutrients. The effects of LCS beverages on hunger, satiety, desire to eat and on the
      selection of sweet or savory foods eating occasions will be assessed.
