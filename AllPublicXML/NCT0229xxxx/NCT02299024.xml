      The investigators overall study objective is to improve patients knowledge and safe use of
      opioid pain relievers upon discharge from the Emergency Department.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Recent studies indicate that emergency department (ED) discharge processes - including
      written and spoken communications - are inadequate, and patients often leave without the
      knowledge necessary to properly care for themselves. In the context of opioid pain relievers,
      this lack of knowledge is potentially dangerous, as patients may not possess the requisite
      knowledge for safe use of their medication or an awareness of the dangers of medication
      misuse.

      The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of an opioid information sheet and spoken
      counseling on patient knowledge about opioids and safe use behaviors. The investigators
      conducted a randomized controlled pilot test of a dual-modality educational intervention
      (written information sheet and spoken counseling about opioids) to assess if the intervention
      can increase patient knowledge about opioid pain relievers. These activities were intended to
      guide future modification of educational interventions and the future development of best
      practices for emergency physician spoken counseling about opioid pain relievers.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Knowledge of medication name</measure>
    <time_frame>4-7 days</time_frame>
    <description>The primary outcome was the patients ability to identify the medication name of their prescribed opioid pain reliever upon follow-up.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Knowledge and counseling recall outcomes</measure>
    <time_frame>4-7 days</time_frame>
    <description>In addition to the outcome of medication name patients were asked additional knowledge and recall questions including: active ingredients in the medication, knowledge about safe daily dose of acetaminophen, side effects, recall of counseling about activities to avoid (drinking alcohol, driving vehicle), knowledge about addictive potential of the medication.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Actual Use outcomes</measure>
    <time_frame>4-7 days</time_frame>
    <description>Patients were queried about their home use of the medication including: pain score at home, average number of tabs per day, and satisfaction with pain reduction. Additionally they were asked about the timing of any alcohol consumption or driving in relation to the timing of medication dosing.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Response to the intervention</measure>
    <time_frame>4-7 days</time_frame>
    <description>Patients in the intervention arm were asked how they liked the intervention using a series of question with a Likert scale.</description>

    <description>Patients in this arm are discharged from the Northwestern Emergency Department with standard communication about their prescribed opioid pain medication from their care providers. They are called for a follow up survey 4-7 days after their visit.</description>

    <arm_group_type>Experimental</arm_group_type>
    <description>Patients in this arm are discharged from the ED with an additional information sheet about their prescribed opioid pain medication, via the intervention titled &quot;Additional Opioid Information&quot;. The sheet is read aloud to them by a research assistant. They are called 4-7 days later for a follow up survey.</description>

    <intervention_name>Additional Opioid Information</intervention_name>
    <description>Patients receiving this intervention are given additional information about the opioid pain medication that they are receiving in the form of a one page handout. The hand out was written in a health-literacy appropriate manner. A research assistant read the handout to them out loud, and they were given a copy to take home with them.</description>
