  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is aimed to determine if acute normovolemic hemodilution (ANH), an established
      blood conservation technique, reduces the requirement for allogeneic blood transfusion in
      operations with prediction of surgical bleeding over 20% of estimated blood volume (EBV)

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Allogeneic blood transfusion is often done during surgery to save life- threatening
      conditions. Blood conservation is a method that can reduce peri-operative allogeneic blood
      transfusion. This study has been conducted on 34 patients underwent laparotomy surgery with
      bleeding more than 20% of EBV. After being informed concent, research subjects were
      randomized into two groups: ANH (conducted ANH) and control group (without ANH). After
      starting general anesthesia, the ANH group was withdrawing blood based on Gross formula.
      Restoration of circulated volume was instituted by infusion of colloids. In control group,
      the operation was started right after the induction of anesthesia. The monitoring of blood
      pressure, heart rate, the amount of bleeding, total fluid, urine production, hemoglobin
      concentration and number of allogenic transfusion were recorded.

    <description>The investigators evaluate number of patients require allogenic transfusion during surgery until 24 hours post surgery with targeted haemoglobin level &gt; 8gr/dl. Blood pressure, heart rate, total bleeding, total fluid administration and urine production are also recorded in order to confirm that acute normovolemic haemodilution is safe in patients undergoing laparotomy surgery</description>

    <description>After general anesthesia is applied, blood was taken through the cubital vein and collected into standard blood bags containing CPDA anti-coagulant. The blood obtained is then stored at temperature of 23 - 25 Celsius degree and given back to patients in the operating room after the bleeding stopped and as soon as there are indications of transfusion.</description>
