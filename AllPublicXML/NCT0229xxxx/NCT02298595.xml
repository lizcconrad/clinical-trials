      This study evaluates the combination of BYL719, cisplatin and cetuximab as induction
      chemotherapy prior to minimally-invasive transoral surgery (TORS or TLM) and selective lymph
      node dissection (SLND), followed by risk-adapted intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT)
      in patients with transorally resectable, Stage III-IVa, HPV-associated oropharyngeal squamous
      cell carcinoma (OPSCC).

    <textblock>
      HPV status and tobacco use are the major independent prognostic factors for patients with
      OPSCC. Patients with HPV-associated OPSCC have a favorable prognosis when treated with
      chemotherapy, radiation, and/or surgery. This has resulted in national trials investigating
      de-intensification strategies for good-risk patients with HPV-associated OPSCC, where current
      multimodality paradigms may represent overtreatment.

      The PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling network, a mitogenic pathway regulating cellular metabolism,
      proliferation and survival, plays a major role in HPV biology. Starting with early infection,
      activation of PI3K suppresses autophagy and induces functional protein translational
      machinery. Activation of the pathway is a nearly universal aspect of mammalian viral
      infection, and is of particular importance for dsDNA viruses such as HPV. The oncoproteins
      E5, E6 and E7 also have direct roles in pathway activation. Moreover, HPV-associated OPSCC
      demonstrates a strikingly high prevalence of genomic activation of the PI3K pathway,
      including activating PIK3CA mutations (27-31%), PIK3CA amplification (20%), and loss of PTEN
      (30%), the negative regulator of PI3K. Overall genomic events hypothesized to result in PI3K
      pathway activation are present in approximately 45-60% of HPV-transformed OPSCC.

      BYL719 is an oral, small molecule, alpha-specific inhibitor of PI3-Kinase. Because
      HPV-associated OPSCC demonstrates a high rate of both genomic and non-genomic PI3K pathway
      activation, we hypothesize that adding BYL719 to platinum-taxane induction chemotherapy in
      HPV-associated OPSCC will increase clinico-radiologic complete response relative to
      historical control. In this phase I/II trial, eligible patients wiht HPV-associated OPSCC
      will be treated with 3 cycles of induction BYL719, cisplatin and paclitaxel. Induction will
      be followed by minimally-invasive, transoral surgery (TORS or TLM) then risk-adapted IMRT.

                  and for 12 weeks after completion of all protocol treatment and should not father
                  a child in this period. A condom is required to be used also by vasectomized men
                  in order to prevent delivery of the drug via seminal fluid, during the period of
                  BYL719 treatment (induction chemotherapy) and for 4 weeks following completion of
                  BYL719.

               -  Women of child-bearing potential, defined as all women physiologically capable of
                  becoming pregnant, unless they are using highly effective methods of
                  contraception during dosing and 12 weeks after completion of all study treatment.
                  Highly effective contraception methods include:

                    -  Total abstinence (when this is in line with the preferred and usual
                       lifestyle of the subject. Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation,
                       symptothermal, post-ovulation methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable
                       methods of contraception

                    -  Female sterilization (have had surgical bilateral oophorectomy with or
                       without hysterectomy) or tubal ligation at least six weeks before taking
                       study treatment. In case of oophorectomy alone, only when the reproductive
                       status of the woman has been confirmed by follow up hormone level assessment

                    -  Male partner sterilization (at least 6 months prior to screening). For
                       female subjects on the study the vasectomized male partner should be the
                       sole partner for that subject.

                    -  Combination of the following methods:

               -  Placement of an intrauterine device (IUD) or intrauterine system (IUS)

               -  Barrier methods of contraception: Condom or Occlusive cap (diaphragm or
                  cervical/vault caps) with spermicidal foam/gel/film/cream/vaginal suppository

               -  Note: hormonal contraception methods (e.g. oral, injected, and implanted) are not
                  allowed as BYL719 may decrease the effectiveness of hormonal contraceptives

               -  Note: Women are considered post-menopausal and not of child bearing potential if
                  they have had 12 months of natural (spontaneous) amenorrhea with an appropriate
                  clinical profile (e.g. age appropriate, history of vasomotor symptoms) or have
                  had surgical bilateral oophorectomy (with or without hysterectomy) at least six
                  weeks ago.
