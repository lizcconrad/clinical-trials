  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study was to compare four different CPR feedback devices to standard BLS in
      terms of the quality of single rescuer pediatric resuscitation. Therefore, the investigators
      hypothesis was that there would be no difference between CPR methods in terms of chest
      compression quality parameters.

      Cardiac arrest is a leading cause of death worldwide. High-quality chest compressions are of
      paramount importance for survival and good neurological outcome. Unfortunately, even health
      professionals have difficulty performing effective CPR. Chest compression (CC) is often too
      shallow, compression ratio is inadequate, and hands-off time is too long. CPR feedback
      devices might be an option for rescuers to in order to increase CC efficiency.
