      The primary objective of this study is to assess changes in alanine aminotransferase (ALT) in
      hepatitis C virus (HCV)-infected subjects given daily doses of JKB-122 for 3 months who have
      been nonresponsive to, intolerable to, or relapsed from prior interferon-based therapies
      (pegylated or standard) either alone or in combination with ribavirin or other anti-HCV
      therapies including direct-acting anti-viral agents.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Is HCV positive (documented by HCV RNA testing at Screening). Chronic hepatitis C is
             defined as a) Positive for anti-HCV antibody, HCV RNA, or an HCV genotype at least 6
             months before screening, and positive for HCV RNA and anti-HCV antibody at the time of
             screening; or b) Positive for anti-HCV antibody and HCV RNA at the time of screening
             with a liver biopsy consistent with chronic HCV infection (or a liver biopsy performed
             before enrollment with evidence of CHC disease, such as the presence of fibrosis),
             according to &quot;Guidance for Industry. Chronic Hepatitis C Virus Infection: Developing
             Direct-Acting Antiviral Agents for Treatment&quot;.

          -  Has previous results from HCV genotype testing. If previous results are not available,
             such testing should be performed at Screening.

          -  Has had a liver biopsy or Fibroscan™ within 3 years and the severity of hepatic
             dysfunction is limited to the following:

               -  Metavir Stage 0 to stage 3 fibrosis (according to liver biopsy) or Fibroscan™
                  results

               -  ALT and AST values not exceeding 5 x ULN (Baseline value for each parameter will
                  be calculated as the average of 3 values obtained 7 days apart

               -  Normal total bilirubin, and prothrombin time/INR values

          -  Has elevated liver test results (ALT) at least 1.5 x ULN and not exceeding 5 x ULN
             (Baseline value for each parameter will be calculated as the average of 3 values
             obtained 7 days apart

          -  Is refractory or null responder, intolerable, relapser, or partial responder.

               -  Null responder is defined as less than a 2 log10 IU/mL reduction in HCV RNA after
                  12 weeks of treatment with standard or Peg Interferon/ribavirin or other anti-HCV
                  therapies;

               -  Relapser is defined as HCV RNA undetectable (or negative, per site's definition)
                  at the end stage of treatment with a standard or pegylated interferon-based
                  regimen or other anti-HCV therapies, but HCV RNA detectable during post-treatment
                  follow-up;

               -  The intolerable is defined as HCV patients who cannot tolerate the side effects

                  not suitable for interferon-based therapies or other anti-HCV therapies;

               -  Partial responder is defined as achieved more than 2 log10 IU/mL reduction in HCV
                  RNA by Week 12 (± 1 week) during a prior pegIFN/RBV treatment course or other
                  anti-HCV therapies but failed to achieve HCV RNA undetectable at the end stage of
                  treatment.

          1. Has history of allergy to JKB-122 or related compounds

             within 3 months prior to the first screening visit (Day -28)

          6. Is being treated with any prescription narcotic drug (including transdermal delivery
             systems)

          7. Has a known or suspected central nervous system disorder that may predispose to

          8. Has unstable and uncontrollable hypertension (&gt;180/110 mmHg)

          9. Has received other therapies for HCV infection (interferon, pegylated interferon,
             ribavirin, or others) in the last 4 weeks prior to the first screening visit (Day -28)

         10. Requires concomitant use of or treatment with opioids or other excluded drugs such as
