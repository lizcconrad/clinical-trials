  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      GSK2140944 has demonstrated in vitro activity against Neisseria (N.) gonorrhoeae, including
      ciprofloxacin resistant and susceptible strains. This study is a Phase II, randomized,
      multicenter, open-label, dose ranging study designed to inform the optimal oral dose of
      GSK2140944 by further characterizing the efficacy, safety, and tolerability in subjects with
      uncomplicated urogenital gonorrhea due to N. gonorrhoeae. Subjects will be randomly assigned
      to receive either a single 1500 milligrams (mg) or 3000 mg oral dose of GSK2140944.
      Appropriate safety and microbiological assessments will be conducted at the Baseline (Day 1)
      Visit and repeated at the Test-of-Cure (Day 4 to 8) Visit. The study duration will be
      approximately 1 week. Approximately 60 microbiologically evaluable subjects (30 subjects in
      each treatment arm) will complete the study if both arms remain active throughout the study.

    <measure>Number of Participants With Culture-confirmed Bacterial Eradication of Urogenital Neisseria Gonorrhoeae at the Test-of-Cure Visit</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Day 1, pre-dose) and Test-of-Cure visit (Day 4 to 8)</time_frame>
    <description>Pre-treatment urogenital, pharyngeal, and rectal swab specimens were obtained for bacteriological culture for neisseria (N.) gonorrhoeae at the Baseline visit. Test- of-Cure was defined by infection site (that is urogenital and, as appropriate, rectal and/or pharyngeal) as culture confirmed bacterial eradication of N. gonorrhoeae observed 3 to 7 days post-treatment. Pre-treatment urogenital specimens were obtained for nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT) assay to detect the presence of N. gonorrhoeae and chlamydia trachomatis at the Baseline visit. Only participants who had a pre-therapy N. gonorrhoeae isolate recovered from their urogenital specimen were evaluated. Microbiologically evaluable (ME) Population comprised of all randomized participants who had N. gonorrhoeae isolated from Baseline cultures of urogenital swab specimens, received any dose of gepotidacin, and returned for their TOC visit.</description>

    <participant_flow>
      <recruitment_details>This was a phase II, randomized, multicenter, open-label, dose ranging study evaluating the efficacy, safety and tolerability of gepotidacin therapy in participants with uncomplicated urogenital gonorrhea. The study duration was approximately 1 week with 2 planned study visits: Baseline (Day 1, pre-dose) and Test-of-Cure (TOC) (Day 4 to 8) visit.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>A total of 106 participants (par.) were randomized to receive GSK2140944 1500 milligrams (mg) or GSK2140944 3000 mg, of which 105 participants received any dose of study treatment and 1 par. was unable to swallow the capsule; therefore, did not receive study drug.</pre_assignment_details>

Additional 100 mL of water was given to assist in swallowing a large number of capsules. Participants who tested positive for chlamydia trachomatis at the Baseline visit, received a single 1 gram dose of azithromycin or local standard of care at the TOC visit.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants With Culture-confirmed Bacterial Eradication of Urogenital Neisseria Gonorrhoeae at the Test-of-Cure Visit</title>
        <description>Pre-treatment urogenital, pharyngeal, and rectal swab specimens were obtained for bacteriological culture for neisseria (N.) gonorrhoeae at the Baseline visit. Test- of-Cure was defined by infection site (that is urogenital and, as appropriate, rectal and/or pharyngeal) as culture confirmed bacterial eradication of N. gonorrhoeae observed 3 to 7 days post-treatment. Pre-treatment urogenital specimens were obtained for nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT) assay to detect the presence of N. gonorrhoeae and chlamydia trachomatis at the Baseline visit. Only participants who had a pre-therapy N. gonorrhoeae isolate recovered from their urogenital specimen were evaluated. Microbiologically evaluable (ME) Population comprised of all randomized participants who had N. gonorrhoeae isolated from Baseline cultures of urogenital swab specimens, received any dose of gepotidacin, and returned for their TOC visit.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Temperature at the Indicated Time Points</title>
        <description>Temperature was measured in semi-supine position after 5 minutes rest. It was recorded at Baseline visit, 2 hour post-dose visit for participants enrolled under orignal protocol, 0.5 hour post-dose for participants enrolled under protocol amendement 1 and up to TOC visit (Day 4 to 8). Vital sign measurements were obtained prior to any scheduled blood collection visit on the same assessment day. Baseline was defined as the study assessment on Day 1 (pre-dose). Change from Baseline was calculated as TOC visit value minus value at Baseline. Only those participants available at the specified time points were analyzed (represented by n=X, X in the category titles).</description>

        <description>Blood samples were collected at Baseline Day 1 (pre-dose) and at TOC visit (Day 4 to 8) to evaluate hemoglobin, total protein and albumin. Baseline was defined as the study assessment on Day 1 (pre-dose). Change from Baseline was calculated as value obtained at TOC visit minus value at Baseline. Only those participants available at the specified time points were analyzed (represented by n=X, X in the category titles).</description>

        <description>Blood samples were collected at Baseline Day 1 (pre-dose) and at TOC visit (Day 4 to 8) to evaluate bilirubin, direct bilirubin and creatinine. Baseline was defined as the study assessment on Day 1 (pre-dose). Change from Baseline was calculated as value obtained at TOC visit minus value at Baseline. Only those participants available at the specified time points were analyzed (represented by n=X, X in the category titles).</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Erythrocytes at Test-of-Cure Visit (Day 4 to 8)</title>
        <description>Blood samples were collected at Baseline Day 1 (pre-dose) and at TOC visit (Day 4 to 8) to evaluate erythrocytes (red blood cell count). Baseline was defined as the study assessment on Day 1 (pre-dose). Change from Baseline was calculated as value obtained at TOC visit minus value at Baseline. Only those participants available at the specified time points were analyzed (represented by n=X, X in the category titles).</description>
