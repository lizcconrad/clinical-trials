  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Degenerative lumbar spondylolisthesis is the forward displacement (slip) of one vertebra on
      an adjacent vertebra resulting in narrowing of the spinal canal or compression of the exiting
      nerve roots. It is commonly associated with low back and leg pain, and is a frequent reason
      for spine surgery particularly in individuals over age 65 years. Recently novel minimally
      invasive surgical techniques have heightened public and government interest by touting
      benefits of reduced approached-related morbidity which in turn leads to quicker recovery,
      shorter hospital stay, improved short-term clinical outcomes, and reduced health care cost.
      However, there is no randomized controlled trial evidence to describe the actual advantages
      and disadvantages associated with minimally invasive spinal fusion. This pilot study is a
      randomized control trial comparing minimally invasive MID-line Lumbar Fusion (MIDLF) to
      traditional &quot;open&quot; posterior lumbar interbody fusion (PLIF) with respect to length of stay,
      approach related morbidity, patient centered outcome measures, and cost-effectiveness in the
      treatment of degenerative lumbar spondylolisthesis.

    <description>MIDLF surgery involves a minimally invasive midline laminectomy posterior approach to the lumbar spine. An incision that is smaller than the standard incision is made in the midline of the low back directly over the spinal levels. Afterward the pressure on the compressed nerves is released, and the disc between the affected vertebrae is completely removed. A metal cage filled with bone graft is placed as described in the PLIF procedure.</description>

    <description>PLIF surgery involves a standard incision in the midline of the low back directly over the involved spinal levels. Afterward the pressure on the compressed nerves is released, and the disc between the affected vertebrae is completely removed. A metal cage filled with bone graft is placed in between the vertebral bodies where the disc usually lies. This will allow bone fusion (healing) to occur from one vertebral body to the other.</description>
