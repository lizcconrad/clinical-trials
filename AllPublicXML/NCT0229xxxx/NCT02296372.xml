  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Critically ill patients are on high risk for increased serum glucose levels, leading to more
      comorbidity and higher mortality risk. In patients with severe sepsis and septic shock
      hyperglycemia is a typical finding. However the need of insulin therapy is associated with an
      increased risk of hypoglycemia. Newly developed technologies for continuous glucose
      monitoring in critically ill patients may improve glycemic control and reduce glucose
      variability. The investigators will perform continuous glucose monitoring in critically ill
      patients on ICU. Measurements will be done for a period of 72h per patient. The investigators
      aim is to evaluate accuracy feasibility and acceptance of these methods. To analyze accuracy
      sensor glucose levels will be validated due to arterial blood gas measurements with the blood
      gas analyzer. The investigators will investigate the influence of several factors like
      oedema, perspiration, BMI, body temperature, pH-value application of vasoconstrictors on
      accuracy and feasibility of the particular system. Furthermore Nursing staff will be given a
      questionnaire to identify acceptance.
