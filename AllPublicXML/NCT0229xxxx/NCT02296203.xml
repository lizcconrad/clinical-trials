  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicentric, phase II single-arm study in which KRAS, NRAS and BRAF wild-type,
      irinotecan-resistant metastatic colorectal cancer patients progressing after an initial
      response to a first-line cetuximab-containing therapy, receive a rechallenge third-line
      treatment with cetuximab plus irinotecan.

    <description>ORR is defined as the percentage of patients, relative to the total of enrolled subjects, achieving a complete (CR) or partial (PR) response, according to RECIST 1.1 criteria. The determination of clinical response will be based on investigator-reported measurements. Responses will be evaluated with a chest and abdominal computed tomography (CT) scan every 8 weeks. Patients who do not have an on-study assessment will be included in the analysis as non-responders.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Histologically proven diagnosis of colorectal adenocarcinoma;

          -  RAS and BRAF wild-type status;

          -  First-line irinotecan-based (FOLFIRI or FOLFOXIRI) cetuximab-containing therapy
             producing at least a partial response;

          -  First-line progression-free survival in response to cetuximab-containing therapy ≥6
             months;

          -  Documentation of progression to first-line cetuximab within 4 weeks after last
             cetuximab administration;

          -  Time between the end of first-line therapy and the start of third-line treatment with
             cetuximab plus irinotecan ≥4 months;

          -  Second-line oxaliplatin-based (FOLFOXIRI, FOLFOX or XELOX) bevacizumab-containing
             therapy;

          -  Documentation of progression to second-line treatment;

          -  Measurable disease according to RECIST criteria v1.1;

          -  Have tumor tissue (of primary tumor and metastases or at least one of the two)
             available for biomarker analysis;

          -  Male or female patients &gt; 18 years of age;

          -  ECOG Performance Status ≤ 2;

          -  Life expectancy of at least 3 months;

          -  Adequate bone marrow, liver and renal function assessed within 14 days before starting
             study treatment;

          -  Women of childbearing potential must have a negative blood pregnancy test at the
             baseline visit. For this trial, women of childbearing potential are defined as all
             women after puberty, unless they are postmenopausal for at least 12 months, are
             surgically sterile or are sexually inactive;

          -  Subjects and their partners must be willing to avoid pregnancy during the trial and
             until 6 months after the last trial treatment. Male subjects with female partners of
             childbearing potential and female subjects of childbearing potential must, therefore,
             be willing to use adequate contraception as approved by the investigator, such as a
             two-barrier method or one-barrier method with spermicidal or intrauterine device. This
             requirement begins 2 weeks before receiving the first trial treatment and ends 6
             months after receiving the last treatment;

          -  Signed informed consent obtained before any study specific procedure.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Active uncontrolled infections or active disseminated intravascular coagulation;

          -  Past or current history of malignancies other than colorectal carcinoma, except for
             curatively treated basal and squamous cell carcinoma of the skin cancer or in situ
             carcinoma of the cervix;

          -  Fertile women (&lt; 12 months after last menstruation) and men of childbearing potential
             not willing to use effective means of contraception

          -  Women who are pregnant or are breastfeeding;

          -  Previous grade 3/4 infusion related reaction to cetuximab.
