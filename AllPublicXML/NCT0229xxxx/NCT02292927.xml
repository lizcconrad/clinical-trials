      DESIGN: Single-centre, feasibility study AIMS: The aim of this study is to evaluate the
      acceptability and pre-operative impact on functional capacity of a trimodal prehabilitation
      program in a cohort of patients undergoing aneurysm repair.

      This will enable the design (feasibility and power) of a large scale Randomised Controlled
      Trial.

      Expected outcomes

        -  The potential number of patients who would benefit, the compliance and acceptability of
           a pre-operative prehabilitation programme will be calculated.

        -  Preoperatively, expected at 6-weeks, the change in physical fitness of patients
           (assessed by the physical function section of SF-36 and measured with peak flow/6-minute
           walk testing) during the pre-operative phase will be assessed in both groups.

        -  The effects on quality of life, anxiety and depression on each study participant will be
           assessed immediately pre-op, expected at 6-weeks.

        -  The number of patients who are able to reduce or cease smoking will be reported during
           the pre-op phase (expected at 6 weeks), as will length of hospital stay after aortic
           surgery, expected at 6-8 weeks.

      POPULATION: Patients undergoing planned elective aortic surgery procedures

      ELIGIBILITY: Adult patients (over 18 years) undergoing elective open and endovascular
      aneurysm repair with capacity to consent and physical fitness to undergo an pre-operative
      exercise programme DURATION: 1 year from 1st June 2014

      1. INTRODUCTION 1.1 BACKGROUND

           Prehabilitation is used in sports and the military to avoid injury and there is evidence
           from the surgical literature that physical prehabilitation can improve the patient
           fitness before major procedures. It is already used with great effect within
           orthopaedics; joint replacement patients who participate in strength-based training with
           aerobic and flexibility exercises for just six weeks pre-operatively reduce their odds
           of requiring inpatient rehabilitation by 73% [1]. In other surgical specialties,
           prehabilitation has also been shown to improve pre-operative physical function [2,3]. In
           a pre-post intervention study, although the postoperative complication rates and the
           hospital length of stay were similar, there were significant improvements in
           post-operative walking capacity. At 8 weeks, 81 % of the prehabilitated patients were
           recovered compared with 40 % of the pre-intervention group [4]. In contrast, a
           randomised controlled trial [5] has shown no difference between control and intervention
           groups where prehabilitation was introduced. The authors claim that this may be due to
           the fact that walking and deep breathing exercises (given to the control group) were
           effective alone, but may also be that differences were small in this cohort; these
           patients were fit when compared to a population of patients with aneurysm disease.

           The literature surrounding the prehabilitation concept is largely biased towards the use
           of exercise alone. Rather than a purely physical assessment and pre-operative training,
           thought should be afforded to the wider impact of major surgery on patients undergoing
           major surgery. For example, there is strong evidence suggesting that undergoing major
           surgery has significant implications for patients' post-operative psychological
           wellbeing. Qualitative data suggests that some patients experience a significant loss of
           confidence and feelings of anxiety in the aftermath of major cardiac surgery due to
           feeling unable to do tasks and activities they had previously undertaken [6].
           Psychological distress could further delay patients' recovery as increased levels of
           stress have been linked with delayed recovery from surgery [7].

           Psycho-educational support for surgical patients has significant benefits on
           psychological and clinical outcomes [8-10]. Interventions are varied and include
           elements such as supplying information, cognitive coping strategies, relaxation,
           reassurance and support, and rehearsal, which prepare patients to tackle the rigorous
           efforts needed to recover from major surgery.

           Lastly, there are a number of psycho-social interventions targeting specific health
           behaviours that would obviously benefit the recovery of patients. The most commonly
           known and widely studied health behaviour intervention of significant benefit is that of
           smoking cessation. Giving up smoking 6 weeks before surgery decreases the post-operative
           complication rates by over 50%. Whilst the effects of giving up smoking are well known,
           efforts to curtail the need for nicotine are often ignored, perhaps from lack of
           knowledge within the medical disciplines [11].

           Proposed intervention - The introduction of a biopsychosocial intervention before
           surgery. The physical exercise programme will be a prescribed exercise training twice
           per week which will be supported by a physical therapist and vascular nurse specialist.
           A trained clinical psychologist will also deliver a brief psychological intervention
           based on cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) techniques in two sessions to modify
           illness, surgical preparation and rehabilitation beliefs. Lastly patients will be
           counselled and referred to smoking cessation services as appropriate by the vascular
           nurse specialist.

           Baseline information will include patient demographics and medical history, quality of
           life assessment using SF-36 forms, hospital anxiety and depression scale (HADS) and
           exercise testing by a standardised 6-minute walk test Information immediately
           pre-operatively will be collected to include a repeat assessment of physical function
           with a 6-minute walk test, SF-36 assessment and HADS scores. Smoking cessation rate will
           be collected.

           A pre and post-intervention group will be studied over a 1-year period. We will report
           on the eligibility, acceptability and pre-operative effect of this trimodal
           rehabilitation programme.

        2. AIM AND EXPECTED IMPACT

           This is a non-randomised pre-post intervention pilot study to understand the
           acceptability and pre-operative effects of a combined physical, psychological and social
           prehabilitation package in patients undergoing aneurysm repair. This will enable the
           design (feasibility and power) of a large scale Randomised Controlled Trial.

           Our hypotheses include:

             -  The introduction of a prehabilitation programme will be acceptable to the majority
                of patients undergoing aneurysm surgery

             -  A physical pre-operative exercise programme will increase physical fitness before
                surgery

             -  A psychological intervention based on cognitive behaviour therapy techniques will
                reduce anxiety before surgery and prepare patients better for their post-operative
                recovery

             -  The introduction of psycho-social counselling for smoking cessation will encourage
                more patients to give up smoking pre-operatively

        3. PARTICIPANT ENTRY: PATIENTS

           3.1 PRE-REGISTRATION EVALUATIONS The research team will identify eligible patients for
           recruitment into the study via clinic lists, multidisciplinary meetings and referral
           letters before the patient attends their clinic appointment. Only adult patients
           undergoing aortic surgery will be selected. Patient information leaflets will be given
           to selected patients and patients will be given the opportunity to read them and ask
           questions before deciding whether or not to participate.

           3.2 INCLUSION CRITERIA

             -  Adult patients (&gt;18 years old) undergoing aortic aneurysm repair.

             -  Ability to comprehend and retain instructions regarding self-training

             -  Physical fitness allowing participation in an exercise programme.

           3.3 EXCLUSION CRITERIA

             -  Minors (&lt;18 years old)

             -  Adult patients who do not have capacity to consent.

             -  Emergency or urgent procedures who will not have a necessary 6 week lead in time
                until operation.

           3.4 WITHDRAWRAL CRITERIA The patient will be made aware that they may withdraw from the
           study at any time without providing a reason; their care and treatment will not be
           affected.

        4. STUDY DESIGN The acceptability of this programme will be studied and the pre-operative
           impact on functional capacity will be assessed in a comparator (pre-intervention) and
           post-intervention group.

           Patients

           Patients from Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust Vascular Unit undergoing aortic
           aneurysm repair will be recruited. The unit performs in the region of 100 abdominal
           aortic repairs annually with a further 100 thoracic aneurysms.

           Inclusion criteria will be those patients undergoing elective repair, willing/able to
           undertake a period of prehabilitation, and those able to comprehend and retain
           instructions regarding self-training. Symptomatic patients or those undergoing urgent
           treatment (&lt; 2 weeks) will be excluded as will those declining to participate.
           Deliberately broad inclusion and exclusion criteria have been chosen to fully understand
           the proportion of patients that may benefit from this intervention.

           Allowing for a 25% ineligibility to be included and 25% refusing to enter into the study
           this would allow 50 patients to be recruited providing vital information on the
           acceptability and potential of this intervention.

           All patients undergoing aneurysm repair of any type and the reasons for inclusion and
           exclusion in the study will be recorded to enable a comprehensive evaluation of the
           number of patients potentially suitable for a prehabilitation programme.

           We plan to identify potential patients from the vascular outpatient clinics at initial
           point of referral to the work-up nurse led service. A standardised screening assessment
           sheet will be used. At this point they will be given a patient information leaflet
           regarding the study (for both pre and post intervention groups).

           On the day of their standard pre-assessment those who have been given a patient
           information leaflet, who agree to be in the study, will be consented. Patients will only
           be consented after a chance to ask unanswered questions. If the patient agrees to
           participate, he or she will be asked to sign a consent form, which will be kept securely
           in a locked office.

           Those agreeing to participate in the study will receive an additional appointment on the
           same day with the vascular nurse specialist for baseline measurement and targeted
           instruction on the Bio Psycho Social Prehabilitation Programme. It is anticipated that
           this would not take more than two hours in addition to their standard appointments.

           Study Protocol

           Our current vascular pre-operative assessment service is an established nurse led
           service, run by a dedicated aortic clinical nurse specialist. The prehabilitation would
           run in conjunction with the current pre-operative screening measures currently in place
           - which include dobutamine stress echocardiography, renal assessment and pulmonary
           function tests.

           -Phase 1 - Comparator (pre-intervention) evaluation

           Patients undergoing present standard of care - i.e. standard work-up for aneurysm repair
           without nurse-led prehabilitation strategy, who meet inclusion and exclusion criteria
           will be given a patient information leaflet, informed they are in the pre-intervention
           group and consented for inclusion in the study as detailed above.

           At the baseline appointment, on the same day as work-up tests, information will be
           collected on standardised data collection sheets to include:

             -  Patient demographics and medical history

             -  Baseline Quality of Life assessment using SF-36 forms

             -  Hospital anxiety and depression scale (HADS).

             -  Exercise testing by a standardised 6-minute walk test

             -  Peak Expiratory Flow Rate (PEFR)

           Information immediately pre-operatively will be collected the day before operation (our
           standard admission is the day before) to include a repeat assessment of physical
           function with a 6-minute walk test, Peak Expiratory Flow Rate (PEFR), SF-36 assessment
           and HADS scores. Smoking cessation rate over the pre-operative period will be collected.
           The aneurysm repair will proceed as standard of care, and will be unchanged from
           standard practice.

           -Phase 2 - Intervention

           Proposed intervention - The introduction of a biopsychosocial intervention before
           surgery. The physical exercise programme will be prescribed exercise training twice per
           week which will be supported by our vascular nurse specialist, previously shown to have
           a small effect on length of stay in cardiac patients [12].

           A trained specialist (a registered psychologist) will also deliver a brief psychological
           intervention based on cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) techniques in two sessions to
           modify illness, surgical preparation and rehabilitation beliefs. This psychological
           intervention has been shown to be effective in encouraging claudicants to initiate and
           continue exercise training [13].

           Lastly patients will be counselled and referred to smoking cessation services as
           appropriate.

           Phase 2 protocol - During an initial set-up phase comprehensive information booklets
           will be developed to instruct the patient on these three modes of prehabilitation.

           Patients who are eligible for the study will be approached in the same way as patients
           studied in the comparator group. At the baseline study visit, the same baseline
           information will be collected as for the comparator group i.e.:

           At the baseline appointment, on the same day as work-up tests, information will be
           collected on standardised data collection sheets to include:

             -  Patient demographics and medical history

             -  Baseline Quality of Life assessment using SF-36 forms

             -  Hospital anxiety and depression scale (HADS).

             -  Exercise testing by a standardised 6-minute walk test

             -  Peak Expiratory Flow Rate (PEFR)

           In addition patients will receive:

             -  Information booklets

             -  Physical exercise plan, run-through and explanations.

             -  Psychological therapy on this day or a mutually convenient day for patient and
                therapist.

             -  Counselling by the nurse specialist and referral for smoking cessation

           Patients will receive a telephone follow-up with the nurse specialist at week 2 and week
           4 to evaluate progress and to encourage compliance with the programme. Between weeks 5-6
           the patient will have a further session with the clinical psychologist, just prior to
           admission for treatment, to prepare them for their impending hospitalisation.

           Again, information immediately pre-operatively will be collected to include a repeat
           assessment of physical function with a 6-minute walk test, Peak Expiratory Flow Rate
           (PEFR), SF-36 assessment and HADS score. In addition, patients will be asked to fill out
           a questionnaire assessing compliance with and acceptability of the prehabilitation
           programme. Smoking cessation rate will be collected.

        5. Data Collection

           The following demographic data will be recorded on standardised data collection forms
           for each patient, collected from patient records and the patient interviews:

             -  Inclusion and exclusion criteria

             -  Medical history/risk factors

             -  ASA classification

             -  Planned operative procedure details

             -  Physical status using functional capacity, measured in metabolic equivalents
                (METs), with a Duke Activity Status Index (score of less than 4 indicates poor
                physical function).

           Functional capacity may be usually expressed in metabolic equivalents (METs), where one
           MET is defined as the oxygen consumption of a 70-kg man at rest. Greater than 7 METs of
           activity tolerance is considered excellent, whereas less than 4 METs is considered poor
           activity tolerance.

           The Duke Activity Status Index suggests questions that correlate with MET levels; for
           example, walking on level ground at about 4 miles per hour or carrying a bag of
           groceries up a flight of stairs expends approximately 4 METs of activity. This system is
           used by the Cleveland clinic for pre-operative cardiac evaluation. It allows a
           pre-operative assessment of physical function to assess predicted ability to cope at
           home after surgery. A brief, self-completed questionnaire (Appendix 1) can provide a
           standardized assessment of functional status that correlates well with an objective
           measure of maximal exercise capacity [14].

           Post-operative data will be collected for patients in order to plan for a further study
           based on reducing length of stay.

             -  Inpatient complications: grade and details using standardised data collection
                sheets

             -  Length of stay

             -  HDU/ITU use

             -  Mortality

           At base line visit and prior to operation each patient will be assessed using:

             -  Baseline Quality of Life assessment using SF-36 forms

             -  Hospital anxiety and depression scale (HADS).

             -  Exercise testing by a standardised 6-minute walk test

             -  Peak Expiratory Flow Rate (PEFR)

           An event log will be recorded for each patient throughout the study period.

           Patients undergoing intervention will be asked to complete a short questionnaire on
           compliance and acceptability of the prehabilitation programme.

        6. ANALYSIS Completed data collection sheets will be analysed for omissions and missing
           data completed before being logged onto a central database and analysed by the research
           team at Imperial College, London, St. Mary's Campus.

      The two groups will be compared using simple statistical methods. We intend to analyse and
      report on the following

        -  The number of patients who accepted inclusion into a pre-operative prehabilitation
           programme will be calculated.

        -  The change in physical fitness of patients (assessed by the physical function section of
           SF-36 and measured with peak flow/6-minute walk testing) during the pre-operative phase
           will be assessed pre and post-intervention groups.

        -  The effects on quality of life.

        -  The effect of a programme on anxiety and depression on each study participant will be
           assessed.

        -  The number of patients who are able to reduce or cease smoking will be reported.

        -  Compliance and acceptability of the prehabilitation programme.

        -  Morbidity and Mortality, HDU/ITU resource use as well as Length of hospital stay after
           aortic surgery.
