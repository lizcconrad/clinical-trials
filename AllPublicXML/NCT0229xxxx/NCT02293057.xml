  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Girls in the juvenile justice system have unique developmental pathways to drug use and
      co-occurring risk (e.g., HIV/STI) behaviors that have typically not been considered or tested
      in order to identify evidence-based gender-specific substance use treatment approaches for
      this population. This study will advance scientific knowledge and clinical practice in the
      drug treatment and public health fields by testing the efficacy of a pre-existing, widely
      disseminated gender-responsive substance use treatment (VOICES) on drug use and HIV/STI risk
      behavior outcomes for a broad range of substance using girls and young women (ages 12-24) who
      are at-risk for or already involved with the justice system.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Compared to both non-offending females and male offending counterparts, offending girls are
      at significantly greater risk for the development of substance use disorders, psychiatric
      symptoms and negative health outcomes, such as HIV/AIDS or other sexually transmitted
      infections (STIs). Research suggests that girls may have different developmental pathways to
      drug use, initial legal involvement and co-occurring negative health outcomes that support
      the importance of testing gender-specific treatments for juvenile justice girls. Although
      there is recent increased emphasis on gender-specific programming in juvenile justice,
      empirically supported gender specific interventions to improve health, mental health and/or
      legal outcomes among juvenile justice girls are lacking. The objective of this Stage II
      treatment trial is therefore to test the efficacy of a pre-existing, widely disseminated
      gender-responsive drug use treatment (VOICES) among 200 girls who are at-risk for or already
      involved with the justice system. We seek to test the effect of VOICES on girls' drug and
      alcohol use, HIV/STI risk, psychiatric symptoms and recidivism as well as explore moderators
      and mediators of outcomes. Girls and young women, ages 12-24 (N= 6 juveniles for Phase I
      Intervention Run-Through; N=200 for Phase II RCT study) will be recruited from justice
      partners (probation, diversion programs) and randomized to either the VOICES (active)
      intervention (n=100) or a Girl Health (attention control) condition (n=100). In Phase I
      (first six months of Year 1), 6 juveniles will be recruited to complete the Intervention
      Run-Through and research assessment once to allow testing of RCT intervention and assessment
      procedures prior to the RCT phase. In Phase II (last half of Year 1 through Year 4), 200
      girls will be recruited and randomized at baseline and then re-assessed at mid-treatment, end
      of treatment, and 3, 6, 9 and 12 month post-intervention follow-ups. Biological specimens for
      juvenile drug use will also be collected at each 3-month assessment. Efficacy trial results
      can be used to make immediate changes to current widespread program delivery resulting in
      direct impact on the field of evidence-based gender-responsive substance use interventions
      for juvenile justice girls and young women.
