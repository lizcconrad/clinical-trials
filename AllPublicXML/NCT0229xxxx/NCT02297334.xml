  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to prove that using a CytoSorb(TM) filter in the cardiopulmonary
      circuit attenuates the inflammatory response to extracorporeal circulation in patients
      undergoing cardiac surgery. The hypothesis is that removing cytokines from patients' blood by
      the CytoSorb device significantly improves circulation and outcome in patients undergoing
      on-pump cardiac surgery.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) induces an inflammatory response due to
      contact of patients' blood with foreign surfaces like tubes or the oxygenator,
      ischemic-reperfusion injury and surgical trauma. Inflammation is modulated by cytokines,
      especially, interleukins. The extent of cytokine release is further related to the duration
      of bypass and the amount of operating field suction. This results in a systemic inflammatory
      response syndrome (SIRS) with the risk of multiple organ dysfunction (MOD). Also in patients
      treated with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) an activation of the inflammation
      system is seen and accompanied with an increase of cytokine levels. The cytokine
      concentration correlates with the severity of the immune reaction and can be a predictor of
      the outcome of the patient. As severe SIRS and MOD significantly increase mortality, the
      attenuation of the inflammatory response is supposed to reduce morbidity and mortality after
      cardiac surgery.

      For adult cardiac surgery and patients who are treated with an extracorporal assist device, a
      tool for cytokine elimination and attenuation of the inflammatory response seems to be
      beneficial.

      In our study we are going to investigate if the use of the CytoSorb device can improve the
      outcome of patients undergoing elective coronar artery bypass and heart valve surgery.

    <description>Hemodynamic and respiratory parameters such as mean arterial pressure, heart rate and peripheral oxygen saturation are recorded. In addition thermodilution parameters (stroke volume variability, global end diastole volume, extravascular lung water index, cardiac index, systemic vascular resistance) are measured.

    <description>At the end of extracorporeal circulation a rotation thromboelastometry analysis is performed and the clotting time (CT), the clot formation time (CFT), the maximum clot firmness (MCF) in In- and Ex-Tem and the MCF in Fib-Tem are measured. Based on an institutional algorithm the coagulation therapy is performed according to the results of the thromboelastometry.</description>
