      Study to verify the efficacy and tolerability of Sinusitis Hevert SL tablets compared to
      placebo in adult patients with acute, uncomplicated rhinosinusitis (inflammation of the nasal
      and paranasal sinuses).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Acute rhinosinusitis is one of the most common diseases worldwide with a prevalence of 6-15%
      and a large impact on quality of life and socioeconomics. The majority of infections are of
      viral origin, while acute bacterial infection occurs in only 0.5-2% of cases. Currently
      available treatment includes a variety of remedies, like analgesic, inhalation with water
      steam of diluted drugs, nasal douche or spray, decongestant and mucolytic remedies as well as
      antibiotics.

      Sinusitis Hevert SL is registered since 2003 for the treatment of inflammation of the nose
      and throat region and the sinuses (sinusitis) and contains eleven homeopathic single
      substances which are classically used in homeopathy for this condition, but has not been
      evaluated in a randomized controlled clinical trial. In this multicenter, randomized,
      double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group phase IV study the efficacy and safety of
      Sinusitis Hevert SL tablets compared to placebo in adult patients with acute, uncomplicated
      rhinosinusitis shall be demonstrated.
