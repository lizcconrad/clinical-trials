  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Transsphenoidal surgery is the first-line treatment of acromegaly. Adjunctive radiotherapy
      can be necessary when surgery is ineffective to avoid a prolonged medical treatment. Several
      studies reported long-term extra-pituitary side-effects of conventional radiotherapy.
      However, none has evaluated potential side-effects induced by Gamma Knife radiosurgery, a
      highly precise stereotactic technique, that has been used as an effective treatment of
      acromegaly.

      Aims of the study: To determine potential long-term (superior to 10 years) extra-pituitary
      side-effects of Gamma Knife radiosurgery in patients treated for Acromegaly.

      Methods: Transversal exposed/unexposed study. Exposed patients have been treated by Gamma
      Knife Radiosurgery after unsuccessful surgery 10-20 years before inclusion, whereas unexposed
      patients have been treated by somatostatin analogs after unsuccessful surgery for at least 10
      years before inclusion. 80 Patients (40 patients/group) will be evaluated in terms of
      cognitive dysfunction, quality of life, secondary tumor, stroke, pituitary deficits and
      growth hormone control of hypersecretion. Recruitment is planned to last for 2 years.

      Expected results: We should be able to determine whether Gamma Knife radiosurgery is a
      long-term safe technique. This result might modify the management and follow-up of patients
      with acromegaly unsuccessfully treated by surgery.
