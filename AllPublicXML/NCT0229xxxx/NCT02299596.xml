  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will compare the outcome after surgery between a group of patients that receives
      instructions for prehabilitation training and one group that received standard treatment.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to investigate whether a training program with intensified physical
      activity prior to and after a surgical procedure reduces the surgical-related postoperative
      recovery time, hospital stay, sick leave and complication rate.

      A secondary aim is to investigate the effect of a training program with pre- and post-
      operative PA on the rate of resumption of QoL and normal physical function.

    <description>The intervention is prehabilitation preoperatively and physical training postoperatively. During the hospital stay both groups will be treated in the same manner.
Preoperative intervention:
One half hour of exercise daily added to the existing daily exercise routine. The level of exercise should produce shortness of breath but the patient should be able to talk without much effort.
Inspiratory muscle training. Thirty breaths x two twice daily. Postoperative intervention is mainly the same as preoperatively.</description>
