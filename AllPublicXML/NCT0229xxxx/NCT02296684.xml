  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this trial is to test the ability of MK-3475 (pembrolizumab) to improve
      locoregional recurrence and distant metastatic rates in high-risk patients with locally
      advanced head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCCs) that are treated with current
      standard of care surgical approaches.

    <description>MK-3475 will be given intravenously once approximately 2-3 weeks prior to standard of care surgery.
Adjuvant therapy will be dictated by surgical pathology and occurs after standard of care surgery and will consist of:
risk-based intensity modulated radiation therapy consisting of 60 Gy in 2 Gy once-daily fraction size (total of 30 fractions)once-daily fraction size (total of 30 fractions)
optional image-guided radiation therapy
risk-based cisplatin administered intravenously on Days 1, 22, and 43 of treatment course
MK-3475 will be given intravenously once every 3 weeks for a maximum of 6 doses if participant is considered high-risk based on 's surgical pathology from standard of care surgery shows high risk features (positive margins or extracapsular extension). These doses of MK-3475 will be given after surgery and after all acute toxicities of post-operative standard of care chemotherapy and radiation have resolved to grade 1 or less.</description>

             etc.) is not considered a form of systemic treatment.

          -  Has a history of (non-infectious) pneumonitis that required steroids or current
             pneumonitis.
