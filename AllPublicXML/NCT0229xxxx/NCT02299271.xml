      This study evaluates post-operative pain management and narcotic consumption in patients
      receiving a fascia iliaca block with local anesthetic versus patients receiving fascia iliaca
      block with saline for total hip arthroplasty.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Although many improvements have been made in implant technology and surgical approaches for
      total hip arthroplasty, management of post-operative pain remains a major clinical issue.
      Inadequate pain control can lead to numerous unwanted side effects and limited physical
      function, especially in a older population. Most surgeons have adopted a multi-modality pain
      management approach using a variety of pharmaceuticals, including nerve block with local
      anesthetic. In the literature, there are a number of technical variations described for the
      fascia iliaca nerve block. At The Christ Hospital, Cincinnati, Ohio, anesthesiologists use a
      more proximal approach to the fasica iliaca block enabling a significantly easier cephalad
      spread of the local anesthetic into the pelvis targeting all three nerves; the femoral,
      lateral femoral cutaneous, and the obturator.

      This prospective, double-blinded, randomized, single-center study is designed to test the
      primary hypothesis that fascia iliaca block with a local anesthestic decreases narcotic
      consumption and provides improved pain control compared to placebo in the first 24 hours
      after surgery in patients undergoing total hip arthroplasty.
