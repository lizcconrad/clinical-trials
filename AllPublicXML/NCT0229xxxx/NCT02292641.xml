  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In the UK approximately 28,000 patients per year are diagnosed with bowel cancer. Further
      15-20% develop pelvic recurrence. In a significant proportion of patients (15-20%), tumour
      extends beyond what the surgeon can routinely remove and requires more extensive
      (exenterative) surgery to achieve successful removal of the tumour. Currently MRI is used for
      the assessment of the pelvic tumour and PET/CT is used in order to prove that there is no
      extrapelvic disease, for the selection of patients who will undergo such a complex surgery.
      The investigators have previously shown, with a single centre retrospective analysis, that
      using a specific staging system for these tumours it is possible to predict both the
      likelihood of surgical success and overall survival outcomes. Until today there are no
      national guidelines for this group of patients.

      The investigators want to test whether standardizing the assessment of these advanced tumours
      will help to improve outcomes for patients and better surgical planning. The investigators
      also want to show that the information from the scans gives valuable data regarding the long
      term outcomes and likelihood of surgical success.

      This is a multicentre prospective trial of patients, who require more extensive surgery,
      using the staging classification. The high resolution MRI scans that patients undergo before
      surgery will be reported using the previously validated system.

      It is hoped that the study will result in a better and standarised method of assessing
      advanced pelvic cancer, with the intent to improve the surgical planning and overall patient
      management, which may increase the possibility of surgical curative resection.

      Currently there are no validated criteria or guidelines for judging whether advanced primary
      or recurrent colorectal cancer can be successfully removed and for selecting which patients
      should undergo this form of more radical surgery as is exenterative surgery. We are proposing
      that by validating the detailed evaluation of imaging of the tumour distribution within the
      pelvis, this will enable clear selection criteria to be established and will improve surgical
      planning. This will result in an overall improvement in curative surgery which is currently
      only 67% at best in global series. Furthermore, overall 3 year cancer specific survival for
      patients undergoing this form of surgery without detailed MRI planning is only 35%. Incorrect
      preoperative staging and planning can result in patients undergoing unnecessary surgery (up
      to 40%) or being refused a potentially curative operation in 17% of the cases.

      The design of the study is to be able to show that we have diagnostic accuracy with the use
      of the proposed staging system. The staging system will be validated against survival
      outcomes, also taking account of surgical morbidity outcomes and Quality Of Life measures.

      The primary endpoint is to demonstrate a histopathological complete resection with clear
      margin rate (R0) of &gt;greater than 67% (that is documented in the current literature) can be
      achieved using MRI compartmental classification planned exenterative surgery.
