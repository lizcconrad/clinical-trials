  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The feasibility of Sayana Press self-injection and the potential for this practice to
      increase contraceptive continuation has never been assessed in family planning programs in
      low-resource settings. The Malawi Ministry of Health (MOH) and the United States Agency for
      International Development (USAID) Malawi Mission requested the Advancing Partners and
      Communities (APC) project to assess self-injection of Sayana Press to inform their
      decision-making for procurement of Sayana Press and distribution through the health system in
      Malawi.

      Sayana速 Press is a subcutaneous formulation of depot medroxyprogesterone acetate (DMPA) in a
      prefilled, auto-disabled injection system called Uniject (Pfizer, Inc., USA). Sayana Press
      was registered with the Medicines and Health Care Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) and
      several other national regulatory agencies. The addition of this method is anticipated to aid
      in improving provision of family planning services in low-resource settings. As such, Sayana
      Press could be particularly useful in a country such as Malawi where injectable contraception
      is the most common method used. DMPA clients and providers are ready to explore the potential
      of self-injection of Sayana Press. A study conducted in a large family planning clinic in
      Edinburgh, Scotland found self-administration of DMPA-SC feasible and associated with similar
      continuation rates and satisfaction to clinician-administered DMPA-IM. A non-comparison study
      conducted in Planned Parenthood clinics in Florida found continuation of self-injected
      DMPA-SC high (74%) at the fourth injection. Participants in this study reported the injection
      to be easy and convenient and were likely to recommend self-administration to other women.
      Moreover, on September 29, 2014 Pfizer submitted a request to the MHRA to change the Sayana
      Press label to include self-injection.

      If self-injection is found feasible, the results from this research will inform
      self-injection training materials, messages for providers and clients, and future scale-up
      efforts in Malawi and elsewhere in sub-Saharan Africa.
