    <textblock>
      The investigators of this study plan to investigate the feasibility and efficacy of repeated
      doses of intranasal ketamine in severely depressed patients who are at least 65 years of age
      and experiencing suicidal ideation. The results of the study could lead to development of new
      strategies for treating depression.
