    <textblock>
      This is an open labeled, multiple centers, two countries (Taiwan and Korea) non-comparative
      phase I/II trial in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma. In phase I part, a maximum of 33
      patients will be recruited in this study. By utilizing a Simon optimal two-stage design, up
      to 69 patients will be enrolled into this study, while considering the 20% drop-out rate, in
      order to target 19 response-evaluable patients for the first stage and additional 36
      response-evaluable patients for the second stage in phase II part study.

      After screening, each eligible patient will undergo a treatment of OBP-301 within 14 days and
      will automatically enter follow-up period.

      The follow-up period is up to 12 weeks after the last injection in the phase I part, and 24
      weeks after the last injection in the phase II part.

      Each patient will return for follow-up visit weekly in the first month after the last
      injection, and then every 4 weeks up to the end of follow-up period of each phase.

    <description>In phase I part, a range of dose levels is investigated and the starting dose is 1x1010 VP/tumor. Dose administration will be conducted through a dose-escalating scheme from 1x1010 VP/tumor to 1x1011 VP/tumor, 1x1012 VP/tumor, 3x1011 VP/tumor and 3x1012 VP/tumor.
After assessing the clinical safety profiles by escalating doses of OBP-301 in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma, the phase II study to determine the response rate will be performed.</description>
