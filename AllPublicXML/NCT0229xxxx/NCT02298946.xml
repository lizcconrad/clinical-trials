  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:

      - T-cells are white blood cells that can find and kill germs and tumors. Cancer can keep
      T-cells from working. Researchers think a new drug called AMP-224 might help the T-cells in
      people with cancer. They think the drug might work even better when combined with a certain
      type of radiation therapy.

      Objective:

      - To study the safety and effectiveness of AMP-224 together with 1 or 3 days of stereotactic
      body radiation therapy (SBRT) directed to the liver.

      Eligibility:

      - People age 18 and older with metastatic colorectal cancer. Their cancer must have spread to
      the liver and not be responding to treatment.

      Design:

        -  Participants will be screened with a medical history, physical exam, and blood and urine
           tests. Their tumors will be measured with computerized tomography (CT) scans or magnetic
           resonance imaging (MRI) of the chest, stomach, and pelvis. They will have an
           electrocardiogram (ECG) heart test.

        -  Participants will have a small part of their tumor removed by needle (biopsy).

        -  Participants will have 8 study visits over about 10 weeks.

        -  At 1 visit, they will have another tumor biopsy.

        -  At 1 visit, they will get a chemotherapy drug through a vein (IV).

        -  At 6 visits, they will receive AMP-224 through an IV.

        -  At 1 or 3 visits, they will have SBRT. CT scans will map the position of their tumor.
           Radiation beams of different intensities at different angles will be directed to the
           tumor.

        -  At all visits, some screening procedures may be repeated.

        -  After treatment ends, participants will have 7 follow-up visits over about 5 months.
           Blood will be drawn. Some screening procedures may be repeated.

      Background:

        -  Colorectal cancer remains the second leading cause of cancer death in western countries
           with a median survival of approximately 24 months despite recent advances in systemic
           treatment.

        -  Several preclinical studies have documented an increase in peripheral antitumor immunity
           following radiation, a phenomenon known as the abscopal effect . Tumor PDL1 expression
           has also been shown to be induced by radiation, which can suppress the anti-tumor immune
           response. Inhibition of PD-1/PDL-1 axis has been shown to improve anti-tumor immunity by
           blocking the tumor-mediated suppression of cytotoxic T cells.

        -  AMP-224, a B7-DC Fc fusion protein, binds to PD-1, an inhibitory receptor that is
           present on the cell surface of exhausted, activated, effector, and memory T cells. AMP-
           224 has a unique mechanism of action in that it binds specifically to PD-1HI T cells
           (chronically stimulated / exhausted T cells) but not to PD-1LO cells which represent the
           normal activated T cells population

        -  The aim of the study is to evaluate whether the anti-tumor immunity of anti-PD1 therapy
           (with AMP-224) can be enhanced by radiation therapy.

      Objectives:

      - To assess safety, tolerability and feasibility of AMP-224 in combination with stereotactic
      body radiation therapy (SBRT) in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer.

      Eligibility:

        -  Histologically confirmed metastatic colorectal cancer.

        -  Patient must have progressed on or been intolerant of prior oxaliplatin- and
           irinotecancontaining regimen and have metastatic lesions that are not amenable to
           curative resection.

        -  Patient must have one focus of metastatic disease in the liver that is amenable to SBRT.

        -  Patient must have at least one measurable metastatic lesion by RECIST 1.1 criteria
           outside the radiation field.

        -  Patients must be willing to undergo mandatory pre and post treatment tumor biopsy.

      Design:

        -  This is a pilot study whereby all patients will receive SBRT to one liver lesion and
           concomitant AMP-224. A single treatment of low dose/cyclophosphamide will be
           administered in conjunction with the SBRT therapy prior to the first AMP-224 treatment.

        -  Hypofractionated radiation will be administered to a metastatic disease site at a dose
           and schedule of 8Gy for 1 or 3 days in dose levels (DL)1 or 2 respectively. The day of
           first administration of AMP-224 will be designated as Day 1. In DL1 the SBRT will be
           administered on Day 0. In DL2 the SBRT will be administered from D-2 to D0. The study
           will begin with DL1 and escalate to DL2 once all subjects enrolled at DL1 have remained
           on study for 4 weeks, which is the DLT period.

        -  AMP-224 therapy will be given as an intravenous infusion beginning on Day 1 and then
           every 14 days for a total of 6 treatments only. Optional continuation of treatment q2-
           weekly until PD will be considered in responding patients.

        -  Cyclophosphamide 200 mg/m2 intravenous will be given on Day 0, prior to the first dose
           of AMP-224.

        -  Correlative studies: Peripheral blood will be collected (pre-dose) on days 1, 29, 57 and
           93 for immune studies (including immunogenicity, circulating PD plasma samples,
           immunemonitoring for phenotyping and PBMC for T-cell activation). Tumor biopsies (FFPE +
           Frozen) of an irradiated and non-irradiated liver lesion will be collected on day 1 and
           day 29, which will be analyzed by immunohistochemistry for tumor-infiltrating
           lymphocytes in addition to RNA analysis.

        -  PK samples will be collected on Days 1, 15, 29, 43, 57, 71 in addition to up to 5 post
           treatment dates (if feasible).

             of the cervix and non-invasive bladder cancer that has had successful curative
             treatment).

         12. Patient must be able to understand and willing to sign a written informed consent
             document.

        Exclusion Criteria

             prior to entering the study.

          3. Patients with known brain metastases will be excluded from this clinical trial because
             of their poor prognosis and because they often develop progressive neurologic
             dysfunction that would confound the evaluation of neurologic and other adverse events.

          4. Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, hypertension
             (systolic BP greater than 160, diastolic BP greater than 100), ongoing or active

             cardiac arrhythmia, uncontrolled diabetes or psychiatric illness/social situations
             that would limit compliance with study requirements.

          5. HIV-positive patients receiving anti-retroviral therapy are excluded from this study
             due to the possibility of pharmacokinetic interactions between antiretroviral
             medications and the investigational agent.

             randomization. Note: Active vitiligo or a history of vitiligo will not be a basis for
             exclusion. In addition, a past history of certain automimmunity eg rheumatoid
             arthritis or thyroiditis may be allowed per PI discretion provided it has been
             quiescent for a minimum of three years.

          7. Active or history of inflammatory bowel disease (colitis, Crohn s), irritable bowel
             disease, celiac disease, or other serious, chronic, gastrointestinal conditions
             associated with diarrhea.

          8. Dementia or significantly altered mental status that would prohibit the understanding
             or rendering of Information and Consent and compliance with the requirements of the
             protocol.

          9. Currently receiving immunosuppressive doses of steroids or other immunosuppressive

             developing human fetus are unknown. Enrolled patients must agree to use adequate
             contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study
             entry, the duration of study participation and 3 months after the end of the
             treatment. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while she or her
             partner is participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician
             immediately.

         13. Patients with unhealed surgical wounds for more than 30 days.
