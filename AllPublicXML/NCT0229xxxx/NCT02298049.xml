  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To our knowledge no study has assessed the effects of a meal on neural responses to food cues
      and compared this with a condition simulating natural inter-meal hunger levels. This is
      important, as the existing literature often compares the effect of fasting to satiation,
      which may not reflect typical appetite processes. Thus, the purpose of this research was to
      examine the effect of a satiating lunch compared to a normal pre-meal state on blood oxygen
      level dependent (BOLD) activity in the human brain, as measured using functional magnetic
      resonance imaging (fMRI).

      We hypothesized that satiation would be associated with decreased brain activity across brain
      regions involved in both appetite and reward such as ventromedial prefrontal cortex,
      orbitofrontal cortex, ventral striatum, hypothalamus, insula, amygdala and hippocampus. 16
      healthy participants (8 males) were scanned on two separate test days, before and after
      eating a meal to satiation, or after not eating for 4 hours (satiated vs. pre-meal). fMRI
      BOLD signals to the sight and/or taste of the stimuli were recorded. Participants were given
      questionnaires to complete about their mood state and appetite before and after all scans.
