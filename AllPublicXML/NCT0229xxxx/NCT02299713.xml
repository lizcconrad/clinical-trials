    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the efficacy of electroacupuncture (EA) on pain
      control, perception of pain, plasma cortisol and beta-endorphins levels, patient-perceived
      quality of life and use of pain medications, in people with chronic knee pain.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Previous randomised trials and meta-analyses have shown certain efficacy of acupuncture in
      some chronic painful conditions, in spite of methodological weaknesses. The
      hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis and the endogenous opioid (EO) system are the
      mechanisms appear to explain how acupuncture works in part. These systems have been shown to
      be important mediators of stress, pain and other stimuli. The Osteoarthritis Research
      International suggest that osteoarthritis (OA) treatment should be multidisciplinary and
      recommended acupuncture as one of 12 possible non-pharmacological modalities for treating OA.

      This study is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, parallel design. 128
      out-patients over 50 years with OA of the knee will be recruited from Mallorca, Spain.
      Participants will be randomly allocated into two groups: placebo/sham acupuncture, non
      insertion technique, and EA. Acupuncture treatments will be used the Traditional Chinese
      Medicine (TCM) style. The patients will be evaluated after a period of one month (2 sessions
      weekly), three months (1session monthly), six months (1 session every 45 days) and again one
      year later (1 session every 2 months), at the end of the study.

    <description>There are different types of controls used in acupuncture trials. We used the control described as sham and by some as minimal acupuncture. This group had the same schedule as the electro-acupuncture group. Sham acupuncture was administered, with the same duration and frequency and by the same specialist who performed the non-sham acupuncture. Retractable needles were placed into small adhesive cylinders, so that the needles were supported but did not perforate the skin. The acupuncturist placed the needles at the same points as the non-sham group and used the same pairs of electrodes to simulate the electrical connection.</description>

    <description>The electro-acupuncture device was a biphasic pulse generator. It was used with maximum tolerable intensity of current and a frequency of 3 Hz. The points were selected according to the Traditional Chinese Medicine meridian theory to treat knee pain. The points selected were local points St 34, St 35, St 36,Liv 8, Sp 10. One distal point St 44.A total of six needles were inserted into each leg by the acupuncturist (the out come measures were not specifically targeted to whether the patient had one or both knees involved). All patients belonging to this group experienced a De Qi sensation, which is a tingling and numbness sensation upon needling of specific points.</description>

    <intervention_name>Electroacupuncture</intervention_name>
    <description>Electro acupuncture is a relatively new method of treatment in Chinese Medicine. Just as in a regular acupuncture treatment, needles are inserted into acupuncture points but small crocodile clips are then attached to the ends of needles to connect them to an electro-acupuncture device. In traditional acupuncture the inserted needles are manually vibrated to induce a response whilst in electro-acupuncture the bi-phasic current results in a constant (controlled) vibration of the needles and a direct electrical stimulation. The device allows the practitioner to adjust the frequency and intensity of the electric stimulation in a consistent manner which is not operator dependant.</description>
