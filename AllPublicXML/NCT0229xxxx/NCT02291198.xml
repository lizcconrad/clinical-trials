  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will look at measuring the activity of natural killer (NK) cells using the in
      vitro diagnostic device NK Vue in subjects being screened for colorectal cancer using
      colonoscopy. The NK Vue diagnostic test for natural killer cell activity uses the principle
      of stimulation of whole blood with a proprietary cytokine followed by the quantitative
      detection of interferon gamma using an immunoassay. NK Vue is intended to be used for the
      monitoring of the immune status of individuals. Measurement of NK cell activity could be a
      useful tool for assessing changes in immunosurveillance in patients with conditions or
      diseases where NK cell activity has been shown to be reduced, such as colorectal cancer.

    <description>Measurement of NK cell activity in subjects with cancer-negative colonoscopies versus those with pathologically confirmed colorectal cancer.
Correlation of NK cell activity with polyp size, with type of adenomatous polyp and with cancer stage; measurement of the sensitivity and specificity of NK Vue; determination of the positive predictive value of NK Vue alone or in combination with the fecal immunochemical test in those subjects positive for adenomatous polyps or cancer; determination of the impact of performing both NK Vue and the fecal test on the sensitivity of the fecal test.</description>
