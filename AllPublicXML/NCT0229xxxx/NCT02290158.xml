      This study evaluates the effects of a finishing protocol in orthodontic outcomes using
      ABO-OGS scores. Patients who finish orthodontic treatment and fulfill the inclusion and
      exclusion criteria receive a treatment using a finishing protocol and their scores are
      compare with 40 patients who don't receive a finishing protocol

    <textblock>
      The phase of finishing is the most demanding and detailed of all phases of the orthodontic
      treatment. American Board of Orthodontics- Objective Grading system is a detailed and
      objective method that evaluates the quality of the final outcome of orthodontic treatment. In
      order to evaluate and compare the effects of a protocol implementation on the ABO-OGS scores,
      standardize cast models and Pan X-Ray from by convenience patients of Orthodontic
      Postgraduate Program of University of Antioquia who finish orthodontic treatment and receive
      the protocol are digitized, eight variables are evaluate and ABO-OGS score is calculate. A
      comparison with 40 no-protocol ABO-OGS scores by convenience-selected patients is done. The
      protocol includes an educate residents program about finishing problems , an standardized
      clinical and X-ray assessment , brackets reposition and frequent clinical evaluation. The
      percentage of the protocol implementation is calculate in every patient and reliability test
      is make . The descriptive analysis and the ABO-OGS score comparison is done by Pearson or
      Spearman correlation.
