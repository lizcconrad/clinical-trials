        <title>Number of Participants With Protocol Defined Hypoglycaemic Adverse Events (HAEs)</title>
        <description>A hypoglycemic event (HAE) was identified by characteristic symptoms or blood glucose levels. HAE was defined as 1 of the given definitions: 1) Characteristic symptoms of HAE with no home glucose monitoring performed where clinical picture included prompt resolution with food intake, subcutaneous glucagon, or intravenous glucose; 2) Characteristic symptoms of HAE with home glucose monitoring measurement of less than or equal to (=&lt;) 70 milligram per deciliter (mg/dL) using sponsor-provided, plasma-referenced, home glucometers (or central laboratory); 3) any glucose value =&lt;49 mg/dL using sponsor-provided, plasma-referenced, home glucometers (or central laboratory) with or without accompanying symptoms.</description>

        <title>Terminal Half-Life (t1/2) on Day 7 for PF-06455349</title>
        <description>Terminal half-life is the time measured for the plasma concentration to decrease by one half. Terminal half-life is calculated by dividing the natural logarithm to the base e (Log e) * 2/k el, where ‘k el’ is the terminal phase rate constant calculated by a linear regression of the log-linear concentration-time curve. Only those data points judged to describe the terminal log-linear decline were used in the regression. PF-06455349 is a metabolite of PF-04937319.</description>
