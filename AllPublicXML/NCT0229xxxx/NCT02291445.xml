  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a pilot study to compare the relative bioavailability between two peppermint oil
      formulations, namely a colon-targeted-delivery capsule (Tempocol-ColoPulse®) and an
      enteric-coated capsule (Tempocol®). This study is conducted as part of a future multicenter
      randomized controlled trial that will assess the therapeutic effect of the new peppermint oil
      formulation in IBS patients.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Rationale: Peppermint oil has shown to be effective in the treatment of IBS symptoms in
      several meta-analyses. However, the level of evidence is moderate and peppermint oil remains
      relatively under-used in IBS. Therefore the investigators plan to conduct a multicenter
      randomized controlled trial to investigate the possible beneficial effects of peppermint oil
      in IBS. To improve efficacy and to reduce side effects, the investigators aim to study the
      use of a new peppermint oil formulation (Tempocol-ColoPulse®) that will slowly release the
      oil in the (ileo-) colonic region specifically. In order to demonstrate differences in
      pharmacokinetics, the subsidizing party, ZonMW, requested an additional pilot study
      (described in the present protocol) in which the investigators will investigate surrogate
      markers for local colon bioavailability, tolerability and side effects of the new
      Tempocol-ColoPulse®.

      Study design: a randomized, double blind, two-period, two-treatment crossover study with a
      wash out period of at least 14 days.

      Intervention: All study volunteers will receive a single dose of 182mg of both
      Tempocol-ColoPulse® and Tempocol®, each on a different test day.

      Nature and extent of the burden and risks associated with participation, benefit and group
      relatedness: Subjects may be confronted with certain inconveniences and minor risks. They are
      required to visit the MUMC+ 5 times, once for the screening and two times per test day for
      various non-invasive measurements (questionnaires, blood pressure and heart-rate measurement,
      urine and fecal sampling, pregnancy test in women in fertile ages, general physical exam) as
      well as for minor invasive venous blood sampling, after which a small haematoma can occur.
      Total time investment is +/- 30 hours, subjects will not benefit from participation.
