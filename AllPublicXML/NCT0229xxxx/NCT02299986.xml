      'Ventilator-Induced Diaphragmatic Dysfunction (VIDD) was originally described by
      Vassilakopoulos and Petrof in 1998, where it is used to cover the effects of mechanical
      ventilation and respiratory muscle unloading on the diaphragm. A recent article by Grosu and
      colleagues has demonstrated that the thickness of the diaphragm decreases with about 6% a day
      in a small cohort of mechanically ventilated patients. This is a longitudinal, single-centre,
      observational cohort study to examine the long-term effects of invasive mechanical
      ventilation on the diaphragm, and to study the risk factors associated with VIDD.

        All patients that are admitted in ICU and who require mechanical ventilation will be
        screened for inclusion, and participants will be enrolled after informed consent. The study
        population will be a mixed medical/surgical cohort, selected with non-probability sampling
        because of the different eligibility criteria.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  The patient must suffer from respiratory insufficiency requiring mechanical
             ventilation

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  The patient has been hospitalized and mechanically ventilated (invasive or non-
             invasive) in the period up to 1 year before start of the study.

          -  The patient is known or suspected to have an anatomical malformation of the diaphragm.

          -  The patient suffers from a disease that may impair diaphragmatic function:

               -  Central neural disease at the level of the brain (Multiple sclerosis, stroke,
                  Arnold-Chiari malformation) and spinal cord (quadriplegia, amyotrophic lateral
                  sclerosis, poliomyelitis, spinal muscular atrophy, syringomyelia).

               -  Neural disease of the phrenic nerve (Guillain-Barr√© syndrome, tumor compression,
                  neuralgic neuropathy, chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy,
                  Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease).

               -  Disorders of the neuromuscular junction (Myasthenia gravis, Lambert- Eaton
                  syndrome, botulism, organophosphate poisoning).

               -  Muscular diseases (muscular dystrophies, myositis (infectious, inflammatory,
                  metabolic).

          -  The patient is known or suspected to have a psychiatric illness inhibiting his/her
             cooperation with the study protocol or possibly obscuring the obtained results.

          -  The patient has been mechanically ventilated for over 24 hours before the first
             ultrasonographic measurement can be performed.
