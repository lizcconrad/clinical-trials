  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In recent years, studies have brought knowledge of the difficulties of social cognition in
      Multiple Sclerosis (MS). The brain tissue alteration at the origin of these difficulties in
      social cognition mechanisms remain poorly understood. Although recent behavioral studies
      indicated social disturbances in many of these patients, functional studies investigating
      specific theory of mind in MS are lacking. The use of new techniques for morphological and
      functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) can identify brain activation networks, mapping
      the achievement and tissue integrity may be related to disorders of social cognition and
      cognitive. The investigators propose to study social cognition in MS patients using
      morphological and functional imaging to determine the mechanisms underlying phenomena such as
      cerebral compensation and its relationship with cognitive impairment.
