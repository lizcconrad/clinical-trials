      Patients with history of a food allergy to hazelnut, walnut or celeriac will undergo food
      provocation with a dose of the allergenic food to which 5% of the respective food allergic
      population (ED05) has been calculated to respond with allergic reactions (single shot study).

      In patients with a hazelnut or peanut allergy a double-blind placebo controlled food
      challenge with cookies containing either placebo or hazelnut and peanut respectively will be
      performed to determine threshold levels eliciting an allergic reaction. The results for
      threshold levels determined by cookie matrix will be compared to the results gained from the
      EuroPrevall project (matrix comparison study).

      In patients with a walnut allergy double-blind placebo controlled provocation with walnut
      will be combined with the intake of proton pump inhibitor (PPI) or with placebo to assess the
      impact of PPI on the threshold level and on the clinical manifestation.

      single shot study, matrix comparison and walnut/PPI study

        1. detailed case history, blood sampling and prick testing with different foods will
           performed.

        2. food provocation with a chocolate dessert meal containing either hazelnut, walnut or
           celeriac (ED05) will be performed (single shot study) in patients with a positive case
           history of an allergic reaction to either hazelnut, walnut or celeriac or with two meals
           containing either placebo or hazelnut and peanut respectively in hazelnut and peanut
           allergic patients or with three meals containing either placebo or walnut in walnut
           allergic patients.

        3. in patients with a negative single shot challenge an open provocation with native
           hazelnut, walnut, celeriac will be performed unless the patients do not have had a
           positive previous food provocation with the respective food. In patients with a negative
           double-blind placebo-controlled food challenge an open provocation with hazelnut or
           peanut or walnut will be performed to confirm tolerance.
