  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective is to determine if data from the National Insurance Health card (giving
      antibiotics and hospitalizations in the past 18 months) allow to predict the individual risk
      of antibiotic resistance and to identify population groups for which probabilistic
      antibiotics regimen of urinary tract infection could be simplified
