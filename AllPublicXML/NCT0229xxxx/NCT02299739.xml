      Herb-induced liver injury is an important issue in musculoskeletal diseases where herbal
      medicine is most frequently used. The low prevalence of drug-induced liver injury (DILI)
      gives rise to the need for large-scale patient studies. We assessed the prevalence of liver
      injury of 6,894 musculoskeletal disease inpatients taking herbal medicine.

      Herb-induced liver injury is an important issue in musculoskeletal diseases where herbal
      medicine is most frequently used. The low prevalence of drug-induced liver injury (DILI)
      gives rise to the need for large-scale patient studies. The objective of this study is to
      report on the incidence of liver injury from herbal medicine in musculoskeletal disease
      patients as large-scale studies are scarce.

      Of 32,675 inpatients taking herbal medicine at 7 locations of a Korean medicine hospital
      between 2005 and 2013, we screened for liver injury in 6,894 patients with liver function
      tests (LFTs) at admission and discharge. LFTs included t-bilirubin, AST, ALT, and ALP. We
      assessed for risk factors for liver injury at discharge.

      Participants received the most frequently used complementary and alternative medicine
      treatment contents (herbal medicine, acupuncture, pharmacopuncture, bee venom
      pharmacopuncture, and Chuna manipulation) administered to musculoskeletal disease patients at
      this hospital.

    <description>Herbal medicine was taken 3 times daily in dried powder (2g) and water-base decoction form (120ml) (Ostericum koreanum, Eucommia ulmoides, Acanthopanax sessiliflorus, Achyranthes bidentata, Psoralea corylifolia, Peucedanum japonicum, Cibotium barometz, Lycium chinense, Boschniakia rossica, Cuscuta chinensis, and Atractylodes japonica).</description>

    <intervention_type>Procedure</intervention_type>
    <intervention_name>Pharmacopuncture</intervention_name>
    <description>Select ingredients similar to those included in the oral herbal medicine (Ostericum koreanum, Eucommia ulmoides, Acanthopanax Sessiliflorus, Achyranthes bidentata, Psoralea corylifolia, Peucedanum japonicum, Cibotium barometz, Lycium chinense, Boschniakia rossica, Cuscuta chinensis, and Atractylodes japonica) were freeze dried into powder form after decoction, then diluted in normal saline and adjusted for acidity and pH to be used in injections. The pharmacopuncture injections were injected once daily to the amount of 1 cc and Ah-shi points and local acupuncture points (CPL, 1 cc, 26G x 1.5 syringe, Shinchang medical co., Korea).</description>

    <intervention_name>Bee venom pharmacopuncture</intervention_name>
    <description>Bee venom pharmacopuncture was applied after confirming a negative reaction to the hypersensitivity skin test. Diluted bee venom (saline:bee venom ratio, 10,000:1) was injected at 4-5 acupoints at the physician's discretion. Each acupuncture point was injected with approximately 0.2 cc to a total of 0.5-1 cc using disposable injection needles (CPL, 1 cc, 26G x 1.5 syringe, Shinchang medical co., Korea).</description>

    <intervention_name>Chuna manipulation</intervention_name>
    <description>Chuna was administered 3-5 times a week. Chuna is a Korean version of spinal manipulation that incorporates conventional spinal manipulation techniques for mobilization involving high-velocity, low amplitude thrusts to joints slightly beyond the passive range of motion and gentle force to joints within the passive range of movement.</description>
