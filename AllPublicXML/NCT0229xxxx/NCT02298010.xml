      The pattern of lymph node metastasis of the gastric cancer to each geographic lymph nose
      stations and the relation between each metastasis and survival are to be analyzed by
      retrospective review of medical records of who enrolled in the CLASSIC trial (NCT00411229)
      which have compared adjuvant chemotherapy and no adjuvant therapy after radical gastrectomy
      with extended lymphadenectomy.

        Criteria of previous CLASSIC trial:

        Inclusion Criteria:

        To be eligible for inclusion, each patient must fulfill each of the following criteria:

          -  Ambulatory males or females, aged ≥18 years.

          -  Karnofsky performance status of ≥70 %.

          -  Histologically confirmed gastric adenocarcinoma, staged pathologically, AJCC/UICC
             stage II (T2N1, T1N2, T3N0), IIIa (T3N1, T2N2, T4N0), and IIIb (T3N2). At least 15
             examined lymph nodes are required to ensure the adequate TNM classification)

          -  Patients who underwent curative D2 lymphadenectomy resection for gastric cancer with
             no macroscopic or microscopic evidence for remaining tumor, who can be randomized to
             either study arm within 6 weeks after surgery.

          -  Give written informed consent prior to study specific screening procedures, with the
             understanding that the patient has the right to withdraw from the study at any time,
             without prejudice.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Patients who fulfill any of the following criteria will be excluded:

          -  Serious concomitant medical illnesses that would limit life expectancy to &lt; 5 years.

          -  Pregnant or lactating women.

          -  Women of childbearing potential with either a positive or no pregnancy test at
             baseline. Postmenopausal women must have been amenorrheic for at least 12 months to be
             considered of non-child bearing potential.

          -  Sexually active males and females (of childbearing potential) unwilling to practice
             contraception during the study.

          -  Any evidence of metastatic disease (including presence of tumor cells in the ascites).

          -  Previous cytotoxic chemotherapy, radiotherapy or immunotherapy except corticosteroids,
             for the currently treated gastric cancer.

          -  History of another malignancy within the last five years except cured basal cell
             carcinoma of skin and cured carcinoma in-situ of uterine cervix.

          -  History of uncontrolled seizures, central nervous system disorders or psychiatric
             disability judged by the Investigator to be clinically significant precluding informed
             consent or interfering with compliance for oral drug intake.

          -  Clinically significant (i.e. active) cardiac disease e.g. symptomatic coronary artery
             disease, New York Heart Association (NYHA) grade II or greater congestive heart

             take oral medication.

          -  Known peripheral neuropathy ≥ CTCAEv3 grade 1. Absence of deep tendon reflexes (DTRs)
             as the sole neurologic abnormality does not render the patient ineligible.

          -  Organ allografts requiring immunosuppressive therapy.

          -  Serious uncontrolled intercurrent infections or other serious uncontrolled concomitant
             disease.-

          -  Moderate or severe renal impairment [creatinine clearance equal to or below 50 ml/min
             (calculated according to Cockroft and Gault)], or serum creatinine &gt; 1.5 x upper limit
             of normal (ULN).

          -  Any of the following laboratory values:

          -  Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) &lt; 1.5 x 10^9/L

          -  Platelet count &lt; 100 x 10^9/L

          -  Total bilirubin &gt; 1.5 x ULN

          -  ALAT, ASAT &gt; 2.5 x ULN

          -  Alkaline phosphatase &gt; 2.5 x ULN.

          -  Prior unanticipated severe reaction to fluoropyrimidine therapy (with or without
             documented DPD deficiency) or patients with Kknown dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase
             (DPD) deficiency.

          -  Hypersensitivity to platinum compounds or any of the components of the study
             medications.

          -  Received any investigational drug or agent/procedure, i.e. participation in another
             trial, within 4 weeks before randomization.

          -  Blood transfusions or growth factors to aid hematologic recovery within 2 weeks prior
             to study treatment start.

          -  Requirement for concurrent use of the antiviral agent sorivudine (antiviral) or
             chemically related analogues, such as brivudine.

          -  Unwilling or unable to comply with the protocol for the duration of the study.
