      Collection of already existing data and images for patients &lt; 2 years of age having
      MultiHance administration for a MRI of the brain or spine. MR Images will be reviewed during
      a prospectively designed blinded reading of the images.

          -  Has available demographic and safety data

          -  Has documented known or highly suspected enhancing disease of the CNS (brain/spine)

             MULTIHANCE contrast agent

          -  Has both pre and post dose T1 SE/FSE and/or GRE and T2 SE/FSE, and FLAIR MR images
