  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Primary hyperhidrosis is a pathological condition characterized by the idiopathic and
      excessive secretion of sweat beyond normal physiological demand and is localized at
      particular foci such as the face, axilla, palms of the hands, and soles of the feet. Patients
      seeking medical attention for hyperhidrosis often report disruptions to their professional
      and/or social lives due to sweating and subsequently experience many psychosocial
      difficulties, such as anxiety, social phobia, and depression. Therefore, a psychiatric
      explanation of causality is frequently offered for these patients during diagnosis. Excessive
      sweating is often mistakenly interpreted as a symptom of an anxiety disorder and can be cause
      for social embarrassment, exacerbating emotional stress and social avoidance. As currently
      constituted, the treatment of secondary psychosocial symptoms in primary hyperhidrosis is
      poorly understood and requires further investigation.

      Primary Objective:

        1. To evaluate the effectiveness of the miraDry ® treatment system for psychosocial
           functioning in patients heavily affected by axillary hyperhidrosis.

           Secondary Objectives:

        2. To characterize the outcomes of and clinical response to the MiraDry ® treatment system
           with respect to the aforementioned criteria.

        3. To compare the results of non-invasive miraDry ® treatment system to the existing
           surgical correction with respect to the aforementioned criteria.

    <description>To evaluate the effectiveness of the miraDry ® treatment system for psychosocial functioning in patients heavily affected by axillary hyperhidrosis. Patients will be asked to complete the Hyperhidrosis Disease Severity Scale (HDSS) as a prescreening survey. The HDSS (below) is a diagnostic tool that qualitatively measures (Likert scaled 1-4) disease-specific severity of the patient's condition based on the degree to which daily activities are impacted. This will be done at baseline, during treatment, at the 6 month follow-up visit, and 1 year follow-up visit.</description>

    <description>MiraDry ® is the trademarked name of a non-invasive thermolytic technology which utilizes a microwave energy-based mechanism targeted for eccrine gland reduction at the dermal-fat interface.
Each participant will be scheduled two MiraDry ® treatment appointments approximately three months apart.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

        This study will recruit patients diagnosed with focal hyperhidrosis with a known diagnosis
        of primarily axillary localization.

        We will only enroll patients available for both treatment visits. Availability for
        follow-up visit is optional.

        Only patients between the ages of 18 and 29 years when the first HHIQ is administered will
        be eligible.

        The upper age limit was so determined because patients over 29 years often present with
        psychopathology which is far more recalcitrant to correction of any kind regardless of
        effectiveness because of the duration of the condition.

        The lower age limit was so determined because 18 years and up are the ages for which the
        miraDry ® procedure has been approved for use by the FDA.

        All participants will be screened using the Hyperhidrosis Disease Severity Scale (HDSS).

        Only patients reporting their condition as a 3 out of 4 or higher on the HDSS will be
        eligible for study because preliminary data suggests effective detection of psychological
        changes only at higher reported levels of sweating severity.

        A patient's previous non-invasive treatment course, including but not limited to
        prescription of psychiatric medication and topical therapies, will not justify exclusion
        from this study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Patients who are unable to provide informed consent, have known allergies to lidocaine,
        hibiclens with 4% chlorhexidine, and/or epinephrine, are pregnant (as determined by
        self-reporting), are unable to take oral antibiotics or antiseptic washes, have heart
        pacemakers or other electronic device implants, and who need supplemental oxygen are not
        eligible to participate in this study
