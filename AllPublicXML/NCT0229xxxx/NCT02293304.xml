      The aim of this study is to evaluate the 18-month clinical performance of a multimode
      adhesive (Scotchbond Universal Adhesive, 3M ESPE, St Paul, MN, USA) in primary molars after
      partial carious removal. This randomized clinical trial will include subjects (5-10 year-old
      children) selected at two university centers (UFSM and FOUSP). The sample will consist of 132
      primary molars presenting active cavitated carious lesions (with radiographic involvement of
      the outer half of the dentin), located on the occlusal and occlusal-proximal surface. The
      sample will be randomly divided into two groups according to bonding approach: etch-and-rinse
      or self-etch strategy. The restorations will be clinically followed every 6 months for up to
      18 months using the USPHS modified criteria for clinical evaluation. Survival estimates for
      restoration longevity will be evaluated using the Kaplan-Meier method.

    <description>The outcome of the study is the failure of restorations in primary teeth. Failures will be assessed by clinical evaluation and will be considered in the presence of loss of restoration or fracture requiring a reintervation (restoration repair or replacement) or symptoms requiring pulp intervention or tooth extraction.</description>
