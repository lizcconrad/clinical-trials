  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators plan to compare the incidence of successful placement of epidural pain
      catheters versus paracostal catheters for the control of pain and prevention of pulmonary
      complications for adult trauma patients with blunt chest wall trauma resulting in multiple
      rib fractures. When a trauma patient has &gt; or = to 3 rib fractures on the same side, is being
      admitted to the Surgical ICU, and is encountered within 72 hours from the time of their
      injury, they will be eligible for the study. If they (or a proxy) choose to participate,
      consent will be obtained and they will randomly be assigned to receive either an epidural or
      paracostal catheter for pain control. The aim of the study is to determine if paracostal
      catheters are noninferior to epidurals for controlling pain in multisystem trauma patients.
      Secondarily the investigators will evaluate success and time of placement of the assigned
      intervention and follow the patient throughout their hospital course to compare the success
      of analgesia provided by each modality along with any complications and/or benefits of the
      two types of catheters.

          -  Admitted to the Surgical ICU

          -  Recruited within 24 hours of admission

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patient allergy to local anesthetics

          -  Patient refusal

          -  Inability to consent for any reason

          -  Prisoners

          -  Age &lt; 18

          -  Pregnant women (pregnancy screen performed as part of routine trauma admission labs)

          -  Absolute contraindications for either thoracic epidural or paracostal pain catheter
             placement which include:

               1. Localized rash or skin infection over the likely site of insertion (We never want
                  to translocate infectious material from the skin to the epidural space or even
                  into the soft tissue where paracostal catheters lay, although for these there is
                  more flexibility in adjusting placement)

               2. Spinal/vertebral instability/fracture including any significant vertebral body
                  injury and 3 or more spinous process fractures near the level of desired epidural
                  placement (transverse process fractures are not considered a contraindication)

               3. History of extensive back surgery at the level of desired epidural placement

               4. Severe aortic stenosis, mitral stenosis, or pulmonary hypertension

               5. Inability to correct coagulopathy (to International Normalized Ratio&gt;1.5)

               6. Persistent hemodynamic instability (hypotension with Systolic Blood Pressure&lt;90
                  that does not respond to initial fluid boluses and requires ongoing pressors
                  beyond the 72 hour window for enrollment)

               7. Inability to cooperate and participate in placement (if intubated and sedated,
                  for example) or to lie in the correct position for placement (lateral decubitus
                  for paracostal pain catheters, either sitting up or lateral decubitus for
                  epidural placement)

               8. Concern for elevated intracranial pressure (we imagine these patients will also
                  be intubated)
