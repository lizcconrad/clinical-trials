  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a retrospective cohort of patients minors during the operation of cartilage
      tympanoplasty for tympanic membrane perforation
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators hypothesis is that the cartilage tympanoplastie lead to a closure of the
      tympanic membrane in 95% of cases. But the investigators believe that certain risk factors
      may influence the anatomical and functional results of tympanoplastie of the child and that
      their inclusion could improve these results.

      For example, young age is not clear so far as a potential risk factor in the few studies
      analyzing this factor independently. A recommendation of the French Society of ENT surgery
      tympanic membrane perforation of the Child in 2006 recommended a minimum age of 6 years.
      However, the level of evidence of articles analyzed was small (it was basically a consensus
      of experts) and the investigators feel it necessary to study this factor by age (&lt;7 years,
      7-10 years, 11-14 years ,&gt; 14 years) on a large cohort to determine the real influence of age
      on the anatomical and functional results as this may lead to changes in practice.

      Similarly, whatever the influence of age in the general population, it could be a key
      criterion in children who have a particular field leading to prolonged tubal dysfunction
      (vélopalatines slots and craniofacial malformations), leading to raising the age of surgery
      tympanic closure: the investigators have for example in 1000 tympanoplasties for perforation,
      expected recruitment numbers in this study, 50 patients with craniofacial malformation or
      vélopalatine slot.

      The purpose of this study is to investigate the factors influencing the anatomic outcome at
      one year of cartilage tympanoplastie child.
