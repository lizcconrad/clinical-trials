  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study design includes an observational prospective cohort of HIV-positive
      pregnant/postpartum women and their infants enrolled during antenatal clinics (or immediately
      postpartum) from prevention of mother-to-child transmission (PMTCT) programs and followed
      until the infants reach the age of 18 - 24 months and semi-structure interviews with a
      sub-set of these women. A second study component involves semi-structured interviews with
      health care workers (HCW) involved in the PMTCT programs and yearly facility surveys at the
      selected study facilities.
