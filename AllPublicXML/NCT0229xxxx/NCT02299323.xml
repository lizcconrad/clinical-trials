      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate radiographic outcomes, intra-operative
      parameters, clinical outcomes, and patient satisfaction following circumferential fusion
      using the INDEPENDENCE® integrated plate and spacer with REVOLVE® Stabilization System for
      the treatment of severe low back pain due to lumbar disc degeneration unresponsive to 6
      months of non-operative treatment.

      A total of thirty subjects will be enrolled at Scott &amp; White Healthcare. The INDEPENDENCE
      spacer will be filled with autogenous bone graft material. The devices subject to this
      Agreement have received 510(k) clearance from the FDA for the indications specified in this
      Agreement.

      Patients will be followed for 2 years with evaluations at the following time intervals:
      preoperatively (within 2 months of surgery) and postoperatively at 6 weeks, 3 months, 6
      months, 12 months, and 24 months.

        Inclusion Criteria:

             with degeneration confirmed by patient history and radiographic examination

               -  Experience pain, functional deficit and/or neurological deficit for a minimum of
                  six months

               -  Unresponsiveness to documented non-surgical treatment modalities for a minimum of
                  six months and/or presentation with progressive symptoms of nerve root or spinal
                  cord compression prior to enrollment

               -  At least 18 years of age and maximum 65 years of age

               -  Ability to provide Informed Consent for study participation and to return for all
                  follow-up visits

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  • Presence of systemic or localized infection at the site of surgery

               -  More than 2 levels to be instrumented

               -  Previous fusion attempt at the involved level(s)

               -  More than three previous open, posterior, lumbar spinal surgical procedures at

                  that spinal instrumentation would be contraindicated

               -  Diagnosis of a condition or requires postoperative medication(s), which may
                  interfere with bony/soft tissue healing

               -  Presence of a disease entity or condition which totally precludes possibility of
