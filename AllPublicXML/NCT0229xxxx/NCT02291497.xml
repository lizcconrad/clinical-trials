  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hypophosphatasia (HPP) is a rare, inherited metabolic disease caused by inactivating
      mutations in the Alkaline Phosphatase (ALPL) gene, coding for the Tissue-nonspecific alkaline
      phosphatase (TNAP). Penetrance and disease severity is very heterogenous, ranging from
      stillbirth to adult-onset manifestations. Especially the latter are again characterized by an
      extremely broad spectrum of symptoms. This scope of variability makes it difficult to
      attribute individual patients' symptoms to the disease and distinguish them from HPP
      independent health issues. Especially in adult HPP patients, musculoskeletal problems,
      including (fragility-) fractures / bone bruise, joint pain, reduced mobility, muscular
      weakness and pain and reduced muscular endurance appear to reflect the prevailing burden of
      disease, especially with respect these patients dis-abilities of daily life.

      To expand current knowledge of the natural history of the disease as well as on disease
      specific musculoskeletal deficits in HPP, all adult patients with established Diagnosis of
      HPP known at the Orthopedic Institute, University of Würzburg, will be offered to participate
      in a single, multimodal assessment of their disease history, current symptoms and
      disabilities, lab evaluations and clinical and technical analysis of their musculoskeletal
      status and capabilities.

      Patients will be invited to a day long visit to the clinic in order to perform the following
      assessments:

      A) Epidemiologic / anamnestic information B) Physical examination C) Structured
      questionnaires D) Laboratory examinations E) Clinical functional testing F) Technical
      Examinations
