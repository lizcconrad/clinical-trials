  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Permanent Breast Seed Implant (PBSI) has been demonstrated to be a well accepted and well
      tolerated form of partial breast radiotherapy. This protocol aims to build on the initial
      experience and to further refine the technique and collect toxicity and cost data, especially
      in comparison to alternate forms of breast radiotherapy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      25 women with low stage (pT1pN0) breast cancer, grade 1 or 2, will be accrued for adjuvant
      partial breast radiotherapy using PBSI and prospectively followed for 5 years. The primary
      aims is to evaluate implant quality according to recognized dosimetric parameters. Secondary
      aims include elaboration of approaches to different technical scenarios imposed by variation
      in seroma size, shape and location within the breast (expanding the technical manual to
      include recommended approaches to implants in different sectors of the breast and in
      different size breasts), incorporation of the use of live 3D ultrasound in the procedure (as
      opposed to current use of 2D US), assessment of patient acceptance and quality of life,
      physician assessment of cosmesis, assessment of toxicity, and recording of cost to the
      patient and health care system compared to alternate forms of breast radiotherapy.
