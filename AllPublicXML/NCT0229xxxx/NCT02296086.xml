      The study will assess the difference in functionality between early vs. standard mobilization
      after hip fracture in the Chinese population.

      The primary objective of this prospective observational cohort study is to assess the
      difference in functionality between Group I and II (see mobilization regimens for the two
      groups above) at 6 weeks using the modified Barthel Index in the Chinese population.

      The allocation of patients to the two groups will be performed on a clinic level: 50% of
      patients will be recruited by study sites in Group I (early mobilization). The other 50% of
      patients will be recruited by study sites in Group II. The sites are carefully selected after
      evaluating their standard procedures of mobilizing elderly patients after hip fractures. This
      process is documented using formal site selection questionnaires.

      The modified Barthel Index is estimated at 75 points for Group II and at 85 points for Group
      I.

      Patients aged 65 years and older with unstable intertrochanteric fractures (AO 31 A2 or A3)
      treated with an intramedullary nail will be included in this study.

      The study visits will be defined as preoperative, surgery, discharge, 6 (± 2) weeks and 12 (±
      2) weeks follow-up (FU) visits. Furthermore, there will be a telephone contact 12 months (± 1
      month) postsurgery.
