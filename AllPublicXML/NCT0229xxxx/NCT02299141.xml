  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There has been limited benefit with angiogenesis inhibitor drugs when used with molecularly
      selected patients in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The investigators propose that
      patients who are molecularly selected for treatment with nintedanib based on the presence of
      mutations (VEGFR1-3, PDGFR-A, PDGFR-B, and FGFR1-3) will have clinically meaningful benefits
      in terms of response rate (RR) and progression-free survival (PFS). Furthermore the
      investigators plan to perform exome sequencing of paired tumor (pre and post treatment) in
      order to better define molecular marker predictors for response and resistance.

    <measure>Response rate (RR)</measure>
    <time_frame>After 2 cycles of therapy (approximately Day 56)</time_frame>
    <description>RR = Partial response plus complete response using RECIST 1.1
Complete response (CR) = disappearance of all target lesions, non-target lesions, and normalization of tumor marker level
Partial response (PR) = at least a 30% decrease in the sum of the diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline of sum diameters</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Progression-free survival (PFS)</measure>
    <time_frame>At the time of progression (estimated to be 8 months)</time_frame>
    <description>PFS is defined as the duration of time from start of treatment to time of progression or death, whichever occurs first.
Progressive disease (PD) = at least a 20% increase in the sum of the diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum on study, appearance of one or more non-target lesion(s) and/or unequivocal progression of existing non-target lesions</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Response rate of specific genetic mutation statuses</measure>
    <time_frame>At the time of progression (estimated to be 8 months)</time_frame>
    <description>The association between response and specific mutation status will be assessed by permutation analysis. Taking the relationship between FGFR1 expression and RR as an example, for instance, we first compute the observed test statistics, e.g., the sample mean difference between responders versus non-responders. Then to simulate the null distribution of the test statistics, or the distribution of the observed mean differences if there were truly no difference, we repeat the following 10,000 times: we randomly shuffle the response status, and then calculate the sample difference between the newly designated groups. The permutation p-value equals the proportion of simulations from the null distribution that exceed the observed test statistics.</description>

    <measure>Unique genetic variations associated with extreme responses (both non-responders and responders)</measure>
    <time_frame>At the time of progression (estimated to be 8 months)</time_frame>
    <description>Unbiased exome and transcriptome sequencing performed on tumor samples at time of diagnosis in responders and non-responders will help us identify unique variations that confer susceptibility to nintedanib.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Genetic mechanisms of secondary resistance</measure>
    <time_frame>At the time of progression (estimated to be 8 months)</time_frame>
    <description>Genomic analysis at time of progression after treatment with nintedanib (after response (complete response/partial response/stable disease) lasting for 6 months or longer) will provide some unique insights into mechanisms underlying acquired resistance.</description>
