  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The ultimate goal of this project is to develop methods that allow informed decision-making
      on the delivery time of fetuses that are at increased risk of stillbirth due to IUGR. In
      placenta related IUGR pregnancies, there can be multiple concurrent placental pathologies.
      Although there is no specific correspondence between a single type of pathology and IUGR, the
      common result of these pathologies is placental insufficiency, which limits the
      maternal-fetal exchange. Oxygen and nutrition transport is known to be hindered in IUGR
      placentas due to obstructed or abrupt vasculature, massive fibrin deposition, and
      inflammation in the villous and intervillous space (villitis). Thus one potential approach to
      distinguish IUGR pregnancies from normal ones is to assess the efficiency of placental
      transport. Based on the hypothesis that efficiency of oxygen transport is representative for
      overall oxygen and nutrition transport in placenta, the investigators propose to characterize
      the blood oxygenation and blood perfusion in placenta in vivo via MRI, and use it as an index
      for better stratification in the IUGR risk group. The investigators will also consider
      alternative MRI approaches such as structural, diffusion and spectroscopy measurements inside
      the placenta, which might reflect the state of placental transport and reveal the status of
      placental health.

      Specific aims: 1) To correlate the MRI metrics that differentiate placental insufficiency
      from normal placenta transport with histopathology data of the placenta. 2) To correlate the
      MRI metrics that reflects placental insufficiency with fetal outcome
