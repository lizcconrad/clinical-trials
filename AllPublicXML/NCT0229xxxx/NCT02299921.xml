  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study plans to learn more about people who are sick in the hospital with a lung
      infection, or respiratory failure. Respiratory failure, or severe lung failure, is a
      life-threatening disease. When it happens, the lungs have trouble carrying out their normal
      function of getting oxygen into the blood, and removing carbon dioxide from the body.
      Investigators are conducting this study to see what drinking too much alcohol, using tobacco
      products, or using drugs (both legal and illegal) may do to lung infections and respiratory
      failure.

      Subjects are asked to be in this research study because they are thought to have a lung
      infection and may also have respiratory failure. Alcohol, tobacco, and drug use have been
      linked to lung infections, respiratory failure, and even death, but the reasons for this
      aren't known. People who use unhealthy amounts of alcohol, tobacco, and or drugs may be more
      at risk for lung infections, and for severe complications due to lung infection. Subject
      participation is important whether or not you use alcohol and or drugs.
