  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hypertension has high prevalence and poor control rates and is considered one of the major
      modifiable risk factors for cardiovascular system diseases, and one of the most important
      public health problems. The imbalance of the autonomic cardiovascular control, which can be
      considered as a major etiologic factor in the development of essential hypertension is
      characterized by increased sympathetic activity and reduced parasympathetic activity
      possible.

      Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death and disability in the world and
      autonomic imbalance is associated with several pathological conditions, and may be a final
      common pathway for the increased morbidity and mortality of cardiovascular diseases. In this
      sense, the heart rate variability (HRV) is a quantitative marker of sympathetic and
      parasympathetic activity, which can be used to assess disease and mortality as a noninvasive
      technique.

      TENS is a noninvasive therapeutic modality, easy to handle, it has no side effects or
      interactions with medications being used for the relief of pain by sensory stimulation
      through peripheral nerves and mainly for control and treatment of acute and chronic pain .
      Research on the effect of TENS on the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous system activity
      remain controversial, especially regarding the parameters to use.

      The aim of this study is to investigate the effects of TENS on the sympathetic and
      parasympathetic nervous system in patients with hypertension by heart rate variability and
      blood pressure variability.

      This is a randomized clinical trial, double blind, where hypertensive patients were
      randomized to three groups: high-frequency TENS (100 Hz) n = 20, low frequency TENS (4 Hz) n
      = 20 and n = 20 placebo. Evaluations will be made in a single session. The results will be
      assessed by a blinded investigator and randomization will be done electronically.

      It is expected to evaluate how often TENS exerts more influence in the modulation of
      sympathetic and parasympathetic system.

      Data collection was performed at the Laboratory of Clinical Investigation (LIC) Institute of
      Cardiology. Initially, patients rested for 30 minutes, and during this period has been
      completed the evaluation form with the identification data and questions about the patient's
      clinical status, such as checking blood pressure, weight and height.

      Patients were randomized to group of high frequency (100 Hz / 200μs), low frequency (4 Hz /
      200μs) or placebo. The placebo group received an active current for 30 seconds, and then
      gradually decreased for 15 seconds to not pass any current. This approach aims at masking the
      investigator and subject (RAKEL et al., 2010). Eligible subjects were randomly assigned in
      blocks, by electronic randomization (www.randomization.com).

      The adhesive electrodes were used, size 9x5 cm, placed in bilateral paravertebral region of
      the T1 segment of the thoracic spine at L2 lumbar spine. Before the application of TENS
      (IBRAMED®), the skin was cleaned in place of the current application with alcohol to avoid
      any barrier conduction of electrical current.

      The sessions took place at the same time of the day, throughout the protocol, the
      participants were comfortably accommodated in an acclimatized room (23ºC) in a supine
      position, head elevation of 30º with knees resting on a wedge. All the participants were
      forbidden to perform exhaustive exercises and intake caffeine at least two hours before the
      intervention and instructed to have a meal before the assessment.

      TENS was applied for thirty minutes, with the frequency defined according to randomization.
      The intensity of the current was delivered at sensory-level intensity, adjusted every 5
      minutes by the sensory threshold, during the 30 minutes as tolerated by each subject, but
      without motor contraction or pain reported by the subject.

      The analysis of autonomic control was performed by means of a sensor placed on the middle
      finger, and connected to the Finapres (Ohmeda 2300, Colorado, USA) by recording beat to beat.
      Then, the conversion signal was performed using the powerlab (LAB chart). The analysis will
      be performed using the software Kubios.

    <description>For the analysis of heart rate variability (HRV), the time of RR intervals obtained from continuous ECG signal recorded by Finapres device (Ohmeda 2300, Colorado, USA) series. The time series of RR will be analyzed in the time and frequency and variability parameters and autonomic balance will be obtained. In the time domain we calculate the mean values of RR intervals, standard deviation and the square root of the sum of the square of successive differences (rMSSD). The acquisition of electrocardiogram signal (ECG) was performed immediately before and after the interventions for a 10-minute period, with the subject at rest.</description>
