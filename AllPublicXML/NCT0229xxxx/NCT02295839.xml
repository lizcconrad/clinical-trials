    <textblock>
      This pilot randomized controlled trial examined the feasibility, acceptability and
      effectiveness of an intervention to improve sleep quality and decrease fatigue levels in
      children with a diagnosis of ALL, during maintenance treatment. Families were randomized to
      usual care or the intervention. The intervention included a sleep hygiene and relaxation
      education session with a nurse practitioner, literature for home, two story books, and a
      follow-up phone call. Self-reported measures were used in addition to actigraphy to measure
      children's quality and quantity of sleep.

    <textblock>
      Sleep is an essential restorative function that promotes both physical and cognitive health.
      Previous studies have demonstrated that children on Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL)
      maintenance therapy have problematic sleep patterns and experience fatigue. This pilot
      randomized controlled trial examined the feasibility, acceptability and effectiveness of an
      intervention to improve sleep quality and decrease fatigue levels in children aged 4-10, with
      a diagnosis of ALL, during maintenance treatment. Families were randomized to usual care or
      the intervention. The intervention included a sleep hygiene and relaxation education session
      with a nurse practitioner, literature for home, two story books, and a follow-up phone call.
      Self-reported measures were used in addition to actigraphy to measure children's quality and
      quantity of sleep. Sleep tips were evaluated by intervention group families.

    <description>Intervention group participants receive a nurse-led, one-hour 1:1 educational session including education about sleep in children and a description of what is known about sleep and fatigue issues in children with cancer. The session also includes strategies to improve sleep hygiene in children. Information about relaxation to promote sleep is outlined and two children's books designed to promote relaxation using the principles of deep breathing are given to the parent(s). A handout containing all the information covered is given to the parent(s).</description>
