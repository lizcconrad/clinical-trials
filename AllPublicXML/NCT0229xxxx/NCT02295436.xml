  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the the study was to evaluate the pharmacokinetic properties of
      minodronic acid tablets following single and multiple oral administration in healthy Chinese
      subjects. Additionally, the effects of age and food on minodronic acid pharmacokinetics was
      also explored.

      This was a single-center, phase I study in healthy young (19-30 years) and elderly (60-65
      years) volunteers, which was conducted in four parts. In Part 1, minodronic acid tablets were
      administered to young volunteers at doses of 1, 2, and 4 mg. In Part 2, after a single dose,
      young volunteers in the 1-mg dose group received repeated oral doses of minodronic acid once
      daily for 7 days. In Part 3, a single oral dose of minodronic acid 1 mg was administered to
      elderly volunteers. In part 4, after a washout period of 8 days, volunteers in the 4-mg dose
      group received a single dose of 4 mg minodronic acid under fed conditions (administrated 30
      minutes before high-fat breakfast). Plasma samples were collected and plasma concentrations
      of minodronic acid were analyzed by LC-MS/MS. Tolerability was assessed throughout the study
      by physical examinations, vital signs measurement, laboratory analyses, and monitoring of
      adverse effects.
