  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The present study was carried out to determine the glycaemic index (GI), glycaemic load (GL),
      insulinaemic index (InI), appetite ratings and postprandial plasma concentrations of
      gastrointestinal hormones related to the control of food intake after the ingestion of five
      types of commercially available selected Spanish breads. All volunteers took the breads and
      glucose in a crossover interventional study.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The most important cereal-derived nourishment is bread, a staple food which is the main
      source of daily carbohydrates. White bread is the one for which the most rapid decline has
      occurred, probably due to a popular belief that bread provokes weight gain, but more studies
      are needed to clarify the relationship between bread consumption and ponderal status in
      Spanish population.

      A growing body of evidence supports a beneficial role for low-glycaemic index (GI) and
      glycaemic load (GL) diets in the prevention of life style-related diseases such as type-2
      diabetes. Likewise, GI s widely used in the selection of foods suitable for glycaemic
      control, since low to moderate GI diets have been proposed for the prevention of type 2
      diabetes, cardiovascular disease and age-related eye diseases. On the contrary, related to
      obesity, no associations between BMI, GI and GL have been reported in a Mediterranean
      population. Thus, investigations focuses on the implication of glycaemic response of
      different breads are of important application.

      Many factors such as manufacturing bread conditions, starch structure, bread particle size
      and inclusion of different types of ingredients like whole-grains may influence glycaemic
      response and therefore may contribute to modify GI, GL and InI of breads. Comparing different
      French breads, GI value varied between 57 for the traditional baguette and 85 for the
      wholemeal loaf, while the traditional baguette exerted a significantly lowest postprandial
      insulin response and the lowest InI. However, to our best knowledge, neither the influence of
      different types of Spanish breads on GI, GL and InI nor the effects on appetite ratings and
      on the postprandial gastrointestinal hormone responses have been investigated.

    <measure>Postprandial determination of Glycemic index and glycemic load</measure>
    <time_frame>from fasting to 180 mins after the intake of the breads</time_frame>
    <description>Glycemic index is defined as the blood glucose response measured as AUC in response to a test food consumed by an individual under standard conditions related to the postprandial response to 50 g of oral glucose load under the same conditions.
Glycemic load takes into account the GI of the product and how many available carbohydrates are in a food serving and is calculated as GL = [GI of product/100 x g of available carbohydrates in a food serving]</description>

    <measure>Postprandial determination of Insulinemic index</measure>
    <time_frame>from fasting to 180 mins after the intake of the breads</time_frame>
    <description>insulinemic index measures the increment of insulin AUC over two hours in response to consumption of the amount of bread providing a 50 g of available carbohydrates divided by AUC after ingestion of 50 g of glucose after two hours</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Postprandial determination of Appetite profile</measure>
    <time_frame>from fasting to 180 mins after the intake of the breads</time_frame>
    <description>Appetite profile was assessed using VAS ratings of hunger, fullness, desire to eat and prospective food consumption, based on a 100-mm scale ranging from 0 (&quot;not at all&quot;) to 100 (&quot;extremely&quot;). This questionnaire was completed before and every 30 min during the 240 min following the intake of the breakfast. A validated composite appetite score was calculated using the following equation: Composite appetite score = (satiety + fullness + (l00 - prospective food consumption) + (100 - hunger))/4 (Flint et al., 2000).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Postprandial determination of Plasma gastrointestinal hormone concentrations</measure>
    <time_frame>from fasting to 180 mins after the intake of the breads</time_frame>
    <description>For the determination of gastrointestinal hormone plasma concentrations, whole blood was added to peptidase inhibitor, which are needed for the determination of some hormones. This blood sample was centrifuged at 1000 x g for 10 min at 4 ºC, divided into aliquots and frozen at -80ºC for analyses. Plasma concentrations of insulin, ghrelin, GLP-1, gastric inhibitory polypeptide (GIP), peptide YY (PYY) and pancreatic polypeptide (PP) were determined using a MILLIplexTM kit (Millipore, USA).</description>

    <description>The evening before the test day, subjects consumed a standardised dinner. Volunteers arrived in a 12-h fasting state. A fasting blood sample was acquired after the resting time, and appetite feelings were assessed by using visual analogue The subjects were instructed to consume the tested bread or 50 g of glucose. The subjects immediately completed two VAS, one on appetite feelings and another on bread palatability. The appetite feeling VAS were repeated every 30 min until a total of 180 min had passed. The subjects were not allowed to eat or drink anything else during the 180 min of the intervention.
After the last blood extraction (3 h), an ad libitum lunch and 300 ml of water was provided. Volunteers ate until comfortably satisfied and the amount of food intake was registered</description>
