      In this clinical study, meloxicam will be used to the patients who are older than 2 years and
      underwent Kasai portoenterostomy to treat their biliary atresia before. Before and after the
      medication, their liver stiffness scores will be checked using hepatic Fibroscan. Liver
      stiffness scores will be compared before and after the medication of meloxicam, and the roll
      of the COX-2 inhibitor (meloxicam) in the patients with biliary atresia in releasing their
      hepatic fibrosis. Also, the side effect of the drug will be checked. The intervention drug,
      meloxicam is safe medicine which is used to treat pain or inflammation caused by
      osteoarthritis or rheumatoid arthritis in adults and children who are at least 2 years old.
      It may also be used for purposes not listed in the medication guide. It will be taken once a
      daily with a dose of 0.125 mg/kg/day (high-dose group) or 0.06 mg/kg/day (low-dose group).
      After 6 months of medication, the maintenance will be decided by the comparison of liver
      stiffness score before and after the intervention.
