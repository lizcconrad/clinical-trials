      Introduction: the influence of temporomandibular disorders (TMD) related to postural changes
      are yet no consensus, but it is believed that the imbalances of a system can influence
      another. Several techniques have been used to treat TMD and its associated problems, however
      there is a paucity of studies evaluating the effects of global treatments, such as Pilates,
      in individuals with TMD literature. Objective: To evaluate changes in the level of pain, the
      severity of TMD, the EMG activity of masticatory muscles and posture of young women
      undergoing training in Pilates, as well as correlating postural changes, pain level, severity
      of TMD and EMG activity of masticatory muscles. A randomized clinical trial with blinded
      assessors will be held. 40 patients divided randomly into two groups will be assessed, the
      control group (CG) who receive conventional treatment with occlusal splint and intervention
      group (IG), which in addition to conventional treatment will undergo Pilates sessions. Both
      groups will be formed for women aged 18 to 35 years with TMD and pain. The IG will receive
      treatment with the Pilates Method for 15 weeks with frequency of twice weekly and use
      occlusal splint as directed by the dentist. The CG will make use of occlusal splint alone. At
      the beginning and end of the 15 weeks the individuals are evaluated to verify the presence of
      TMD, TMD severity, pain, EMG evaluation of masticatory muscles and body posture. Data will be
      analyzed statistically.

      t-test or Mann-Whitney test will be used to compare data before and after 15 weeks of
      treatment.

      Multiple Two-Way ANOVAs will be used to compare treatment and evaluation period, for each
      depended variable: effects of pain, severity of TMD, EMG activity of masticatory muscles and
      posture.
