  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare drug delivery and lung function after treatment with
      formoterol from a nebulizer versus a dry powder inhaler (DPI) in patients recovering from
      severe exacerbations of COPD. This is to determine if one device is superior in providing
      better lung function and drug deposition in this clinical setting.
