  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, exploratory study to verify intra-operative handling and safety and to
      collect preliminary short-term safety and efficacy data of the Turris® Facet Fuser, a small
      bioresorbable device for the immediate immobilization of the facet joint.

      Patients eligible for study enrollment will present with degenerative lumbar spinal diseases
      involving the L4/L5 segment and requiring spinal fusion.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The Turris® Facet Fuser is an investigational resorbable device intended to support spinal
      segment fusion in individuals suffering from degenerative lumbar spinal diseases. The device
      is directly inserted in the facet joint of the affected segment using the BoneWelding®
      technology, a soft tissue sparing, ultrasound based insertion method which confers immediate
      stability to the implant.

      Aim of this prospective, exploratory study is to verify intra-operative handling and safety
      of the Turris® Facet Fusion System and to collect preliminary short-term safety and efficacy
      data on this innovative implant by observing the healing process over a period of one year.
