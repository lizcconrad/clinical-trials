      To investigate the value of procalcitonin (PCT) kinetics between 0-8-16-24 hours after
      starting empirical antibiotic therapy in critically ill patients, to predict appropriate or

        All patients over 18 years with suspected infection on admission or during their stay on
        the intensive care unit were screened for eligibility. Patients were enrolled, when the
        attending intensive care specialist had a suspicion of infection and decided to start
        empirical antibiotic therapy.

        Inclusion Criteria:

             the attending ICU physician

          -  Suspected site of infection has to be present and documented

          -  Microbiological sample sent for staining

          -  Inflammatory markers available at the start of the therapy

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients younger than 18 years

          -  Who received prophylactic or empiric antibiotic therapy 48 hours before inclusion

          -  Whose receiving acute renal replacement therapy in the first 24 hours following
             antibiotic treatment

          -  Following cardiopulmonary resuscitation

          -  End stage diseases with a &quot;do not resuscitate&quot; order

          -  Immunocompromised patients (human immunodeficiency virus infection, bone marrow
             transplantation, malignant haematological disorders and chemotherapy)

          -  Post cardiac surgery patients
