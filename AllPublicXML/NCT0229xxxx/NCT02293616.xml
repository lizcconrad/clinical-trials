  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It is well documented that intensive care unit (ICU) patients have lower levels of skeletal
      muscle strength compared to non-ICU patients upon hospital discharge, and this weakness
      affects the patient's ability to perform basic activities of daily living upon hospital
      discharge and for extended periods thereafter. Recently, critically ill ICU patients have
      been shown to have lower nitric oxide levels. These patients often suffer from a disturbed
      homeostasis with circulatory and metabolic abnormalities that may potentially contribute to
      their ICU acquired weakness. Given the recent research showing dietary nitrate
      supplementation can increase nitric oxide levels and improve exercise tolerance in healthy
      and diseased older individuals, our aim is to investigate the importance of nitrate
      supplementation in ICU patients with focus on physical function and ICU acquired muscle
      weakness.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The proposed study is an investigator initiated, double blind, placebo controlled
      experimental study designed to evaluate the effect of chronic NO3- supplementation via
      beetroot juice ingestion on the skeletal muscle strength and physical function in ICU
      patients. Patients will be randomized to receive either nitrate rich or nitrate depleted
      beetroot juice once daily during their ICU and hospital stay. Physical function and skeletal
      muscle strength will be measured at ICU (± 2 days) and hospital (± 2 days) discharge and 2
      months (± 2 weeks) after enrollment. Plasma levels of nitrate and nitrite will be measured 1,
      3 and 5 days after randomization into the trial and at ICU and hospital discharge. Skeletal
      muscle ultrasound will be performed to examine the size and echogenicity of patient muscles.
      Self-reported physical function will be measured using the Functional Performance Inventory
      Short Form (FPI-SF). The FPI-SF provides an overall score of patient self-reported functional
      performance in the areas of household maintenance, movement, family and social activities,
      work, avocation and recreation

    <time_frame>2 months</time_frame>
    <description>The SPPB is based on timed measures of standing balance, walking speed, and ability to rise from a chair. Each performance measure is assigned a score ranging from 0 to 4, with 4 indicating the highest level of performance and 0 inability to complete the test. A summary score (range 0-12) will be calculated by adding the three scores.</description>

    <description>Blood samples will be collected in 4 mL lithium heparin vials. Nitrate and nitrite will be measured separately using the ENO-20 NOx analyzer.</description>

    <measure>Skeletal muscle strength</measure>
    <time_frame>2 months</time_frame>
    <description>Skeletal muscle strength will be measured in both upper and lower extremities. Hand grip strength in both hands will be measured using a hand held grip strength dynamometer. Additionally, an electronic strength dynamometer will be used to collect strength measures of the elbow flexion, elbow extension, shoulder flexion in the scaption plane, ankle dorsiflexion, knee extension and hip extension, bilaterally. Skeletal muscle ultrasound will be performed on upper and lower extremities bilaterally.</description>
