  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to evaluate the preliminary anti-tumor activity and tolerability of
      PF-03084014 when administered as a single agent in the treatment of patients with advanced
      triple receptor-negative breast cancer (mTNBC) harboring genomic alterations in Notch
      receptors (NA+), and in a smaller subset of mTNBC patients whose tumor tests negative for
      genomic alterations in Notch receptors (NA-)
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <overall_status>Terminated</overall_status>
  <why_stopped>
    The study was terminated on June 24th, 2015 due to change in strategy of PF-03084014
    development. There were no safety/efficacy concerns behind the decision.
