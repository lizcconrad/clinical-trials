  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is defined as a hyperglycemia with onset or first
      recognition during pregnancy. GDM complicates 5 to 25% of pregnancies, depending on the
      diagnostic criteria used and the population being studied.

      GDM is an important red flag: up to 70% women with GDM will develop type 2 diabetes mellitus
      (T2DM) during their lifetime. Accordingly, professional associations recommend T2DM
      postpartum screening (T2DM-pP-S), 6-to-24 weeks after delivery. A 75g oral glucose tolerance
      test (OGTT) should be performed for diagnosis (gold standard). Nevertheless, this T2DM-pP-S
      recommendation has failed worldwide for the same reasons: the presently impractical pattern
      of the testing. A solution is direly needed.

      Our overall goal is to improve detection of pre-diabetes and diabetes and more specifically,
      to facilitate the recommended T2DM-pP-S in women diagnosed with GDM.

      We hypothesize that, in GDM women, results of an OGTT performed after delivery, before
      hospital discharge (OGTT-1) predict results of the recommended OGTT at 6-to-12 weeks
      postpartum (OGTT-2). Our aims are:

        1. To validate in Caucasian women the predictive threshold value of the 2hr-glucose of
           OGTT-1 established by our Stage-1 study.

        2. To determine, in a multiethnic non-Caucasian cohort, the threshold value for the
           2hr-glucose of OGTT-1 that is predictive of abnormal glucose tolerance at OGTT-2.

        3. To define the OGTT time preference of women (before hospital discharge vs. 6-to-12 weeks
           postpartum).

      If our results are in line with our Stage-1 data, most redundant 6-to-24 weeks postpartum
      OGTT will be avoided. Medical practice will change.
