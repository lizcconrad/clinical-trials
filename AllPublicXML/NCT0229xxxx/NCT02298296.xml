      The purpose of the study is to to determine the natural history of positive psychological
      states, health status, and functioning, over an 8 week period following admission for an
      acute coronary syndrome (ACS). We aim to compare the changes in these factors from baseline
      to 8-week follow-up with corresponding changes in the completed proof-of-concept intervention
      trial (NCT02004158).
