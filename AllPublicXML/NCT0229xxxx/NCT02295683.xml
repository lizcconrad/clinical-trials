    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to document safety and efficacy of renal sympathetic denervation
      treatment in subjects with uncontrolled hypertension by using Iberis renal denervation
      system.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is a prospective, multi-center, single-arm, non-interventional and open-label
      registry to collect descriptive data from patients who receive renal sympathetic denervation
      treatment in accordance with routine hospital practice using Iberis system.

      This registry will collect data prospectively from patients that receive renal sympathetic
      denervation treatment with use of Iberis renal denervation system and treatment will be
      applied according to the routine hospital practice. No additional tests are required specific
      to this registry. The registry will serve as a tool to collect clinical data in order to
      expand the knowledge base of safety, efficacy and functionality of the Iberis system in
      patients with resistant hypertension.

      A minimum of 30 patients will be enrolled in Europe
