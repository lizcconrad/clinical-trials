  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Atrial fibrillation (AF), an important cause of cardiac mortality and morbidity is the most
      common type of cardiac arrhythmia in clinical practice. Hypertensive individuals are at
      particular risk of development of atrial fibrillation. Renin-angiotensin-aldosteron system
      (RAS) which is activated in hypertension may be the underlying mechanism of AF among
      hypertensive patients.

      Vitamin D deficiency has been shown to be involved in the pathogenesis of hypertension,
      cardiovascular disease and obesity. Increased RAS activity is one of the postulated
      mechanisms by which vitamin D deficiency may trigger the development of hypertension and
      various cardiovascular diseases. On the basis of these data we hypothesized that
      hypovitaminosis D might be associated with new-onset AF among patients with hypertension.

        Hypertensive patients with new-onset AF. New onset AF was defined as AF identified for the
        first time by an electrocardiogram or ambulatory holter monitoring. Hypertension was
        defined as blood pressure ≥ 140/90 mmHg or a history of antihypertensive drug use.
