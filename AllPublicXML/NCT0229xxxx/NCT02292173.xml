  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main purpose of this study is to see whether the combination of trametinib and sorafenib
      can help people with hepatocellular cancer. Researchers also want to find out if the
      combination of trametinib and sorafenib is safe and tolerable.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Each cycle will last for 4 weeks. Sorafenib and trametinib will be administered orally on
      continuous basis. During the first cycle sorafenib will be started on day 1 and trametinib on
      day 8 to improve tolerance. Participants will get restaging scans every 2 cycles.
      Participants will continue to receive treatment if they have a stable disease or a better
      response by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) criteria 1.1.

    <measure>Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD)</measure>

  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Progression Free Survival (PFS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 3 years</time_frame>
    <description>PFS is defined as the duration of time from start of treatment to time of progression or death, whichever occurs first. Progression will be evaluated in this study using the new international criteria proposed by the revised Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) guideline (version 1.1). Changes in the largest diameter (unidimensional measurement) of the tumor lesions and the shortest diameter in the case of malignant lymph nodes are used in the RECIST criteria. Further, modified RECIST criteria for HCC will be used to evaluate response. Progressive Disease (PD): At least a 20% increase in the sum of the diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum on study (this includes the baseline sum if that is the smallest on study). In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 mm. (Note: the appearance of one or more new lesions is also considered progression).</description>

    <measure>Response Rate</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 3 years</time_frame>
    <description>Response will be evaluated in this study using the new international criteria proposed by the revised Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) guideline (version 1.1). Changes in the largest diameter (unidimensional measurement) of the tumor lesions and the shortest diameter in the case of malignant lymph nodes are used in the RECIST criteria. Further, modified RECIST criteria for HCC will be used to evaluate response. Complete Response (CR): Disappearance of all target lesions. Any pathological lymph nodes (whether target or non-target) must have reduction in short axis to &lt;10 mm. Partial Response (PR): At least a 30% decrease in the sum of the diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum diameters.</description>

             advanced stage disease that is not amenable to curative surgical resection. Potential
             participants without histologic diagnosis must meet the radiographic criteria for HCC.
