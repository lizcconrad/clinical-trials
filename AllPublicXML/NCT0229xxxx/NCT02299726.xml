  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Over one million hospitalizations for acute heart failure (AHF) occur over every year in the
      United States, resulting in high mortality, re-hospitalizations, and incurred financial
      costs; yet nearly every attempt over the last 10 years to improve outcomes with novel
      therapies have all failed. In this proposal, we will study whether a generic drug known as a
      mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist (more commonly known as an aldosterone blocker), proven
      to reduce morbidity and mortality for chronic heart failure patients, is safe and feasible to
      give to AHF patients in the emergency department and during hospitalization for a total of 3
      days. The results of this study will provide necessary and sufficient data to design an
      efficacy study in a larger population to test whether early use of a high-dose of
      mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists will reduce post-discharge morbidity and mortality.

      This clinical trial pilot study - Early Aldosterone Blockade in Acute Heart Failure: An
      Exploratory Safety Study - will explore the safety of early mineralocorticoid receptor
      blockade with high-dose spironolactone (100mg/daily), an oral mineralocorticoid receptor
      antagonist, versus placebo (both in addition to standard therapy), in patients admitted with
      acute heart failure (AHF) for 3 days. Aim 1 will answer the critical question that early
      mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) antagonism in AHF patients is sufficiently safe to move
      forward with a definitive trial. Aim 2 will demonstrate feasibility of patient enrollment and
      compliance with treatment throughout the study to inform future study design and enrollment
      projections. This study will provide the necessary and sufficient data in order to plan a
      larger, simple, definitive trial to test the hypothesis that early aldosterone blockade in
      AHF patients will reduce mortality and 30-day readmissions.

      The primary endpoint for the pilot study will be the difference in incidence of mean change
      of serum potassium of a specific amount from baseline to 120 hours from initial dose between
      placebo vs. spironolactone treated subjects.
