  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The current standard treatment of locally advanced rectal cancer is neoadjuvant concurrent
      chemo-radiation therapy (CCRT) followed by total mesorectal excision (TME). Recently,
      laparoscopic surgery is getting substitute open surgery based on the advantages of early
      recovery, short admission, less pain, less blood loss, and little scar without compromising
      oncologic outcomes.

      It is reported that hyperthermia is effective in synthetic (S) phase, Low oxgen pressure,
      acidic, and low perfusion site which are known as radio-resistant. Because of these
      characteristics, it considered as the most valuable radiosensitizer in cancer treatment,
      theoretically. Furthermore, mild hyperthermia (41 to 41.5 ÂºC) can promote tumor
      reoxygenation.

      Based on those background, the investigators start this prospective study to evaluate the
      efficacy of laparoscopic TME after CCRT with hyperthermia in locally advanced rectal cancer.
