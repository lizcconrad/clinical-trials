      The purpose of this study is to assess how accurately SmartTarget can direct high intensity
      focused ultrasound (HIFU) to a pre-defined area (cancer) in the prostate.

      The current standard methods for treating prostate cancer are directed to the whole gland -
      either surgery to remove it or radiotherapy. An alternative method is focal therapy. This is
      surgery that uses an energy source to ablate the cancer whilst preserving the normal healthy
      tissue.

      Prior to surgery prostate cancer can often be localised using MRI imaging and detailed
      prostate biopsy techniques. The difficulty is that during surgery it is very difficult to
      accurately locate the cancer on the live ultrasound images - to compensate surgeons will
      treat half or a quarter of the prostate to ensure that the cancer is treated. This may cause
      higher rates of side-effects.

      SmartTarget is an MRI to ultrasound fusion device that maps the pre-treatment MRI onto the
      live ultrasound during surgery. It then provides a target for the surgeons to treat during
      the operation.

      The results will measure if the area intended to treat was covered and if how accurate the
      treatment was by comparing the pre-treatment MRI with a 1 week post treatment scan

    <description>The ability of SmartTarget-directed focal HIFU therapy to ablate an intended target within the prostate, as measured by the proportion of men in whom complete ablation of the target region is achieved. Complete or incomplete ablation is determined by a comparative assessment of the pre-therapy and one week post-therapy contrast-enhanced MRIs by an expert radiologist.</description>
