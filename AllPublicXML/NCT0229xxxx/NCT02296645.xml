      ZuraPrep is being evaluated for safety and efficacy as a preoperative skin preparation
      against the Tentative Final Monograph (TFM) 10-minute end point recently revised by the FDA
      for the lower bound of a 95% confidence interval whereas there must be specific reductions of
      normal flora in the abdomen and groin areas. A positive control will be evaluated as well.
