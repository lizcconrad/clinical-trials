  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the ability of a belladonna and opium suppository given prior to surgery
      to improve bladder comfort after surgery for patients who are having elective ureteroscopy
      surgery.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Belladonna and opium suppositories are administered postoperatively to relieve bladder
      discomfort usually caused by bladder spasms. The onset of action of the suppository is 30-60
      minutes. Bladder spasms are more likely to occur following uteroscopy procedures. The spasms
      result in a felt desire to void, even when there is no urine in the bladder. The spasms can
      produce pain or a sense of severe urgency.

      By administering a belladonna and opium suppository at the beginning of surgery, it is hoped
      that there will be a decrease in the incidence of bladder spasms, increased comfort and less
      need for additional medications.

    <description>Bladder comfort is defined as bladder pain and bladder urgency. Bladder pain is measured on a 0-10 verbal analog scale with 0 = no pain and 10 = most pain possible. Bladder urgency is measured by a 0 - 4 scale with 0 = no desire to void, 1 = awarenes of need to void which can be delayed at least 30 minutes, 2 = moderate urgency than can be delayed for no more than 15 minutes, 3 = severe urgency that can be delayed for no more than 5 minutes, 4 = must void now. Pain and urgency are reported by the patient with or without questioning by the nurse.</description>

    <description>Patients will receive a single antispasmodic muscarinic suppository after induction of anesthesia but before insertion of urological scope for surgery. The suppository is composed of Belladonna (16.2 mg) and Opium (30 mg) in a water soluble base manufactured as Belladonna and Opium Supprettes.</description>
