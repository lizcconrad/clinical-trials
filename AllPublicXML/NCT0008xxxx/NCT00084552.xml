      RATIONALE: Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to damage tumor cells.
      Intensity-modulated radiation therapy (radiation directed at the tumor more precisely than in
      standard radiation therapy) may reduce damage to healthy tissue near the tumor. It is not yet
      known whether reducing the dose of radiation to erectile tissue will help prevent erectile
      dysfunction.

      PURPOSE: This randomized phase III trial is studying intensity-modulated radiation therapy
      alone to see how well it works compared to intensity-modulated radiation therapy with reduced
      doses to erectile tissue in treating patients with stage II prostate cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Compare erectile dysfunction in patients with stage T1b-T2c adenocarcinoma of the
           prostate after treatment with intensity-modulated radiotherapy with vs without dose
           sparing for erectile tissue.

      Secondary

        -  Compare biochemical freedom from failure rates, as a measure of prostate cancer control,
           in patients treated with these regimens.

        -  Compare the quality of life of patients treated with these regimens.

        -  Determine the association of molecular markers and biochemical freedom from failure rate
           and other endpoints in patients treated with these regimens.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, single-blind study. Patients are stratified according to age
      (≤ 65 vs &gt; 65), prescription radiotherapy dose (74 Gy vs 76 Gy), and frequency of erection
      during sexual activity within the past 4 weeks (a few times vs sometimes vs most times to
      always). Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients undergo conventional intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) once daily
           5 days a week for approximately 7.5 weeks.

        -  Arm II: Patients undergo IMRT with dose restriction to erectile tissue once daily 5 days
           a week for approximately 7.5 weeks.

      Treatment in both arms continues in the absence of unacceptable toxicity or disease
      metastasis.

      Quality of life is assessed at baseline, at 6 and 12 months, and then annually for 4 years

      Patients are followed at 3 months and then every 6 months thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 200 patients (100 per treatment arm) will be accrued for this
      study within 2.5 years.
