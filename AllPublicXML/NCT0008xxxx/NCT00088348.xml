  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will identify patients with anterior segment disease who may be eligible to
      participate in current or future NEI studies on this disease. Anterior segment disease
      includes all disorders that affect the eye surface, anterior chamber, iris and ciliary body
      and lens of the eye. The eye surface is composed of the cornea, conjunctiva, eyelids,
      lacrimal and meibomian glands, and the interconnecting nerves.

      Patients of any age with anterior segment disease may be eligible for this screening study.
      Participants will be evaluated with some or all of the following tests and procedures,
      depending on the nature of their eye problem:

        -  Medical history and brief physical examination.

        -  Eye examination, including measurement of visual acuity (eye chart) and eye pressure,
           examination of the pupils, eye movements, structures in the front of the eye (cornea,
           conjunctive, etc.), the lens, and the structures in the back of the eye (retinal, optic
           nerve, etc.).

        -  Photographs of the eye to help assess the status of the cornea and conjunctive and to
           evaluate any changes that may occur in the future.

        -  Assessment of tear and surface status. The amount of tears the eyes can produce is
           measured by placing a small piece of sterile paper in the corner of the eye every 5
           minutes. Special orange and green dyes are placed in the eyes to determine the health
           status of the surface of the eye.

        -  Corneal or conjunctival biopsy. A small tissue sample from the surface of the eye may be
           removed for laboratory examination to help diagnose a condition that is unclear. For
           this procedure, the eye is numbed with anesthetic eye drops. The required tissue is
           collected, an antibiotic ointment is placed in the eye to prevent infection, and a patch
           may be placed over the eye for 12 to 24 hours.

        -  Blood draw for tests to study the cause of the patient's eye disease.

        -  Other diagnostic tests as needed.

        -  DNA testing to look for a genetic pattern associated with the patient's eye disease.

      Patients who are found eligible for an NEI study will be offered participation in that study.
      Patients who are not eligible for current studies will be advised about treatment options.

      This is a screening protocol that will allow the NEI clinicians to examine patients with
      ocular diseases in order to identify those who may be eligible to participate in other NEI
      studies on anterior segment disease.
