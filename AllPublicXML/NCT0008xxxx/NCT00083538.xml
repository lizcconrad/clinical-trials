      The purpose of this study is to determine if vaccination with autologous idiotype- or tumor
      lysate-pulsed dendritic cells induces the generation of anti-idiotypic and anti-tumor
      immunologic responses.

      This is an experimental treatment that will consist of receiving special white blood cell
      administrations either underneath the skin or in the lymph nodes. In this protocol, treatment
      will be given according to the &quot;risk group&quot;. If there are certain abnormalities in the
      chromosomes, the disease is considered to be high risk. High-risk patients will first receive
      one cycle of chemotherapy with a regimen called DT PACE, after which the white blood cells
      will be collected. Leukapheresis is a procedure in which blood is removed, white blood cells
      are saved, and the remaining blood is given back to you. These dendritic cells will then be
      mixed with your individual myeloma protein and/or cells, and keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH)
      that is necessary for the enhancement of immune response against myeloma antigens. It is
      hoped that this will cause these cells to interact with and activate T cells, which will then
      destroy myeloma cells in your body. Half of these white cells will be injected into your
      lymph nodes (intranodally) and half will be given subcutaneously. High risk patients will
      receive a chemotherapy regimen called DT PACE.
