    <textblock>
      This will be an international, multicenter, uncontrolled, 2-stage, phase II study in adult
      patients with advanced gastric cancer, reasonable performance status, good organ function,
      lack of serious concomitant medical conditions. Patients must have progressed or recurred
      after a fluoropyrimidine-containing regimen at anytime for primary metastatic disease or
      within 6 months of last dose of adjuvant therapy. Twenty-one evaluable patients will be
      enrolled in Stage 1. If at least 2 objective tumor responses are observed in the first 21
      evaluable patients, the study will be expanded to enroll a total of 41 evaluable patients.
      Edotecarin will be administered at a starting dose of 13 mg/m2 as an IV infusion over 60
      minutes in repeated 3-week cycles treatment.

             chemo-radiation with curative intent

          -  Progression or recurrence after a fluoropyrimidine-containing regimen at any time for
             primary metastatic disease or within 6 months of last dose of adjuvant therapy

          -  Presence of at least 1 measurable (target) lesion. Target lesions are defined as those

             techniques or &gt;=10mm with spiral computerized tomography (CT) scan. Previously
             irradiated lesions will not be considered as target lesions.

          -  All previous therapies must have been discontinued at least 4 weeks before study
             entry, and all acute toxic effects (excluding alopecia or neurotoxicity) of any prior
             therapy must have resolved to NCI CTC (Version 2.0) Grade &lt;=1 (please see inclusion
             criteria #8 below for exceptions)

             upper limits of normal (ULN) regardless of liver involvement secondary to tumor SGOT
             &lt;= 2.5 x ULN; &lt;=5 x ULN if there is liver involvement secondary to tumor Albumin &gt;=3.0
             g/dL Pregnancy test for females of childbearing potential is negative within 7 days of

             adequately treated basal cell or squamous cell skin cancer or in situ carcinoma of the

             drug administration or may interfere with the interpretation of study results and, in
             the judgement of the investigator, would make the subject inappropriate for entry into
