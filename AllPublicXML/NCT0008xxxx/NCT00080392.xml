      This study will test the safety of a drug called EW-A-401 in patients with intermittent
      claudication - pain and discomfort in the legs due to blockages of the arteries. The study
      will also evaluate whether EW-A-401 improves blood flow to the legs. EW-A-401 contains
      genetic material (DNA) that instructs the body to produce specific proteins that promote the
      growth of new blood vessels and may, therefore, improve blood flow to the legs.

      Patients 21 years of age and older with pain or discomfort of one or both legs due to
      blockages of the arteries below the groin may be eligible for this study. Candidates are
      screened with a medical history, physical examination, blood and urine tests, eye
      examination, chest x-ray and CT scan of the chest, and treadmill tests. Patients who are able
      to exercise more than 12 minutes on the treadmill may not enroll in the study.

      Participants undergo the following procedures:

        -  Muscle biopsy: On the first day of the study, patients have a muscle biopsy. This
           procedure is done under local anesthesia with mild sedation. A 1-inch incision is cut
           into the skin over a calf muscle and a small amount of muscle tissue is removed for
           examination by a pathologist.

        -  Drug treatment and tests: About 10 to 13 days after the biopsy, patients are admitted to
           the NIH Clinical Center for 3 to 5 days for drug treatment and tests. They receive 10
           injections of either the study drug (EW-A-401) or placebo (an inactive substance) in
           each leg during a single session lasting about 1 hour. In addition, they have blood and
           urine tests, complete questionnaires about their symptoms, and undergo magnetic
           resonance imaging (MRI), a test that a magnetic field and radio waves to produce
           detailed images of body tissues and organs. For this procedure, the patient lies on a
           table that slides into the scanner (a large hollow tube) for imaging of the blood
           vessels in the legs. Patients wear headphones to muffle loud knocking and thumping
           sounds that occur during the scanning process.

        -  30-day follow-up: Patients return to the Clinical Center three times over 30 days
           following the hospital stay for a medical history, physical examination, and blood and
           urine tests to assess the safety of EW-A-401.

        -  Extended follow-up: Patients return to the Clinical Center at 3, 6, and 12 months after
           hospitalization for a medical history and physical examination, blood and urine tests,
           two treadmill tests, questionnaires about symptoms, and MRI studies, including imaging
           for blood flow measurement. Blood flow to the legs is measured during MRI using large
           blood pressure cuffs inflated around the legs during the scanning. The cuffs are
           inflated very tightly for 5 minutes, and then a dye is injected into an arm vein to
           brighten the images. Additional pictures are taken over the next 5 to 10 minutes. At two
           of these follow-up visits, patients also have an eye examination, and at the 3- or
           6-month visit they have a repeat muscle biopsy of the calf.

      The study lasts 12 months. After 6 months, patients will be told whether they received
      EW-A-401 or placebo. Because EW-A-401 is so new, patients will continue to be contacted every
      year after the study is completed.

    <textblock>
      Lower limb intermittent claudication, muscular pain with exercise relieved promptly by rest,
      is a disabling syndrome affecting over 10 million patients in the United States. Intermittent
      claudication is caused by peripheral artery atherosclerosis, the same disease causing heart
      attack. Peripheral artery atherosclerosis impairs blood flow to skeletal muscles in the lower
      limbs. Growth factors, such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF-A), have been shown
      in animal studies to improve blood flow the lower limbs by promoting the growth of new blood
      vessels.

      This clinical study tests the safety and feasibility of gene transfer of an agent (EW-A-401)
      intended to improve blood flow in the skeletal muscle of subjects with intermittent
      claudication. The investigational agent is a circle of genetic material (plasmid DNA) that
      instructs the body to produce a genetically-engineered transcription factor, a protein that
      regulates expression of genes. This specific transcription factor has been shown in animal
      studies to increase expression of the VEGF-A gene, and to promote the growth of new blood
      vessels. The study agent will be delivered by injection into leg muscle during a single
      session. This is the first human experience using this transcription factor.

      This study has a randomized, double-blind, dose-escalation, placebo-controlled design. The
      primary outcome measure will be safety and toxicity. In addition, we will collect exploratory
      effectiveness information including blood flow, walking capacity, quality of life, and
      inspection of blood vessels on samples of leg muscle.
