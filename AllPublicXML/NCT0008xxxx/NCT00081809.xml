      Primary Objectives:

        -  To document the efficacy of treatment with autologous lymphoma-derived HSPPC-96 of
           selected patients with indolent lymphoma. The efficacy endpoints are:

        -  the rate of complete and partial responses

        -  the time to progression.

      Secondary Objectives:

        -  To evaluate the safety and tolerability of autologous tumor-derived heat-shock protein
           peptide complex (HSPPC-96) administered intradermally once weekly for four consecutive
           weeks, followed by HSPPC-96 administered once every two weeks.

        -  To evaluate the feasibility of autologous HSPPC-96 preparation from lymphoma specimens.

        -  To assess approximately the composition of the tissue source of the autologous HSPPC-96
           for each patient.

        -  To study the effect of autologous lymphoma-derived HSPPC-96 vaccine therapy on the
           expression of Fas ligand and TRAIL death proteins in peripheral blood lymphocytes of
           patients with indolent lymphoma.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with previously treated or newly diagnosed follicular center cell grade I or
             grade II lymphoma, small lymphocytic lymphoma, MALT lymphoma, monocytoid B-cell
             lymphoma, Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia, or marginal zone lymphoma with
             bidimensionally measurable disease;

          -  Part of the resected specimen must undergo routine pathologic examination to confirm
             the diagnosis of lymphoma. The remaining tissue must be used for the preparation of
             autologous HSPPC-96;

          -  Autologous HSPPC-96 vaccine must be successfully prepared and provided by the sponsor;

          -  A minimum of 2 grams of non-necrotic, resectable malignant lymphoma for HSPPC-96
             preparation;

          -  Bidimensionally measurable disease in at least one location other than the resected
             lymphoid tissue;

          -  Life expectancy of at least 16 weeks;

          -  Zubrod performance status of less then or equal to 2;

          -  Adequate bone marrow function;

          -  Adequate hepatic function;

          -  Adequate renal function;

          -  Signed written informed consent;

          -  Patients of child-bearing potential must practice contraception, which is adequate in
             the opinion of the Principal Investigator;

          -  Patients of child-bearing potential must have a negative serum pregnancy test prior to
             entry into the study and must not be lactating;

          -  Patients must be willing to be followed at the M. D. Anderson Cancer Center during the
             course of treatment and follow-up;

          -  Electrocardiogram if none performed in the prior six months;

          -  Patients must have no chemotherapy, immunotherapy, radiotherapy, or experimental
             anti-cancer therapy within six weeks prior to starting autologous HSPPC-96
             administration;

          -  Patients must have fully recovered from prior anti-cancer therapy;

          -  Tumor measurements and staging no more than 4 weeks prior to receiving the first dose
             of autologous HSPPC-96.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with active or prior history of central nervous system lymphoma;

          -  Patients with serious intercurrent medical illnesses, requiring hospitalization;

          -  Patients with a history of primary or secondary immunodeficiency (other than related
             to the malignant lymphoma because treatment is dependent on functional immune system)
             or patients taking immunosuppressive drugs such as systemic corticosteroids;

          -  Women who are pregnant or lactating;

          -  Patients participating in another clinical trial;

          -  Patients receiving growth factors of any kind, including G-CSF, GM-CSF, or Epogen;

          -  Patients with bulky disease, defined as greater than 10 cm in diameter;

          -  Patients with positive HIV antibody;

          -  Patients with more than 4 previous treatment regimens will be excluded.
