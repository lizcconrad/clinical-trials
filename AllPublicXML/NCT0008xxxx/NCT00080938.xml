      RATIONALE: Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to damage tumor cells. Drugs such as
      temozolomide may make the tumor cells more sensitive to radiation therapy. Combining
      temozolomide with radiation therapy may kill more tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well giving temozolomide together with
      whole-brain radiation therapy works in treating patients with brain metastasis secondary to
      non-small cell lung cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Determine the intracranial response rate in patients with brain metastasis secondary to
           non-small cell lung cancer treated with whole brain radiotherapy and temozolomide.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the time to radiological progression in patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine the time to neurological progression (confirmed by magnetic resonance imaging
           (MRI)) in patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine the overall survival of patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine the toxicity of this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients undergo whole brain radiotherapy once daily, 5 days a week, for 2 weeks (10
      fractions). Patients also receive concurrent oral temozolomide once daily on days 1-14.

      Beginning 3 weeks after the completion of chemoradiotherapy, patients receive oral
      temozolomide once daily on days 1-5. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 6 courses in
      the absence of neurologic (Central Nervous System, CNS) progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients were followed every 3 months for 2 years.

      ACCRUAL: A total of 26 patients were accrued for this study.

    <description>Response was assessed per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumor (RECIST) by brain MRI in the 21 eligible and treated patients.Complete response (CR): complete disappearance of the clinically detectable malignant brain metastasis(es) being followed on MRI scan off corticosteroids and a stable or improving neurologic exam. Partial response (PR): greater than or equal to a 50% reduction in the sum of the product(s) of the maximal cross-sections on MRI scan with a stable or decreasing dose of corticosteroids and a stable or improving neurologic exam. Response = CR + PR</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>1-year Neurologic (Central Nervous System, CNS) Progression Free Rate</measure>
    <time_frame>assessed every 3 months for 2 years</time_frame>
    <description>1-year CNS progression free rate is the percentage of patients who had no CNS progression after being followed for 1 year . Progressive disease (CNS) was defined as a 25% or greater increase in the sum of the product(s) of the maximal cross-sections on MRI scan, reappearance of any lesion that has disappeared, development of any new lesion(s), stable disease with a deterioration of neurologic exam, or clear worsening of any evaluable disease.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Time to Non-CNS (Systemic) Progression</measure>
    <time_frame>assessed every 3 months for 2 years</time_frame>
    <description>Time to non-CNS progression was calculated from time of protocol entry to time of first systemic progressive disease or death. Patients alive and non-CNS progression-free at last follow-up were censored. Disease progression was defined as at least a 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum longest diameter (per RECIST criteria). Development of new lesions in non-CNS sites also constituted non-CNS progression. The 21 eligible and treated patients were included in the analysis.</description>

    <measure>Overall Survival Time</measure>
    <time_frame>assessed every 3 months for 2 years</time_frame>
    <description>Overall survival (months) was calculated from time of protocol entry to time of death from any cause. Patients alive at last follow-up were censored. The 21 eligible and treated patients were included in the analysis.</description>

        <description>Time to non-CNS progression was calculated from time of protocol entry to time of first systemic progressive disease or death. Patients alive and non-CNS progression-free at last follow-up were censored. Disease progression was defined as at least a 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum longest diameter (per RECIST criteria). Development of new lesions in non-CNS sites also constituted non-CNS progression. The 21 eligible and treated patients were included in the analysis.</description>
