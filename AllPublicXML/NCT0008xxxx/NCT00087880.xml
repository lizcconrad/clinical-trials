      The work adapts interventions that have been successful in the general populations, and
      tailors them to chronic smokers, who may have numerous previous smoking treatment failures.
      If successful it will: (1) make available a treatment intervention that produces hight long
      term abstinence rates; (2) provide information on variables that predicts success and failure
      in this population of smokers; (3) examine the cost-effectiveness of more intensive, longer
      term treatments.

    <description>Participants will start with a 21 mg nicotine patch, tapering to 14 mg patch and finally tapering to 7 mg patch. The nicotine patch will be administered on Week 3 of the program. Participants will meet with medical staff during Weeks 1, 2, 5, and 11. Five group counseling sessions must be attended by the participants. Assessments will be conducted on Weeks 12, 24, 36, 52, 64, and 104.</description>

The contents of these sessions will introduce additional information focusing on motivation, social support, mood management, weight gain, and dependence/withdrawal. Subjects will be contact by phone between counseling sessions (at Weeks 13, 15, 18, 22, 26, 30, 34, 36, 40, 48) for a brief check-in.</description>
