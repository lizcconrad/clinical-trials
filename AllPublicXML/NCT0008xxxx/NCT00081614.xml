  <brief_title>A Study Evaluating Tarceva in Combination With Avastin Versus Avastin Alone in Treating Metastatic Renal Cell Carcinoma</brief_title>
  <official_title>A Phase II, Multicenter, Randomized, Double-Blind Clinical Trial to Evaluate the Efficacy and Safety of Tarceva (Erlotinib Hydrochloride) in Combination With Avastin (Bevacizumab) Versus Avastin Alone for Treatment of Metastatic Renal Cell Carcinoma</official_title>

  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of the study is to assess the potential benefit of combining two targeted
      therapies (an anti-EGF inhibitor along with an anti-VEGF inhibitor). The goal will be to
      determine whether the addition of Erlotinib to Avastin will improve the benefit in metastatic
      renal cell carcinoma (RCC) with regard to time to progression, response rate, duration of
      response, and survival compared with Avastin alone. Since Avastin has been shown to be active
      in renal cancer, the goal will be to assess whether this activity can be enhanced with
      Erlotinib.
