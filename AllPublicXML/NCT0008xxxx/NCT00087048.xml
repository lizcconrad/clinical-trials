      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as topotecan, work in different ways to stop
      tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die.

      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well high-dose topotecan works as second-line
      therapy in treating patients with recurrent extensive-stage small cell lung cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Determine the overall survival of patients with recurrent extensive stage small cell
           lung cancer treated with high-dose topotecan hydrochloride.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the safety and toxic effects of this drug in these patients.

        -  Determine the recurrence-free survival of patients treated with this drug.

        -  Determine time to response and tumor response in patients treated with this drug.

        -  Determine the quality of life of patients treated with this drug.

      OUTLINE: This is a non-randomized, multicenter study.

      Patients receive high-dose topotecan hydrochloride IV over 30 minutes on days 1, 8, 15, 22,
      29, and 36. Treatment repeats every 56 days for 4 courses in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Quality of life is assessed at baseline, day 1 of each course (except course 1), at the end
      of study treatment, and then every 3 months thereafter.

      Patients are followed at 7-14 days and then every 3 months thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 65 patients will be accrued for this study.
