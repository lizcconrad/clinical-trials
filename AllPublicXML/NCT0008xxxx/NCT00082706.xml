      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as fluorouracil, leucovorin, gemcitabine, and
      cisplatin, work in different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or
      die. Combining more than one drug may kill more tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well giving fluorouracil together with
      leucovorin, gemcitabine, and cisplatin works in treating patients with metastatic or
      unresectable adenocarcinoma of the urothelium or urachal remnant (part of the bladder).

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Determine the response rate and overall survival of patients with metastatic or
           unresectable adenocarcinoma of the urothelium or urachal remnant treated with
           fluorouracil, leucovorin calcium, gemcitabine, and cisplatin.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the toxicity of this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients are stratified according to diagnosis (adenocarcinoma of the urothelium vs
      adenocarcinoma of the urachal remnant).

      Patients receive fluorouracil by vein (IV) continuously, leucovorin calcium IV once daily,
      and cisplatin IV once daily on days 1-5 and gemcitabine IV on days 1 and 5. Courses repeat
      every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are followed every 3-6 months.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 23-46 patients (7-18 with adenocarcinoma of the urachal remnant
      and 16-28 with adenocarcinoma of the urothelium) will be accrued for this study.

    <description>Complete Response: Participants counted as complete response if they have no radiological evidence of tumor, have no signs or symptoms of disease, and have normalized tumor markers (in those with initially elevated markers). Participants with an intact, tumor-containing bladder, must have a cystoscopy and exam under anesthesia to confirm a complete response. Partial response: Any response less than a complete response. Progressive disease: Progressive disease is at least 25% increase in tumor volume, or any new site of involvement, including the CNS. Increasing severity of symptoms, if judged by treating physician to be due to progressive disease, also counted as progression, even if these are not accompanied by an &quot;objective&quot; indicator. Any unequivocal increase (i.e. to greater than 5 mi.u./mL in beta-hCG) in a male patient taken to represent progressive disease, as will two consecutive rises amounting to a total of at least 125% of baseline for any other tumor marker.</description>

    <measure>Number of Patients with Dose-Limiting Toxicity</measure>
    <time_frame>Continous assessment during 21 day cycles</time_frame>
    <description>For each single arm trial, a stopping boundary also imposed to monitor toxicity of the new combination chemotherapy. Trial should be stopped for the 90% probability that the dose-limiting toxicity is greater than 40%. Participants monitored in groups of 3 sequentially. Stopping boundary obtained using a Bayesian monitoring rule.</description>

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Histologic proof of cancer originating from the urinary tract with adenocarcinoma as
             the predominant (&gt;/= 50%) histology. Dr. Czerniak and/or Dr. Tamboli will be consulted
             in equivocal cases of mixed histology. The Study Chairman is the final arbiter in
             questions of mixed histology.

          2. Bi-dimensionally measurable disease. All patients must have measurable or evaluable
             disease. In general, liver and lung lesions should be at least 1 cm, and patients with
             node-only disease should have lesions of &gt;/= 1.5 cm in greatest dimension. Patients
             with disease confined to bone may be eligible if a measurable lytic defect, or
             soft-tissue component in present. Those without measurable disease may be eligible if
             a serum marker is elevated (&gt;/= 4 x ULN) (ie: CEA, CA-125, CA19-9, bhCG, etc).

          3. (# 2 cont'd) The Study Chairman is the final arbiter in questions related to
             measurability. Patients with a three-dimensional mass or pelvic sidewall fixation on
             bladder examination under anesthesia are considered to have measurable disease.

          4. Patients are eligible if they have evidence of metastatic disease, or if their tumor
             is surgically unresectable. In the absence of grossly metastatic disease, all patients
             should be seen and evaluated by a member of the Urology staff to assess their
             potential for resection.

          5. Patients must have adequate physiologic reserves as evidenced by: • Life expectancy of
             at least 9 months (based on co-morbidity) &amp; at least 9 weeks based on the natural
             history of their cancer. • Zubrod Performance Status (PS) of &lt;/= 2; or 3 if of recent
             onset and due entirely to the cancer and not to comorbidity, and especially if the
             compromised performance status is due to uncontrolled pain which is expected to be
             rapidly reversible when therapy starts.

          6. (#5 cont'd) • Adequate bone marrow function as defined by absolute neutrophil count
             &gt;/= 1,800 and platelet count &gt;/= 150,000. Supranormal values judged to be of benign or
             inconsequential etiology are acceptable. • Transaminase (either SGPT or SGOT) &lt;/= 2x
             the upper limit of normal. • Conjugated bilirubin &lt;/= 2x the upper limit of normal. •
             Creatinine clearance (either measured or estimated using the formula of Cockcroft and
             Gault) of &gt;/= 35 mL/min: CLcr = [(140-age) • wt(kg)]/[72 •Creat (mg/dL)] (For females,
             x 0.85)

          7. Patients must sign an informed consent indicating that they are aware of the
             investigational nature of this study, in keeping with the policies of this hospital.

          8. Patients must be at least 6 weeks out from pelvic irradiation, and must not have had
             more than 10% of the bone marrow irradiated.

          9. Patients with a history of cardiac disease, or evidence of ischemic heart disease on
             EKG must have adequate cardiac function with an EF &gt;/= 40% to participate.

         10. Patient must be at least 18 years of age to participate in this study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients with metastases to the bladder from a primary adenocarcinoma arising outside
             the urinary tract are ineligible.

          2. Overt psychosis or mental disability or otherwise incompetent to give informed
             consent.

          3. A life threatening illness (unrelated to tumor) that would prevent completion of
             protocol therapy.

          4. Pregnant or nursing women, as the drug therapy regimen, and support medications pose
             significant potential risks to the fetus and newborn.

          5. Patients with second malignancies are eligible provided that the expected outcome from
             the second cancer is such that this will not interfere in the delivery of this
             therapy, or the assessment of response.

          6. Patients with uncontrolled CNS metastases are not eligible.
