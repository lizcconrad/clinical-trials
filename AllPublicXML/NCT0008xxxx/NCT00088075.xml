    <textblock>
      A clinical study to evaluate the efficacy, safety and tolerability of two dose ranges of
      risperidone (1 to 3 mg/day, and 4 to 6 mg/day) versus placebo (an inactive substance like a
      sugar pill) in adolescents (aged 13 to 17 years) with schizophrenia (i.e. abnormal behavior
      and thoughts). The study duration is about 6 to 7 weeks.

      Subjects will be aged 13 to 17 years with a diagnosis of schizophrenia. On enrollment,
      subjects will be assigned to receive 1 of 3 treatments (oral placebo tablets, oral
      risperidone tablets 1 to 3 mg, or oral risperidone tablets 4 to 6 mg), which will be
      administered daily for 6 weeks. Study medication will be increased to within the target
      dosage range during the first 7 days and then further increased until the maximum tolerated
      dose is achieved by day 14. The maximum tolerated dose will be maintained for the last 4
      weeks of the study, unless dose adjustments are agreed with the Sponsor. Risperidone (1 to 3
      mg or 4 to 6 mg) or placebo given orally as 0.5, 1, 2, 3, or 4 ,g tablets (or matching
      placebo) each day for 6 weeks.
