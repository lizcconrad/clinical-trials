    <textblock>
      RATIONALE: Gefitinib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking the enzymes necessary for
      their growth. Calcitriol may help tumor cells develop into normal cells. Dexamethasone may
      increase the effectiveness and decrease the side effects of gefitinib and calcitriol.

      PURPOSE: This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of calcitriol when
      given together with gefitinib or when given together with gefitinib and dexamethasone in
      treating patients with advanced solid tumors.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD), toxic effects, and tolerability of
           calcitriol alone and in combination with gefitinib with or without dexamethasone in
           patients with advanced solid tumors.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of these regimens in these patients.

        -  Determine any tumor responses in patients treated with these regimens.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of calcitriol.

        -  Stage 1: Patients receive calcitriol IV over 1 hour on days 1, 15, and 22 and oral
           gefitinib once daily on days 8-28 during course 1. For all subsequent courses, patients
           receive calcitriol IV over 1 hour on days 1, 8, 15, and 22 and oral gefitinib once daily
           on days 1-28. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or
           unacceptable toxicity.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of calcitriol with a fixed dose of gefitinib
      until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose
      preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.

        -  Stage 2: Patients receive calcitriol (beginning at 1 dose level below the MTD determined
           in stage 1) and gefitinib as in stage 1. Patients also receive oral dexamethasone once
           on the day before and twice on the day of each dose of calcitriol.

      Cohorts 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of calcitriol with fixed doses of gefitinib and
      dexamethasone until the MTD is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at
      which 2 of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 21-36 patients will be accrued for this study within 1 year.
