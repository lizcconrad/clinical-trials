      This study will identify abnormalities of a protein called alpha synuclein that is found in
      the brain of patients with Parkinson's disease and related disorders to see if it can serve
      as a disease marker. There is currently no treatment that will cure or delay progression of
      Parkinson's disease. Thus, there is a need to find disease markers that can help diagnosis
      the disease, follow its progression, and monitor the effects of treatment. This study will
      examine and compare alpha synuclein from blood and cerebrospinal fluid (the fluid that bathes
      the brain and spinal cord) of patients with Parkinson's disease, patients with variants of
      the disease, and healthy normal volunteers to determine differences in the protein that might
      serve as a disease marker.

      Patients with neurodegenerative disorders such as Parkinson's disease and Parkinson plus
      disorders (other diseases that are variants of Parkinson's disease) and healthy volunteers
      between 18 and 80 years of age may be eligible for this study. Candidates are screened with a
      medical history, physical examination, neurological evaluation, and blood tests. A brain MRI
      (magnetic resonance imaging) scan is done if needed for diagnosis.

      All participants have a blood sample drawn and a lumbar puncture (spinal tap). For the lumbar
      puncture, a local anesthetic is given and a needle is inserted in the space between the bones
      in the lower back where the cerebrospinal fluid circulates below the spinal cord. A small
      amount of fluid is collected through the needle. The fluid is analyzed for specific proteins
      and chemicals that are leaked from the brain in various disease states and that cannot be
      measured in blood.

      Participation of healthy volunteers is completed after the blood draw and lumbar puncture.
      Patients with Parkinson's and related diseases return to the clinic once a year for 2 years
      for a repeat blood draw and lumbar puncture to follow changes in the alpha synuclein protein
      and to monitor disease progression. Patients with specific proteins of interest may also be
      asked to come for a repeat lumbar puncture 6 months after the first procedure.

      OBJECTIVE: Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder of unknown
      etiology in which several underlying pathophysiological mechanisms including proteasomal
      degradation, mitochondrial dysfunction, inflammation, oxidative stress, and excitotoxicity
      may contribute to cell death. No treatment is known to cure or delay progression of PD, thus
      there is a need to investigate measurable biologic markers for the purpose of diagnosis,
      monitoring disease progression and effect of treatment. This study will focus on alpha
      synuclein and its metabolic pathways as a potential biomarker, to assist in evaluation of
      pathogenesis and future diagnostic and therapeutic options.

      STUDY POPULATION: In this pilot study we plan to include 30 patients with Parkinson's disease
      (PD), 30 patients with Parkinson plus disorders, and 30 control patients without neurologic
      disease or autoimmune disorders.

      DESIGN: Samples of serum, plasma and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) will be collected from all
      patients for analysis at the beginning of the study. The assay will be performed for various
      proteins including cytokines primarily related to the alpha synuclein (AS) pathway. A repeat
      CSF, plasma and serum analysis will be performed in patients with PD, and Parkinson plus
      disorders at the end of one and two years to follow changes of protein expression profiles
      with disease progression.

      ASSESSMENT OF RISKS AND BENEFITS: This study will carry the risk associated with venepuncture
      and lumbar puncture.

      OUTCOME ESTIMATE AND POTENTIAL MEANING FOR THE FIELD: The primary outcome measure is to
      correlate the changes of alpha synuclein phosphorylation in CSF, plasma and serum with
      changes in UPDRS motor score in patients with PD over the period of 2 years, compared to
      controls. The secondary aim of the study is to compare the protein expression profiles
      between different synucleinopathies including PD, Multiple System Atrophy (MSA) and Dementia
      with Lewy Bodies (DLB) with time. There are currently no validated surrogate disease markers
      in PD or other related neurodegenerative disorders. Our work would hopefully help understand
      pathophysiologic mechanisms in patients with PD, monitor disease progression using specific
      biologic markers, and in future development of targeted therapies.
