      RATIONALE: Chemoprevention therapy is the use of certain drugs to try to prevent the
      development or recurrence of cancer. Deslorelin combined with low-dose add-back estradiol and
      testosterone (given to replace hormones suppressed by deslorelin) may be effective in
      preventing breast cancer in at-risk women.

      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well giving deslorelin together with estradiol
      and testosterone works in preventing breast cancer in premenopausal women who are at high
      risk for this disease.

      OBJECTIVES:

      I. Assess the effects on the breast of treatment with the gonadotropin-releasing hormone
      agonist (GnRHA)-based regimen in breast cancer (BRCA) gene mutation carriers, including
      correlation of changes in mammographic and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) densities with
      tissue morphometrics and biomarkers.

      II. Evaluate perspectives about risk reduction options and impact on quality-of-life (QOL)
      measures of participation in the chemopreventive protocol and in risk reduction surgery.

      OUTLINE:

      GROUP 1: Patients receive deslorelin, estradiol, and testosterone intranasally once daily
      (QD) for 6 months. Patients then undergo planned risk reduction mastectomy.

      GROUP 2: Patients receive deslorelin, estradiol, and testosterone intranasally QD for 10
      months. Patients then undergo continued surveillance through 10 months.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 6 months for 2 years.
