      RATIONALE: Imaging procedures, such as fludeoxyglucose F18 positron emission tomography
      (^18FDG-PET), may improve the ability to detect disease progression and help doctors predict
      a patient's response to treatment and plan more effective treatment.

      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well ^18FDG-PET imaging works in detecting
      disease progression and determining response to treatment in patients who are undergoing
      chemoradiotherapy for locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Determine whether peak standardized uptake value (SUV) for fludeoxyglucose F 18 positron
           emission tomography (FDG-PET) shortly after definitive chemoradiotherapy is predictive
           of long-term survival of patients with inoperable stage IIB or III non-small cell lung
           cancer.

      Secondary

        -  Determine whether max SUV for FDG-PET shortly after definitive chemoradiotherapy is
           predictive of long-term survival in these patients.

        -  Determine whether post-treatment imaging using peak and max SUV for FDG-PET shortly
           after definitive chemoradiotherapy is predictive of local disease control in these
           patients.

        -  Determine whether pre-treatment imaging using these techniques is predictive of
           long-term survival and local disease control in these patients.

        -  Correlate, if possible, Ki-67 expression with overall survival of patients assessed with
           these imaging techniques.

      OUTLINE: This is a diagnostic, multicenter study.

      Before starting chemoradiotherapy, patients undergo baseline whole-body positron emission
      tomography (PET) imaging. Patients receive fludeoxyglucose F 18 (^18FDG) IV followed 50-70
      minutes later by PET imaging. Patients then receive concurrent definitive radiotherapy and
      chemotherapy. Patients enrolled in other treatment-oriented clinical trials receive therapy
      as per that trial. Other patients receive standard thoracic radiotherapy (dose ≥ 60 Gy) and
      standard chemotherapy comprising a platin (cisplatin or carboplatin) and a second non-platin,
      non-gemcitabine drug (etoposide, vinblastine, vinorelbine, paclitaxel, or docetaxel).
      Approximately 14 weeks after completion of chemoradiotherapy and adjuvant chemotherapy (if
      given), patients undergo post-treatment ^18FDG-PET imaging.

      Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years and then every 6 months for at least 1 year.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 250 patients (including at least 75 with stage IIB/IIIA disease
      and at least 75 with stage IIIB disease) will be accrued for this study within 2 years.
