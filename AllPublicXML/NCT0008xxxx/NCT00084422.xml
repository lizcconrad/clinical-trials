      RATIONALE: CEP-701 may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking the enzymes necessary for
      their growth.

      PURPOSE: This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of CEP-701 in treating
      young patients with recurrent or refractory high-risk neuroblastoma.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Determine the maximum tolerated dose of CEP-701 in pediatric patients with recurrent or
           refractory high-risk neuroblastoma.

        -  Determine the dose-limiting toxicity of this drug in these patients.

        -  Determine the pharmacokinetic behavior of this drug in these patients.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the degree of TrkB tyrosine kinase inhibition activity present in the serum of
           patients treated with this drug.

        -  Correlate the degree of TrkB tyrosine kinase inhibition activity in these patients with
           dose level, pharmacokinetics, and antitumor activity data of this drug.

        -  Determine the antitumor activity of this drug in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is an open-label, dose-escalation, multicenter study.

      Patients receive oral CEP-701 twice daily* on days 1-5, 8-12, 15-19, and 22-26. Courses
      repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      NOTE: *On day 1 of course 1 only, patients receive oral CEP-701 once instead of twice.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of CEP-701 until the maximum tolerated dose
      (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2 of 6
      patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. Once the MTD is determined, the dose level is
      expanded up to 9 patients.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 60 patients will be accrued for this study.
