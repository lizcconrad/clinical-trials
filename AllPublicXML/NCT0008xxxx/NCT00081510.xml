      Primary Objective(s):

        -  To compare the activity (progression-free survival [PFS]) of anastrozole in combination
           with lonafarnib to that of anastrozole in combination with placebo in subjects with
           hormone-sensitive ADVANCED breast cancer.

      Secondary Objective(s):

        -  To determine the effects of anastrozole in combination with lonafarnib on objective
           response, duration of response, overall survival, and safety in subjects with advanced
           breast cancer. To assess the exposure and pharmacokinetics of lonafarnib and anastrozole
           in the subject population.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Postmenopausal women who have histologically-confirmed breast cancer with the
             following characteristics:

               -  estrogen and/or progesterone receptor positive,

               -  locally advanced disease

               -  distant metastatic disease, stage 4

          -  Subjects eligible for single-agent treatment with aromatase inhibitors for current
             disease.

          -  Subjects taking biophosphonates are allowed if they begin bisphosphonate therapy AT
             LEAST two weeks prior to randomization.

          -  Measurable disease (masses with clearly defined margins on radiological images and at
             least one diameter &gt;=20 mm[&gt;=10 mm if spiral CT]) or evaluable disease (masses with
             margins not clearly defined on radiological images or with no diameter &gt;= 20 mm).
             Subjects with bone disease only are permitted if disease is evaluable.

             advanced disease.

          -  Subjects with with CLINICALLY APPARENT brain metastases or extensive visceral disease,
