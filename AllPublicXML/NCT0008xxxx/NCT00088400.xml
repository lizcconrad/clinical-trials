      Study Objectives:

      Primary Objective:

      To evaluate the efficacy of intratumoral/interstitial therapy with TransMID compared to best
      standard of care in patients with progressive and/or recurrent, non-resectable glioblastoma
      multiforme.

      Secondary Objectives:

      To assess the safety of intratumoral/interstitial therapy with TransMID compared to best
      standard of care in patients with progressive and/or recurrent, non-resectable glioblastoma
      multiforme.

      To evaluate possible differences in efficacy and/or safety with TransMID associated with
      differing degrees of transferrin receptor expression in tumor tissue and serum
      anti-diphtheria toxin antibody titer levels.

      Study Design:

      Multicenter, open label, randomized study comparing TransMID with a chemotherapeutic regimen
      considered to be best standard of care and consisting of either nitrosureas, platinum
      compounds, temozolomide, procarbazine or PCV (procarbazine, lomustine (CCNU) &amp; vincristine).
      A planned interim analysis of the primary efficacy endpoint will be conducted after
      approximately 50 percent of the required events have been observed.

        INCLUSION CRITERIA:

        Patients will be included in the study if they meet all of the following criteria:

          1. Male or female at least 18 years of age.

          2. Histological results confirming GBM are available.

          3. Progressive GBM (greater than or equal to 25 percent increase in contrast enhanced
             tumor CSA compared to the nadir or smallest previous measured CSA) and/or recurrent
             GBM after conventional treatment, including surgery (biopsy or debulking surgery)
             and/or radiation therapy and/or chemotherapy.

          4. Pre-study MRIs used to determine current progression and/or recurrence of GBM are
             available to the Investigator and for independent confirmation of progression and/or
             recurrence.

          5. Patient is not considered a candidate for resection.

          6. If female of child-bearing potential, a reliable method of contraception must be
             combined with a negative pregnancy test before entering the study (female patients
             must be willing to use contraception for 2 months after the last treatment with
             TransMID (Trademark)). Male patients must be willing to use a barrier method of
             contraception for up to 2 months after the last treatment with TransMID (Trademark)

          7. Able and willing to follow instructions and comply with the protocol.

          8. Provide written informed consent prior to participation in the study.

          9. Karnofsky Performance Scale Score 70-100.

         10. Tumor characteristics:

             i) must be unifocal; and

        ii) must be unilateral and supratentorial; and

        iii) lesion must have a diameter (on contrast-enhanced MRI) greater than or equal to 1.0 cm
