      RATIONALE: Inserting a gene that has been created in the laboratory into a person's white
      blood cells may make the body build an immune response to kill tumor cells. Interleukin-2 may
      stimulate a person's white blood cells to kill tumor cells. Vaccines may make the body build
      an immune response to kill tumor cells. Combining gene-modified white blood cell infusions
      with interleukin-2 and vaccine therapy may kill more tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: This phase I trial is studying how well giving gene-modified white blood cells when
      given together with interleukin-2 and vaccine therapy works in treating patients with
      metastatic melanoma.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Determine, preliminarily, any clinical tumor regression in lymphodepleted patients with
           metastatic melanoma treated with fowlpox gp100 antigen immunization and antitumor
           antigen T-cell receptor (TCR)-engineered tumor infiltrating lymphocytes or CD8+
           autologous peripheral blood lymphocytes followed by interleukin-2.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the in vivo survival of TCR gene-engineered cells in patients treated with
           this regimen.

      OUTLINE: Patients are stratified according to their ability to produce tumor-infiltrating
      lymphocytes (TIL) (yes vs no).

      Patients receive lymphodepleting chemotherapy comprising cyclophosphamide IV over 1 hour on
      days -7 and -6 and fludarabine IV over 30 minutes on days -5 to -1.

        -  Stratum 1 (TIL): Patients receive TIL retrovirally transduced with gp100 antigen TCR
           gene IV over 20-30 minutes on day 0*.

        -  Stratum 2 (CD8+peripheral blood lymphocytes [PBL]): Patients receive CD8+PBL
           retrovirally transduced with gp100 antigen TCR gene IV over 20-30 minutes on day 0*.

      NOTE: *Day 0 is 1-4 days after the last dose of fludarabine.

      Patients in both strata also receive fowlpox-gp100 vaccine (before TIL/PBL infusion) IV over
      1-2 minutes on days 0 and 28 and high-dose interleukin-2 (IL-2) IV over 15 minutes every 8
      hours on days 0-4 and days 28-32. Patients also receive G-CSF SC once daily beginning on day
      0 and continuing until blood counts recover.

      Treatment continues in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Beginning
      6-8 weeks after the last dose of vaccine and high-dose IL-2, patients with stable or
      responding disease may receive 1 retreatment course.

      Responding patients are followed at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months and then annually thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 61 patients will be accrued for this study.
