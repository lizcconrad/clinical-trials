    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, open-label, multicenter, parallel-groups study of multiple intravenous
      doses of Puricase, administered intravenously, in 40 patients with symptomatic gout. Subjects
      must wash out of any uric acid-lowering agents for one week before being dosed, and must
      refrain from using such agents throughout the study.

          -  Women of childbearing potential must have a negative serum pregnancy test and must use
             an approved birth control method during their participation in the protocol. Such
             methods include oral, injectable, or implantable contraceptives; IUDs and barrier

          -  History of end stage renal disease requiring dialysis

          -  History of liver disease, as defined by baseline serum transaminase elevation &gt;3X the

          -  Concurrent use of uric acid-lowering agents

          -  Prior treatment with Puricase® or other recombinant uricase

          -  An acute gout flare within one week prior to first treatment with Puricase® (exclusive
             of chronic synovitis/arthritis) requiring use of medication which violates the
             protocol

          -  glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency
