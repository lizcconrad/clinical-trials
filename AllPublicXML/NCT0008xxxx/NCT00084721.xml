      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as irinotecan, work in different ways to stop
      tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Celecoxib may stop the growth of tumor
      cells by blocking the enzymes necessary for their growth. Giving irinotecan with celecoxib
      may kill more tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of irinotecan when
      given with celecoxib in treating patients with unresectable or metastatic colorectal cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Determine the maximum tolerated dose of irinotecan when administered with celecoxib in
           patients with unresectable or metastatic colorectal cancer.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the dose-limiting toxic effects and non-dose-limiting toxic effects of this
           regimen in these patients.

        -  Determine the incidence and intensity of diarrhea and myelotoxicity in patients treated
           with this regimen.

        -  Determine any responses in patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine potential mechanisms for irinotecan-induced diarrhea and protective effects of
           celecoxib on diarrhea prevention in patients treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of irinotecan. Patients are assigned to 1 of 2
      treatment groups.

        -  Group I: Patients receive a fixed dose of irinotecan IV over 90 minutes on days 1, 8,
           15, and 22 and oral celecoxib twice daily on days 10-42. Courses repeat every 42 days in
           the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

        -  Group II: Patients receive irinotecan as in group I at escalating doses and oral
           celecoxib twice daily on days 0-42. Treatment continues as in group I.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of irinotecan until the maximum tolerated
      dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2
      of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 18-30 patients (9 for group I, 9-21 for group II) will be
      accrued for this study within 1-2 years.
