  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This randomized phase II trial is studying how well cilengitide works in treating patients
      with unresectable stage III or stage IV melanoma. Cilengitide may stop the growth of melanoma
      by stopping blood flow to the tumor.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the clinical efficacy of EMD 121974 at two different doses in patients with
      metastatic melanoma by determining the progression-free survival rate at 8 weeks.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the response rate of EMD 121974 in patients with metastatic melanoma.

      II. To determine the overall survival in patients who receive EMD 121974. III. To determine
      the safety and toxicity of EMD 121974 in patients with metastatic melanoma.

      IV. To determine the population pharmacokinetics of EMD 121974. V. To determine the
      biological activity of EMD 121974 in melanoma cells of patients who are treated with the
      drug.

      VI. To evaluate the use of optical imaging and functional dynamic imaging scans in assessing
      biological activity of EMD 121974.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, double-blind study. Patients are stratified according to prior
      systemic treatment (yes vs no), visceral metastases (yes vs no), serum lactic dehydrogenase
      level (normal vs abnormal), and tumor integrin α_vβ_3 overexpression (yes vs no). Patients
      are randomized into 1 of 2 treatment arms.

      ARM I: Patients receive cilengitide IV over 1 hour on days 1, 4, 8, 11*, 15, 18, 22, and 25.
      Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      NOTE: *For the first course only, treatment is omitted on day 11.

      ARM II: Patients receive cilengitide as in arm I at a higher dose.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 3 months for 1 year and then
      every 6 months thereafter.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients must have histologically or cytologically confirmed stage IV or unresectable
             stage III metastatic melanoma of cutaneous, mucosal or unknown origin

          -  Patients must have measurable disease, defined as at least one lesion that can be
             accurately measured in at least one dimension (longest diameter to be recorded) as &gt;=
             15 mm with conventional techniques or with spiral CT scan; in case of obviously
             visible cutaneous metastatic lesions, the margins of the lesions should be clearly
             defined and measured in at least one dimension as &gt;= 10 mm

          -  Patient may have received prior interferon therapy (only in an adjuvant setting for
             resected stage III melanoma) and/or up to 1 prior systemic treatment regimen
             (chemotherapy, biotherapy, or biochemotherapy) for stage IV disease; active vaccine
             therapy will not be considered as &quot;prior systemic treatment&quot;

          -  Radiographic studies used to assess disease must have been performed within 21 days
             prior to registration; if a target lesion has been previously embolized, perfused or
             irradiated, there must be objective evidence of progression before start of therapy to
             be considered for response assessment

          -  ECOG performance status ≤ 2 (or Karnofsky ≥ 60%)

          -  Leukocytes &gt;= 3,000/microL

          -  Absolute neutrophil count &gt;= 1,500/microL

          -  Platelets &gt;= 100,000/microL

          -  Total bilirubin =&lt; 1.5 X institutional upper limit of normal

          -  ALT(SGPT) =&lt; 2.5 X institutional upper limit of normal

          -  Creatinine =&lt; 1.5 X institutional upper limit of normal

          -  Patient must have a hemoglobin &gt;= 9 gm/dL (this may be achieved by transfusion if
             needed) obtained within 14 days prior to registration; in case that PRBC transfusion
             is needed to obtain a hemoglobin level of &gt;= 9 gm/dL, the hemoglobin level should not
             be reduced more than 1 gm/dL for at least 1 week

          -  The effects of EMD 121974 on the developing human fetus at the recommended therapeutic
             dose are unknown; for this reason and because antiangiogenic agents are known to be
             teratogenic, women of child-bearing potential and men must agree to use adequate
             contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study
             entry and for the duration of study participation; should a woman become pregnant or
             suspect she is pregnant while participating in this study, she should inform her
             treating physician immediately

          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with metastatic melanoma of choroidal origin

          -  Patients must not have received the following drugs prior to enrollment: endostatin,
             angiostatin, bevacizumab or any integrin-targeted drugs

          -  Subjects who require concurrent treatment with a non-permitted medication (such as
             anticoagulant therapy other than for flushing of intravenous port device, or used for
             thrombosis prophylaxis)

          -  Patients who have had chemotherapy or radiotherapy within 4 weeks (6 weeks for
             nitrosoureas or mitomycin C) prior to entering the study or those who have not
             recovered to grade 1 toxicity from adverse events due to agents administered more than
             4 weeks earlier

          -  Patients may not be receiving any other investigational agents

          -  Patients with known brain metastases should be excluded from this clinical trial
             because of their poor prognosis and because they often develop progressive neurologic
             dysfunction that would confound the evaluation of neurologic and other adverse events;
             however, the following is the exception; patients who have no radiographical evidence
             of recurrences in the brain for at least 3 months after the complete resection of the
             brain metastases or who have asymptomatic brain metastases stable for at least 3
             months since the whole brain radiation therapy and/or stereotactic radiosurgery will
             be eligible for this study; patients must not require a steroid treatment for brain
             metastases

          -  Subjects with a history of wound-healing disorders, advanced coronary disease (such as
             unstable angina pectoris or arrhythmia LOWN IV [defined as 2 or more consecutive
             ventricular premature complexes], cardiac or cardiovascular abnormalities NYHA
             III/IV), or with a recent history (within 6 months) of peptic ulcer disease

          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac
             arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with
             study requirements

          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because EMD 121974 is an antiangiogenic
             agent with the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects; because there is an
             unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to
             treatment of the mother with EMD 121974, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the
             mother is treated with EMD 121974; lactating women must not breastfeed

          -  No other prior malignancy is allowed except for the following: adequately treated
             basal cell or squamous cell skin cancer, in situ cervical cancer, adequately treated
             Stage I or II cancer from which the patient is currently in complete remission, or any
             other cancer from which the patient has been disease-free for 5 years
