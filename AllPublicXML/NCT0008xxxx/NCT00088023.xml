      The purpose of this study is to determine the safety of a short intravenous infusion of
      PT-523 to patients with solid tumors who have failed curative or survival prolonging therapy
      or for whom no such therapies exist.

    <textblock>
      The primary objectives of this study are 1) to evaluate the safety of a short intravenous
      infusion of PT-523 when administered on days 1, 8, and 15 of a 28-day cycle to patients with
      solid tumors who have failed curative or survival prolonging therapy or for whom no such
      therapies exist; and 2) to establish the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and identify the dose
      limiting toxicities (DLT) of PT-523.

      The secondary objectives of this study are to determine the pharmacokinetics and to evaluate
      preliminary efficacy of PT-523.
