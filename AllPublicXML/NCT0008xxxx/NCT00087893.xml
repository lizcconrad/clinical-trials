      To investigate the relationship of vascular cell phenotypes to atherosclerosis.

      BACKGROUND:

      Currently, the predominant hypothesis regarding atherosclerosis is that it is in major part
      driven by two independent pathways: hyperlipidemia (the &quot;stimulation&quot;) and inflammation (the
      &quot;response&quot;). Although vascular cells mediate the influence of inflammation on
      atherosclerosis, very little is known about vascular cell epidemiology and the relationship
      of vascular cell phenotypes to atherosclerosis. The main hypothesis tested in this study is
      that variation in vascular cell biology is related to the population variation in
      atherosclerosis.

      DESIGN NARRATIVE:

      The cross-sectional study will be nested within a large cohort study, the Multiethnic Study
      of Atherosclerosis (MESA). A partial sample of 1,000 individuals who have undergone other
      special laboratory analyses will be identified and new measures collected as part of their
      upcoming site visit. A number of novel cellular phenotypes describing the innate immune
      response (monocyte activation, natural killer and T cell counts), the adaptive immune
      response (TH1 and TH2 helper cells, and memory T cells), and vessel integrity (circulating
      endothelial progenitor cells) will be measured in these participants. Plasma constituents
      will also be measured that relate to the cellular phenotypes. The overall goal is to test the
      hypothesis that these novel phenotypes are associated with subclinical atherosclerosis in the
      coronary and carotid arteries assessed by quantification of coronary calcification (CAC) and
      B-mode ultrasound (CIMT), in addition to the other subclinical measures available from the
      MESA cohort.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>T helper bias</measure>
    <time_frame>2008</time_frame>
    <description>T helper bias is a stable phenotype in people, with few environmental drives; the main environmental driver appears to be anti-CMV titer; this has led to our view that genetics probably plays a role, and our current GWAS efforts using our unique MESA-Inflammation cellular phenotypes.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>T helper bias toward Th1 cells</measure>
    <time_frame>2008</time_frame>
    <description>T helper bias towards Th1 cells is strongly associated with measures of atherosclerosis in the population-based study MESA-Inflammation (both coronary calcification and carotid wall thickness) after fully adjusting for traditional and novel CVD risk factors. This is consistent with our original hypothesis, based on small human studies and mouse data.</description>
