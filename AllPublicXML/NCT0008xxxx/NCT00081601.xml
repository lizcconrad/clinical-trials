  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the proportion of patients with a serological
      prostate specific antigen (PSA) by day 85.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A serological PSA response is defined as a reduction from baseline PSA serum concentration of
      at least 50%, which is confirmed by a second PSA value 28 or more days later.
