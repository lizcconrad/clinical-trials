  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study investigates the effects of the glucocorticoid hormone cortisol on brain structure
      and function. Patients with Cushing's disease are studied before and after treatment. Brain
      imaging and neuropsychologic tests are used to study changes in the hippocampus and thinking
      and learning functions as well as mood during the period of elevated cortisol. At several
      intervals after treatment, these are reexamined to study the degree of reversibility of the
      abnormalities. The contribution of cortisol as well as testosterone and estrogen to
      dysfunction and recovery is studied. Since elevated cortisol and dysregulation of its
      secretory system occurs in a significant proportion of the aged and in Alzheimers Disease and
      Major Depressive Disorder, these studies will help advance knowledge of the role of cortisol
      in these conditions.
