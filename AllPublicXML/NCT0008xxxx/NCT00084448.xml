      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as paclitaxel, work in different ways to stop
      tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Celecoxib may stop the growth of
      cancer by stopping blood flow to the tumor and may increase the effectiveness of paclitaxel
      by making tumor cells more sensitive to the drug. Giving celecoxib together with paclitaxel
      may kill more tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well giving paclitaxel together with celecoxib
      works in treating patients with recurrent or persistent platinum-resistant ovarian epithelial
      or primary peritoneal cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the antitumor activity of paclitaxel and celecoxib in patients with recurrent
           or persistent platinum-resistant ovarian epithelial or primary peritoneal cancer.

        -  Determine the nature and degree of toxicity of this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive paclitaxel IV over 1 hour on days 1, 8, and 15 and oral celecoxib twice
      daily on days 2-6, 9-13, and 16-27. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years and then every 6 months for 3 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 19-51 patients will be accrued for this study within 11-22
      months.
