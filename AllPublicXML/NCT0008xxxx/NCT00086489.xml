    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Histologically confirmed: Stage III (AJCC 6th edition)xxl unresectable melanoma, with
             measurable disease (either locally relapsed unresectable, in-transit lesions or
             unresectable draining nodes) or Stage IV melanoma, including:

          -  Metastasis to skin, subcutaneous tissues or distant lymph nodes, or

          -  Metastasis to lungs, or

          -  Metastasis to all other visceral sites with either LDH &lt;= ULN (upper limit of normal)
             or a single site of metastasis

          -  Note: Patients with melanoma of ocular origin will be considered ineligible

          -  Documented progressive disease following adjuvant therapy, localized therapy or other
             therapy for metastatic disease

          -  Measurable disease defined by at least one target lesion that can be accurately
             measured and whose size is at least 1.0 cm (by spiral CT) or 2.0 cm (by conventional
             techniques) in its longest diameter

          -  ECOG performance status of 0 or 1 Life expectancy of &gt; 3 months

          -  Either gender, aged 18 years and above

          -  Adequate bone marrow, hepatic, and renal functions determined within 2 weeks prior to
             starting therapy, defined as:

          -  Absolute neutrophil count &gt;= 1.5 x 10(9)cells/L

          -  Platelets &gt;= 100 x 10(9)/L

          -  Hemoglobin &gt;= 10 g/dL

          -  Aspartate and alanine aminotransferases (AST, ALT) &lt;= 2.5 x ULN (&lt;= 5 x ULN, if
             documented liver metastases are present)

          -  Total bilirubin &lt;= 1.5 x ULN

          -  Creatinine &lt;= 1.5 x ULN

          -  Patients must have recovered from all prior treatment related toxicities, to baseline
             status, or a CTC grade of 0 or 1. Post-surgical pain shall not be considered a basis
             for exclusion.

          -  Females must either be not of childbearing potential [surgically sterilized, which
             includes tubal ligation, or at least 2 years postmenopausal; not breastfeeding], or
             practicing 1 form of approved contraception for at least three months prior to entry

          -  History of, or significant evidence of risk for, chronic inflammatory or autoimmune
             disease (e.g. Addison's disease, asthma, celiac disease, multiple sclerosis, Graves
             Disease, Hashimoto's thyroiditis, inflammatory bowel disease, psoriasis, rheumatoid
             arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, etc.)

          -  Potential requirement for systemic corticosteroids or concurrent immunosuppressive
             drugs based on prior history.

          -  History of autoimmune colitis or other chronic gastrointestinal conditions associated
             with diarrhea or bleeding, or current acute colitis of any origin.

          -  Pregnant or lactating women.

          -  Dementia or significantly altered mental status that would prohibit the understanding
             or rendering of informed consent and compliance with the requirements of this

          -  Diagnosed or suspected brain metastases. Patients with past history of brain
             metastases but with no radiologic evidence within 12 weeks prior to enter into the
             protocol will be eligible.

          -  Any serious uncontrolled medical disorder or active infection, which would impair
             their ability to receive study treatment.
