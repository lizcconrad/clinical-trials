      RATIONALE: Tissue plasminogen activator and captopril may help the body generate angiostatin.
      Angiostatin may stop the growth of cancer by stopping blood flow to the tumor.

      PURPOSE: This phase I/II trial is studying the side effects and best dose of tissue
      plasminogen activator and captopril and to see how well they work in treating patients with
      progressive metastatic cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Determine the maximum tolerated dose and toxicity of captopril and tissue plasminogen
           activator (tPA) in patients with progressive metastatic cancer.

        -  Determine the in vivo generation of angiostatin by western analysis in patients treated
           with this regimen.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the antitumor effect of this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.

      Patients receive tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) IV over 6 hours and oral captopril twice
      daily on days 1-5. Courses repeat every 14 days for up to 1 year in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients who achieve a complete response (CR) receive 2
      additional courses beyond CR.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of tPA and captopril until the maximum
      tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2
      of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.
