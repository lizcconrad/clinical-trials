  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Alternative medicine has received increasing attention from both the scientific and public
      communities. While the majority of current alternative medicine use is the result of interest
      in replacing or augmenting formal medical treatments, several cultures have long-standing
      traditions of herbal medicine use, particularly among older, more traditional members.
      Research in this area has been limited primarily to small-scale studies that identify herbal
      remedies popular in specific cultures. This study observes older Mexican Americans because a
      substantial proportion of this population continue to utilize traditional herbal remedies in
      their everyday life.
