    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the effectiveness of different doses of epoetin
      alfa for treating anemia in patients who have cancer; or patients who no longer have any
      signs of cancer, but remain anemic as a result of their treatment. These patients should not
      be currently receiving chemotherapy or radiotherapy. A subject's participation in the study
      will last approximately 6 months. Subjects will receive weekly doses of epoetin alfa or
      placebo. Their hemoglobin will be tested every week.
