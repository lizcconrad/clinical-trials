      RATIONALE: Screening tests, such as nipple aspiration, ductal lavage, and breast duct
      endoscopy, may help doctors detect cancer cells early and plan more effective treatment for
      breast cancer.

      PURPOSE: This clinical trial is studying how well nipple aspiration, ductal lavage, and
      breast duct endoscopy work in detecting cancer cells in healthy women who are at
      moderate-to-high risk of developing breast cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Determine the incidence of mild or severe cellular atypia in nipple aspirate fluid of
           healthy women at moderate to high risk of developing breast cancer, defined by family
           history or prior atypical biopsy.

      Secondary

        -  Correlate cellular atypia with breast cancer, biochemical tumor markers, growth factors,
           and genetic and protein markers in these participants.

        -  Determine cancer risk and incidence utilizing these methods of screening in these
           participants.

        -  Observe the natural history of atypia in these participants over a total of 10 years.

        -  Determine whether these techniques may serve as supplementary tools in future screening
           of these participants.

      OUTLINE: Participants under 50 years of age undergo nipple aspiration every twelve months for
      3 years. Participants over 50 years of age undergo nipple aspiration every 18 months for 4.5
      years.

      Participants with significant cellular atypia in nipple aspirate fluid undergo ductal lavage
      and endoscopy.

      Participants are followed annually for a total of 10 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 1,000 participants will be accrued for this study within
      approximately 4 years.
