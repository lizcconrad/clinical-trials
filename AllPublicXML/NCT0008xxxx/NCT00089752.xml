      The purpose of this study is to determine whether functional status improves in individuals
      with milder obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) following continuous positive airway pressure
      (CPAP) treatment.

      BACKGROUND:

      OSA is characterized as mild, moderate, or severe, according to the number of respiratory
      disturbances per hour of sleep (RDI), as defined by the American Academy of Sleep Medicine.
      CPAP is the primary treatment for sleep apnea. The column of pressure delivered to the upper
      airway by this device immediately eliminates the respiratory disturbances when it is applied.
      There is evidence from randomized controlled studies that CPAP also improves functional
      status, and the key manifestation of OSA, including excessive daytime sleepiness, in
      individuals with severe OSI (i.e., RDI greater than 30). However, there has been limited
      research exploring improvement in functional status in individuals with less severe OSA
      (i.e., those with mild OSA and RDI of 5-15 or moderate OSA and RDI of 16-30). The large
      placebo effect that has been reported in controlled studies of OSA-associated functional
      outcomes mandates the need for a placebo in studies evaluating the true impact of this
      treatment. Results from the three randomized controlled studies in milder OSA that have
      examined this issue have been equivocal, principally because of serious methodological
      limitations. It remains unclear whether CPAP treatment improves daily functioning in those
      with milder OSA (RDI 5-30). This is a critical issue as this level of disease severity
      represents the largest segment of OSA and comprises 15% of the U.S. population.

      DESIGN NARRATIVE:

      Using Granger's model of functional assessment, this study will examine whether functional
      status improves in participants with milder OSA following CPAP treatment. The study will
      employ a randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel study design, and will use a sham CPAP
      device as the placebo in participants with significant daytime sleepiness. The study will
      test the hypothesis that the change in functional status (measured by the Functional Outcomes
      of Sleep Questionnaire) after 8 weeks of treatment will be greater for participants treated
      with active CPAP compared to the placebo. Secondary aims of the study include examining
      whether CPAP also improves daytime sleepiness, and determining whether CPAP can reduce
      nocturnal blood pressure to lower the risk for stroke and hypertension linked to OSA.

    <description>The primary endpoint is change after 8 weeks of treatment from baseline value (controlling for baseline value) in the 30-item Functional Outcomes of Sleep Questionnaire (FOSQ) that will be used to test the primary study hypothesis that patients with milder OSA (RDI 5-30) on active treatment will demonstrate greater mean change for the Total score from baseline to 8 weeks treatment. The FOSQ is designed to assess the impact of excessive sleepiness on functional status. The instrument has established content validity, test-retest reliability (r= 0.91), and internal consistency (alpha = 0.96). The scale ranges from 5 - 20 with normal functional status being a value greater than 17.</description>

    <time_frame>Measured at Baseline and Week 8 treatment in the ITT sample</time_frame>
    <description>Change in the score from baseline to 8 weeks treatment, controlling for baseline, in the POMS is a reliable and valid measure of mood states that consists of 65 adjectives on which subjects' rate themselves as they feel &quot;today&quot; using a five-point scale. There are six mood or affective states on this test derived through factor analysis: Tension-Anxiety (score range 0-36), Depression-Dejection (score range 0 - 60), Anger-Hostility (score range 0-48), Vigor-Activity (score range 0-32), Fatigue-Inertia (score range 0-28), and Confusion-Bewilderment (score range 0-28). There is also a summary Total Mood Disturbance (TMD) score that gives a Total estimate of affective state score range 0-200). Higher scores indicate greater disability.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline and 8 weeks of treatment in the ITT sample</time_frame>
    <description>Change in the score from baseline to 8 weeks treatment, controlling for baseline, in the PVT is an objective assessment of sleepiness and measures decrements in neurobehavioral performance due to sleepiness, i.e., ability to sustain attention and respond in a timely manner to salient signals.(7) The PVT yields five highly informative metrics on the capacity for sustained attention and vigilance performance: frequency of lapses, duration of lapse domain, optimum response time, vigilance decrement function, false response frequency. We applied this conceptually valid, relatively short duration, reliable task with known psychometric properties and minimal practice/learning curves to document attentional lapses (response times &gt; 500 msec) in performance.</description>

        <title>Change in the Score of the Functional Outcomes of Sleep Questionnaire at Baseline and Week 8 Treatment</title>
        <description>The primary endpoint is change after 8 weeks of treatment from baseline value (controlling for baseline value) in the 30-item Functional Outcomes of Sleep Questionnaire (FOSQ) that will be used to test the primary study hypothesis that patients with milder OSA (RDI 5–30) on active treatment will demonstrate greater mean change for the Total score from baseline to 8 weeks treatment. The FOSQ is designed to assess the impact of excessive sleepiness on functional status. The instrument has established content validity, test-retest reliability (r= 0.91), and internal consistency (alpha = 0.96). The scale ranges from 5 - 20 with normal functional status being a value greater than 17.</description>

        <title>Change in the Score From Baseline to 8 Weeks Treatment Measured by the Profile of Mood States</title>
        <description>Change in the score from baseline to 8 weeks treatment, controlling for baseline, in the POMS is a reliable and valid measure of mood states that consists of 65 adjectives on which subjects’ rate themselves as they feel “today” using a five-point scale. There are six mood or affective states on this test derived through factor analysis: Tension-Anxiety (score range 0-36), Depression-Dejection (score range 0 - 60), Anger-Hostility (score range 0-48), Vigor-Activity (score range 0-32), Fatigue-Inertia (score range 0-28), and Confusion-Bewilderment (score range 0-28). There is also a summary Total Mood Disturbance (TMD) score that gives a Total estimate of affective state score range 0-200). Higher scores indicate greater disability.</description>

        <title>Change in the Number of Lapses From Baseline to 8 Weeks Treatment on the Psychomotor Vigilance Task (PVT) - Total Lapses in 20 Minute Test</title>
        <description>Change in the score from baseline to 8 weeks treatment, controlling for baseline, in the PVT is an objective assessment of sleepiness and measures decrements in neurobehavioral performance due to sleepiness, i.e., ability to sustain attention and respond in a timely manner to salient signals.(7) The PVT yields five highly informative metrics on the capacity for sustained attention and vigilance performance: frequency of lapses, duration of lapse domain, optimum response time, vigilance decrement function, false response frequency. We applied this conceptually valid, relatively short duration, reliable task with known psychometric properties and minimal practice/learning curves to document attentional lapses (response times &gt; 500 msec) in performance.</description>

          <description>Change in the score from baseline to 8 weeks treatment, controlling for baseline, in the PVT is an objective assessment of sleepiness and measures decrements in neurobehavioral performance due to sleepiness, i.e., ability to sustain attention and respond in a timely manner to salient signals.(7) The PVT yields five highly informative metrics on the capacity for sustained attention and vigilance performance: frequency of lapses, duration of lapse domain, optimum response time, vigilance decrement function, false response frequency. We applied this conceptually valid, relatively short duration, reliable task with known psychometric properties and minimal practice/learning curves to document attentional lapses (response times &gt; 500 msec) in performance.</description>
          <population>The Intent-to-Treat Sample includes all randomized patients receiving at least a 20 minute interval of Active during the post randomization treatment period and who had no clinically significant major violations of inclusion or exclusion criteria.</population>
