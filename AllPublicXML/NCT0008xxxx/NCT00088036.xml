          -  Patients must meet all of the DSM-IV-TR General Diagnostic Criteria for a Personality
             Disorder AND Patients must meet DSM-IV-TR diagnostic criteria for BPD as determined by
             the DIPD-IV, confirmed by a psychiatrist with training in the evaluation and
             assessment of BPD.

          -  The symptom severity as assessed by the total score of the ZAN-BPD, confirmed by a
             psychiatrist with training in the evaluation and assessment of BPD, must be greater
             than or equal to 9 at Visit 2.

          -  Female patients of childbearing potential must test negative for pregnancy and must be
             using medically accepted means of contraception throughout the study. Use of any oral
             or injectable contraception must be initiated prior to Visit 2.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Investigators, study site personnel directly affiliated with the study, or immediate
             family of investigator site personnel directly affiliated with the study. Immediate
             family is defined as a spouse, parent, child, or sibling, whether biological or
             legally adopted.

          -  Persons employed by Lilly (that is, employees, temporary contract workers, or
             designees responsible for the conduct of the study). Immediate family of Lilly

             any other Lilly sponsored study investigating olanzapine.

          -  Have had previous treatment with olanzapine unless, in the opinion of the
             investigator, the patient's previous treatment was inadequate in dose or duration to
             provide an accurate assessment of the therapy, or the effect of olanzapine was
             confounded by concomitant medication.

          -  Female patients who are either pregnant or nursing.
