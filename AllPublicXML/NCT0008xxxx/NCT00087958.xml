  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this clinical trial is to determine if the investigational drug is able to
      reduce/shrink advanced breast cancer tumors in patients who no longer benefit from
      anthracyclines, taxanes and capecitabine.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All patients in this trial will receive the investigational (chemotherapy) drug at an optimal
      dose as determined by previous clinical trials. The investigational drug is given through a
      vein once every three weeks. This drug prevents tumor cells from dividing, so they may stop
      growing or die.

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

        In order to be eligible for this trial you must:

          -  Have a diagnosis of breast cancer that is now metastatic (meaning the cancer has
             spread beyond its original location) or a recurrence of the cancer in its original
             location that cannot be removed by surgery.

          -  Have received previous treatment with anthracyclines (e.g. doxorubicin [Adriamycin or
             Doxil] or epirubicin [Ellence]), taxanes (paclitaxel [Taxol or Abraxane] or docetaxel
             [Taxotere]) and capecitabine (e.g. Xeloda) for your breast cancer and your doctor has
             determined that these treatments are no longer of benefit to you.

          -  Be at least 18 years of age

          -  Not be taking other treatments for your cancer at the time you enter the trial.

          -  Not be pregnant

          -  Additionally, there are other criteria for study entry that a doctor participating in
             this study will need to review in detail with you and clinical assessments may need to
             be performed (lab tests, CT scans).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  None listed here. Can be discussed with your doctor.
