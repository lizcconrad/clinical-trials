    <textblock>
      Fibromyalgia (FM) is a chronic disorder that involves chronic widespread musculoskeletal pain
      typically accompanied by fatigue, disordered sleep, cognitive complaints, psychological
      distress, and impairments in functioning. Treatments to date have been only partially
      effective and typically of modest benefit. Many persons with FM remain persistently
      dysfunctional and often disabled. This has given greater impetus for patients to seek
      complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) therapies. In this study, a variant of
      electroencephalograph (EEG) biofeedback known as Low Energy Neurofeedback System (LENS) will
      be used to reduce FM symptoms.

      Participants in this study will be randomly assigned to receive either LENS or placebo for
      several sessions. The Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire will be used to assess participants
      at the end of the study and at the 3- and 6- month follow-up visits.
