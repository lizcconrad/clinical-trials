      This study will examine whether infection with Helicobacter pylori bacteria may cause
      inflammation of the eye's surface. Although most people who are infected with H. pylori do
      not have symptoms, the bacteria can cause several diseases, including gastritis-stomach
      inflammation, stomach ulcers or, rarely, stomach cancer, and certain types of lymphoma. H.
      pylori has also been associated with autoimmune disorders, in which the patient's immune
      system attacks the body's own tissues.

      People who have been infected with H. pylori, with and without dry eye, may be eligible for
      this study. Candidates are screened with a medical history, a blood test to determine H.
      pylori infection, and an eye examination. The examination includes measurements of visual
      acuity, eye pressure, and tear production. To measure the amount of tear production, a small
      piece of filter paper is inserted over the eyelid on the side and collects tears over a
      5-minute period. Drops of two colored dyes (orange and green) are placed in the eyes to see
      if there are any dry areas. Screening also includes examination of the pupils and eye
      movements, the lens, and the back of the eye, including the retina.

      Participants will also have a few cells collected from the surface of the eye. After the eyes
      are numbed with anesthetic eye drops, a swab (like a Q-tip) is rolled over the surface of the
      white part of the eye to collect small samples of the superficial layer of the conjunctiva -
      a transparent membrane covering the eyeball. The specimens are analyzed by special laboratory
      techniques to determine whether H. pylori has infected the eye.

    <textblock>
      Helicobacter pylori, one of the world's most prevalent pathogens, is a spiral-shaped,
      catalase-positive, Gram-negative rod with 4-6 sheathed flagella attached to one pole which
      allow for motility. The prevalence of H. pylori infection in humans is high; 50% of those
      over the age of 60 are infected. H. pylori infection causes chronic gastric inflammation,
      ulcer disease and gastric carcinoma. Further, chronic antigenic stimulation driven by H.
      pylori infection has been linked to the development of gastric mucosa associated lymphoid
      tissue (MALT) lymphoma. Infection with H. pylori induces a vigorous immune response resulting
      in the presence of local and systemic antibodies. H. pylori-specific immunoglobulin G
      antibodies present in serum, plasma, whole blood, saliva, gastric juice and urine have each
      been used to successfully detect the presence of infection in adults. The sensitivity and
      specificity of serological tests range from 80% to 95% depending upon the assay used. H.
      Pylori infection is characteristically associated with a vigorous inflammatory response and
      we have recently identified H. Pylori DNA in conjunctival MALT lymphoma using molecular
      diagnostic techniques. Ocular surface inflammation is a cardinal feature of
      keratoconjunctivitis sicca. Since we identified H. Pylori DNA in conjunctival MALT lymphoma
      we hypothesize that chronic infection may also be capable of triggering chronic ocular
      surface inflammation as seen in keratoconjunctivitis sicca. The purpose of this pilot study
      is to determine whether H. pylori DNA is detectable in the conjunctiva of seropositive KCS
      patients.
