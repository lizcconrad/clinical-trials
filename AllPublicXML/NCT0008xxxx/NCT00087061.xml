      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as gimatecan, work in different ways to stop
      tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die.

      PURPOSE: This phase I/II trial is studying the side effects and best dose of gimatecan in
      treating patients with recurrent or progressive primary malignant glioma.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of gimatecan in patients with recurrent or
           progressive primary malignant glioma treated with or without concurrent enzyme-inducing
           anticonvulsant drugs.

        -  Determine whether this drug has sufficient activity to warrant further development in
           these patients. (phase II)

      Secondary

        -  Determine the qualitative and quantitative toxic effects of this drug in these patients.

        -  Determine the pharmacokinetic behaviors of this drug in these patients.

        -  Correlate the principal toxic effects with the pertinent pharmacokinetic parameters of
           this drug in these patients.

        -  Determine the antitumor activity of this drug in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is an open-label, dose-escalation, multicenter study. Patients are stratified
      according to the concurrent use of enzyme-inducing anticonvulsant drugs (yes vs no).

        -  Phase I: Patients receive oral gimatecan once daily on days 1-5. Courses repeat every 28
           days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of gimatecan until the maximum tolerated
      dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2
      of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.

        -  Phase II: Patients receive gimatecan as in phase I at the MTD. Patients are followed for
           at least 1 month and then every 2 months thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 30-83 patients (30-42 for phase I [15-21 per stratum] and
      21-41 for phase II) will be accrued for this study within 24 months.
