  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial is studying how well CCI-779 works in treating patients with soft tissue
      sarcoma or gastrointestinal stromal tumor. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as CCI-779, work
      in different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the antitumor activity of CCI-779 in this patient population.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the following in patients with soft tissue sarcomas and following treatment with
      CCI-779: duration of response, time to progression, survival.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To describe and correlate the following with patient characteristics and outcome in this
      patient population and following treatment with CCI-779: relative levels of 4EBP1 to eIF4E,
      phospho 4EBP1, total and phospho ribosomal S6 on pretreatment tumor tissue, expression levels
      of EGFR, activated EGFR, Her2, c-Myc, phospho Akt, total Akt, phospho-mTOR and total mTOR on
      pretreatment tumor tissue, drug induced inhibition of p70S6 kinase activity, and
      phosphorylation of S6 in PBMC, relative levels of serum sirolimus in post-treatment samples.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive CCI-779 IV over 30 minutes on days 1, 8, 15, and 22. Courses repeat every 28
      days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients achieving a
      complete response (CR) receive 2 additional courses beyond CR.

      Patients are followed every 3 months for 1 year, every 4 months for 1 year, and then every 6
      months for 3 years.
