      RATIONALE: Mycophenolate mofetil added to immunosuppressive treatment regimens may be
      effective in treating newly diagnosed chronic graft-versus-host disease caused by stem cell
      transplantation. It is not yet known whether immunosuppressive treatment regimens are more
      effective with or without mycophenolate mofetil in treating chronic graft-versus-host
      disease.

      PURPOSE: This randomized phase III trial is studying whether the addition of mycophenolate
      mofetil improves the efficacy of immunosuppressive treatment regimens in patients with newly
      diagnosed chronic graft-versus-host disease.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Compare the efficacy of immunosuppressive treatment regimens with vs without
           mycophenolate mofetil in patients with newly diagnosed chronic graft-vs-host disease.

        -  Compare the quality of life of patients treated with these regimens.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, prospective, multicenter
      study. Patients are stratified according to organ involvement of chronic graft-versus-host
      disease (GVHD) (single organ vs multiple organs) and transplant center. Patients are
      randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

      All patients receive usual therapy for chronic GVHD comprising oral prednisone twice daily
      and oral cyclosporine, oral tacrolimus or oral sirolimus twice daily until 2 weeks after the
      first evidence of improvement of symptoms of chronic GVHD.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive oral mycophenolate mofetil twice daily.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive oral placebo twice daily. In both arms administration of the
           study drug continues for 3 months after completion of prednisone and cyclosporine,
           tacrolimus or sirolimus in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Quality of life is assessed at baseline and then every 3 months.

      Patients are followed every 3 months for 3-5 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 230 patients (115 per treatment arm) will be accrued for this
      study within 3 years.
