      The purpose of this study is to find out if two antidepressant medications, paroxetine and
      venlafaxine, can help control depression in Parkinson's disease, and if these medications
      affect the motor symptoms of Parkinson's disease such as tremor, stiffness, slowness, and
      balance.

      Nearly 50 percent of individuals with Parkinson's disease (PD) suffer from depression—a
      condition that causes disability and can reduce quality of life. The University of Rochester
      Medical Center is conducting a research study of antidepressant medications to find out more
      about how to treat depression in PD. Antidepressant medications have not been adequately
      studied in persons with PD.

      The purpose of this study is to find out if the antidepressant medications paroxetine and
      venlafaxine can help control depression in PD and whether or not these medications affect the
      motor symptoms of PD such as tremor, stiffness, slowness, and balance.

      This is a randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled, 12-week study of paroxetine immediate
      release (Paxil) and venlafaxine extended release (Effexor XR). Paroxetine and venlafaxine XR
      are drugs that have been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and are available
      by prescription. Paroxetine and venlafaxine XR have been shown to be effective in treating
      depression in the general population. Two hundred, twenty-eight persons will be enrolled
      among 15 medical centers throughout the United States and Canada. Each person will
      participate in the trial for 12 weeks. Each participant will be randomly assigned to take
      either paroxetine or venlafaxine, or a placebo.
