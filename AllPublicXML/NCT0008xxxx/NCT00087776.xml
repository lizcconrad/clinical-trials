    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this trial is to compare the survival of patients with metastatic
      malignant melanoma treated with Taxoprexin Injection to those treated with Dacarbazine. In
      addition, the response rate to each drug, response duration, time to progression and time to
      treatment failure will be measured. Toxicity will be evaluated and compared between the two
      groups.

             documentation of disease progression.

          -  At least 6 weeks (42 days) since any prior immunotherapy, cytokine, biologic, vaccine
             or other therapy unless patients have progressed during immunotherapy.

          -  At least 4 weeks (28 days) since any prior radiotherapy.

          -  Lesions being used to assess disease status may not have been radiated.

          -  Patients must have ECOG performance status of 0 - 2.

             diagnosis, except for curatively treated non-melanoma skin cancer or carcinoma in situ
             of the cervix or other cancers cured by surgery alone with a disease-free survival
             longer than 5 years.

          -  Patients with uncontrolled brain metastasis.

          -  Patients who are pregnant or nursing and patients who are not practicing an acceptable
