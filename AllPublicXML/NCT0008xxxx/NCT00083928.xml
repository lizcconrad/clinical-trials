    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether injections of Å6 are effective in treating
      ovarian cancer patients who have completed first-line therapy and currently have no
      detectable cancer but have experienced a doubling of CA 125 levels.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Females ≥18 years of age

          -  Histologically or cytologically documented primary epithelial ovarian carcinoma,
             cancer of the Fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal carcinoma

          -  Completion of first-line chemotherapy

          -  Clinical remission as a result of chemotherapy

          -  History of normal CA125 level after initial course of therapy

          -  CA125 serum level has shown 2 consecutive rises based on 3 consecutive samples which
             are mutually &gt;= 28 days apart, provided that:

               1. the 3rd sample is above the institution's ULN, and

               2. the 3rd sample is confirmed by a 4th sample which is likewise higher than the 2nd
                  sample value and is above the institution's ULN

          -  No clinically evident disease progression, as assessed by history, physical
             examination, computed tomographic (CT) scan, or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)

          -  ECOG Performance Status of 0 or 1

          -  No clinically significantly abnormal clinical laboratory tests or concomitant
             illnesses

          -  Ability and willingness to self-administer subcutaneous injections

          -  Although pregnancy is extremely unlikely in this patient population because of the
             disease and prior treatment, patients who have the potential to become pregnant must
             have a negative pregnancy test and must agree to practice an effective method of
             contraception throughout the trial.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Persistent adverse events due to agents administered more than 4 weeks earlier

          -  More than 1 course of previous chemotherapy for the qualifying cancer

          -  Disease requiring chemotherapy or radiotherapy

          -  Ascites

          -  Recent history of active infection, gastrointestinal bleeding, thromboembolic
             disorders, or anticoagulation
