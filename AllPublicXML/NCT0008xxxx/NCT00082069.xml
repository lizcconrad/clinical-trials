      The vaccine is given as a nose spray. Volunteers will receive a 3-dose vaccination with doses
      spaced two weeks apart. Volunteers will be assigned to a vaccination group based on their
      order of enrollment with consideration of their availability to complete the necessary
      vaccinations and follow-up visits.

    <textblock>
      This is an open-labeled dose escalating trial in which a total of 32 subjects (minimum of 24
      allowable) will receive one of four intranasal Invaplex 50 vaccine doses according to the
      following chart:

      Test articles/dose

      Group / N* / Invaplex 50

      A / 8 / 10 micrograms

      B / 8 / 50 micrograms

      C / 8 / 240 micrograms

      D / 8 / 480 micrograms

      *minimum of 6 volunteers/group

      An interval no less than 7 days following the third (and final) dose (total of 35 days
      between initial dose at the lower dose level and the next initial dose at the next higher
      dose level) will separate volunteer groups receiving different doses. All volunteers will
      receive three immunizations. The first dosing time point is Day 0, the second is Day 14 (+-
      one day), and the third is Day 28 (+- 2 days). Blood and stool specimens will be collected at
      intervals to examine systemic and mucosal vaccine antigen-specific immune responses. Vaccine
      safety will be actively monitored during vaccination and for 28 days following the third
      vaccination dose.
