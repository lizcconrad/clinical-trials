      Key objectives of this clinical study are to:

        -  Determine how well intramuscular (IM) olanzapine depot works compared to placebo

        -  Evaluate the safety and tolerability of IM olanzapine depot compared to placebo

        -  Evaluate different doses of IM olanzapine depot compared to placebo to identify the best
           dose(s).
