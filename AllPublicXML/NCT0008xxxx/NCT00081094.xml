      RATIONALE: Imaging procedures, such as carbon-11 acetate positron emission tomography (PET)
      and fludeoxyglucose F 18 PET, may improve the ability to detect hepatocellular carcinoma
      (liver cancer) and allow doctors to plan the most effective treatment.

      PURPOSE: This clinical trial is studying how well carbon-11 acetate PET and fludeoxyglucose F
      18 PET work in detecting cancer in patients with liver cancer.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        INCLUSION:

          -  Biopsy-proved HCC (stage I and II by conventional staging) or one or more of the
             following in a patient with clinically documented cirrhosis:

          -  AFP &gt; 200 mg/dL;

          -  A contrast-enhancing tumor mass (&gt;1 cm) by CT or MRI; or

          -  A tumor mass confirmed by arteriography.

          -  Patient must provide written informed consent and have completed conventional imaging
             and staging before initiation of PET imaging.

        EXCLUSION:

          -  Pediatric patients under the age of 18 will be excluded from consideration from this
             study.

          -  Patients with a known prior malignancy (with the exception of basal cell carcinoma of
             the skin and carcinoma in situ of the cervix) within 5 years will be excluded from
             entry into the study. However, patients with a prior HCC thought to have a new primary
             or recurrent HCC are eligible.

          -  Pregnant and breastfeeding patients.

          -  Patients with poorly controlled diabetes mellitus (fasting blood glucose level &gt; 200
             mg/dL)
