    <textblock>
      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as docetaxel, work in different ways to stop
      tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Oblimersen may increase the
      effectiveness of docetaxel by making tumor cells more sensitive to the drug.

      PURPOSE: This randomized phase II trial is studying how well giving docetaxel together with
      oblimersen works compared to docetaxel alone in treating patients with hormone-refractory
      adenocarcinoma (cancer) of the prostate.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Compare the activity of docetaxel with or without oblimersen, in terms of
           prostate-specific antigen response, in patients with hormone-refractory adenocarcinoma
           of the prostate.

        -  Compare the toxicity of these regimens in these patients.

      Secondary

        -  Compare the time to progression in patients treated with these regimens.

        -  Compare survival of patients treated with these regimens.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to
      participating center, metastatic disease (M0 vs M1 with non-measurable lesions only vs M1
      with measurable lesions), prior estramustine (yes vs no), and prior bisphosphonates (yes vs
      no). Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive docetaxel IV over 1 hour on day 5 and oblimersen IV continuously
           on days 1-7.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive docetaxel IV over 1 hour on day 1. In both arms, treatment
           repeats every 21 days for up to 12 courses in the absence of disease progression or
           unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are followed every 8 weeks until progressive disease and then every 16 weeks
      thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 102 patients (51 per treatment arm) will be accrued for this
      study.
