  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test if denufosol will remove the fluid build-up in the eye
      so that the retina can be re-attached without invasive surgery.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this trial is to determine if administration of denufosol is well-tolerated
      and more efficacious than placebo in stimulating subretinal fluid reabsorption and retinal
      reattachment without surgical intervention in subjects presenting with rhegmatogenous retinal
      detachment.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  have rhegmatogenous retinal detachment in only one eye

          -  be able to receive intravitreal injection of study drug and be able to wait 24(+/- 6)
             hours to have detachment surgically treated or retinal breaks repaired per judgement
             of investigator

          -  no more than 3 separate identifiable retinal breaks that are clustered together and
             confined within an area no more than 2 clock hours in extent

          -  retinal detachment must be large enough such that it cannot be immediately repaired
             with laser photocoagulation or cryotherapy

          -  have pinhole acuity (using ETDRS) of macula-on, 20/50 or better in both eyes OR
             macula-off, 20/50 or better in non-study eye and have history, prior to detachment, of
             reading capability in study eye

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  have a non-rhegmatogenous retinal detachment

          -  have large retinal break(s) whose total break area is greater than 1 clock hour in
             extent

          -  have evidence of atrophic retinal pigment epithelium, choroid, choroidal detachment or
             intraocular inflammation

          -  be monocular

          -  have a prior retinal detachment repair or a congenital condition that places a greater
             risk for rhegmatogenous retinal detachment

          -  have proliferative vitreoretinopathy greater than grade B

          -  have pre-existing subretinal or vitreous hemorrhage, corneal opacity, or other
             conditions which limit the view of peripheral retina

          -  have any co-existing macular pathology or other retinal conditions that can limit
             visual acuity

          -  currently have uncontrollable elevated intraocular pressure, advanced glaucoma, or any
             history or current evidence of endophthalmitis in the affected eye

          -  have symptoms consistent with a rhegmatogenous retinal detachment such as visual
             disturbance greater than 14 days prior to screening if macula-on OR history of loss of
             reading vision in affected eye for greater than 6 days prior to screening if
             macula-off

          -  have a retinal detachment with evidence of demarcation lines or evidence of subretinal
             fibrosis visible upon fundus examination

          -  be currently taking medications that could obscure or confound study results including
             acetazolamide (Diamox) and dorzolamide

          -  have had a periocular, retrobulbar or intravitreal injection in the affected eye,
             including corticosteroids in the 3 months prior to screening or require one
