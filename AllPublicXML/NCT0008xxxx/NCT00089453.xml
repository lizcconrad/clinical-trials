  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to induce anti-myeloma responses in patients with high risk or
      relapsed myeloma using combination chemo- and immunotherapy comprising sequentially: 1)
      lymphoid and myeloid suppressive conditioning, 2) adoptive transfer of purified KIR-ligand
      mismatched Natural Killer cells from a haplo-identical donor, and 3) autografting two weeks
      after infusion of NK cells to ensure autologous reconstitution. Other objectives include
      establishing the response rate, disease free survival, progression free survival and toxicity
      of regimen. Secondary objectives are to monitor the persistence of haplo-identical purified
      KIR-ligand mismatched Natural Killer cells by molecular methods, select haplo-identical
      purified KIR-ligand mismatched donors and predict prior to therapy which donor will induce a
      response, monitor Natural Killer cell reconstitution prior to and after autografting, and
      establish Natural Killer cell clones after autografting and determine origin and specificity.

      This study will induce anti-myeloma responses in patients with high risk or relapsed myeloma
      using combination chemo- and immunotherapy comprising sequentially: 1) lymphoid suppressive
      conditioning to avoid rejection of the donor NK cells, 2) adoptive transfer of purified
      KIR-ligand mismatched Natural Killer cells from a haplo-identical donor, and 3) autografting
      two weeks after infusion of NK cells to ensure autologous reconstitution.
