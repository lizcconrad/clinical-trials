  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Bortezomib may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking the enzymes necessary for their
      growth. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as flavopiridol, work in different ways to stop
      cancer cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Bortezomib may increase the
      effectiveness of flavopiridol by making cancer cells more sensitive to the drug. Giving
      bortezomib together with flavopiridol may kill more cancer cells. This phase I trial is
      studying the side effects and best dose of bortezomib and flavopiridol in treating patients
      with recurrent or refractory indolent B-cell neoplasms.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the recommended phase II dose of bortezomib and flavopiridol in patients with
      recurrent or refractory indolent B-cell neoplasms.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the toxic effects and maximum tolerated dose of this regimen in these
      patients.

      II. To determine disease-related effects of this regimen in these patients. III. To determine
      the pharmacodynamics of this regimen in patients with myeloma.

      IV. To determine the pharmacokinetics of this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation, multicenter study.

      Patients receive bortezomib IV over 3-5 seconds followed by flavopiridol IV over 1 hour on
      days 1, 4, 8, and 11.

      Courses repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
