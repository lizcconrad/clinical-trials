      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of Dual Focus Schema Therapy in
      comparison to Individual Drug Counseling as 6-month manualized individual behavioral therapy
      enhancements to the orientation/early treatment process of Therapeutic Community (TC)
      residents.

    <textblock>
      Therapeutic Community (TC) treatment can be effective psychosocial modality for addiction,
      but premature dropout remains a major problem. Personality disorders are very common in
      residential programs, and TCs regard personality disturbance as core to all people with
      addiction. Severe personality dysfunction is associated with higher dropout rates from TCs,
      and adding cognitive-behavioral treatments may improve retention and outcome. We hypothesize
      that severe personality disturbance causes significant problems with an individual?s initial
      adjustment and effective utilization of TC processes and techniques. We predict that a
      behavioral therapy that targets personality pathology will result in better early retention
      and engagement than will a more standard addiction counseling approach.

      To begin to improve retention, TC research must begin to systematically evaluate the impact
      of adding interventions targeted at decreasing premature dropouts through controlled clinical
      trials. We have developed the first empirically tested treatment manual for the full range of
      personality disorders in substance abusers and propose to conduct a randomized clinical trial
      to evaluate the efficacy of Dual Focus Schema Therapy in comparison to Individual Drug
      Counseling as 6-month manualized individual behavioral therapy enhancements to the
      orientation/early treatment process of 100 TC residents. In addition to evaluating retention
      differences, we will analyze the rate and degree of change for these two conditions monthly
      and at 6, 12, 18, and 24-month follow-up for psychological indicators related to personality
      disorder and therapeutic processes related to the TC.
