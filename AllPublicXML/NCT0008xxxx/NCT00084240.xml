      The primary objective is to confirm the hypothesis that azithromycin (optimal dose once daily
      for three days) plus chloroquine is non-inferior to sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine plus
      chloroquine for the treatment of uncomplicated, symptomatic malaria due to P. falciparum.

      The trial was terminated prematurely 2 June 2005 due to the inability to recruit the planned
      number of subjects. There were no safety or efficacy concerns regarding the study in the
      decision to terminate the trial.

          -  Positive rapid diagnostic test (Binax NOW ICT) for P. falciparum

          -  Women of childbearing potential must have a negative urine gonadotropin prior to entry
             into the study and must agree to use adequate contraception during the entire study

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Severe or complicated malaria including subjects with any of the following: a.)

             cyclosporine, hexobarbital and phenytoin)

          -  Specific systemic diseases or other medical conditions that would interfere with the
             evaluation of the therapeutic response or safety of the study drug
