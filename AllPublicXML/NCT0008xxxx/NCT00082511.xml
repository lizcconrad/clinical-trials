      This was a randomized, multi-center, open-label, parallel-group, trial of prasterone 200 or
      100 mg/day for 12 months in women with lupus receiving glucocorticoid therapy who had
      completed an earlier 6-month randomized, placebo-controlled study (NCT00053560. Bone Mineral
      Density assessments were performed at baseline and at months 6 and 12.

    <description>There were 4 arms to the study:
During a previous 6 month db RCT, patients received either prasterone 200 mg/day or placebo. Upon entry into this open-label study, they were re-assigned by randomized allocation to receive either prasterone 200 mg/day or 100 mg/day. Hence, there were 4 possible treatment arms extending over the 18 months of observation between the double-blind study and the subsequent 12 month open-label extension study.</description>
