      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as FR901228 (depsipeptide), work in different
      ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die.

      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well FR901228 works in treating patients with
      advanced cancer of the urothelium that has progressed or recurred after receiving one
      chemotherapy regimen.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the response (confirmed complete and partial) in patients with advanced
           transitional cell carcinoma of the urothelium that has progressed after prior
           chemotherapy when treated with FR901228 (depsipeptide) .

        -  Determine progression-free and overall survival of patients treated with this drug.

        -  Determine the qualitative and quantitative toxic effects of this drug in these patients.

        -  Determine, preliminarily, the effects of this drug on reversing tumor promoter gene
           methylation in these patients.

        -  Correlate, preliminarily, tumor DNA in plasma with response or outcome in patients
           treated with this drug.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive FR901228 (depsipeptide) IV over 4 hours on days 1, 8, and 15. Courses repeat
      every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients
      achieving a complete response receive 2 additional courses of treatment.

      Patients are followed every 3 months for 1 year and then every 6 months for 2 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 20-40 patients will be accrued for this study.
