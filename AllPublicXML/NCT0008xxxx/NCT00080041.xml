    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety, toxicities, and dosage for
      investigational drug Motexafin Gadolinium administered with docetaxel to patients with
      advanced solid tumors. Secondly, tumor response to the combined treatment will be evaluated.
