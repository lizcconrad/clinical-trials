    <textblock>
      Patients have a type of cancer called Hodgkin's lymphoma or non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, which has
      come back or not gone away or is at high risk for coming back after treatment, including the
      best treatment investigators know for this disease. Investigators are asking the patient to
      volunteer to be in a research study using a new experimental therapy consisting of special
      immune system cells called LMP2 specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes in combination with a
      special protein called a monoclonal antibody.

      Some patients with Hodgkin or non-Hodgkin Lymphoma show evidence of infection with the virus
      that causes infectious mononucleosis Epstein Barr virus (EBV) before or at the time of their
      diagnosis of the lymphoma. EBV is found in the cancer cells of up to half the patients with
      lymphoma, suggesting that it may play a role in causing lymphoma. The cancer cells infected
      by EBV are able to hide from the body's immune system and escape destruction. Investigators
      want to see if special white blood cells, called T cells, that have been trained to kill EBV
      infected cells can survive in the blood and affect the tumor.

      The investigators have used this sort of therapy to treat a different type of cancer that
      occurs after bone marrow and solid organ transplant called post transplant lymphoma. In this
      type of cancer the tumor cells have 9 proteins made by EBV on their surface. They grew T
      cells in the laboratory that recognized all 9 proteins and were able to prevent and treat
      post transplant lymphoma. However in Hodgkin disease and non-Hodgkin Lymphoma the tumor cells
      only express 2 EBV proteins. In a previous study investigators made T cells that recognized
      all 9 proteins and gave them to patients with Hodgkin disease. Some patients had a partial
      response to this therapy but no patients had a complete response. Investigators think one
      reason may be that many of the T cells reacted with proteins that were not on the tumor
      cells. They are now trying to find out if they can improve this treatment by growing T cells
      that only recognize one of the proteins expressed on Lymphoma cells called LMP-2. These
      special T cells are called LMP-2 specific cytotoxic T-lymphocytes (CTLs).

      In this study investigators also are trying to see if they can improve these results by
      treating patients first with a special protein called an antibody and then giving the EBV
      specific T cells. The reason for doing this is that EBV specific T cells have worked very
      well in bone marrow transplant patients to prevent and treat EBV cancers. These patients have
      very few of their own immune cells when they are given the trained T cells and therefore
      there is a lot of space for the trained cells to grow. Investigators hope that they can
      improve the effect of the trained T cells in Hodgkin disease and non-Hodgkin Lymphoma
      patients by first temporarily removing the patient's own T cells before giving the trained
      cells.

      Investigators first tested a biopsy of the tumor that has already been done to see if the
      tumor cells are EBV positive. They then got permission to take up to 60ml (12 teaspoonfuls)
      of blood from the patient or their donor on one or two occasions and used this blood to grow
      T cells in the laboratory. They first grew a special type of cell called dendritic cells
      stimulate the T cells and put a specially produced human virus (adenovirus) that carries the
      LMP-2a gene into the dendritic cells. These dendritic cells were then treated with radiation
      so they could not grow. They were then used to stimulate T cells. This stimulation trained
      the T cells to kill cells with LMP-2a on their surface. Investigators then grew these LMP-2a
      specific CTLs by more stimulation with EBV infected cells (which were made from the patient's
      blood or their donor's blood by infecting them with EBV in the laboratory). The investigators
      also put the adenovirus that carries the LMP2 gene into these EBV infected cells to increase
      the amount of LMP2 that these cells have. Again, these EBV infected cells were treated with
      radiation so they could not grow. Once sufficient numbers of T cells were made, investigators
      tested them to make sure they kill cells with LMP2a on their surface. These cells are now
      ready to give to the patient if they agree to being on this study.

      Investigators also took up to 500 ml (2 1/2 cups) of extra blood from the patient or their
      donor, which were frozen. In case the patient's own cells do not recover as expected after
      the antibody and cell infusions, these cells can be thawed and given back to the patient.

      If the patient agrees to this treatment they will get treated with the CD45 antibodies for 4
      days in a row and then 2-3 days later get a dose of LMP2 specific CTLs.

      The CD45 antibodies will be given to the patient through a vein for 6-8 hours and monitored
      for at least 6 hours after the infusion. After the infusion The patient will be checked for
      the levels of CD45 in the blood at 24 hours (optional) and/or at 48-72 hours after the last
      infusion to check the level is low enough to give the patient the CTLs.

      The CTLs will be thawed and injected through a central line, if the patient has one, or
      through a vein in their arm over 10 minutes, after pretreatment with Tylenol and Benadryl. We
      will then monitor them in clinic for 4 hours after the injection.

      All of the treatments will be given by the Center for Cell and Gene Therapy at Texas
      Children's Hospital or the Methodist Hospital. We will follow the patient in the clinic after
      the CTL injection. If there is a reduction in the size of the lymphoma on CT or MRI scans as
      assessed by a radiologist, they can receive up to six additional doses of the T cells if they
      wish.
