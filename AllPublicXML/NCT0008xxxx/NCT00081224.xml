      RATIONALE: Celecoxib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking the enzymes necessary for
      their growth. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as capecitabine, work in different ways to
      stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Radiation therapy uses
      high-energy x-rays to damage tumor cells. Celecoxib may also make tumor cells more sensitive
      to chemotherapy and radiation therapy. Giving celecoxib with capecitabine and radiation
      therapy before surgery may shrink the tumor so that it can be removed.

      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well giving neoadjuvant celecoxib together with
      capecitabine and pelvic irradiation works in treating patients with stage II or stage III
      adenocarcinoma (cancer) of the rectum.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Determine the pathological complete response rate in patients with stage II or III
           adenocarcinoma of the rectum treated with neoadjuvant celecoxib and capecitabine in
           combination with pelvic irradiation.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the safety and tolerability of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Determine the rectal function of patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine the time to recurrence or progression and survival time of patients treated
           with this regimen.

        -  Correlate cellular and molecular markers in pretreatment tumor samples with response in
           patients treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

        -  Neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy: Patients receive oral celecoxib twice daily on days 1-7
           and oral capecitabine twice daily on days 1-5. Patients undergo pelvic radiotherapy once
           daily on days 1-5. Courses repeat weekly for 5.5 weeks.

        -  Surgery: Patients undergo surgery 4-6 weeks after completion of neoadjuvant
           chemoradiotherapy.

        -  Adjuvant chemotherapy: Patients with a curative resection receive oral capecitabine
           twice daily on days 1-14. Treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 4 courses.

      Treatment continues in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are followed every 3 months for 1 year and then every 6 months for 4 years.
