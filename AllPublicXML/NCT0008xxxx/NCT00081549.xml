      This study is a Phase I/II study. In Phase I of this study, the objective is to determine the
      maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of combination therapy with Aroplatin and gemcitabine (Gemzar®)
      in subjects with unresectable, locally advanced and/or metastatic pancreatic cancer. In Phase
      II, the primary objective is to evaluate survival after therapy with Aroplatin and
      gemcitabine at the identified MTD in subjects with unresectable, locally advanced and/or
      metastatic pancreatic cancer. Secondary objectives are to evaluate the severity and quantity
      of adverse events and determine the proportion of non-progressors and the progression-free
      interval.

           pancreatic cancer.

      Phase II Primary Objective:

        -  Evaluate survival after therapy with Aroplatin and gemcitabine at the MTD in subjects
           with unresectable, locally advanced and/or metastatic pancreatic cancer.
