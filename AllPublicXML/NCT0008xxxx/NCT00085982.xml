  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Leptin is a hormone produced by the fat cells that researchers have shown to play a role in
      controlling appetite. Certain people with severe insulin resistance have little or no leptin.

      The purpose of this study is to investigate people whose leptin levels have been found to be
      lower than 85 percent of the general population. Researchers will determine whether insulin
      levels in these participants improve when they are treated with genetically engineered
      leptin.

      Study participants must be age 8 years or older and must have severe insulin resistance
      syndrome and leptin deficiency. During an initial 7-day visit to the Clinical Center,
      researchers will evaluate participants' metabolic parameters, such as insulin responsiveness,
      lipid levels, appetite, and hormone levels. After taking these tests, participants will
      self-inject doses of leptin once or twice a day and will be monitored for treatment outcomes
      as well as side effects via follow-up visits. These inpatient follow-up visits will involve
      both blood tests and imaging studies at the Clinical Center at 4, 8, and 12 months after the
      initial visit, and every 6 months thereafter.

      Since this protocol was initiated, we have observed that recombinant leptin has improved
      metabolic abnormalities in subjects with lipoatrophy and leptin deficiency . The mechanism by
      which leptin treatment improves insulin sensitivity in lipodystrophy patients is correlated
      with the decrease in triglyceride content that occurs in the liver and muscle tissues during
      leptin therapy, but it is unclear if this completely accounts for the increase in insulin
      sensitivity .

      We followed two patients with mutations to their insulin receptor, who were refractory to
      standard insulin resistance treatment. We administered recombinant leptin hormone for 10
      months to these two patients and observed the effect on insulin sensitivity and glucose
      tolerance in a pilot protocol.

      Initial results from this study demonstrated that the two patients with extreme insulin
      resistance responded to leptin therapy by decreasing HgbA1c, decreasing fasting serum glucose
      levels, decreasing fasting serum insulin levels, and a concomitant improvement in glucose and
      insulin tolerance during their treatment period on leptin therapy. Three months following
      leptin withdrawal, these metabolic improvements deteriorated to the pre-treatment level.
      During this 10-month period of leptin treatment, no adverse reactions to the therapy were
      observed for these two patients.

      The diabetes in this group is clinically very challenging to control. The new insulin
      sensitizing medications are currently being tested, but clearly are not sufficient to control
      diabetes in the optimal target ranges. In this study, we would like to continue to test the
      safety and efficacy of leptin replacement therapy in these rare, but complex group of
      patients. We would like to see whether leptin will improve insulin sensitivity, thus decrease
      insulin resistance in a situation where the mechanism of insulin resistance can be attributed
      to a presumed defect on the insulin receptor. This will allow us to learn if leptin can
      overcome a receptor defect by activating some of the down-stream molecules in insulin
      signaling cascade.

      This will be an open-labeled study of 20 patients. We will include all ethnicities and all
      genders of patients aged 5 and higher, with identified or presumed insulin receptor
      mutations, and extreme forms of insulin resistance, manifested by fasting hyperinsulinemia,
      fasting hyperglycemia, or severe glucose intolerance during a standard oral glucose tolerance
      test. These patients also need to demonstrate concomitantly low fasting leptin levels (less
      than 12.0 ng/mL for females and less than 8.0 ng/mL for males).

      Patients will be evaluated every 6-12 months during the first two years of therapy. If no
      improvements are seen after one year of therapy, then the study medication will be withdrawn.
      If the patient shows improvements in his/her metabolic parameters while on leptin, the
      patient will be invited to continue taking the study medication. After two years of
      treatment, extending the treatment period on an annual basis will be the decision of the
      patient, principal investigator and Aegerion Pharmaceuticals. Leptin is supplied by Aegerion
      Pharmaceuticals, LLP and currently is only available through research studies. Neither the
      NIH nor Aegerion Pharmaceuticals can guarantee that leptin will be available indefinitely
      and/or after the study ends.

      With leptin therapy, we hope to continue to see the improvements in metabolic control that
      was demonstrated in the two pilot study patients. We hope to better assess the role leptin is
      playing in regulating the glucose control and insulin sensitivity in this unique population
      of patients, where the defect in insulin sensitivity is due to a known or presumed insulin
      receptor mutation.

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA

          -  Ethnicity: All ethnic groups

          -  Gender: Males and females

          -  Age &gt;5 years. In our experience with the younger children, we find that their
             participation in serial blood tests and MRI scans improves greatly when they are at
             least 5 years of age. Also, in our experience with the Type A insulin resistant
             patients, their initial insulin resistance is manifested as extreme hyperinsulinemia
             and hypoglycemia in the younger patients. We would not want to treat a young child
             experiencing chronic hypoglycemia.

          -  Clinically significant, severe insulin resistance. This can be documented by a known
             or suspected defect in the insulin receptor that have characteristic phenotypic
             identification. These include the following: Rabson Mendenhall syndrome, which usually
             is associated with mutations in the insulin receptor; Type A insulin resistance, which
             is usually associated with mutations in the insulin receptor; and Type B insulin
             resistance, which is associated with auto-antibodies to the insulin receptor. The
             inclusion criteria should include any patient with extreme insulin resistance who has
             appropriately low leptin levels. Syndromes of lipodystrophy are similar, but we
             already have approval to treat this group of patients.

          -  Circulating leptin levels &lt; 12.0 ng/ml in females and &lt; 8.0 ng/ml in males as measured
             by Linco assay from serum samples after an overnight fast.

          -  Presence of at least one of the following metabolic abnormalities:

               -  Fasting insulin &gt;30 (Micro)U/ml OR

               -  Presence of diabetes as defined by the 2006 ADA criteria:

                    -  Fasting plasma glucose &gt;= 126 mg/dL

                    -  2 hour plasma glucose &gt;= 200 mg/dL following a 75 gram (1.75g/kg if less
                       than 40kg) oral glucose load, or

                    -  Diabetic symptoms with a random plasma glucose &gt;= 200 mg/dL

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA

          -  General: Pregnant women, women in their reproductive years who do not use an effective
             method of birth control, and women currently nursing or lactating within 6 weeks of
             having completed nursing.

          -  Exclusions for underlying disease likely to increase side effects or to hinder
             objective data collection:

          -  Known infectious liver disease

          -  Known HIV infection

          -  Current alcohol or substance abuse

          -  Psychiatric disorder impeding competence or compliance

          -  Active tuberculosis

          -  Use of anorexiogenic drugs

          -  Other conditions which in the opinion of the clinical investigators would impede
             completion of the study.

          -  Subjects who have a known hypersensitivity to E. Coli derived proteins.
