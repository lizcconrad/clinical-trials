        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Histologically or cytologically confirmed diagnosis of a non-hematologic malignancy
             that is either unresponsive to currently available therapies or for which there is no
             known effective therapy.

          -  Patient willing to give informed consent, understand and comply with study
             procedures/restrictions

          -  Negative serum pregnancy test for women of child-bearing potential and not nursing.
             Fertile patients must use effective contraception during and for 30 days (women) or 4
             months (men) after treatment with WX-UK1.

          -  Measurable or non-measurable disease. Patients without clinical or radiologic evidence
             of disease are not eligible.

          -  Laboratory parameters (obtained within the screening period): WBC &gt;= 3 G/L,
             neutrophils &gt;= 1.5 G/L, platelets &gt;= 100 G/L, Hgb &gt;= 9 g/dL), total bilirubin &lt;= 1.5 x
             ULN, ASAT/ALAT/AP/GGT &lt;= 2.5 x ULN, serum creatinine &lt;= 2 x ULN.

        Exclusion Criteria:

             seizure disorder

          -  Known standard therapy for the patient's disease that is potentially curative or known
             to extend life expectancy.

          -  Carcinomatous meningitis or untreated/uncontrolled metastatic brain parenchymal
             disease.

          -  Concurrent or prior (within 4 weeks prior to start of WX-UK1 treatment for cytotoxic
             chemotherapy, biological-, endocrine-, investigational- or radiotherapy and 6 weeks

             blood sampling

          -  Illness or condition that might alter the absorption, distribution, metabolism and
             elimination of WX-UK1

          -  Known Hepatitis B/C or HIV infection

          -  Contraindication to capecitabine intake as specified in the SPC such as DPD-deficiency
             or concomitant intake of sorivudine or sorivudine related compounds
