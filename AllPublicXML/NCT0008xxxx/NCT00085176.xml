      RATIONALE: Cancer therapies may affect the ability of a child's brain and central nervous
      system to function normally. Learning to identify which patients will develop complications
      may improve the ability of doctors to plan cancer treatment and improve patient quality of
      life.

      PURPOSE: This clinical trial is studying neurobehavioral changes in children who have
      received steroid therapy or intrathecal therapy for acute lymphoblastic leukemia.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Compare neurobehavioral functioning, specifically memory, attention, executive function,
           visual-motor integration, and processing speed, in children previously treated with
           steroids (prednisone vs dexamethasone) and intrathecal therapy (methotrexate alone vs
           methotrexate, cytarabine, and hydrocortisone) for childhood acute lymphoblastic
           leukemia.

        -  Correlate non-treatment risk factors, such as gender, age at diagnosis, and time since
           termination of prior therapy, with impaired neurobehavioral function in these patients.

        -  Correlate neurobehavioral complications with quality-of-life of these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter, cohort study. Patients are assigned to 1 of 2 cohorts (prior
      treatment per CCG-1922 [prednisone vs dexamethasone] vs prior treatment per CCG-1952
      [intrathecal (IT) methotrexate vs IT methotrexate, cytarabine, and hydrocortisone]). Patients
      in each cohort are stratified according to age at diagnosis, gender, and time since prior
      treatment termination.

        -  Cohort A (CCG-1922): Patients undergo physical and neurological examination,
           neurobehavioral evaluation, and quality of life assessment. Neurobehavioral evaluations
           assess memory, attention, and executive function.

        -  Cohort B (CCG-1952): Patients undergo evaluation as above. Neurobehavioral evaluations
           assess visual-motor integration and processing speed.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 448 patients (224 per cohort) will be accrued for this study
      within 4 years.
