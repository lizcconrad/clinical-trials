      This study will examine and compare how the brain controls the timing of movement in healthy
      volunteers and in people with schizophrenia. Previous experiments have shown that when people
      are asked to look at a clock and report the time they first decide to make a movement, they
      report times later than the first brain waves associated with movement appear. When they are
      asked to report the time they first initiate the movement, they report times before the
      muscles actually begin to move. The study may help determine how the sense of willing and
      initiating an action is altered in schizophrenic patients, and how people may feel more or
      less &quot;in control&quot; of their movements.

      Normal volunteers and patients with schizophrenia between 18 and 65 years of age may be
      eligible for this study. Control subjects must not have any neurological or psychological
      disorders, and schizophrenia patients must not have any other neurological disorders.

      All participants will have a medical history, physical examination, and a test to determine
      their level of attention. Schizophrenia patients will be interviewed about their symptoms and
      complete psychiatric rating scales. In addition, all participants will undergo the following
      procedures:

      Electric shock

      Participants look at a clock on a computer screen whose hands revolves around the clock fast.
      While they look at the clock, they are given small, non-painful electric shocks and are asked
      to say when they receive the shocks, according to the clock. The shocks are repeated 40
      times.

      Arm movement

      Participants are asked to lift their arm up off a table repeatedly, at random times, while
      they look at the computer clock. This exercise is repeated a total of 80 times. Of these 80
      times, participants are asked 10 times in a row to say the time they first had the desire to
      move their arm, and then 10 times in a row the time they first felt that they were moving
      their arm.

      Electroencephalography (EEG) and Electromyography (EMG)

      Participants undergo EEG and EMG during the electric shock and arm movement experiments to
      measure electrical activity of the brain (EEG) and of the muscles (EMG). For EEG, electrodes
      (small metal discs) are placed on the scalp with a cap, paste, or glue-like substance and the
      brain waves are recorded. For EMG, electrodes are taped to the skin over the muscle.

      Objectives

      The purpose of this study is to determine how the subjective sense of willing and initiating
      an action is altered in schizophrenic patients. One proposed explanation for characteristic
      symptoms of schizophrenia (&quot;passivity phenomena&quot;) is a defect in the forward model of
      movement that the brain receives as the motor signal is generated. We propose to examine this
      forward model using Libet's paradigm, in which normal subjects gave evidence for a forward
      model in their anticipatory reports of initiation of movement. We intend to determine the
      times associated with willing (W), initiating (M), and
      electroencephalographic/electromyographic (EEG/EMG) measures of movement.

      Study Population

      We intend to study adult patients with a Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental
      Disorders diagnosis of schizophrenia. These patients provide a unique population for this
      study because they often do not have the sense that they direct their own movement or author
      their own thoughts (passivity phenomena). Studies have shown that schizophrenics have
      movement-related cortical potentials on EEG, but it is not known when the subjective sense of
      initiating movement occurs for these patients. As the order of mental events in time has been
      shown to contribute to the sense of agency, it is important to know how the timing of
      voluntary movement is altered in schizophrenia.

      Design

      We will ask patients to look at a fast-rotating clock on a computer screen and note when
      their movements were willed, instigated by an external agent if they have such delusions, and
      were initiated. Patients will also report the time of a somatosensory stimulus. Surface EMG
      will determine the time of actual movement, and EEG will record brain potentials associated
      with movement. Eligible patients with schizophrenia and passivity phenomena will be recruited
      from the Clinical Brain Disorders Branch, NIMH.

      Outcome Measures

      The primary outcome measure of this study is the absence of time W in some schizophrenics,
      the latency of W in other schizophrenics compared to normal subjects, and the latency of M in
      schizophrenics compared to normals. Any effect of medication status or symptoms on
      performance in the study will be considered exploratory data.

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:

        SCHIZOPHRENIC PATIENTS:

        Experimental subjects will be patients with DSM-IV diagnosis of schizophrenia who have
        volunteered to participate in the clinical research unit of the Clinical Brain Disorders
        Branch, NIMH. In addition, outpatients with DSM-IV diagnosis of schizophrenia who
        participate in outpatient research through the CBDB will be included. All patients will
        have received the diagnosis of schizophrenia by means of the Structured Clinical Interview
        for DSM-IV (SCID) with three psychiatrists reaching a consensus diagnosis. Patients on the
        clinical research unit must meet rigorous criteria in order to participate in research.
        Exclusionary criteria include history of traumatic brain injury, known comorbid
        neurological disorders, including epilepsy, history of drug and alcohol abuse, etc. All
        patients will have undergone a comprehensive battery of neuropsychological tests, including
        Wide Range Achievement Test- Reading (often to be a good indicator of premorbid
        intelligence), a short version of Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS-R), Wechsler
        Memory Scales (WMS-R), Trails A and B, tests of attention and executive function, including
        the continuous performance test (CPT), Wisconsin Card Sort (WISC), the N-Back test of
        working memory. Patients with psychiatric diseases other than schizophrenia that are not
        currently active and symptomatic will be included.

        All patients in the study will have schizophrenia. However, at the time of testing,
        patients will be administered clinical rating scales (i.e., Brief Psychotic Rating Scale
        (BPRS), appropriate sections of the SCID and the Yale Hallucination Phenomenology
        Assessment (YHPA)) to determine the presence of passivity phenomena.

        NORMAL VOLUNTEERS:

        Twenty-six normal controls will be included; controls will be screened in the NINDS
        Movement Disorders Outpatient Clinic, and will have neurological and physical examinations.
        They will be asked to abstain from alcohol for 24 hours before the study. All subjects
        participating in the studies will have a valid Clinical Center Medical Record Number.

        ALL SUBJECTS:

        All subjects will be between the ages of 18 and 65. Subjects may be male or female.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

        Patients younger than 18 years old or older than 65 years old will be excluded from the
        study.

        A. Patients with neurological disorders will be excluded. Patients with psychiatric
        disorders other than schizophrenia who are experiencing an active phase of their disorder
        will be excluded.

        B. Patients with a history of significant medical disorders requiring chronic treatment
        with other drugs, which affect the central nervous system and cannot be stopped will be
        excluded.

        C. Patients not capable of giving an informed consent will be excluded.
