    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the toxicity of PS-341 combined with one of four doses
      of thalidomide in patients with refractory multiple myeloma, and to find the most appropriate
      doses of PS-341 and thalidomide in the combination.

    <textblock>
      Patients will be enrolled in groups of 6-10 patients, each receiving a low dose of PS-341
      (1.0 mg/m2) and different dose levels of thalidomide (50, 100, 150, and 200 mg). The first
      six patients in each group will receive PS-341 alone for the first cycle, and thalidomide
      will be added on day 22. If the combination is found to be safe in these first 6 patients,
      the remaining patients in each group will be enrolled. Initially, these patients will receive
      PS-341 alone and thalidomide will be added subsequently, if deemed safe based on the first 6
      patients in each thalidomide dose cohort.
