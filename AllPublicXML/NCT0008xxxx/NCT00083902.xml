  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this investigational trial is to find out how well patients respond and how
      long their response lasts when treated with a standard regimen of dexamethasone with or
      without thalidomide and also find out what kind of side effects patients will experience.

      Maintenance

      Dexamethasone

      Patients will receive 40 mg dexamethasone days 1-4 only, every 3-4 weeks. Response will be
      assessed at least every 3 months while on maintenance therapy. Appropriate H2 blocker and
      antibiotics will also be given.

      Thalidomide

      Thalidomide will continue at a dose of 400 mg daily, or at the dose that was reduced and
      judged to be well tolerated in induction therapy. Thalidomide will be given as an oral, once
      daily dose at bedtime. Those patients unable to tolerate dexamethasone may continue on
      thalidomide alone until criteria for removal from treatment is met.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  All patients must have a confirmed diagnosis of previously treated, active multiple
             myeloma, with hypoproliferative/low risk relapse following at least one autologous
             transplant.

          -  Patients must be 18 years of age or older. Women of childbearing age and fertile men
             must use a medically acceptable means of birth control while on study and for 6 months
             thereafter.

          -  Patients must sign an informed consent to participate in this study, and be fully
             aware of the known teratogenic potential of this drug combination.

          -  Patients must have a SWOG performance status of 0-2.

          -  Patients must have adequate renal function, as defined by serum creatinine &lt; or = 3.0
             mg/dl.

          -  Patients must be off chemotherapy (including steroids) and local radiotherapy for &gt; or
             equal 3 weeks prior to entering the study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  No other concurrent therapy for myeloma is permitted while on protocol.

          -  There must be no evidence of active infection requiring IV antibiotics.
