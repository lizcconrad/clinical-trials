      This study will evaluate patients with eye complications related to vaccination against
      smallpox to learn more about these conditions. Vaccinia vaccination has been used for more
      than 100 years for preventing smallpox. A small number of people who receive the vaccination
      (less than 1 in 1,000) develop complications, sometimes in their eyes. This usually results
      from the accidental transfer of the infection from the vaccination site to the face or eyes,
      perhaps by touching the vaccination area and then the face or eyelids before washing the
      hands. The study will also examine whether an experimental treatment called NP-016 vaccinia
      immune globulin can reduce corneal scarring that is sometimes associated with serious
      vaccinia complications and can impair vision.

      Children and adults with keratitis, severe conjunctivitis, or blepharitis following exposure
      to vaccinia vaccination may be eligible for this study. Children must weigh at least 10 kg.

      Participants undergo the following tests and procedures at enrollment, with some tests
      repeated at scheduled study visits:

        1. Medical history and physical examination

        2. Infectious disease consultation

        3. Complete eye evaluation including:

             -  Fundus photography to examine the back of the eye - dilation of the pupils with eye
                drops to examine and photograph the back of the eye

             -  Slit lamp biomicroscopy - evaluation of the front part of the eye with a slit lamp
                microscope

             -  Eye pressure measurements

             -  Eye swab to look for vaccinia virus or other causes of disease

        4. Blood tests

        5. Photographs and documentation of eye and skin lesions

        6. Vaccinia diagnostic tests, such as skin or mucosa scrapings; blood, throat, or urine
           cultures; and tissue biopsies, if needed

      Patients begin treatment with standard medications for their eye disease, such as
      trifluridine (ViropticÂ® (Registered Trademark)) anti-viral eye drops. Patients whose
      condition becomes serious are offered additional treatment with intravenous (through a vein)
      infusions of either VIG or placebo (salt water solution with no active drug) and are randomly
      assigned to one or the other treatment group. All patients continue standard-of-care
      treatment as well.

      Follow-up visits at the NIH eye clinic are scheduled as required by the patient's condition.
      Patients with mild complications who are taking only standard medications may need to be seen
      only 1 month after the initial visit and then 6 months and 12 months later. Patients with
      more serious conditions who qualify for VIG or placebo treatments may be seen daily for a
      week, then once a week for the rest of the first month, and then at 6 months and 12 months,
      unless more frequent treatment or observation is required.

      Vaccinia virus (a live but relatively weak relative of smallpox and cowpox) is used to
      vaccinate people against the development of smallpox (variola) resulting from an infection
      with the viral genus Orthopoxvirus. Although, smallpox was thought to be eradicated worldwide
      during the 1970's, some smallpox cultures have been retained in the laboratories of several
      countries and may pose a potential threat if used as a biological weapon. This has recently
      led to programs where mass-inoculations with vaccinia have been initiated throughout the U.S.

      Vaccination against smallpox using vaccinia can result in complications. Reactions are rarely
      serious or life threatening, but one of the most common serious complications occur in and
      around the eye. This occurs when a person transfers vaccinia viruses by touch from their
      primary inoculation site to their own eyes (auto-inoculation). Accidental exposure can also
      occur in the laboratory or by contact with a vaccinated person. Ocular involvement may be
      confined to the lids or conjunctiva but may easily be transferred to the cornea. Keratitis
      can result in scarring that could have a severe and permanent impact on vision. Even when the
      cornea is not affected, extensive lesions on the lid or other ocular tissues can lead to
      additional sight-threatening complications.

      Recently, the US Food and Drug Administration licenced Vaccinia Immune Globulin Intravenous
      (Human) (VIGIV, formerly known as NP-016). It is indicated for the &quot;treatment and/or
      modification of the following conditions, which are complications resulting from smallpox
      vaccination: (a) Eczema vaccinatum; (b) Progressive vaccinia; (c) Severe generalized
      vaccinia; (d) Vaccinia infections in individuals who have skin conditions such as burns,
      impetigo, varicella-zoster, or poison ivy; or individuals who have eczematous skin lesions
      because of either the activity or extensiveness of such lesions; and (e) Aberrant infections
      induced by vaccinia virus that includes its accidental implantation in eyes (except in cases
      of isolated keratitis), mouth, or other areas where vaccinia infection would constitute a
      special hazard.&quot; The precautionary statement regarding isolated vaccinia keratitis appears
      though it is uncertain whether VIGIV use will decrease or increase corneal scarring in
      humans. The implication of increased scarringis based on some evidence in animal models
      indicating that more extensive corneal clouding can occur following VIG therapy. To
      investigate if this implication has clinical significance, two hundred study participants
      with corneal involvement following vaccinia vaccination or other exposure will be randomized
      to receive either placebo or VIGIV. All enrolled participants will be provided
      standard-of-care antiviral treatments for ocular complications. One-year proportions of
      corneal scarring will be compared between the two groups. Further knowledge about the
      biologic mechanisms of complications associated with vaccinia vaccination and rapid
      diagnostic test may lead to more effective forms of therapy.

          3. Have known severe acute allergic reactions to the non-active ingredients of
             polysorbate 80, maltose, or the trace amounts of TNBP or Triton X-100 used in the
             preparation of VIGIV.

          4. Has received VIGIV within 6 months prior to randomization.

          5. Pregnant women, unless an approved, specific additional consent statement attesting to
             awareness of the unknown risk of VIGIV therapy during pregnancy is understood and
