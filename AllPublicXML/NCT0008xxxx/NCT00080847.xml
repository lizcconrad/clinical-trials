    <textblock>
      This randomized phase II trial is studying rituximab and combination chemotherapy to see how
      well they work compared to oblimersen, rituximab, and combination chemotherapy in treating
      patients with advanced diffuse large B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Monoclonal antibodies,
      such as rituximab, can locate cancer cells and either kill them or deliver cancer-killing
      substances to them without harming normal cells. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as
      cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone, work in different ways to stop
      cancer cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Oblimersen may increase the
      effectiveness of anticancer drugs by making cancer cells more sensitive to the drugs.
      Combining rituximab and combination chemotherapy with oblimersen may kill more cancer cells

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To estimate the 1-year progression-free survival probability rate in younger patients with
      low and low-intermediate IPI risk advanced stage diffuse large B-cell NHL treated with
      8-cycles of CHOP-rituximab. (The CHOP-rituximab arm of this study was permanently closed,
      effective 10/15/04.) II. To estimate the 1-year progression-free survival probability rate in
      younger patients with low and low-intermediate IPI risk advanced stage diffuse large B-cell
      NHL treated with 8 cycles of CHOP-rituximab-G3139.

      III. To evaluate response (complete, complete unconfirmed, and partial) and toxicity for
      these regimens in this patient population. (The CHOP-rituximab arm of this study was
      permanently closed, effective 10/15/04.) IV. To estimate the 1-year progression-free survival
      and response rate in the subset of patients overexpressing bcl-2 protein.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to
      age-adjusted International Prognostic Index (0 vs 1). Patients are randomized to 1 of 2
      treatment arms. (Arm I closed to accrual as of 9/21/04.)

      ARM I (closed to accrual as of 9/21/04): Patients receive rituximab IV over 6 hours,
      cyclophosphamide IV over 15-45 minutes, doxorubicin IV over 5-20 minutes, and vincristine IV
      over 5-15 minutes on day 1 and oral prednisone on days 1-5.

      ARM II: Patients receive oblimersen IV continuously on days 1-7; rituximab IV over 6 hours,
      cyclophosphamide IV over 15-45 minutes, doxorubicin IV over 5-20 minutes, and vincristine IV
      over 5-15 minutes on day 5; and oral prednisone on days 5-10.

      In both arms, treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 8 courses in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are followed every 3 months for 1 year, every 6 months for 1 year, and then annually
      for up to 5 years.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  All patients must have previously untreated stage III, IV, or bulky stage II diffuse
             large B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma which is positive for CD20

          -  Adequate sections from the original diagnostic specimen must be available for
             submission for review; an adequate biopsy requires sufficient tissue to establish the
             architecture and a REAL or WHO histologic subtype with certainty; thus, core biopsies,
             especially multiple core biopsies MAY be adequate; whereas, needle aspirations or
             cytologies are not adequate

               -  Patients may also be registered to SWOG-8947 and SWOG-8819

          -  Patients must have an age-adjusted International Prognostic Index score of 0 or 1

          -  All patients must have bidimensionally measurable disease documented within 28 days
             prior to registration; patients with non-measurable disease in addition to measurable
             disease must have all non-measurable disease assessed within 42 days prior to
             registration

          -  Patients must have a unilateral bone marrow aspirate and biopsy performed within 42
             days prior to registration

          -  Patients must have a CT scan of the chest and abdomen/pelvis performed within 28 days
             prior to registration

          -  Patients must not have clinical evidence of central nervous system involvement by
             lymphoma; any laboratory or radiographic tests performed to assess CNS involvement
             must be negative within 42 days of registration

          -  Patients must not have a previous diagnosis of indolent lymphoma (histologic
             transformation are ineligible); as patients with nodal diffuse large ell lymphoma may
             have bone marrow involvement with small lymphocytes, such patients are eligible

          -  Patients must not have received prior chemotherapy, radiation, or antibody therapy for
             lymphoma

          -  All patients must have a Zubrod performance status of 0-2

          -  Serum LDH must be measured within 28 days prior to registration

          -  Patients must have a cardiac ejection fraction &gt;= 45% by MUGA scan or an ECHO with no
             significant abnormalities within 42 days prior to registration

          -  Patients known to be HIV positive, or who have a history of solid organ
             transplantation are ineligible as the biology and natural history of HIV associated,
             or post transplant lymphomas are very different than that of de novo diffuse large
             cell lymphomas; patients at high risk of hepatitis B virus infection should be
             screened before initiation of rituximab

          -  Patients requiring continuing supplemental oxygen therapy are ineligible

          -  No other prior malignancy is allowed except for the following: adequately treated
             basal cell or squamous cell skin cancer, in situ cervical cancer, adequately treated
             stage I or II cancer from which the patient is currently in complete remission, or any
             other cancer from which the patient has been disease-free for 5 years

          -  Pregnant or nursing women may not participate due to the potential for congenital
             abnormalities, and of harm to nursing infants due to this treatment regimen; women or
             men of reproductive potential may no participate unless they have agreed to use an
             effective contraceptive method

          -  If day 28 or 42 falls on a weekend or holiday, the limit may be extended to the next
             working day

               -  In calculating days of tests and measurements, the day a test or measurement is
                  done is considered day 0; therefore, if a test is done on a Monday, the Monday 4
                  weeks later would be considered day 28; this allows for efficient patient
                  scheduling without exceeding the guidelines

          -  All patients must be informed of the investigational nature of this study and must
             sign and give written informed consent in accordance with institutional and federal
             guidelines

          -  At the time of patient registration, the treating institution's name and ID number
             must be provided to the Data Operations Center in Seattle in order to ensure that the
             current (within 365 days) date of institutional review board approval for this study
             has been entered into the data base
