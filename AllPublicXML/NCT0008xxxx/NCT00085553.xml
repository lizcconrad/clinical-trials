      This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of tipifarnib and erlotinib
      hydrochloride in treating patients with solid tumors that have spread to other places in the
      body. Tipifarnib and erlotinib hydrochloride may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking
      some of the enzymes needed for cell growth.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the maximal tolerated dose of R115777 (tipifarnib) in combination with
      OSI-774 (erlotinib hydrochloride).

      II. To describe the toxicity profile of this combination. III. To evaluate the effect of
      OSI-774 on the disposition of R115777. IV. To evaluate in vitro markers of farnesyl
      transferase (FT) inhibition and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) inhibition.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.

      Patients receive erlotinib hydrochloride orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-28 (days 8-28
      of course 1 as of 11/4/2013) and tipifarnib PO twice daily (BID) on days 1-21. Courses repeat
      every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. (Closed to
      accrual as of 2/2/06)

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 3 months.

             life-prolonging therapy is available

          -  Medically capable and willing to provide the biologic specimens as required by the
             protocol Note: The goals of this study include assessment of the biologic effects on
             surrogate markers of the agent(s) being tested and are, therefore, contingent upon
             availability of the biologic specimens; patients with pre-existing clinical
             contraindications (e.g. anticoagulant therapy) for biopsy will be excluded from
             participation in the study; however, those patients who develop a major complication
             associated with the first biopsy (e.g. bleeding) or who develop clinical
             contraindications (e.g., anticoagulant therapy) after entry on study may remain on the
             study without the requirement for further tissue biopsies; this stipulation only
             applies to the 12 patients enrolled in Cohort II at MTD; the stipulation for provision
             of biologic specimens, as noted above, excludes the optional pharmacogenomic specimen
