    <textblock>
      The objective of this study was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of adalimumab 40 mg given
      every other week (eow) in subjects with active ankylosing spondylitis (AS) who have had an
      inadequate response to, or who are intolerant to, treatment with at least 1 nonsteroidal
      anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) and who may have also failed treatment with at least 1
      disease-modifying antirheumatic drug (DMARD).

    <description>The HUI-3 is a generic approach to the measurement of health status and assessment of health-related quality of life (HRQL). The HUI-3 classification is comprised of a total score and 8 attributes - Vision, Hearing, Speech, Ambulation, Dexterity, Emotion, Cognition and Pain. The attributes are measures on a scale from the worst score of 0 to best score of 1. The total score scale ranges from dead (= 0) and perfect health (= 1). The total score can have a negative score that is interpreted as worse than dead and the lower limit is -0.36. An increase in the HUI-3 score represents improvement.</description>

        <description>Radiographic progression was based on change in mSASSS scoring (comparison of the means) from double-blind Baseline visit to Week 104. The mSASSS is the sum of the lumbar and cervical spine score ( 0 [no change] to 72 [progression]), derived from scoring the anterior site of the lumbar spine (T12 to S1) and the cervical spine (C2 to T1) as either 0 (normal), 1 (erosion, sclerosis, or squaring), 2 (syndesmophyte), 3 (bridging syndesmophyte), or N (vertebral body not evaluable). Data from NCT00195819 was compared with data from AS patients in OASIS.</description>

        <description>BASFI consist of a set of 10 questions designed to determine the degree of functional limitation in subjects with AS. The BASFI score was derived based on the average of questions 1 through 10. The first 8 questions considered activities related to functional anatomy and the final 2 questions assessed the subject's ability to cope with everyday life over the last week. A 100-mm visual analog scale (VAS) was used to answer the questions and the mean of the ten scales gave the BASFI score a value between 0 (easy) and 100 (impossible).</description>

        <title>Mean Change in C-Reactive Protein (CRP) (mg/dL) in Subjects With Adalimumab Exposure Through Week 260</title>
        <description>Evaluation of the mean changes in CRP in subjects with adalimumab exposure from Baseline through 5 years. The test for CRP is a laboratory measurement for evaluation of an acute phase reactant of inflammation via the use of an ultrasensitive assay. A decrease in the level of CRP indicates reduction in inflammation. A decrease in CRP indicates improvement.</description>

        <title>Number of Subjects With a Disease Controlling Clinical Response From Adalimumab as Measured in Assessments of Ankylosing Spondylitis Ankylosing Spondylitis (ASAS) 5/6 in Subjects With Adalimumab Exposure Through Week 260</title>
        <description>The change in ASAS 5/6 was evaluated for the effect of adalimumab on structural damage.
ASAS 5/6 criteria is the 20% improvement in 5 out of 6 domains (physical function [BASFI], Total Back Pain, Patient's Global Assessment of Disease Activity, Inflammation [mean of Questions 5 and 6 of the BASDAI], spinal mobility [BASMI], and acute phase reactants [CRP]).</description>

        <title>Mean Change in the Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Metrology Index (BASMI) in Subjects With Adalimumab Exposure Through Week 260</title>
        <description>BASMI measures the range of motion based on five clinical measurements: 1) cervical rotation, 2) tragus to wall distance, 3) lumbar side flexion, 4) lumbar flexion (modified Schober's) and 5) intermalleolar distance. BASMI 0 = indicates mild disease involvement, 1 = moderate disease, and 2 = severe disease involvement. The results for cervical rotation and lumbar side flexion are the means of the left and right measurements. Scoring range 0-10. The higher the BASMI score, the more severe was the subject's limitation of movement due to their AS.</description>

        <description>The patient is in a sitting position on the examination table with the hands on the hips. A pen mark is made at the xiphisternum and a tape measure placed around the circumference of the patient's chest at this level. The patient is asked to take a deep breath and to exhale as completely as possible while looking directly ahead. The measurement (in cm) is noted. The patient is asked to inhale as deeply as possible and the measurement (in cm) is noted. The difference in the 2 measurement points (in cm) constitutes the value for CE.
An increase in chest expansion represents improvement</description>

        <title>Number of Subjects With SF-36 Physical Component Summary (PCS) of Minimal Clinically Important Difference (MCID) Response Through Week 260 of Adalimumab Exposure</title>
        <description>SF-36 is a standardized survey evaluating 8 aspects of functional health and well being; physical and social functioning, physical and emotional role limitations, bodily pain, general health, vitality, and mental health. The score for a section is an average of the individual question scores, which are scaled 0(no functioning) to 100 (highest level of functioning).
Responders were subjects whose change in PCS score fulfilled the Minimal Clinically Important Difference (MCID). The MCID for PCS was determined by a &gt;= 3.0 point increase during exposure to adalimumab.</description>

        <title>Number of Subjects With SF-36 Mental Component Summary (MCS) of Minimal Clinically Important Difference (MCID) Response Through Week 260 of Adalimumab Exposure</title>
        <description>SF-36 is a standardized survey evaluating 8 aspects of functional health and well being; physical and social functioning, physical and emotional role limitations, bodily pain, general health, vitality, and mental health. The score for a section is an average of the individual question scores, which are scaled 0(no functioning) to 100 (highest level of functioning).
Responders were subjects whose change in MCS fulfilled the Minimal Clinically Important Difference (MCID). The MCID for MCS was determined by a &gt;= 3.0 point increase during exposure to adalimumab.</description>

        <description>The HUI-3 is a generic approach to the measurement of health status and assessment of health-related quality of life (HRQL). The HUI-3 classification is comprised of a total score and 8 attributes - Vision, Hearing, Speech, Ambulation, Dexterity, Emotion, Cognition and Pain. The attributes are measures on a scale from the worst score of 0 to best score of 1. The total score scale ranges from dead (= 0) and perfect health (= 1). The total score can have a negative score that is interpreted as worse than dead and the lower limit is –0.36. An increase in the HUI-3 score represents improvement.</description>

        <title>Mean Change in the Ankylosing Spondylitis Quality of Life Questionaire (ASQoL) in Subjects Through Week 260 of Adalimumab Exposure</title>
        <description>ASQoL determined participants' quality of life and is comprised of 18 questions (yes or no) to be completed by the participant. Each statement on the ASQoL is given a score of &quot;1&quot; or &quot;0.&quot; All item scores were summed to give a total score or index. Total scores ranged from 0 (good quality of life) to 18 (poor quality of life) related to ability to cope, relationships, mood, sleep, motivation, activities of everyday living, independence, and social life. Decrease in ASQoL score represents improvement.</description>
