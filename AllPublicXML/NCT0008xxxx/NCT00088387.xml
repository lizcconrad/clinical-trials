      This study will examine the effect of the drugs lithium and divalproex (Depakote) on tau
      proteins, a type of protein in the brain and spinal fluid that are altered in patients with
      Alzheimer's disease. Both drugs are approved by the Food and Drug Administration to treat
      mood disorders, and both have been shown in animal studies to decrease the amount of altered
      tau protein. This study will determine whether lithium alone or in combination with
      divalproex reduces the altered tau protein in the spinal fluid of patients with Alzheimer's
      disease.

      Patients with Alzheimer's disease who are between 40 and 90 years of age may be eligible for
      this study. Candidates are screened with a medical history and physical examination,
      neurologic and neuropsychological evaluation, blood and urine tests, electrocardiogram (EKG),
      and, if needed, a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan of the brain.

      Participants undergo the following tests and procedures:

        -  Drug treatment: Patients take study drugs for 6 weeks.

        -  Weekly clinic visits: Patients come to the clinic once a week for a physical
           examination, blood and urine tests, a review of drug side effects, and to receive the
           next week's supply of medications.

        -  Lumbar puncture (spinal tap): Patients have a lumbar puncture at study weeks 2, 4, and 6
           to measure various brain chemicals and tau proteins in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF),
           which bathes the brain and spinal cord. For this test, a local anesthetic is given and a
           needle is inserted in the space between the bones in the lower back where the CSF
           circulates below the spinal cord. A small amount of fluid is collected through the
           needle.

        -  Follow-up visit: Two weeks after completing the study medication, patients return to the
           clinic for a final evaluation, including a physical examination and blood and urine
           tests.

      The overall objective of this study is to examine the acute effects of lithium alone and/or
      in combination with divalproex on surrogate measures of neuroprotective activity in patients
      with Alzheimer's disease. It is hypothesized that at safe and tolerable doses these drugs
      will inhibit glycogen synthase kinase-3 activity and reduce the phosphorylated tau epitopes
      threonine-181 and threonine-231 implicated in the pathogenesis of this disorder. In this
      proof-of-principle study, efficacy on reducing tau phosphorylated epitopes will be assessed
      through cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) measurements. Safety will be monitored by means of frequent
      clinical evaluations and laboratory tests.

      <textblock>
        INCLUSION CRITERIA:

        Patient is between the ages of 40 and 90 (inclusive).

        Patient will have a diagnosis of AD; the study will be confined to patients who are able to
        provide consent (pass a capacity assessment).

        The modified Hachinski Ischemia Score must be less than 4.

        Brain MRI performed within 15 months of enrollment must be compatible with the diagnosis of
        AD.

        Patient and/or caregiver are willing to adhere to protocol requirements as evidenced by
        written, informed consent.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

        Patients meeting any of the following exclusion criteria during screening or during the
        study will not be enrolled or will be immediately excluded from the study, as appropriate:

        Patient has a history of any medical condition that can reasonably be expected to subject
        the patient to unwarranted risk.

        Patient has clinically significant laboratory abnormalities that would preclude
        administration of lithium and divalproex.

        Patient is taking a prohibited concomitant medication. The following medications are
        forbidden for at least one month prior to the treatment phase (unless otherwise noted) and
        during the course of the study:

        Any investigational drugs;

        Anti-depressants (eligibility will be considered as long as dosage remains stable
        throughout the study);

        Anticonvulsants and other mood stabilizing drugs;

        Treatment that may provoke lithium toxicity due to reduced renal clearance, including
        metronidazole, spectinomycin, tetracycline;

        Treatment that may substantially increase steady-state plasma lithium levels resulting in
        lithium toxicity, including angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, NSAIDS, diuretics;

        Treatment that may increase the risk of neurotoxicity, including calcium channel blocking
        agents;

        Drugs that may increase urinary lithium excretion resulting in lower serum lithium
        concentrations, such as acetazolamide, urea, xanthine preparations, alkalinizing agents
        such as sodium bicarbonate, theophylline;

        Drugs that interact with lithium, including methyldopa;

        Neuroleptics (eligibility will be considered as long as dosage remains stable throughout
        the study). If patient is on existing atypical neuroleptic drugs, these will be continued
        at the same dose. Patients will not start a new prescription for atypical antipsychotics
        during the study;

        Drugs that may prolong the effects of lithium, including neuromuscular blocking agents;

        Digoxin, warfarin.

        investigators, would interfere with compliance or safety.

        Patient has known hypersensitivity to lithium or divalproex.

        Patient's inability to swallow tablets or to comply with medication schedule.

        Patient has no adequate caregiver.
