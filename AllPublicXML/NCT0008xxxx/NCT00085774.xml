             screening visit

          -  Have exercise-induced bronchospasm (EIB), with or without asthma, as demonstrated by a
             ≥15% decrease in pre-challenge absolute FEV1 observed up to 60 minutes following an
             exercise challenge conducted at the first screening visit

          -  Predicted FEV1 ≥70% for age, height, gender, and, where applicable, race following an

          -  Ability to perform spirometry reproducibly (i.e., the difference between the two
             highest FEV1 values out of a minimum of three and a maximum of eight values obtained
             at the first screening visit must not exceed 0.2 L)

             flow meter

             visits

             examination, vital signs, and 12 lead ECG (electrocardiogram; with 30 second Lead II

             from the study.

          -  Inability to tolerate or unwillingness to comply with required washout periods for all
             applicable medications and xanthine-containing foods and beverages prior to the

          -  Treatment in an emergency room for asthmatic symptoms or hospitalization for asthmatic
             symptoms within twelve months prior to the first screening visit

          -  Experienced an upper respiratory tract infection and/or sinusitis associated with
             exacerbation of asthmatic symptoms not requiring emergency room treatment and/or
             hospitalization and/or treatment with oral or injected corticosteroids that has not
             resolved within four weeks prior to the screening visit

          -  History and/or presence of any clinically-significant acute or chronic disease,
