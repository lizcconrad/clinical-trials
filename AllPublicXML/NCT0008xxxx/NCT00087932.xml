  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether differences in the use of complementary and
      alternative medicine (CAM) are influenced by the socioeconomic status and ethnicity of cancer
      patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The use of CAM is common among patients with cancer. However, there may be differences in
      participation, treatment preferences, and quality of life that are influenced by
      socioeconomic factors and ethnicity. This study will compare two distinct socioeconomic
      groups to determine differences in CAM use.

      Participants in this study will complete a questionnaire regarding demographics,
      socioeconomic status, disease specifics, and facilitators and barriers to CAM use.
      Participation in an introductory seminar and in various CAM programs will be monitored.
      Participants will also complete a quality of life scale that will provide insight into the
      way different populations perceive and use CAM and will identify potential obstacles to
      integrating CAM into other cancer treatment programs.
