      The purpose of this study is to determine if E7070 is an efficacious, safe, and tolerable
      treatment for patients with metastatic breast cancer who have failed, or could not tolerate,
      prior treatments with an anthracycline, a taxane, and capecitabine.

             the upper limits of normal (ULN); alkaline phosphatase &lt;= 3 times ULN and alanine
             transaminase (ALT) and aspartate transaminase (AST) &lt;= 3 times ULN, unless related to
             liver metastasis, in which case &lt;= 5 x ULN,

          -  Patients must have serum electrolytes including calcium (corrected for albumin),
             magnesium, and potassium (corrected) within normal limits,

          -  Patients must be willing and able to complete the FACT-B questionnaire,

          -  Patients must be willing and able to comply with the study protocol for the duration

             (other than required for palliation of bone pain or chest ulceration) within 2 weeks
             of E7070 treatment,

          -  Patients must not have received prior treatment with Mitomycin C or nitrosoureas,
