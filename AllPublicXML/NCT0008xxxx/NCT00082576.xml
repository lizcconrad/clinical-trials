      The primary objective is to confirm the hypothesis that azithromycin plus chloroquine is
      non-inferior to mefloquine for the treatment of symptomatic, uncomplicated malaria due to P.
      falciparum.

             presence of both of the following: a.) Blood smears positive for Plasmodium falciparum
             monoinfection, with asexual parasitemia between 1000 -100,000 parasites/mL b.) Fever

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Severe or complicated malaria including subjects with any of the following: a.)
             Impaired consciousness (e.g. obtundation, unarousable coma), seizures (any seizure
             within 24 hours prior to enrollment) or abnormal neurologic exam suggestive of severe
             or complicated malaria b.) Hemoglobinuria c.) Jaundice d.) Respiratory distress
             (respiratory rate &gt;= 30/min) e.) Persistent vomiting f.) Hematuria, as reported by the

          -  Known or suspected cardiovascular, hepatic or renal abnormality that in the opinion of
             the Investigator would place the subject at increased risk to participate in the
             study. The following findings are specific exclusions: a.) Serum creatinine &gt;2.0 x ULN
