    <textblock>
      The objective of this Phase II trial is to compare the efficacy and safety of 6 months of
      treatment with thymalfasin plus trans arterial chemoembolization (TACE) with TACE alone in
      adult patients with non-surgical hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Signed written informed consent.

          -  Diagnosis of HCC by:

               1. Presence of HCC on biopsy (core biopsy), or, if biopsy is strongly
                  contra-indicated due to safety or patient-related concerns, then the diagnosis of
                  HCC can be determined by:

               2. A new hepatic defect on imaging with an AFP &gt; 1000 ng/ml, or

               3. A new hepatic defect on ultrasound or CT with an AFP &lt; 1000 ng/ml when one of the
                  following is present:

                    1. At least two additional imaging techniques show signs characteristic of HCC,
                       or

                    2. The new hepatic defect has doubled in diameter over time, or

                    3. The AFP has progressively risen to &gt; 200 ng/ml and triples the mean
                       baseline.

          -  HCC must be unresectable and non-transplantable.

          -  Hematocrit &gt; 30%, platelet count &gt;= 50,000 per microliter, WBC &gt; 2.0 x 109/L, and
             polymorphonuclear white cell count &gt;= 1.0 x 109/L.

          -  Adequate renal function as demonstrated by serum creatinine level &lt; 1.5 mg/dl.

          -  If the patient is a woman, she is using a definitive method of birth control in
             consultation with her physician, or is surgically sterile or post-menopausal.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Concomitant chronic use of any drug known to be hepatotoxic, or of any
             immunosuppressive drug (Use of oral contraceptives will not exclude an otherwise
             eligible patient).

          -  Presence of main portal vein thrombosis or hepatic artery malformation.

          -  HCC amenable to treatment by surgical resection or hepatic transplantation.

          -  HIV infection diagnosed by HIV seropositivity and confirmed by Western blot.

          -  Concomitant or prior history of malignancy other than HCC within the last 10 years,
             except for curatively treated skin cancer or surgically cured in situ carcinoma of the
             cervix.

          -  Active infectious process that is not of a self-limiting nature. TB and AIDS are
             examples of infectious processes that are not of a self-limiting nature.

          -  Pregnancy as documented by a urine pregnancy test. Women with reproductive potential
             must agree to practice an adequate method of birth control for the duration of the
             study.

          -  Alcohol or intravenous drug abuse within the previous 1 year.

          -  Previous treatment with thymalfasin.

          -  Patients with known hypersensitivity to iodine.

          -  Simultaneous participation in another investigational drug study, or participation in
             any clinical trial involving investigational drugs within 30 days of study entry.
