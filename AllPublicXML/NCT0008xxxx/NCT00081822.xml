  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the recommended phase II dose of clofarabine when
      administered in combination with standard dose Ara-C to older (&gt;=60 years of age) patients
      with newly diagnosed acute myeloid leukemia (AML).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This phase I/II trial will include an initial dose escalation of clofarabine with a fixed
      standard dose of Ara-C in phase I to determine the 'optimal phase II dose'. Patients will be
      enrolled into phase I in cohorts of 3-6 beginning at Dose Level I of clofarabine (30
      mg/m2/day, days 2-6). If 0/3 or 1/6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity (DLT),
      clofarabine will be escalated to Dose Level II (40mg/m2/day, days 2-6). If &gt;1/3 or ≥2/6
      patients experience DLT on Dose Level II, then Dose Level I will be declared the optimal
      phase II dose. However, if 0/3 or 1/6 patients experience DLT on Dose Level II, then Dose
      Level II will be declared the optimal phase II dose. In the event that ≥2 patients experience
      DLT at Dose Level I, clofarabine will be dose reduced to Dose Level -I (22.5mg/m2/day, days
      2-6). Accrual will continue in cohorts of 3-6 patients, in a phase I fashion. If 0/3 or 1/6
      patients experience DLT, then Dose Level -I will be declared the 'optimal phase II dose'. In
      the event that ≥2 patients experience DLT at Dose Level -I, clofarabine will be further dose
      reduced to Dose Level -II (15mg/m2/day, days 2-6). Accrual will again proceed in cohorts of
      3-6 patients. If 0/3 or 1/6 experience DLT, then Dose Level -II will be declared the 'optimal
      phase II dose'. In the event that ≥2 patients experience DLT at Dose Level -II, accrual to
      the protocol will be halted.

      Enrollment will proceed at the optimal phase II dose in a Simon 2-stage design to determine
      the CR rate and treatment-related mortality initially in 16 patients; if the CR rate and TRM
      is acceptable , then enrollment will continue to approximately 46 patients or until complete.
