          2. Male or female 18 years of age or older

          3. Chronic hepatitis C infection based on history of positive serum anti-HCV antibody
             and/or HCV RNA

          4. Patients must have documented failure to respond to past treatment with PEG-Intron or
             Pegasys plus RBV.

          5. Liver biopsy within 3 years of screening documenting chronic liver disease consistent
             with chronic hepatitis C

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients with any history of decompensated liver disease including but not restricted
             to portal hypertension as manifested by gastroesophageal varices, variceal bleeding,
             ascites, or encephalopathy

          2. Specific laboratory abnormalities at Screening

          3. Patients who were HCV RNA negative during prior pegylated interferon plus ribavirin
             treatment, but who relapsed during follow-up

          4. Recent depression or psychiatric disorders

          5. Known HIV infection or positive HIV antibody test at Screening

          6. Chronic hepatitis B infection or positive hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) at
             Screening

          8. Presence or history of non-HCV chronic liver disease

          9. History of unstable or deteriorating cardiovascular or cerebrovascular disease within

             existing functional graft, including bone marrow transplant or stem cell transplant

         13. Concurrent therapy with immunosuppressive drugs or cytotoxic agents such as
             cyclosporine, azathioprine, chronic systemic corticosteroids, or chemotherapeutic
             agent(s) (e.g., cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, or cancer chemotherapy) or radiation
