      RATIONALE: Chemoprevention therapy is the use of certain drugs to try to prevent the
      development or recurrence of cancer. Iloprost may be effective in preventing lung cancer.

      PURPOSE: This randomized phase II trial is studying how well iloprost works in preventing
      lung cancer in patients who are at high risk for this disease.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Compare the reversal of premalignant histological changes in the bronchial epithelium of
           patients at high risk for lung cancer (defined by &gt; 20 pack years of smoking and sputum
           atypia) treated with iloprost vs placebo.

        -  Determine whether this drug modulates Ki-67 proliferation index (Antigen Ki-67) in these
           patients.

        -  Determine whether this drug affects prostaglandin metabolism in these patients.

        -  Determine the toxicity profile of this drug in these patients.

      Secondary

        -  Determine whether this drug modulates a panel of biomarkers, including
           MCM-2(Minichromosome maintenance protein: forms DNA helicase), EGFR (Epidermal growth
           factor receptor: cell surface receptor for the epidermal growth factor family of
           proteins. Mutations in EGFR expression or activity can result in cancer.) , HER2/neu
           (Human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 HER2 is a member of the EGFR family), RARβ
           (Retinoic Acic Receptor Beta is a nuclear transcription regulator and a member of the
           thyroid-steroid hormone receptor superfamily), p53, FHIT (Fragile histidine triad
           protein is an enzyme involved in purine metabolism and had been demonstrated to be a
           tumor suppressor), apoptotic index, and microvessel density, in these patients.

        -  Determine the genes whose expression is altered by this drug in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter study. Patients
      are stratified according to smoking status (current vs former) and participating center.
      Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive oral iloprost twice daily.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive oral placebo twice daily. In both arms, treatment continues for
           6 months in the absence of unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are followed at 1 month and then annually thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 152 patients (76 [38 current smokers and 38 former smokers] per
      treatment arm) will be accrued for this study within 2 years.

    <description>This outcome measure is created for each subject as follows:
From all biopsies scored at the baseline bronchoscopy, the mean WHO score is calculated.
From all biopsies scored at the follow-up bronchoscopy, the mean WHO score is calculated.Histology on bronchial biopsies pre-treatment and post-treatment will be compared. All biopsies will be graded according to the WHO classification for bronchial epithelium for this outcome, and all the following outcomes.
WHO Classification Grade Normal 1.0 Reserve Cell Hyperplasia 2.0 Metaplasia 3.0 Mild Dysplasia 4.0 Moderate Dysplasia 5.0 Severe Dysplasia 6.0 Carcinoma in Situ 7.0 Carcinoma 8.0

        <description>This outcome measure is created for each subject as follows:
The biopsies used in this analysis are those from the following 6 anatomical sites pre-specified in the protocol to be biopsied: RUL (Right upper lobe: the superior region of the right lung), RML (Right middle lobe: an anatomic portion of the right lung), RB6 (The carina in the right lower lobe at the entrance to the superior segment), LUL (Left upper lobe: the superior portion of the lung), LUDB (Left upper division bronchus: the carina between the lingular orifice and the left upper lobe), and LB6 (The carina in the left lower lobe at the entrance to the superior segment).
From these biopsies scored at the baseline bronchoscopy, the mean WHO score is calculated.
From these biopsies scored at the follow-up bronchoscopy, the mean WHO score is calculated.
The difference (follow-up mean - baseline mean) is used as the outcome measure for each subject.</description>

        <description>This outcome measure is created for each subject as follows:
The biopsies used in this analysis are restricted to biopsies from anatomical sites that were biopsies during both the baseline and follow-up bronchoscopies, thus creating &quot;pairs&quot; of biopsies.

From these biopsies scored at the baseline bronchoscopy, the maximum WHO score is used.
From these biopsies scored at the follow-up bronchoscopy, the maximum WHO score is used.
