      health behaviors and early cardiovascular disease in the Vietnam Era Twin (VET) Registry, a
      sample of over 4,000 twin pairs.

      BACKGROUND:

      Cardiovascular disease (CVD) affects approximately 60,800,000 Americans each year, claiming
      the lives of nearly one million of these people (American Heart Association, 2001). CVD is
      likely to be complex in etiology, reflecting the combined effect of both genes and
      environment, as well as gene x gene and gene x environment interaction. Examination of
      environmental factors thought to affect CVD risk in the context of a genetically informative
      design can help elucidate the relative contribution of genetic and environmental factors and
      potentially aid in identifying environmental factors that may interact with genetic
      vulnerability in predicting CVD. Cardiovascular morbidity and mortality are over-represented
      among individuals in lower socioeconomic strata, as are behaviors that increase the
      likelihood of cardiovascular events, including smoking, heavy alcohol consumption and
      physical inactivity (Adler et al., 1994; Anderson &amp; Armstead, 1995). Thus, it is commonly
      assumed that socioeconomic status (SES) serves as an important environmental influence on
      health and health behaviors. Twin studies partition genetic and environmental variance and
      detect gene x environment interaction and provide a unique opportunity to study the
      association between SES and health.

      DESIGN NARRATIVE:

      The study will characterize the nature of the association between socioeconomic status (SES),
      health behaviors and cardiovascular disease (CVD) in the existing Vietnam Era Twin (VET)
      registry, a sample of over 4000 male twin pairs with a mean age of 51 in 1999. Specifically,
      the study will: 1) determine how strongly environmental factors contribute to individual
      differences in SES, health behaviors and CVD, relative to genetic factors; 2) examine whether
      measures of SES are associated with health behaviors and CVD mortality when controlling for
      concomitant genetic influences; and 3) investigate whether SES interacts with genetic
      vulnerabilities to predict health behaviors and CVD (gene x environment interaction). Using
      VETdatasets, the primary method of analysis will be twin structural equation modeling.
