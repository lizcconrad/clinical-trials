      This pilot study will assess the safety and efficacy of Pivanex alone in patients with
      malignant melanoma who have relapsed after treatment with chemotherapy or Interleukin-2
      (IL-2). Pivanex is an investigational agent.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Rationale: Pivanex is a histone deacetylase inhibitor that induces tumor differentiation,
      inhibits proliferation, and induces apoptosis. Pivanex has been generally well tolerated in
      clinical trials and has shown preliminary evidence of efficacy in patients with non-small
      cell lung cancer. Pivanex has shown in-vitro and in-vivo evidence of anti-tumor activity
      against melanoma and, therefore, represents a promising therapeutic approach to patients with
      malignant melanoma.

      Purpose: This open-label trial will determine the response rate of Pivanex in patients with
      malignant melanoma.

      Objectives:

        -  Determine time to disease progression

        -  Determine overall survival

        -  Determine the safety profile of Pivanex in malignant melanoma

      Outline: This is an open-label, single center study in patients with malignant melanoma whose
      disease has progressed or failed to respond to chemotherapy or Interleukin-2 (IL-2). Patients
      will be treated with 2.5 g/m2 of Pivanex administered intravenously over 6 hours daily on
      Days 1 – 3.

      Treatment will be repeated every 21 days until tumor progression or the patient is withdrawn
      from treatment for other protocol-specified reasons. Tumor status will be assessed prior to
      every odd-numbered treatment cycle using the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors
      (RECIST) method. Patients who continue to experience tumor response or stabilization at the
      time treatment is discontinued will be followed every 12 weeks for tumor status until disease
      progression.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Histologically or cytologically confirmed melanoma, previously treated with
             chemotherapy or IL-2

          -  Recurrent or progressive disease after treatment.

          -  Measurable disease.

          -  Males and females, age ≥ 18 years.

          -  Adequate renal function with creatinine ≥ 1.5 mg/dl.

          -  Adequate liver function with alkaline phosphatase &lt;= 2.5 X upper limit of normal, SGOT
             and SGPT &lt;= 1.5 X upper limit of normal and total bilirubin &lt;= 1.5 X upper limit of
             normal.

          -  Adequate bone marrow function: platelets ≥ 100,000/mm3, hemoglobin ≥ 9 g/dL, and
             absolute neutrophil count (ANC)≥ 1,500 cells/mm3.

          -  Able to give informed consent.

          -  Must have discontinued previous surgery, radiation therapy or cancer chemotherapy at
             least four weeks prior to randomization (six weeks if a prior nitrosourea or mitomycin
             C), with recovery from treatment-associated toxicity. Localized palliative radiation
             therapy to non-target lesions is permitted within the four weeks prior to
             randomization.

          -  A predicted life expectancy of at least 6 months.

          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 or 1.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Receipt of more than three (3) systemic treatment regimens for malignant melanoma
             (including IL-2).

          -  A second malignancy within the last 5 years other than curatively treated
             carcinoma-in-situ or non-melanoma skin cancer.

          -  Pregnant or lactating females. Females of childbearing potential must have a negative
             pregnancy test and all male and female patients of reproductive potential must agree
             to use adequate birth control.

          -  Known HIV-positive patients.

          -  Acute medical problems, such as ischemic heart or lung disease or uncontrolled
             systemic infection.

          -  Patients with any underlying medical conditions or circumstance, which would
             contraindicate therapy with study treatment, affect compliance or impair evaluation of
             study endpoints.

          -  Patients receiving investigational agents within 4 weeks of randomization.

          -  Known allergy to reagents in the study.

          -  Symptomatic or untreated brain metastases – Patients with brain metastases are
             eligible if they are clinically and neurologically stable for ≥ 4 weeks since therapy
             (radiation therapy, radiosurgery/gamma knife, surgical resection) as determined by the
             investigator and either off corticosteroids or on a stable dose of corticosteroids.
