  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to find out if 300 mg of ATV plus 100 mg of ritonavir (RTV)
      works as well as 400 mg of ATV alone as part of a regimen with stavudine XR and lamivudine to
      slow or stop the progression of HIV infection in patients who have never used anti-HIV drugs.
