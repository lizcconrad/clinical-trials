      RATIONALE: New diagnostic procedures such as computed tomographic colonography may improve
      the ability to detect colorectal cancer and may provide a less invasive method of detection.

      PURPOSE: This clinical trial is studying how well computed tomographic colonography works in
      screening healthy participants for colorectal cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Compare the sensitivity of computed tomographic colonography (CTC) vs colonoscopy for
           detecting significantly large lesions (â‰¥ 10 mm in diameter) in asymptomatic
           participants, in terms of specificity, area under the ROC curve, and predictive values
           for detecting clinically significant colorectal neoplasia.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the interobserver variation in accuracy of interpreting CTC examinations of
           these participants, including any benefits of a primary 3-dimensional read and/or
           independent second interpretations.

        -  Determine the effects of different colon preparations on the accuracy of CTC in these
           participants.

        -  Compare participant acceptance and willingness to have a repeat examination by CTC vs
           colonoscopy.

        -  Determine the accuracy of CTC in detecting flat lesions in the colon of these
           participants.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Participants receive an oral laxative, oral bisacodyl, and three doses of oral barium
      sulphate 24 hours before imaging. After cathartic cleansing, participants undergo computed
      tomographic colonography followed by colonoscopy.

      Participants are followed up for approximately 4 weeks.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 2,607 participants will be accrued for this study.
