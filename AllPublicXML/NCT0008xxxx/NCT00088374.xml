  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will examine whether the drug 17AAG (17-allylamino 17-demethoxygeldanamycin) can
      shrink kidney tumors in patients with Von Hippel-Lindau disease (VHL), a rare, inherited
      syndrome in which patients develop tumors in certain parts of the body. 17AAG contributes to
      the destruction of proteins in cells that may play in role in causing cancer and spurring
      tumor growth. The study will also look at the effect of 17AAG on other tumors patients may
      have that are caused by VHL, on the amount of blood vessels in the tumors, on the biologic
      activity of the tumor, and on cells circulating in the bloodstream, as well as the safety of
      the drug and its impact on the kidney tumor in patients whose tumor(s) is removed.

      Patients 18 years of age and older with von Hippel-Lindau disease who have at least one
      kidney tumor large enough to pose a risk of metastasis (spread of cancer to other parts of
      the body) may be eligible for this study. Candidates are screened with a medical history and
      physical examination, computed tomography (CT) scan, brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI),
      see below), and blood and urine tests. Additional tests, including a 24-hour urine
      collection, ultrasound of the testicles in men, hearing test, eye exam, and MRI of the spine,
      may be done if recent test results are not available.

      Participants undergo the following tests and procedures:

      MRI: This test uses a strong magnetic field and radio waves to show structural and chemical
      changes in tissue. During the scan, the patient lies on a table in a narrow cylinder
      containing a magnetic field, wearing earplugs to muffle loud noises that occur with
      electrical switching of the magnetic fields. A catheter (plastic tube) is inserted into the
      patient's arm to administer a contrast dye that enhances the images.

      17AAG treatment: Patients receive 17AAG infusions into a vein once a week for 3 weeks out of
      every 4, for 3 months. The infusions last up to 1 to 2 hours.

      Repeat testing: After 3 months, patients have repeat MRI scans to measure changes in tumor
      activity, blood flow, and number of blood vessels in the tumor since the pretreatment scans.
      They may have additional tests, including a CT scan, eye exam, and other tests to evaluate
      the effect of 17AAG on the tumors.

      Background:

      Von Hippel-Lindau disease is a hereditary cancer syndrome in which affected individuals are
      at risk for developing tumors in a number of organs, including the brain, spine, adrenal
      glands, eyes and pancreas.

      The molecular hallmark of VHL is inactivation of the VHL gene which leads to accumulation of
      the hypoxia inducible factors (HIF); this, in turn results in overexpression of several genes
      including vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), glucose transporter 1 (GLUT-1),
      transforming growth factor alpha (TGF-Î±), platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) and
      erythropoietin, which play an important role in tumorigenesis, tumor growth and metastasis.

      17-allylamino-17-demethoxygeldanamycin (17AAG) is an inhibitor of the cellular chaperone heat
      shock protein 90 (Hsp90), and its interaction with Hsp90 leads to destabilization and
      degradation of several proteins, that depend on Hsp90 for their stability.

      The alpha subunit of HIF1 is one such Hsp90 client protein' and is susceptible to VHL
      independent, 17AAG-induced degradation.

      Objectives:

      To evaluate the efficacy of 17 AAG administered as a single agent in von Hippel Lindau
      patients with renal tumors. The primary endpoint of the trial is response of renal tumors
      following 3 cycles of therapy.

      To study the safety and tolerability of 17 AAG. To evaluate PD modulation of hsp90, and to
      explore the utility dynamic contrast enhanced MRI in evaluation of blood flow and metabolic
      changes in renal tumors before and during therapy

      Eligibility:

      Adults with clinical diagnosis of von Hippel Lindau disease Presence of one or more localized
      renal tumors for which surgical resection would be considered the standard approach

      Design:

      Patients will receive 17 AAG as an intravenous infusion at a dose of 300mg/m(2) on days 1, 8,
      and 15 of 28 day cycles.

      The study will follow a two-stage MinMax phase II design and will accrue a maximum of 26
      patients.

    <measure>Number of Participants With a Renal Tumor Response</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Response is defined as the number of patients who experience a disease response (complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) of renal tumors)per RECIST criteria. CR is the disappearance of all target lesions. PR is at least a 20% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter (LD) of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum LD. See the protocol Link module for the full criteria if desired.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants With a Non-renal Tumor Response</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Number of patients who have a PR or CR of non-renal lesions (pancreatic tumors, pheochromocytomas, and hemangioblastomas). The effect of treatment on the lesions will be evaluated at baseline and at the time of restaging (12 weeks) per RECIST criteria. RECIST is defined as changes in only the largest diameter (unidimensional measurement) of the tumor lesions. Lesions are either measurable or non-measurable using the criteria. See the protocol Link module for the full criteria if desired.</description>

    <measure>The Number of Participants With HIF, HSP90, and HSP70 Modulation in Resected Tumor Tissue and/or Peripheral Blood Lymphocytes</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Measurement of HIF, HSP90 and HSP70 levels by Western Blot in tumor tissue and/or lymphocytes to assess modulation of these biomarkers in response to 17 AAG treatment. Pretreatment tumor samples (when available) and resected tumors (in those patients who did not have a response and underwent surgical resection of their tumor) were to be used for this analysis. Levels of Hsp90, Hsp70, HIF and HIF transcriptional targets in resected tumor will be compared to respective levels in tumors previously resected from other VHL patients (not treated with 17AAG).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Patients in Whom Renal Tumors Could be Identified by Positron Emission Tomography (PET)Based on Fludeoxyglucose 18F (18FDG) Uptake</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and at 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Images were acquired after the intravenous administration of 18FDG and H2015 and used to analyze glucose uptake and estimate blood flow. The parameter to be measured is SUV (standard uptake value(s)) and/or mL/min/gm.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants With Flow Dynamics Measured by DCE MRI Within the Renal and Non-renal Tumor</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and during therapy (12 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>Dynamic images will be acquired before and after the intravenous administration of 0.1 mmol/kg of Gadolinium Diethylene triamine pentaacetic acid (DTPA). Time activity curves will be generated over a period of ten minutes. The parameter to be measured is the forward contrast transfer rate (Ktrans), the reverse contrast transfer rate (Kep), and/or the extravascular extracellular space volume fraction (Ve). Flow dynamics are a measure of blood flow changes in the tumor and are determined using the parameters we had previously defined (Ktrans, Kep, etc.).</description>

        <description>Dynamic images will be acquired before and after the intravenous administration of 0.1 mmol/kg of Gadolinium Diethylene triamine pentaacetic acid (DTPA). Time activity curves will be generated over a period of ten minutes. The parameter to be measured is the forward contrast transfer rate (Ktrans), the reverse contrast transfer rate (Kep), and/or the extravascular extracellular space volume fraction (Ve). Flow dynamics are a measure of blood flow changes in the tumor and are determined using the parameters we had previously defined (Ktrans, Kep, etc.).</description>
        <time_frame>Baseline and during therapy (12 weeks)</time_frame>
        <population>It is not the magnitude of changes in Ktrans, Kep, and Ve that limit our abililty, but the fact that this data was available in only a small number of patients.</population>

          <title>Number of Participants With Flow Dynamics Measured by DCE MRI Within the Renal and Non-renal Tumor</title>
          <description>Dynamic images will be acquired before and after the intravenous administration of 0.1 mmol/kg of Gadolinium Diethylene triamine pentaacetic acid (DTPA). Time activity curves will be generated over a period of ten minutes. The parameter to be measured is the forward contrast transfer rate (Ktrans), the reverse contrast transfer rate (Kep), and/or the extravascular extracellular space volume fraction (Ve). Flow dynamics are a measure of blood flow changes in the tumor and are determined using the parameters we had previously defined (Ktrans, Kep, etc.).</description>
          <population>It is not the magnitude of changes in Ktrans, Kep, and Ve that limit our abililty, but the fact that this data was available in only a small number of patients.</population>
