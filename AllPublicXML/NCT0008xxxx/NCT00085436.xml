      RATIONALE: Vaccines made from a patient's dendritic cells and tumor cells may make the body
      build an immune response to kill tumor cells. Interleukin-2 may stimulate a person's
      lymphocytes to kill kidney cancer cells. Interferon alfa may interfere with the growth of
      cancer cells. Combining vaccine therapy with interleukin-2 and interferon alfa may kill more
      tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well giving vaccine therapy together with
      interleukin-2 and interferon alfa works in treating patients with metastatic renal cell
      carcinoma (kidney cancer).

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Determine the clinical response rate in patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma
           treated with autologous dendritic cells (DC) loaded with autologous tumor lysate (DC
           vaccine) in combination with interleukin-2 and interferon-alfa.

        -  Determine the toxicity of this regimen in these patients.

      Secondary

        -  Determine, within relevant immune pathways, the treatment-related, tumor-specific immune
           response in patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Correlate tumor-specific immune response with objective clinical response in patients
           treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE:

        -  Induction therapy: Patients undergo leukapheresis on day -9. Patients receive autologous
           dendritic cells (DC) loaded with autologous tumor lysate (DC vaccine) by intranodal
           injection on days 0 and 14; interleukin-2 (IL-2) IV continuously on days 1-5 and 15-19;
           and interferon-alfa (IFN-α) subcutaneously (SC) once daily on days 1, 3, 5, 15, 17, and
           19.

        -  Maintenance therapy: Patients undergo leukapheresis on days 33, 61, and 89. Patients
           receive DC vaccine by intranodal injection on days 42, 70, and 98; IL-2 IV continuously
           on days 43-47, 71-75, and 99-103; and IFN-α SC once daily on days 43, 45, 47, 71, 73,
           75, 99, 101, and 103.

      Patients are followed every 3 months.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 18-33 patients will be accrued for this study.

    <description>A total of 18 evaluable patients will be accrued in the first stage. If 4 or fewer responses are observed in the first stage, the trial will be stopped early, otherwise an additional 15 evaluable patients will be accrued for a total of 33 evaluable patients. If 11 or more responses are observed among the 33 patients, the experimental regimen will be considered for further study, otherwise it will be rejected. The trial will not proceed to the second stage unless at least 5 responses are observed in the first stage.</description>

        <title>Clinical Response as Measured by RECIST Monthly and Then Every 2-3 Months</title>
        <description>A total of 18 evaluable patients will be accrued in the first stage. If 4 or fewer responses are observed in the first stage, the trial will be stopped early, otherwise an additional 15 evaluable patients will be accrued for a total of 33 evaluable patients. If 11 or more responses are observed among the 33 patients, the experimental regimen will be considered for further study, otherwise it will be rejected. The trial will not proceed to the second stage unless at least 5 responses are observed in the first stage.</description>
