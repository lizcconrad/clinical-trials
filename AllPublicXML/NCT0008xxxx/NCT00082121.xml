  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if the study drug (TP10), which blocks complement
      release, can reduce such side effects of complement inflammation as chest pain or heart
      attacks and be taken safely in women who undergo cardiopulmonary bypass surgery.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      During cardiac surgery, a substance called “complement” is released by the body. This
      complement causes inflammation, which can lead to side effects such as chest pain, heart
      attacks, or heart failure. The purpose of this study is to determine if the study drug
      (TP10), which blocks complement release, can reduce such side events and be taken safely in
      women.
