      The primary objective of the study is to determine if Serostim® 4 mg administered daily for
      12 weeks as treatment for the abnormal fat accumulation and distribution associated with
      HIV-associated Adipose Redistribution Syndrome (HARS) reduces Visceral Adipose Tissue (VAT,
      measured by CT scan) more effectively than placebo.

             methods:

               -  Detectable viral load measured by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification,
                  branched chain DNA (bDNA) signal amplification or the presence of p24 antigen.

               -  Presence of HIV antibodies confirmed by either Western blot or immunofluorescence
                  assay.

             Written laboratory documentation of an HIV infection must be obtained prior to
             randomization. In the absence of documented historical confirmation, an assay of HIV
             antibodies will be included in the Screening Laboratory Panel. Results will be
             confirmed with a Western Blot.

          2. Have evidence of excess abdominal adipose deposition when measured by the
             anthropometric methodology, using the following cut off values:

          5. Weight &gt;= 36 kg (79.3 lb)

          6. Be between 18 and 60 years of age (inclusive) unless local law dictates different
             limits.

             medical care, and with the understanding that the subject may withdraw consent at any
             time without prejudice to future medical care.

         10. Female subjects must:

               1. Be post menopausal (&gt;= 1 year) or surgically sterilized (i.e., have undergone
                  tubal ligation or hysterectomy)

                  or

               2. Use a contraceptive method for the duration of the study such as:

                    -  Hormonal contraceptive

                    -  Intra uterine device

                    -  Diaphragm with spermicide, or condom with spermicide.

               4. Confirmation that female subjects of childbearing potential are not pregnant must
                  be established by a negative beta-hCG serum pregnancy test during the 14-day
                  screening period prior to Study Day 1. If the beta-hCG serum pregnancy test is
                  performed more than 7 days prior to Study Day 1, a urine pregnancy test must be
                  performed by the site laboratory on Study Day 1 to confirm a negative test
                  result.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Have an active AIDS-defining opportunistic complication (OC) as defined by the CDC or
             have had an untreated or suspected serious systemic infection, or have had a

        In order to participate in this trial a subject must meet all of the inclusion and
        exclusion criteria specified above. Requests for protocol exceptions/exemptions must come
        from a participating, fully initiated site at which a prospective patient has consented to
        undergo screening. Exceptions/exemptions are only allowed by the Trial Director. There is
        no program in place to allow drug for a single patient IND, or for an expanded access
        protocol. This statement holds true for both children and adults.
