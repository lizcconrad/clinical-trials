  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This clinical trial is studying the amount of EF5 and motexafin lutetium present in tumor
      cells and/or normal tissues of patients with abdominal (such as ovarian, colon, or stomach
      cancer) or non-small cell lung cancer. EF5 may be effective in measuring oxygen in tumor
      tissue. Photosensitizing drugs such as motexafin lutetium are absorbed by tumor cells and,
      when exposed to light, become active and kill the tumor cells. Knowing the level of oxygen in
      tumor tissue and the level of motexafin lutetium absorbed by tumors and normal tissue may
      help predict the effectiveness of anticancer therapy

      OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the uptake of motexafin lutetium in tumors and normal tissue of patients with
      intra-abdominal malignancies or non-small cell lung cancer.

      II. Determine the ratio of tumor to normal tissue by measuring the level of motexafin
      lutetium uptake in tumor and normal tissue removed from these patients.

      III. Determine the pattern, presence, and level of EF5 binding (as a surrogate marker for
      hypoxia) in tumors of these patients.

      IV. Determine the feasibility of measuring optical properties, tissue oxygenation, motexafin
      lutetium concentration, fluorescence, and blood flow by non-invasive means in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter, diagnostic study. Patients are stratified according to
      diagnosis (intra-abdominal malignancy vs non-small cell lung cancer).

      Patients receive EF5 IV over 1-2.5 hours on day 1 and motexafin lutetium IV over 10-15
      minutes on day 2. Patients undergo definitive surgical resection approximately 3 hours after
      motexafin lutetium administration. Hypoxia and motexafin lutetium levels in the resected
      tumors are evaluated. Tumor to normal tissue ratios are also determined.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed at approximately 1-8 weeks.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 30 patients (20 with intra-abdominal malignancies and 10 with
      non-small cell lung cancer) will be accrued for this study within 10-15 months.
