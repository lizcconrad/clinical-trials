      RATIONALE: Vaccines made from a patient's dendritic cells and tumor cells may make the body
      build an immune response to kill tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of vaccine therapy in
      treating patients with stage III or stage IV melanoma.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Determine the dose-limiting toxicity and the maximum tolerated dose of autologous
           dendritic cells pulsed with autologous tumor cell lysate in patients with stage III or
           IV melanoma.

        -  Determine the safety and tolerability of this therapy in these patients.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the immune response, in terms of the type and degree of T-cell proliferation
           and delayed-type hypersensitivity responses, in patients treated with this therapy.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation, pilot study.

      Patients undergo leukapheresis for the collection of peripheral blood mononuclear cells
      (PBMC) on days -9, 19, and 47. Autologous dendritic cells (DC) are prepared from autologous
      PBMC exposed to sargramostim (GM-CSF), interleukin-4, and tumor necrosis factor alpha and
      pulsed with autologous tumor cell lysate. Patients receive autologous tumor cell
      lysate-pulsed DC IV over 5-10 minutes on days 0, 28, and 56.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of autologous tumor cell lysate-pulsed DC
      until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose at which
      33% of all patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.

      Patients are followed at day 84 and then every 3 months thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 3-20 patients will be accrued for this study within 3-20
      months.
