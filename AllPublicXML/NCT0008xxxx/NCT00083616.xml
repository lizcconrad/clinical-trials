  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine that panitumumab will have clinically meaningful
      anti-tumor activity in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer who have developed
      progressive disease or relapsed while on or after prior fluoropyrimidine, irinotecan and
      oxaliplatin chemotherapy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Panitumumab was administered once every 2 weeks until participants developed progressive
      disease, were unable to tolerate panitumumab, or discontinued treatment for other reasons
      (eg, administrative decision). Participants then attended a safety follow-up visit 4 weeks
      from the last panitumumab infusion. Participants were subsequently contacted every 3 months
      from the last panitumumab infusion through month 24 to assess disease status and survival.

    <description>Confirmed objective tumor response (complete or partial response) based on modified World Health Organization (WHO) criteria, through week 16. Tumor response was assessed by a central Independent Review Committee (IRC) and confirmation 4 weeks after initial assessment was required. Complete Response (CR): Disappearance of all index and non-index lesions and no new lesions. Partial Response (PR): At least a 50% decrease in the sum of the product of the longest diameters (SPD) of index lesions taking as reference the Baseline SPD, and no new non-index lesions and no &quot;unequivocal progression&quot; of non-index lesions, or, the disappearance of all index lesions and persistence of one or more non-index lesions not qualifying for either CR or Progressive Disease.</description>

Partial Response (PR): At least a 50% decrease in the sum of the product of the longest diameters (SPD) of index lesions taking as reference the Baseline SPD, and no new non-index lesions and no &quot;unequivocal progression&quot; of non-index lesions, or, the disappearance of all index lesions and persistence of one or more non-index lesions not qualifying for either CR or Progressive Disease.</description>

    <description>Kaplan-Meier estimates of the median time from enrollment to the date of first observed disease progression or death due to disease progression among those participants with a best outcome of stable disease. Stable disease (SD): Neither sufficient shrinkage of Index lesions to qualify for partial response nor sufficient increase to qualify for progressive disease (PD) taking as reference the nadir sum of the products of the longest diameters (SPD) since the treatment started and the disappearance of or persistence of one or more non-index lesions not qualifying for PD.</description>

        <description>Confirmed objective tumor response (complete or partial response) based on modified World Health Organization (WHO) criteria, through week 16. Tumor response was assessed by a central Independent Review Committee (IRC) and confirmation 4 weeks after initial assessment was required. Complete Response (CR): Disappearance of all index and non-index lesions and no new lesions. Partial Response (PR): At least a 50% decrease in the sum of the product of the longest diameters (SPD) of index lesions taking as reference the Baseline SPD, and no new non-index lesions and no “unequivocal progression” of non-index lesions, or, the disappearance of all index lesions and persistence of one or more non-index lesions not qualifying for either CR or Progressive Disease.</description>

      <pi_employee>Principal Investigators are NOT employed by the organization sponsoring the study.</pi_employee>
      <restrictive_agreement>The Clinical Trial Agreement generally does not restrict an investigator's discussion of trial results after completion. The Agreement permits Amgen a limited period of time to review material discussing trial results (typically up to 45 days and possible extension). Amgen may remove confidential information, but authors have final control and approval of publication content. For multicenter studies, the investigator agrees not to publish any results before the first multi-center publication.</restrictive_agreement>
