  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to use brain imaging technology to identify the parts of the
      brain that are activated during meditation and to compare these parts to those activated
      during other activities. This study will also determine the effects of meditation on
      involuntary functions, such as breathing.

    <textblock>
      Meditation and relaxation-based interventions are becoming more widely accepted in clinical
      settings because of their low cost, low risk, and proven effectiveness as a complementary
      intervention in a wide range of diseases. Despite the success and growing use of
      relaxation-based treatments, few studies have addressed the basic mechanism by which these
      treatments work. This study will use functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to define
      the brain mechanisms underlying the meditative state, to differentiate this state from other
      states, and to determine how meditation-induced brain changes affect autonomic function.

      Participants in this study will have an fMRI brain scan. Brain activity, breathing rate, and
      heart rate will be measured while the participant engages in three different activities:
      lying quietly, meditating, and mentally generating numbers.
