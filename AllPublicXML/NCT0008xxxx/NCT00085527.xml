      RATIONALE: FR901228 may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking the enzymes necessary for
      their growth.

      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well FR901228 works in treating patients with
      relapsed or refractory advanced ovarian epithelial cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Determine the response rate (complete and partial) in patients with relapsed or
           refractory advanced ovarian epithelial carcinoma treated with FR901228 (depsipeptide).

        -  Determine the toxicity of this drug in these patients.

      Secondary

        -  Correlate clinical response with platinum sensitivity in patients treated with this
           drug.

        -  Correlate clinical response with P-glycoprotein expression or p53 status in patients
           treated with this drug.

      OUTLINE: This is multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to response to prior
      platinum administration (platinum resistant vs platinum sensitive).

      Patients receive FR901228 (depsipeptide) IV over 4 hours on days 1, 8, and 15. Courses repeat
      every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 20-37 patients will be accrued for this study within 12 months.
