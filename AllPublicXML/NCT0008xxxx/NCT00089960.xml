        Inclusion Criteria

          -  Age ≥ 18 years;

          -  Disease progression per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) during
             previous treatment with imatinib mesylate at least 600 mg daily for at least 8 weeks,
             as per two independently assessed prestudy computerized tomography (CT) scans;

          -  Presence of at least one measurable (per RECIST)

          -  Progressing tumor lesion not previously treated with radiotherapy or embolization and

        Exclusion criteria:

          -  Prior malignancy (other than GIST, in situ cervical cancer, or basal cell cancer of
             the skin) unless treated with curative intent and without evidence of disease for ≥ 3
             years; cardiac disease including myocardial infarction, unstable angina, and
