  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:

        -  Many cancers produce two proteins, carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) and mucin-1 (MUC-1).

        -  The PANVAC-V priming vaccine and PANVAC-F boosting vaccine contain human genes that
           cause production of CEA and MUC-1, which can be used as a target for the immune system
           to attack the cancer. The vaccines also contain genes that cause production of other
           proteins that enhance immune activity.

        -  Sargramostim is a protein that boosts the immune system.

      Objectives:

        -  To evaluate the safety and effectiveness of PANVAC-V and PANVAC-F in patients with
           advanced cancer.

        -  To document the immune response to the vaccines and any anti-tumor responses that may
           occur.

      Eligibility: Patients 18 years of age and older with advanced cancer whose tumors produce CEA
      or MUC-1 protein

      Design:

        -  This trial has four arms: the first arm includes 10 patients with advanced colorectal
           cancer; the second arm includes 10 to 15 patients with any advanced non-colorectal
           cancer that produces either EA or MCU-1; the third arm includes about 12 patients with
           advanced breast cancer; the fourth arm includes about 12 patients with advanced ovarian
           cancer.

        -  All patients receive PANVAC-V on study day 1, followed by PANVAC-F on days 15, 29 and
           43. The vaccines are given by injection under the skin. Sargramostim is injected at the
           vaccination site on the day of each vaccination and for the next 3 days following
           vaccination.

        -  Patients whose disease has not worsened after the last boosting vaccination may receive
           up to 12 additional monthly boosting vaccinations. Following the 12 vaccinations,
           patients may receive vaccine every 3 months. Patients whose scans show that their
           disease has progressed, but who are otherwise clinically stable may revert back to
           monthly injections.

        -  Patients undergo apheresis to collect white blood cells (lymphocytes) on day 1 and day
           71 of the study to measure the immune response to the treatment. Blood is collected
           through a needle placed in one arm and directed through a cell separator machine where
           the lymphocytes are extracted. The rest of the blood components are returned to the
           patient through the same needle.

        -  Patients are monitored with frequent blood tests and periodic imaging tests (scans) to
           monitor for safety and the response to treatment.

      Background:

        -  CEA and MUC-1 are overexpressed in multiple adenocarcinomas.

        -  Pox viral vectors can induce a strong immune response to CEA and MUC-1.

        -  The use of agonist epitopes within the TAA can induce a better immune response than
           native peptides and have been associated with clinical responses

        -  Heterologous prime and boost regimens are superior in terms of generalizing immune
           responses; and this may translate into improved clinical responses

        -  The use of GM-CSF does not add significant toxicity and in pre-clinical models is
           essential for induction for optimal immune responses.

        -  It is possible by using vectors directed against TAA that there may be additive or
           synergistic immune responses and this may be important in overcoming antigenic escape
           variance

        -  Evidence of clinical benefit has been noted in some patients treated with this vaccine

      Objectives:

        -  For the first two arms (colorectal cancer and non-colorectal cancer): To evaluate the
           safety and tolerability of the vaccine.

        -  For the Ovarian Cancer and Breast Cancer arms: To evaluate clinical response to the
           vaccine.

      Eligibility:

        -  In the first two arms (colorectal and non-colorectal cancer), histologically confirmed
           adenocarcinoma that is CEA or MUC-1 positive described as metastatic disease (measurable
           or evaluable) or metastatic disease documented by biopsy but not evaluable by imaging
           (e.g. small volume peritoneal disease)

        -  For the ovarian and breast cancer arms, patients must have evaluable disease

        -  Normal organ function, ECOG 0-1

      Design:

        -  This is a non-randomized four arm, pilot trial of pox viral vaccines that contain the
           transgenes for CEA and MUC-1 (both with modified HLA-A2 agonist epitopes) as well as 3
           human T-cell costimulatory molecules, B7-1, ICAM-1, and LFA-3 [PANVAC(TM)-V (vaccinia)
           and PANVAC(TM)-F (fowlpox)] in patients with metastatic carcinoma that express CEA or
           MUC-1 antigen.

        -  The first arm will enroll 10 patients with metastatic colorectal adenocarcinoma.

        -  The second arm will consist of 10-15 patients with any metastatic non-colorectal
           carcinoma that expresses either CEA or MUC-1.

        -  The third arm will consist of about 12 patients with metastatic breast carcinoma. The
           fourth arm will consist of about 12 patients with metastatic ovarian carcinoma.

        -  All patients will receive PANVAC(TM)-V (vaccinia) subcutaneously (s.c.) scheduled on day
           1, followed by PANVAC(TM)-F (fowlpox) s.c. scheduled on days 15, 29, and 43 (Core
           Phase).

        -  Sargramostim (100 micro g) will be given at the site of the vaccination on each
           vaccination day and for three consecutive days thereafter.

        -  Up to 12 additional monthly boosting vaccinations (Extension Phase) will be offered to
           patients who have completed the Core Phase of the study and who have not experienced
           disease progression.

        -  Following the 12 monthly vaccinations, patients without disease progression will be
           allowed to receive vaccine every 3 months.

        -  Patients who have radiographic evidence of progressive disease, but who are otherwise
           clinically stable may revert back to monthly vaccinations.

        5-FU/LV with or without either irinotecan or oxaliplatin) for the colorectal cancer arm, or
        either failed or not be a candidate for therapy of proven efficacy for their disease in the
        non-colorectal, breast, and ovarian cancer arms.

        C. 18 years of age or greater.

        D. All patients on the colorectal adenocarcinoma cohort must be HLA-A2 positive.

        disorders; those with other acute, chronic or exfoliative skin conditions (e.g., atopic
        dermatitis, burns, impetigo, varicella zoster, severe acne, or other open rashes or wounds)
        until condition resolves; pregnant or nursing women; children 3 years of age and under; and
        immunodeficient or immunosuppressed persons (by disease or therapy), including HIV
        infection.

        Typically this is 3-4 weeks for patients who most recently received cytotoxic therapy
        except for the nitrosoureas and mitomycin C for which 6 weeks is needed for recovery.

        N. Hematological eligibility parameters (within 16 days of starting therapy):

        Dose limiting toxicities include:

          -  Any Grade 2 generalized urticaria or Grade 3 or greater allergic reaction.

          -  Any Grade 2 or greater autoimmune response.

          -  Any Grade 3 or greater hematologic or non-hematologic reaction, including
             injection-site reaction.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

        A. Patients should have no evidence of being immunocompromised as listed below.

          -  Human immunodeficiency virus positivity due to the potential for decreased tolerance

             might be stimulated by vaccine treatment. This requirement is due to the potential
             risks of exacerbating autoimmunity. Patients with endocrine disease that is controlled
             by replacement therapy including thyroid disease and adrenal disease and vitiligo may
             be enrolled.

        B. Concurrent use of systemic steroids, except for physiologic doses for systemic steroid

        or exfoliative skin conditions (e.g. atopic dermatitis, burns, impetigo, varicella zoster,
        severe acne, or other open rashes or wounds).

        F. Serious intercurrent medical illness which would interfere with the ability of the
        patient to carry out the treatment program, including, but not limited to, inflammatory
        bowel disease, Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, or active diverticulitis

        G. Patients with a history of cardiomyopathy or symptomatic congestive heart failure
        (unless stable on treatment), symptomatic arrhythmia not controlled by medication. Unstable

        history of myocardial infarction or embolic stroke within the past 6 months.

        H. Clinically active brain metastasis, or a history of encephalitis, multiple sclerosis, or
        seizures within the last year (from seizure disorder or brain metastasis).

        I. Medical conditions, which, in the opinion of the investigators would jeopardize the
        patient or the integrity of the data obtained.

        J. Concurrent chemotherapy; an exception to this is to allow for patients with breast
        cancer who are receiving trastuzumab, to continue therapy with trastuzumab while receiving
        the vaccine treatment.

        K. Serious hypersensitivity reaction to egg products.

        L. Clinically significant cardiomyopathy requiring treatment.
