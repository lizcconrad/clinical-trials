      RATIONALE: Diagnostic procedures, such as nipple aspiration, ductal lavage, and breast duct
      endoscopy, may help doctors detect and assess breast cancer cells early and plan more
      effective treatment.

      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well nipple aspiration, ductal lavage, and duct
      endoscopy work in assessing cancer cells in women who are undergoing surgery for breast
      cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Correlate the cell yield and morphology findings from ductal lavage with duct endoscopy
           findings and surgical pathology findings in women with breast cancer.

        -  Determine the sensitivity and specificity of nipple aspiration, ductal lavage, and duct
           endoscopy in detecting established breast cancer in these patients.

      Secondary

        -  Compare the intraduct environment of cancer-involved ducts in the affected breast vs the
           ductal systems in the contralateral breast of these patients.

        -  Perform immunohistochemical analysis (including estrogen receptor, progesterone
           receptor, HER2-neu receptor, epidermal growth factor receptor, p53, and proliferation
           marker expression) for markers potentially associated with breast cancer in these
           patients.

        -  Determine potential molecular markers of malignancy by gene methylation, gene
           expression, and proteomics in these patients.

        -  Compare the biochemistry and protein analysis of the intraductal fluid vs serum analysis
           in these patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients undergo nipple aspiration, ductal lavage, and duct endoscopy under general
      anesthesia immediately before breast surgery. Fluid and tissue obtained are examined for
      tumor markers by immunohistochemistry. Candidate genes are analyzed by gene methylation, gene
      expression arrays, and proteomic profiling.

      Patients are followed at 24 hours and at 1 week.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 100 patients will be accrued for this study within 1 year.
