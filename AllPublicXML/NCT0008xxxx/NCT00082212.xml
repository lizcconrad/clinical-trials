  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the overall response rate, time to progression, and
      1 yr survival with cetuximab in patients with ovarian or primary peritoneal carcinoma.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      To determine the overall response rate of cetuximab alone in subjects with ovarian or primary
      peritoneal carcinoma who have persistent or recurrent disease following 1-2 previous regimens
      of chemotherapy. Potential relationship between response, dose, and the occurence of rash in
      the treatment of subjects who have stable disease after the initial 6 weeks of treatment,
      time to progression, and 1 yr survival.
