    <textblock>
      STR (Skeletal Targeted Radiotherapy, 166Ho-DOTMP) is an investigational radiopharmaceutical
      that delivers radiation directly to cancer cells in the bone and bone marrow. Conventional
      methods of delivering radiation therapy, such as total body irradiation, expose non-target
      tissues to radiation and cause serious side effects. In contrast, STR's targeted approach to
      delivering radiotherapy concentrates the radiation where it is needed, and minimizes exposure
      of normal tissues.

      STR is composed of a bone-targeting molecule, DOTMP, in a stable complex with the
      radionuclide holmium-166. When injected into a patient's bloodstream, STR rapidly binds to
      bone mineral, delivering a brief, intense dose of radiation to destroy cancer cells in the
      bone and marrow. The high-energy and long path-length of holmium-166 beta particles provide
      optimal penetration and uniform irradiation of disease sites in the marrow and bone. STR that
      does not bind to bone is rapidly eliminated through the urinary tract. STR treatment is
      followed by autologous stem cell transplantation. The short half-life of holmium-166 allows
      treatment on an out-patient basis, and minimizes the time required between STR administration
      and transplantation.

      The phase III study of STR is a multi-center, randomized, controlled study, designed to
      evaluate the safety and efficacy of STR in patients with primary refractory multiple myeloma.
      These are patients who have failed to achieve at least a partial response to conventional
      therapy and have been undergoing treatment for less than 18 months. The trial is expected to
      enroll approximately 240 evaluable patients, half on the experimental arm and half on the
      control arm. Patients on the experimental arm will receive STR at a dose of 750 mCi/m2 plus
      the chemotherapy drug melphalan at 200 mg/m2, followed by autologous stem cell
      transplantation. Patients on the control arm will receive melphalan only, followed by
      transplantation. Patients on both study arms will be evaluated for response to treatment six
      months after transplantation, using an immunofixation assay to detect myeloma protein in
      patient samples. Analysis of patient samples will be conducted at a central laboratory, and
      blinded results will be reviewed by an independent panel of experts. The study's primary
      endpoint is complete response, as determined by the complete disappearance of myeloma protein
      at six months post-transplant.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      1.To determine the efficacy of STR (166Ho-DOTMP). The primary endpoint of this study is to
      compare the CR rate at 6 months post-transplant (in the absence of further therapy) in
      subjects with primary refractory multiple myeloma after treatment with 750 mCi/m2 166Ho-DOTMP
      plus 200 mg/m2 melphalan followed by autologous PBSCT to treatment with 200 mg/m2 melphalan
      alone followed by autologous PBSCT.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

        1. To compare the treatment groups with respect to survival and progression-free survival.

        2. To compare treatment groups with respect to overall response rate (CR+VGPR+PR), best
           response within 6 months, and duration of response.

        3. To compare the safety profile of the treatment groups.

        4. To assess the biodistribution and estimated radiation absorbed dose to kidney in the
           first 20 subjects.

      METHODOLOGY: Informed consent for participation in the study will be obtained, eligibility
      determined, and the subject registered. All subjects will receive a tracer dose of 30 mCi
      166Ho-DOTMP to determine skeletal uptake and biodistribution of 166Ho-DOTMP therapy. Subjects
      may receive a therapy dose only if 1) the tracer dose shows no aberrant distribution, and 2)
      if the skeletal residence time is at least 5.8 hours (equivalent to F x Te &gt; 4 hr). Subjects
      with adequate skeletal uptake and no aberrant distribution will be stratified based on the
      length of time since first induction therapy, and on response to prior therapy, and will
      undergo randomization to determine whether they will receive 166Ho DOTMP plus melphalan (Arm
      A) or melphalan alone (Arm B) as the conditioning regimen prior to autologous PBSCT.

      Subjects randomized to Arm A will be treated with 750 mCi/m2 166Ho DOTMP intravenously 4 to
      12 days after the tracer dose, with a total dosage not to exceed 1500 mCi. Five to 9 days
      after the 166Ho-DOTMP therapy dose, subjects will receive 200 mg/m2 melphalan IV.

      Subjects randomized to Arm B will receive 200 mg/m2 melphalan at least 10 days and no more
      than 3 weeks after the tracer dose.

      For all patients, cryopreserved hematopoietic stem cells will be infused 24 to 48 hours after
      melphalan. Subjects will be followed for safety assessments for 10 years or until death.
      Efficacy will be evaluated for up to 3 years in responding subjects, and disease relapse or
      progression and survival will be documented until Year 10.

      An analysis to estimate radiation dose to the kidney will be performed in the first 20
      patients. Additionally, after 6 months of follow-up have been completed on the first 20
      subjects in each arm, an analysis of the CR rate will be conducted to rule out lack of
      efficacy of 166Ho-DOTMP. A planned interim analysis to determine the efficacy of the
      treatment will be performed when 60 patients on each arm have completed 6 months of
      follow-up. Enrollment on trial will continue while these interim analyses are performed.

      NUMBER OF SUBJECTS: Two hundred and forty subjects who meet the eligibility criteria and
      receive study treatment will be followed on this protocol.
