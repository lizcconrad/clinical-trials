  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      RATIONALE: OSI-7904L may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking the enzymes necessary for
      their growth. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as oxaliplatin, work in different ways to stop
      tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Combining OSI-7904L with oxaliplatin
      may kill more tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of OSI-7904L and
      oxaliplatin in treating patients with refractory or recurrent advanced colorectal cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Determine the dose-limiting toxicity of OSI-7904L and oxaliplatin in patients with
           refractory or recurrent advanced colorectal cancer.

        -  Determine the maximum tolerated dose of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Determine a safe dose for this regimen in these patients.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the pharmacokinetic profile of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Determine the safety profile of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Determine the antitumor activity of this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a nonrandomized, multicenter, open-label, dose-escalation study.

      Patients receive oxaliplatin IV over 2 hours followed by OSI-7904L IV over 30 minutes on day
      1. Treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 6 courses in the absence of disease progression
      or unacceptable toxicity.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of OSI-7904L and oxaliplatin until the
      maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at
      which 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. A maximum of 12 patients receive
      treatment at the MTD.

      Patients are followed every 8 weeks.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 3-25 patients will be accrued for this study.
