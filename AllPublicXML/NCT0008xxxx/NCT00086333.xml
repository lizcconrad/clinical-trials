  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, randomized phase II trial of a monoclonal antibody (mAb) drug
      immunoconjugate, SGN-15, administered weekly in combination with weekly docetaxel. The
      primary objective of the study is to determine the optimal interval between SGN-15 and
      docetaxel using FDG-PET imaging as a surrogate marker of response. In addition, clinical
      response rate, duration of response, and survival data will be collected.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      SGN-15 is a mAb-drug immunoconjugate comprised of the chimeric anti-Lewis Y (LeY) mAb BR96,
      conjugated to doxorubicin. The LeY antigen is found as a glycoprotein at the cell surface on
      90% of carcinomas of the lung. SGN-15 induces its antitumor effect through binding to the
      cell surface LeY antigen. It is then rapidly internalized with release of doxorubicin inside
      the cell allowing the relative sparing of tissues normally affected by non-specific
      chemotherapy.

      The study is open to patients with good performance status (ECOG 0&lt;=2) with stage IIIB or IV
      NSCLC which is not potentially curable by surgery or combined modality therapy and who have
      received no prior lung cancer chemotherapy for metastatic NSCLC.

      Patients will be registered into one of two treatment sequences and wil receive SGN-15 and
      docetaxel in 4 week cycles consisting of treatment weekly for 3 weeks, followed by a week of
      rest.

      Arm A will receive a combination os SGN-15 and docetaxel on the same day. Arm B will receive
      the combination of SGN-15 followed by the docetaxel 3 days later. All patients will undergo
      PET imaging prior to treatment and on Day 22.

      Patients achieving a clinical response or stable disease as determined by physical
      examination and/or traditional restaging studies (using established RECIST criteria) after
      one 4 week cycle of therapy are eligible to receive continued cycles of SGN-15 and docetaxel
      on the same schedule until clinical or radiographic disease progression or toxicity occurs.
