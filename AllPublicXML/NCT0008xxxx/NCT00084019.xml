  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Long-term side effects, the expense of medications, and the difficulty of taking medications
      continuously for long periods of time are all problems with complicated anti-HIV drug
      regimens. The purpose of this study is to determine whether two drugs, atazanavir (ATV) and
      ritonavir (RTV), will control HIV infection when taken together without any other anti-HIV
      drugs after 48 weeks of viral suppression.

      Hypothesis: Simplified maintenance therapy with ATV and RTV alone after virologic suppression
      does not markedly increase the risk of virologic failure.

    <textblock>
      The expense, difficulty, and long-term adverse events associated with sustained adherence to
      combination antiretroviral therapy emphasize the need for simpler, alternative treatment
      strategies for HIV infection. Studies have shown that single protease inhibitor (PI)
      maintenance therapy may provide sufficient virologic suppression while reducing the risk of
      nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI)-associated metabolic complications.
      However, it is not known whether ritonavir-boosted atazanavir (ATV/RTV) maintenance therapy
      would be effective in controlling HIV replication in the genital compartments and whether
      viral load testing by blood collection would be effective in detecting elevated levels of HIV
      in the genital compartments. This study will determine whether simplified maintenance therapy
      with ATV/RTV after 48-week virologic suppression will increase the likelihood of virologic
      failure.

      This study will last 54 weeks. Participants will undergo an electrocardiogram (EKG) at
      screening. At study start, participants will switch from their current PIs to ATV/RTV and
      stay on their current NRTIs until Week 6, when they will discontinue their NRTIs and remain
      on a maintenance regimen of ATV/RTV alone for the duration of the study. Study visits will
      take place at Weeks 3 and 6, then every 4 weeks until Week 30, then every 8 weeks until the
      end of the study at Week 54. Medication assessment, physical exam, and blood work will occur
      at each study visit. At Week 30, viral load will be measured in the genital secretions of
      both male and female study participants.
