  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Eyetech Pharmaceuticals Inc. and Pfizer, Inc. are studying an investigational drug,
      MacugenTM, for the possible treatment of CRVO. An investigational drug is one that has not
      been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). This investigational drug may
      slow the growth of abnormal blood vessels in the eye and may reduce tissue swelling in the
      eye.

      The purpose of this study is to compare the safety and efficacy of a Macugen™ injection to a
      “pretend” injection. In addition, the purpose of this study is to measure the action of the
      study drug in the body over a period of time and to check for the presence of the study drug
      in your blood (called pharmacokinetics or PK).

      This study will involve approximately 90 people. People who decide to participate will have
      an equal chance (1 in 3) to receive one of three study injections, two of which are Macugen™
      and one of which is a “pretend” injection.

      This study will consist of 3 phases: a screening phase which will last up to two weeks, a
      confirmation phase which will last one day, and a randomization phase (the patient will be
      assigned by chance to a study group in this phase) which will last approximately 52 weeks.
