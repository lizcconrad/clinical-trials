      RATIONALE: Monoclonal antibodies such as trastuzumab can locate tumor cells and either kill
      them or deliver tumor-killing substances to them without harming normal cells. Imatinib
      mesylate may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking the enzymes necessary for their
      growth and by stopping blood flow to the tumor. Giving trastuzumab together with imatinib
      mesylate may kill more tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of imatinib mesylate
      when given together with trastuzumab in treating patients with recurrent or metastatic
      HER2/neu-expressing (producing) cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Determine the maximum tolerated dose of imatinib mesylate when administered with
           trastuzumab (Herceptin®) in patients with recurrent or metastatic
           HER2/neu-overexpressing cancer.

        -  Determine response in patients treated with this regimen.

      Secondary

        -  Correlate the number of circulating tumor cells with radiographic imaging in patients
           treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of imatinib mesylate.

      Patients receive trastuzumab (Herceptin®) IV over 90 minutes on day 1 and oral imatinib
      mesylate once or twice daily on days 1-21. Courses repeat every 21 days in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of imatinib mesylate until the maximum
      tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2
      of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 9-18 patients will be accrued for this study.
