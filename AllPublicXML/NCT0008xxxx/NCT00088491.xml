  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, double-blind study to determine how well intramuscular (IM) olanzapine
      depot works compared to oral olanzapine; evaluate the safety and tolerability of IM
      olanzapine depot compared to oral olanzapine; evaluate different doses of IM olanzapine
      depot; and determine the blood levels of IM olanzapine depot in patients at different points
      in time after an injection.
