      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as cisplatin, work in different ways to stop
      tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Safingol may stop the growth of tumor
      cells by blocking the enzymes necessary for their growth and by stopping blood flow to the
      tumor.

      PURPOSE: This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of safingol when given
      with cisplatin in treating patients with locally advanced or metastatic solid tumors.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of safingol when administered with cisplatin
           in patients with locally advanced or metastatic solid tumors.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the toxic effects of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Determine the clinical pharmacokinetics of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Determine, preliminarily, the therapeutic activity of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Determine a safe dose (i.e., near the MTD) for phase II evaluation of this regimen in
           these patients.

        -  Determine, preliminarily, the role of ceramide and S1P, relative to response and
           apoptosis, in patients treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is an open-label, non-randomized, dose-escalation study of safingol.

      Patients receive safingol IV over 1 hour and cisplatin IV over 1 hour on day 1. Courses
      repeat every 21 days* in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      NOTE: *Patients receive safingol on days 1 and 8 and cisplatin on day 8 for course 1 only;
      course 1 is 28 days in duration.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of safingol until the maximum tolerated dose
      (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2 of 6
      patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. Once the MTD is determined, 10 additional
      patients are treated at that dose level.
