      RATIONALE: Interleukin-2 may stimulate a person's white blood cells to kill renal cell
      carcinoma (kidney cancer) cells.

      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well high-dose intravenous interleukin-2 works
      in treating patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma that has not responded to previous
      low-dose intravenous or subcutaneous interleukin-2.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the response rate (complete, partial, and minor) in patients with metastatic
           renal cell carcinoma who failed prior low-dose intravenous or subcutaneous interleukin-2
           (IL-2) when treated with high-dose intravenous IL-2.

        -  Determine the overall survival, disease-free survival, and time to progression in
           patients treated with this drug.

        -  Determine the toxicity of this drug in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a pilot study.

      Patients receive high-dose interleukin-2 IV every 8 hours for 15 doses followed 7-10 days
      later by another 15 doses (course 1).

      Patients are assesed for response 2 months after initiation of treatment. Patients with
      responding or stable disease receive a second course of therapy. Patients with an ongoing
      response receive subsequent courses of treatment in the absence of unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are followed every 6 months for survival.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 20 patients will be accrued for this study.
