      RATIONALE: Monoclonal antibodies, such as monoclonal antibody 3F8, can locate tumor cells and
      either kill them or deliver tumor-killing substances to them without harming normal cells.
      Beta-glucan, isotretinoin, and sargramostim may increase the effectiveness of monoclonal
      antibody 3F8 by making tumor cells more sensitive to the monoclonal antibody. Combining
      different types of biological therapy may kill more tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well giving beta-glucan, isotretinoin, and
      sargramostim together with monoclonal antibody 3F8 works in treating patients with
      neuroblastoma that has not responded to previous treatment.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the efficacy of beta-glucan, isotretinoin, and sargramostim (GM-CSF) in
           enhancing monoclonal antibody 3F8-mediated ablation in patients with high-risk
           refractory neuroblastoma.

        -  Determine the antitumor activity of this regimen, in terms of assessing disease status
           in the bone marrow by real-time quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain
           reaction, in these patients.

        -  Determine the toxicity of this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is an open-label study. Patients are stratified according to refractory disease
      (primary refractory [never had disease progression or disease recurrence] vs secondary
      refractory [recurrent disease that did not respond completely to reinduction therapy]).

        -  Courses 1 and 2: Patients receive sargramostim (GM-CSF) subcutaneously once daily on
           days -5 to 11. Patients also receive oral beta-glucan once daily on days -2 to 11 and
           monoclonal antibody (MOAB) 3F8 IV over 30-90 minutes on days 0-4 and 7-11.

        -  Courses 3 and 4: Patients receive GM-CSF, beta-glucan, and MOAB 3F8 as above. Patients
           also receive oral isotretinoin twice daily on days -2 to 11.

      Treatment repeats every 2-4 weeks for 4 courses in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 27-74 patients (10-33 for stratum 1 and 17-41 for stratum 2)
      will be accrued for this study.
