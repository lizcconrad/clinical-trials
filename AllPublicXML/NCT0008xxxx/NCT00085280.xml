  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This clinical trial is studying how well erlotinib works in treating patients with stage
      IIIB, stage IV, or recurrent non-small cell lung cancer. Erlotinib may stop the growth of
      tumor cells by blocking the enzymes necessary for their growth.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Prospectively identify downstream markers of EGFR linked signaling pathways that are
      predictive of response to OSI-774 (Erlotinib) in this population.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Estimate antitumor objective response rate per RECIST. II. Estimate disease control rate
      (CR+PR+SD). III. Estimate time to progression and overall survival. IV. Estimate if a grade 2
      rash is a predictor of response to OSI-774 (Erlotinib) and of patient survival.

      V. Assess safety profile of OSI-774 (Erlotinib) in this population. VI. To determine whether
      smoking status is linked to outcome for advanced NSCLC patients treated with OSI-774
      (Erlotinib).

      OUTLINE: This is a pilot, multicenter study.

      Patients receive oral erlotinib once daily on days 1-28. Courses repeat every 28 days in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients complete the Smoking Status Survey, a questionnaire regarding smoking habits, at
      baseline, and then every 3 months during study treatment.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years, and
      then every 6 months for 3 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 129 patients will be accrued for this study within 6 months.
