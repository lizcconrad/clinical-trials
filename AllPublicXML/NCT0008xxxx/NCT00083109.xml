  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as fluorouracil, work in different ways to stop tumor cells
      from dividing so they stop growing or die. Suramin may increase the effectiveness of
      fluorouracil by making tumor cells more sensitive to the drug. This phase I/II trial is
      studying the side effects and best dose of fluorouracil and the chemosensitizer suramin and
      to see how well they work in treating patients with metastatic renal cell (kidney) cancer.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the dose of suramin and fluorouracil that would result in plasma concentrations
      of suramin between 10-50 uM in patients with metastatic renal cell cancer. (Phase I) II.
      Determine the objective response rate (complete response and partial response) in patients
      treated with this regimen. (Phase II)

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the preliminary efficacy of this regimen in these patients. (Phase I) II.
      Determine the pharmacokinetics of low-dose suramin in these patients. (Phase I) III.
      Determine the time to tumor progression and progress rate at 3 and 6 months in patients
      treated with this regimen. (Phase II)

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation phase I study followed by a phase II study.

      PHASE I: Patients receive suramin IV over 30 minutes and fluorouracil IV on days 1, 8, 15,
      22, 29, and 36. Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses suramin and fluorouracil
      until the dose level allowing 10-50 uM of suramin into the patient's blood is determined
      without 2 or more of 6 patients experiencing dose-limiting toxicity.

      PHASE II: Patients receive suramin and fluorouracil (at the dose level determined in phase I)
      as in phase I.

      In both phases, courses repeat every 8 weeks for up to 1 year in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are followed for survival.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 36 patients will be accrued for this study.
