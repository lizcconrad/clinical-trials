  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to determine whether treatment with Armodafinil
      (CEP-10953) is more effective than placebo treatment for patients with excessive sleepiness
      associated with chronic shift work sleep disorder (SWSD) by measuring mean sleep latency from
      the Multiple Sleep Latency Test (MSLT) (20 minutes) (average of 4 naps at 0200, 0400, 0600,
      and 0800) and by Clinical Global Impression of Change (CGI-C) ratings.

    <description>The Multiple Sleep Latency Test (MSLT) is an objective assessment of sleepiness that measures the ability of a subject to remain awake. Long latencies to sleep are indicative of a patient's ability to remain awake. Mean sleep latency from MSLT was measured for five 20-minute (maximum) MSLT naps performed at scheduled visits (2400 [midnight], 0200, 0400, 0600, and 0800).The MSLT was administered at weeks 4, 8, and 12. The primary efficacy variable was the mean change from the baseline assessment in MSLT sleep latency as assessed at week 12 (or last postbaseline visit).</description>

    <measure>Clinical Global Impression of Change (CGI-C)</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Number of participants who had at least minimal improvement in CGI-C ratings at Week 12 or last post-baseline visit. The CGI-C uses the following categories and scoring assignments: 1=Very much improved; 2=Much improved; 3=Minimally improved; 4=No change; 5=Minimally worse; 6=Much worse; and 7=Very much worse. Severity of illness was assessed at baseline by the CGI-S, which consists of the following categories: 1=Normal (shows no signs of illness); 2=Borderline ill; 3=Mildly (Slightly) ill; 4=Moderately ill; 5=Markedly ill; 6=Severely ill; and 7=Among the most extremely ill patients.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Patients are included in the study if all of the following criteria are met:

          -  Written informed consent is obtained.

          -  The patient is an outpatient, man or woman of any ethnic origin, 18 to 65 years of age
             (inclusive).

          -  The patient has a complaint of excessive sleepiness.

          -  The patient has a diagnosis of SWSD according to International Classification of Sleep
             Disorders (ICSD) criteria, and must have had excessive sleepiness during night shifts
             for at least 3 months.

          -  The patient must work at least 5 night shifts per month, of which at least 3 nights
             are consecutive, and plan to maintain this schedule.

          -  The patient must work night shifts that include at least 6 hours between 2200 and 0800
             and be no longer than 12 hours in duration.

          -  The patient is in good health as determined by a medical and psychiatric history,
             physical examination, ECG, and serum chemistry and hematology.

          -  Women must be surgically sterile, 2 years postmenopausal, or, if of child-bearing
             potential, using a medically accepted method of birth control (ie, barrier method with
             spermicide, steroidal contraceptive, or intrauterine device [IUD]) and agree to
             continued use of this method for the duration of the study. Steroidal contraceptives
             must be used with a barrier method while taking the study drug and for at least a full

          -  The patient has a CGI-S rating as it pertains to sleepiness during night shifts
             including the commute to and from work.

          -  The patient does not have any medical or psychiatric disorders that could account for
             the excessive sleepiness during the night shift.

          -  The patient is able to complete self rating scales and computer-based testing.

          -  The patient is willing and able to comply with study restrictions and to attend

          -  has used an investigational drug within 1 month before the screening visit

        <title>Multiple Sleep Latency Test (MSLT)</title>
        <description>The Multiple Sleep Latency Test (MSLT) is an objective assessment of sleepiness that measures the ability of a subject to remain awake. Long latencies to sleep are indicative of a patient’s ability to remain awake. Mean sleep latency from MSLT was measured for five 20-minute (maximum) MSLT naps performed at scheduled visits (2400 [midnight], 0200, 0400, 0600, and 0800).The MSLT was administered at weeks 4, 8, and 12. The primary efficacy variable was the mean change from the baseline assessment in MSLT sleep latency as assessed at week 12 (or last postbaseline visit).</description>
