      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as VNP40101M and hydroxyurea, work in different
      ways to stop cancer cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Hydroxyurea may help
      VNP40101M kill more cancer cells by making cancer cells more sensitive to the drug.

      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well giving VNP40101M with hydroxyurea works in
      treating patients with acute myelogenous leukemia or high-risk myelodysplasia.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the complete response rate to VNP40101M in patients with acute myelogenous
           leukemia or high-risk myelodysplasia .

        -  Determine the toxic effects of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Determine the pharmacokinetics of this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is an open-label, multicenter study. Patients are stratified to acute
      myelogenous leukemia (AML) or high risk myelodysplasia (MDS) patients ≥ 60 years old with no
      prior treatment vs AML patients any age in first relapse. (AML patients any age in first
      relapse closed to accrual 06/09/05).

      Patients receive VNP40101M IV over 30 minutes once on day 1 (course 1).

      Four to five weeks after the first course, patients undergo bone marrow aspiration and
      biopsy. If the bone marrow is improved but contains residual leukemia, patients receive a
      second course of VNP40101M (at the same dose as in course 1). If patients achieve complete
      response (CR), or partial CR after the first or second course, a consolidation course may be
      given comprising VNP40101M at a reduced dose.

      Patients are followed monthly for 6 months, every 2 months for 12 months, and then every 3
      months for 18 months .

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 230 patients (100 with acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) or
      high-risk myelodysplasia and 130 with AML in first relapse) will be accrued for this study.
