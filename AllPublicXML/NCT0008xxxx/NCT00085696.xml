    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of VELCADE when given
      in combination with rituximab in patients with Relapsed or Refractory Indolent B-Cell
      Lymphoma. This study will investigate if treatment with VELCADE and rituximab increases the
      time it takes your lymphoma to get worse.
