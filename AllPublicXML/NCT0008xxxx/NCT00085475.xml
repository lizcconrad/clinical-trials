      RATIONALE: Imatinib mesylate may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking the enzymes
      necessary for their growth.

      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well imatinib mesylate works in treating
      patients with locally advanced or metastatic dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans or giant cell
      fibroblastoma.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Determine the therapeutic activity of imatinib mesylate in patients with locally
           advanced or metastatic dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans or giant cell fibroblastoma.

        -  Determine the progression-free rate at 14 weeks in patients treated with this drug.

      Secondary

        -  Determine objective response rate, progression-free survival, and overall survival in
           patients treated with this drug.

        -  Determine the duration of response in patients treated with this drug.

      OUTLINE: This is an open-label, non-randomized, multicenter study.

      Patients receive oral imatinib mesylate twice daily for at least 14 weeks in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients with stable disease after 14 weeks
      receive imatinib mesylate for 12 additional weeks. Patients with a partial or complete
      response at 14 weeks undergo surgical resection if possible. If surgical resection of all
      remaining tumor is not possible OR if complete resection is not achieved (section margins
      positive), patients continue to receive imatinib mesylate in the absence of disease
      progression

      Patients are followed monthly for 6 months, every 3 months for 6 months, every 6 months for 2
      years, and then annually thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 44 patients will be accrued for this study within 2 years.
