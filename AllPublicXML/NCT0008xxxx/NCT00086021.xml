      headache sufferers.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Acupuncture has been shown to reduce the frequency and severity of some types of headaches,
      but the efficacy of acupuncture for chronic daily headaches has not been studied. The
      long-term goals of this study are to reduce the symptoms that are associated with recurrent
      headaches and to collect data that can be used for future acupuncture studies.

      Participants in this study will be randomly assigned to receive 8 weeks of either standard
      care or ten acupuncture treatments in addition to medical care. Self-report questionnaires
      will be used to assess headaches and daily pain severity.
