      This study will determine whether uninterrupted treatment with birth control pills over
      several menstrual cycles prevents severe premenstrual syndrome (PMDD).

      Previous studies have shown that the hormones estrogen and progesterone regulate mood in
      women with MRMD. This study will use various treatment regimens with birth control pills and
      placebo (sugar pill) to clarify the relationships among estrogen and progesterone, the
      menstrual cycle, and mood.

      Healthy women between 18 and 45 years of age who menstruate may be eligible for this 15-week
      study. Candidates are screened with a physical examination, blood and urine tests, an
      electrocardiogram, and 3 months of symptoms ratings to confirm MRMD.

      Participants are randomly assigned to one of three treatment groups. Group 1 takes a birth
      control pill every day and on three occasions takes a placebo capsule. Group 2 takes a birth
      control pill most but not all days and on three occasions takes a placebo capsule. Group 3
      takes a birth control pill every day and on three occasions takes another medication called
      CDB-2914 that causes menstrual bleeding to occur.

      Participants come to the NIH clinic every other week for blood tests and measurement of vital
      signs (blood pressure, pulse, and temperature) and to complete symptoms ratings scales.
      Subjects who develop breakthrough bleeding (menstruation earlier than expected) will have a
      transvaginal ultrasound. For this procedure, a probe is inserted into the vagina for about 10
      minutes. The probe gives off and receives sound waves that can be used to form a picture of
      the endometrium (lining of the uterus).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Results from previous protocols (#90-M-0088 and 92-M-0174) have demonstrated that women with
      menstrually-related mood disorder (MRMD), but not women lacking this disorder, experience
      mood deterioration within approximately one to two weeks after exposure to either estradiol
      or progesterone in the context of gonadal suppression (induced by use of the depot
      gonadotropin releasing hormone agonist leuprolide acetate). Preliminary results of protocol
      00-M-0103 suggest that this hormone-induced depression occurs consequent to changes in
      gonadal steroid levels and not to simple exposure to basal levels above a critical threshold.
      Additionally, continued administration of hormone for three months resulted in no further
      symptoms subsequent to the initial precipitated episode. These data suggest the potential
      therapeutic benefit of extended oral contraceptive (OC) regimens with reduced pill-free
      intervals in MRMD to minimize the mood destabilizing effects of changing hormone levels. In
      this protocol we examine whether the effects of 15 weeks of continuous oral contraceptive
      administration causes a remission of symptoms in women with MRMD.

    <measure>Change in Premenstrual Tension Syndrome Scale (PMTS) Factors Associated With Premenstrual Symptoms.</measure>
    <time_frame>Every 2 weeks for 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>The PMTS observer scales assess symptoms in ten different domains including irritability-hostility; tension; efficiency; dysphoria; moodiness; motor coordination; mental-cognitive functioning; eating habits; sexual drive and activity; physical symptoms and social impairment. They have been used to measure premenstrual symptom severity and response to treatment in several clinical trials and prevalence studies. Score ranges from no symptoms to severe symptoms on a scale of 0 to 6, with 0 being no symptoms and 6 being severely symptomatic.</description>

    <measure>Change in Clinical Global Impression Scale (CGI) Factors Associated With Premenstrual Symptoms.</measure>
    <time_frame>Every 2 wks for 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>The CGI was developed for use in NIMH-sponsored clinical trials to provide a brief, stand-alone assessment of the clinician's view of the patient's global functioning prior to and after initiating a study medication.1 The CGI provides an overall clinician-determined summary measure that takes into account all available information, including a knowledge of the patient's history, psychosocial circumstances, symptoms, behavior, and the impact of the symptoms on the patient's ability to function. The CGI actually comprises two companion one-item measures evaluating the following: (a) severity of psychopathology from 1 to 7 and (b) change from the initiation of treatment on a similar seven-point scale, with 1 being normal/more improved and 7 being severe/worse.</description>

    <description>The Beck Depression Inventory (BDI)is a 21-question multiple-choice self-report inventory, one of the most widely used instruments for measuring the severity of depression. Total scores are interpreted per these ranges:
0-9: indicates minimal depression 10-18: indicates mild depression 19-29: indicates moderate depression 30-63: indicates severe depression.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA (are from protocol 81-M-0126 and are as follows):

          -  Subjects who meet criteria for MRMD are healthy (by physical exam, normal pelvic exam
             and pap smear, and normal lab values) and medication free will be included in this
             study.

          -  Oral contraceptives (and CDB-2914 in arm #3) will not be administered to any subject
             with significant clinical or laboratory abnormalities.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

        Any patient with a current axis I psychiatric diagnosis will be excluded from participating
        in this protocol.

        Subjects taking psychotropic agents (e.g. antidepressants, anxiolytics or mood stabilizers)
        will likewise be excluded from the study.

        Women who have received glucocorticoid or megestrol therapy within the last year (and thus
        may experience residual suppression of the compensatory HPA axis response to
        CDB-2914-induced glucocorticoid receptor antagonism) will be also excluded, albeit almost
        entirely on theoretical grounds.

        Women who have any chronic medical conditions or are taking medications will be excluded.

        Women who have a medical condition or are taking any chronic medications that may increase
        serum potassium levels will also be excluded.

        Those patients who would be uncomfortable with extending the length of their menstrual
        cycles will not be enrolled in this study and will either be offered participation in
        another study or an outside referral for treatment in the community.

        The following conditions will constitute contraindications to treatment with continuous
        oral contraception or the use of the progesterone antagonist, CDB-2914, and will preclude a
        patient's participating in this protocol:

          -  history of endometriosis, or recent, rapid growth of uterine fibroid tumors (defined
             as doubling in size in six month period);

          -  history of breast carcinoma;

          -  history of pulmonary embolism or phlebothrombosis;

          -  undiagnosed vaginal bleeding;

          -  porphyria;

          -  history of malignant melanoma;

          -  history of cholecystitis or pancreatitis;

        <title>Change in Clinical Global Impression Scale (CGI) Factors Associated With Premenstrual Symptoms.</title>
        <description>The CGI was developed for use in NIMH-sponsored clinical trials to provide a brief, stand-alone assessment of the clinician's view of the patient's global functioning prior to and after initiating a study medication.1 The CGI provides an overall clinician-determined summary measure that takes into account all available information, including a knowledge of the patient's history, psychosocial circumstances, symptoms, behavior, and the impact of the symptoms on the patient's ability to function. The CGI actually comprises two companion one-item measures evaluating the following: (a) severity of psychopathology from 1 to 7 and (b) change from the initiation of treatment on a similar seven-point scale, with 1 being normal/more improved and 7 being severe/worse.</description>
        <time_frame>Every 2 wks for 3 months</time_frame>
        <population>This study was terminated early due to confounding factors in design. Protocol terminated after receiving information from manufacturer (Pharma) that CDB-2914 crosses the blood-brain barrier, invalidating Arm #3 due to potential Central Nervous System effect of the compound on behavior.</population>
