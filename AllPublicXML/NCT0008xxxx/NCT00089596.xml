    <textblock>
      This study hopes to show that specially treated umbilical cord cells, called stem cells, can
      be safely given to a person after they receive chemoradiation therapy or chemotherapy for
      their illness. During chemoradiation therapy or chemotherapy, a person loses all of the cells
      that are needed to make the different types of cells in their blood, including their immune
      system cells. These cells must be replaced in order for the blood and immune systems to work
      properly. Some people receive bone marrow transplants or other types of stem cell transplants
      to get the cells they need. CB001 is being developed as an option for people who need bone
      marrow transplants or other types of transplants to replace those cells. It is also being
      developed for people who do not have the option of other types of transplants.
