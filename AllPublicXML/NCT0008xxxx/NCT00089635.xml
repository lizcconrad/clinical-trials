  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine that ABX-EGF (panitumumab) will have clinically
      meaningful anti-tumor activity in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer who have
      developed progressive disease or relapsed while on or after prior fluoropyrimidine,
      irinotecan and oxaliplatin chemotherapy.

    <measure>Objective Tumor Response Through Week 16</measure>
    <time_frame>From enrollment through Week 16</time_frame>
    <description>Confirmed objective tumor response was defined as a complete response or partial response from enrollment through Week 16. Tumor response was monitored, beginning at Week 8, per a modified version of the World Health Organization (WHO) criteria for tumor response and progression by an independent review committee central assessment. Complete response was defined per modified WHO criteria as disappearance of all lesions (index and non-index). Partial response was defined as ≥ 50% decrease from Baseline in the sum of the products of the longest diameters (SPD) of index lesions. Scans were required to confirm a complete or partial response no earlier than 4 weeks from the time a response of complete or partial response was first documented.</description>

    <measure>Duration of Response</measure>

    <description>Kaplan-Meier estimate of time time from first objective response to first observed progression of disease or death if the death was due to disease progression (whichever comes first) among participants who had a response at any time on study. Participants who responded and did not progress while on study or who died for reasons other than disease progression while on study were censored at their last evaluable assessment date.</description>

    <description>Kaplan-Meier estimate of median time from date of enrollment to date of first observed progression or death date if the death was due to disease progression (whichever comes first); in those participants who had a best response of stable disease.
Stable Disease is defined as neither sufficient shrinkage of index lesions to qualify for a partial response nor sufficient increase to qualify for progressive disease taking as reference the nadir sum of the products of the longest diameters since the treatment started.</description>

        <title>Objective Tumor Response Through Week 16</title>
        <description>Confirmed objective tumor response was defined as a complete response or partial response from enrollment through Week 16. Tumor response was monitored, beginning at Week 8, per a modified version of the World Health Organization (WHO) criteria for tumor response and progression by an independent review committee central assessment. Complete response was defined per modified WHO criteria as disappearance of all lesions (index and non-index). Partial response was defined as ≥ 50% decrease from Baseline in the sum of the products of the longest diameters (SPD) of index lesions. Scans were required to confirm a complete or partial response no earlier than 4 weeks from the time a response of complete or partial response was first documented.</description>

      <pi_employee>Principal Investigators are NOT employed by the organization sponsoring the study.</pi_employee>
      <restrictive_agreement>The Clinical Trial Agreement generally does not restrict an investigator’s discussion of trial results after completion. The Agreement permits Amgen a limited period of time to review material discussing trial results (typically up to 45 days and possible extension). Amgen may remove confidential information, but authors have final control and approval of publication content. For multi-center studies, the investigator agrees not to publish any results before the first multi-center publication.</restrictive_agreement>
