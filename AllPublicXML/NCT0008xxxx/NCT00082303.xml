      The purpose of this study is to explore the effect of music imagery on patients receiving
      intensive chemotherapy for acute leukemia or high-grade non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Standard treatment for acute leukemia and high-grade non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma includes
      intensive chemotherapy that typically requires a 4-week hospital stay in protective
      isolation. Patients treated in isolation units may experience elevated levels of
      psychological distress. Both guided imagery and music therapy have been effective in
      improving the moods of cancer patients, but studies have not been conducted in acute leukemia
      and non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma patients. This study will evaluate the effect of music imagery on
      these patients.

      Participants in this study will be randomly assigned to receive either standard care plus
      music imagery or standard care alone. Participants assigned to the standard care plus music
      imagery group will receive a 45-minute weekly music imagery session with a music therapist.
      All participants will complete questionnaires and self-reports regarding their general
      anxiety, affect, and fatigue.
