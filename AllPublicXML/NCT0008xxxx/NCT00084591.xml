      RATIONALE: Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to damage tumor cells.
      Intensity-modulated radiation therapy (radiation directed at the tumor more precisely than in
      standard radiation therapy) with incorporated boost (an increase in the amount of radiation
      given during treatment) may cause less damage to normal tissue. Drugs used in chemotherapy,
      such as capecitabine, work in different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop
      growing or die. Giving radiation therapy together with chemotherapy before surgery may shrink
      the tumor so it can be removed.

      PURPOSE: This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of neoadjuvant
      intensity-modulated radiation therapy with incorporated boost when given together with
      capecitabine in treating patients with locally advanced rectal cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Determine the maximum tolerated dose of neoadjuvant boost intensity-modulated
           radiotherapy when combined with capecitabine before surgery in patients with locally
           advanced rectal cancer.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the pathologic tumor response in patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine the quality of life of patients treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of boost intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT).

      Patients undergo neoadjuvant IMRT with incorporated boost once daily 5 days a week for 5
      weeks. Beginning on the first day of radiotherapy, patients receive oral capecitabine twice
      daily 7 days a week for 5 weeks. Patients undergo surgical resection 4-8 weeks after
      completion of chemoradiotherapy.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients undergo escalating doses of boost IMRT until the maximum tolerated
      dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 3
      of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.

      Quality of life is assessed at baseline, at week 5 of chemoradiotherapy, before surgery, and
      then at 1, 3, and 12 months after surgery.

      Patients are followed at 1, 3, and 12 months after surgery.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 3-15 patients will be accrued for this study.
