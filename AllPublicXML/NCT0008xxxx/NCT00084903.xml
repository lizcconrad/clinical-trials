      RATIONALE: New diagnostic procedures such as fluorescence and reflectance spectroscopy
      (shining light on tissue and measuring patterns of light reflected) may improve the ability
      to noninvasively detect cervical intraepithelial neoplasia and dysplasia.

      PURPOSE: This diagnostic trial is studying how well fluorescence and reflectance spectroscopy
      during colposcopy work in detecting cervical intraepithelial neoplasia and dysplasia in
      healthy participants with a history of normal Pap smears.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Identify potential improvements in noninvasive methods of diagnosing dysplasia and
           neoplasia of the cervix using fluorescence and reflectance spectroscopy in healthy
           participants with a history of normal pap smears.

        -  Determine the reflection and fluorescence spectra of in vivo samples of the normal human
           cervix.

        -  Refine the detection of cervical lesions by fluorescence spectroscopy in these
           participants using improved classification of normal columnar tissue and non-neoplastic
           tissue with inflammation.

        -  Determine and validate the wavelength selections for spectroscopic diagnosis derived
           from in vitro measurements from these participants.

        -  Compare specific tissue sections from these participants with their excitation-emission
           matrices in order to identify the cell types contributing to the signal.

      OUTLINE: Participants undergo placement of a fiber optic probe on one normal columnar cell
      site and one normal squamous cell site of the cervix during colposcopy*. The probe delivers
      laser light at a specific excitation wavelength and collects fluorescence from the entire
      emission wavelength range from the mucosa. Participants undergo biopsies of both sites.

      NOTE: *The columnar epithelium will not be colposcopically visible in all patients, in which
      case 2 normal squamous sites will be measured

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 1,000 participants will be accrued for this study.
