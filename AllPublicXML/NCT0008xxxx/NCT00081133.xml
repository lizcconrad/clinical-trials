      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as arsenic trioxide, work in different ways to
      stop cancer cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Imatinib mesylate may stop the
      growth of cancer cells by blocking the enzymes necessary for their growth. Combining arsenic
      trioxide with imatinib mesylate may kill more cancer cells.

      PURPOSE: This phase I/II trial is studying the side effects and best dose of arsenic trioxide
      when given with imatinib mesylate and to see how well they work in treating patients with
      accelerated phase or blastic phase chronic myelogenous leukemia or Philadelphia
      chromosome-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Determine the maximum tolererated dose of arsenic trioxide when administered with
           imatinib mesylate in patients with accelerated or blastic phase chronic myelogenous
           leukemia or Philadelphia chromosome-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia.

        -  Determine the rate of complete morphologic remission in the bone marrow of patients
           treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a phase I dose-escalation study of arsenic trioxide followed by a phase II
      study.

        -  Phase I:

             -  Induction therapy: Patients receive oral imatinib mesylate once daily on days 1-35
                (weeks 1-5) and arsenic trioxide IV over 1-4 hours on days 1-5, 8-12, 15-19, and
                22-26 (weeks 1-4).

      Patients undergo bone marrow evaluation on week 5. Patients achieving a morphologic remission
      proceed to consolidation therapy. Patients not achieving morphologic remission receive a
      second course of imatinib mesylate as above on weeks 6-10 and arsenic trioxide as above on
      weeks 6-9. Patients are re-evaluated on week 10. Patients achieving morphologic remission
      proceed to consolidation therapy. Patients not achieving a morphologic remission are removed
      from study.

        -  Consolidation therapy: Patients receive oral imatinib mesylate as in induction therapy
           on approximately weeks 6-11 (or weeks 11-16*) and arsenic trioxide IV over 1-4 hours on
           days 1, 3, 5, 8, 10, 12, 15, 17, 19, 22, 24, and 26 (approximately weeks 6-9 OR weeks
           11-14*).

      Patients who remain in morphologic remission receive a second course of imatinib mesylate as
      in induction therapy on approximately weeks 12-17 (or weeks 17-22*) and arsenic trioxide as
      above (in consolidation therapy) on approximately weeks 12-15 (or weeks 17-20*).

      NOTE: *For patients who receive a second course of induction therapy

      Cohorts of 6 patients receive escalating doses of arsenic trioxide until the maximum
      tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2
      of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.

        -  Phase II: Patients receive arsenic trioxide at the MTD and imatinib mesylate as in phase
           I.

      Treatment in both phases continues in the absence of unacceptable toxicity or disease
      progression.

      After completion of consolidation therapy, patients may continue imatinib mesylate off study
      at the discretion of the physician. Patients who become candidates for stem cell
      transplantation at any time during the study are removed from study.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 6-43 patients (6-12 for phase I and 37 [including 6 patients
      from phase I] for phase II) will be accrued for this study within 2 years.
