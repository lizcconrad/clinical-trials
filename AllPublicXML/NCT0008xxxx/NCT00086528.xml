      The primary objective of this study is as follows:

        -  To evaluate the safety and tolerability of XL647 administered orally as a single dose
           and as repeat doses in subjects with solid tumors.

      The secondary objectives of this study are as follows:

        -  To evaluate the plasma pharmacokinetics of XL647 administered orally as a single dose
           and as repeat doses in subjects with solid tumors,

        -  To estimate renal elimination of XL647 administered orally as a single dose in subjects
           with solid tumors.

      The exploratory objective of this study is as follows:

        -  To assess the pharmacodynamic effects of XL647 administration in plasma and peripheral
           blood cells.

      In addition, subjects may be eligible to enter a Treatment Extension Period. The following
      information will be obtained from this part of the study:

        -  Long-term safety and tolerability of XL647 after repeat administration,

        -  Tumor response after repeat administration of XL647.

    <description>Administered orally as a solution with mass-based dosing in early cohorts or as 50-mg tablets at a fixed dose at the MTD. A minimum of 3 subjects was planned for each dosing cohort with dose escalation dependent on subject tolerance of the prior dose. During the Treatment Period, subjects in each cohort were administered a single dose of XL647 on Day 1 followed by a 72-hour period of observation. If there were no XL647-related dose limiting toxicities, subjects received 5 daily doses of XL647 on Days 4-8. Twenty-one days after the initial dose, in the absence of unacceptable toxicity or disease progression, subjects could enter a Treatment Extension Period that consisted of repeated 2-week cycles of five oral doses of XL647 followed by a 9-day observation period.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  The subject has a histologically confirmed malignancy that is metastatic or

             are no longer effective,

          -  The subject has disease that is assessable by tumor marker, physical, or radiologic
             means,

          -  The subject is ≥18 years old,

          -  There have been at least 4 weeks since prior chemotherapy or radiation therapy (6
