      Capsaicin to Control Pain Following Third Molar Extraction

      Summary: This study will test the effectiveness of the drug capsaicin in controlling pain
      after third molar (wisdom tooth) extraction. Capsaicin, the ingredient in chili peppers that
      makes them &quot;hot,&quot; belongs to a class of drugs called vanilloids, which have been found to
      temporarily inactivate pain-sensing nerves. If capsaicin alleviates pain in dental surgery,
      it may have potential for use in many types of surgery and painful illnesses.

      Healthy normal volunteers between 16 and 40 years of age who require third molar (wisdom
      tooth) extraction may be eligible for this study. Participants undergo the following
      procedures in three visits:

      Visit 1

      Patients have touch (sensory) testing inside the mouth using three methods: 1) applying a
      temperature probe onto the gums and having the patient rate how warm it is; 2) applying a
      gentle stroke across the gums with the bristles of a small paint brush and having the patient
      say whether or not it feels painful; and 3) applying a light touch to the gums with a small
      needle and having the patient rate the pain intensity following the touch. Following touch
      testing, the patient's mouth is numbed with an anesthetic and a small piece of gum tissue
      next to the lower wisdom tooth is removed (biopsied). Then, a small amount of either
      capsaicin or placebo (saline, or salt water) is injected next to the wisdom tooth.

      Visit 2

      Following repeat the touch testing, patients are sedated with an injection of midazolam. They
      then have another biopsy under local anesthesia on the same side of the mouth as the first
      biopsy. Their mouth is again numbed with an anesthetic, and they are given either a
      pain-relieving medicine called Toradol or a placebo injected into the arm. One lower wisdom
      tooth is then extracted. After the extraction, pain ratings are recorded every 20 minutes for
      up to 6 hours. During this time, patients are monitored for vital signs, numbness, pain, and
      side effects. Patients who request pain-relief medication are given acetaminophen and
      codeine. At the end of the study, they are discharged from the clinic and given acetaminophen
      and codeine to take at home, as instructed. They are provided a pain diary to record pain
      ratings and any adverse reactions that might occur until the last visit.

      Visit 3

      Patients return for a follow-up evaluation 48 hours after discharge from the clinic. At the
      end of the evaluation, they are discharged home with flurbiprofen for pain relief. Remaining
      wisdom teeth are removed &quot;off-study&quot; no sooner than 1 week following the first visit.

      Successful preemptive analgesic strategies are superior to traditional pain management
      schemes in the management of post-operative pain. The premise of this double-blind, placebo
      and positive-controlled clinical study is to evaluate the efficacy of vanilloid agonists as
      preemptive agents in an oral surgery tissue injury model. Vanilloids are a class of small
      organic compounds; the most familiar of which is capsaicin, the active ingredient in hot
      pepper. Binding of capsaicin to the vanilloid-1 receptor produces initial activation and then
      long-acting desensitization of pain specific neurons. We propose to produce a selective,
      long-term inactivation of peripheral pain transmission through the local application of
      capsaicin in the oral mucosa in an effort to prevent or reduce post-operative pain in the
      oral surgery model. Healthy subjects will be recruited, and following local anesthesia and
      conscious sedation, will be given an intramucosal injection of either capsaicin or placebo,
      or as a positive control, intravenous ketorolac. Subjects will rate pain and time of
      analgesic rescue medication request will be noted. Small biopsies will be removed from the
      extraction site prior to drug injection and at 48 hr post-operatively. Tissue levels of
      neurogenic inflammatory mediators and sensory neuron content will be compared pre- and
      post-operatively. A decrease in post-operative pain and decrease in analgesic use will be
      taken as a positive effect of the vanilloid for decreasing post-operative pain. We anticipate
      that through the long term blockade of pain specific fibers pre-operatively that there will
      be significant attenuation of post-operative pain development following surgery. This has
      significant implications for reducing pain and suffering, decreasing analgesic use, and
      reducing post-operative complications following surgery.

        INCLUSION CRITERIA:

        Male or female volunteers referred for mandibular third molar extraction with a minimal
        difficulty rating score of 2 - 3 at the time of screening; rating will be verified by the
        oral surgeon at time of surgery. (Rating scale: 1 = erupted; 2 = soft tissue impaction; 3 =
        partial bony impaction; 4 = full bony impaction).

        Age between 16-40.

        ASA status 1 or 2, deemed in good general health (able to tolerate outpatient conscious
        sedation safely).

        Willing to wait up to 4 hours for post-operative observation.

        Willing to return at 48 hours for a second tissue biopsy.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

        ASA status 3-5 and Emergency operation (E) that do not get a physician clearance; i.e.
        systemic disturbances that limits the patient's activity.

        Pregnant or breast-feeding mothers.

        Allergy to investigational drugs or to red chili peppers.

        Chronic use of analgesics (not limited to, but including: non-steroidal anti-inflammatory
        medications, steroids, anti-depressants, anti-convulsants).
