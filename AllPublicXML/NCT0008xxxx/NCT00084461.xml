  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of romidepsin in treating patients who have locally
      advanced or metastatic neuroendocrine tumors. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as romidepsin,
      work in different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine objective response rate in patients with locally advanced or metastatic
      neuroendocrine tumors treated with FR901288 (romidepsin).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the toxicity of this drug in these patients. II. To measure serum tumor markers
      (pancreastatin, gastrin, pancreatic polypeptide, glucagon, substance-P, neurotensin,
      calcitonin, somatostatin, vasoactive intestinal peptide, gastrin releasing polypeptide, ACTH)
      depending on the tumor type pre-, during-, and post-treatment.

      III. To perform a nuclear medicine functional imaging scan (octreoscan) to evaluate the
      disease status pre-, during-, and post-treatment.

      IV. To perform histone acetylation assay in cytospins from peripheral blood mononuclear cells
      (PBMCs) to correlate with disease response and with immunologic parameters.

      V. To quantify gene expression by Real Time PCR of type 1 and type 2 cytokines,
      co-stimulatory molecules, and adhesion molecules in PBMCs obtained from the pre-, during-,
      and post-treatment blood samples.

      VI. To perform a multicolor flow cytometric analysis on fresh blood to assess activation of
      lymphocyte subsets and presence of co-stimulatory and adhesion molecules.

      VII. To perform in vitro functional assays for innate as well as antigen-specific T cell
      immune responses in PBMCs obtained from the pre-, during-, and post-treatment blood samples.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive romidepsin IV over 4 hours on days 1, 8, and 15. Treatment repeats every 28
      days for 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients
      achieving complete remission (CR) receive 2 additional courses beyond CR.

      Patients are followed at 2-4 weeks.
