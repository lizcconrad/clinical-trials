      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as irinotecan and flavopiridol, work in different
      ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Combining more than one
      drug may kill more tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well giving irinotecan together with
      flavopiridol works in treating patients with advanced liver cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Determine the time to progression in patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma
           treated with irinotecan and flavopiridol.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the response rate and overall survival in patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine the toxicity of this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is an open-label, non-randomized study.

      Patients receive irinotecan IV over 30 minutes and flavopiridol IV over 1 hour on days 1, 8,
      15, and 22. Courses repeat every 42 days in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 16-32 patients will be accrued for this study within 2 years.
