      Purpose of this study is to assess the safety and tolerability of AZD5438 given orally to
      patients with advanced solid malignancies A review of the emerging clinical tolerability and
      exposure data from this study in conjunction with preclinical and the available clinical
      pharmacodynamic data relating to AZD5438, led to a decision by AstraZeneca that the
      development of AZD5438 as a potential anti-cancer agent would be discontinued.
