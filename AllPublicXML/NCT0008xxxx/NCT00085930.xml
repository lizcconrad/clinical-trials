  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients have high-risk neuroblastoma, a form of cancer typically found in children. The
      patients previously participated in a gene transfer research study using special immune
      cells. This research study combines two different ways of fighting disease, antibodies and T
      cells. Antibodies are types of proteins that protect the body from bacterial and other
      infections. T cells, also called cytotoxic T lymphocytes or CTLs, are special
      infection-fighting blood cells that can kill some tumor cells. Both antibodies and T cells
      have been used to treat patients with cancers and while they have shown promise, they have
      not been strong enough to cure most patients. The antibody used in this study is called
      14g2a. This antibody sticks to neuroblastoma cells because of a substance on the outside of
      these cells called GD2. 14g2a and other antibodies that bind to GD2 have been used to treat
      people with neuroblastoma. For this study 14g2a has been changed so that instead of floating
      free in the blood, it is now joined to T cells. When an antibody is joined to a T cell in
      this way it is called a chimeric receptor. T lymphocytes or CTLs can kill tumor cells but
      there normally are not enough of them to kill all tumor cells. Some researchers have taken T
      cells from a person's blood, grown more of them in the laboratory and then given them back to
      the patient. Sometimes an antibody or chimeric receptor is attached to these T cells to help
      them bind to tumor cells. These chimeric receptor-T cells seem to kill some of the tumor, but
      they don't last very long in the body and so the tumor eventually comes back. We have found
      that T cells that are also trained to recognize the virus that causes infectious
      mononucleosis, Epstein Barr Virus (EBV), can stay in the blood stream for many years. By
      joining the 14g2a antibody to the CTLs that recognize EBV, we believe we will make a cell
      that can last a long time in the body (because they are EBV-specific) and recognize and kill
      neuroblastoma cells (because an antibody that can recognize these cells has been placed on
      their surface). Patients received treatment with the immune cells described above. They may
      want to receive an additional dose of these cells. This is being offered as an option because
      their neuroblastoma has returned and they have enough cells remaining to provide the patients
      with an additional dose. These 14g2a antibody CTLs are an investigational product not
      approved by the Food and Drug Administration.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Earlier, the patient gave us blood to make 14g2a chimeric receptor-T cells and 14g2a chimeric
      receptor-EBV CTLs in the laboratory. These cells were grown and frozen for the patient. The
      patient received treatment with these cells. However, there are enough cells remaining that
      we are able to offer to treat the patient with an additional dose if they would like.

      As with the original treatment, the patient will be given an injection of cells into the vein
      through and IV. Before the injection is received, the patient will be given a dose of
      Benadryl and Tylenol. The injection will take about 2 minutes. We will follow the patient in
      the clinic after the injection for 3 hours. The treatment will be given by the Center for
      Cell and Gene Therapy at Texas Children's Hospital.

      Medical tests before treatment--

      Before being treated, the patient will receive a series of standard medical tests:

        -  Physical exam

        -  Blood tests to measure blood cells, kidney and liver function

        -  Measurements of tumor by scans and bone marrow studies if the bone marrow may show
           evidence of disease

      Medical tests during and after treatment:

      The patient will receive standard medical tests when they are getting the infusions and
      after:

        -  Physical exams

        -  Blood tests to measure blood cells, kidney and liver function

        -  Measurements of tumor by scans and bone marrow studies if the bone marrow had evidence
           of disease 6 weeks after each infusion

      Because the patient has received cells with a new gene in them the patient will be followed
      for a total of 15 years to see if there are any long term side effects of gene transfer. If
      they have a procedure related to their tumor (for example a biopsy or tumor resection), we
      will request permission to obtain a tissue sample. This will help investigators learn more
      about T cell and CTL treatment of neuroblastoma. In the event of death, we will request
      permission to perform an autopsy to learn more about the effects of these infusions on the
      disease.
