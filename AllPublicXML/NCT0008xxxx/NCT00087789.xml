  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase I clinical study to assess the safety, tolerability and biologic activity of
      in vivo AAV-mediated delivery of CERE-110. Up to 12 subjects will receive open label CERE-110
      in dose-escalating fashion. All subjects will receive bilateral, stereotactic injections of
      CERE-110 for a total of four (Dose A and B) and six (Dose C) injections to target the basal
      forebrain region of the brain containing the nucleus basalis of Meynert (NBM). All study
      participants will be observed for a 24-month period and then followed annually.
