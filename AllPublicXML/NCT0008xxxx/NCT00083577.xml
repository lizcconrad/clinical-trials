  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research is to study how helpful thalidomide is in controlling the
      myeloma disease and to study any side effect resulting from thalidomide.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients will receive thalidomide in the oral form (by mouth). Then the dose of thalidomide
      will be increased each week until week 7 as long as there are no significant side effects.
      After week 7, patients will continue to receive thalidomide as long as there is no toxicity
      requiring the treatment to be stopped and as long as there is no evidence of rapid tumor
      growth during the treatment with thalidomide.

      Routine physical examinations and blood tests will be done to monitor the effect of treatment
      and the toxicities encountered, if any, and provide the available treatments for side effects
      accordingly. Blood tests will be done once a month for the first six months of receiving
      thalidomide.

    <criteria>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  All patients must have a confirmed diagnosis of previously treated, active multiple
             myeloma

          -  Myeloma protein should be evident from which to evaluate response

          -  Must be 18 years of age or older. Women of childbearing age and fertile men must use a
             medically acceptable means of birth control while on study and for 6 months
             thereafter.

          -  Patients must sign an informed consent to participate in this study, and be fully
             aware of the known teratogenic potential of this drug

          -  Patients must have a total white blood cell count of 2,000 K/microliters. Patients may
             be anemic or thrombocytopenic provided this is felt to be due to extensive marrow
             involvement with myeloma

          -  Patients must have adequate liver function as demonstrated by a direct bilirubin of &lt;
             or = 2.0 mg/dL.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients must not have an active infection requiring parenteral antibiotics

          -  No other concurrent therapy for myeloma is permitted while on Thalidomide
