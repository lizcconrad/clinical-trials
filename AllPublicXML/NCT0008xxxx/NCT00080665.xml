      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy such as docetaxel work in different ways to stop tumor
      cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Imatinib mesylate may stop the growth of
      tumor cells by blocking the enzymes necessary for their growth. Giving docetaxel with
      imatinib mesylate may kill more tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of docetaxel when
      given together with imatinib mesylate in treating patients with locally advanced or
      metastatic breast cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Determine the safety profile, maximum tolerated dose, and recommended phase II dose of
           docetaxel when administered with imatinib mesylate in patients with locally advanced or
           metastatic breast cancer.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the pharmacokinetic profile of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Determine the potential effects of this regimen on CYP3A4 activity and docetaxel
           metabolism in these patients.

        -  Correlate docetaxel and imatinib mesylate exposure (utilizing total and unbound
           docetaxel and imatinib mesylate plasma concentrations) with drug response (e.g.,
           pharmacodynamic effects, drug toxicity, and response) in these patients.

        -  Determine response rate, duration of response, and time to treatment failure in patients
           treated with this regimen.

        -  Correlate proteomic profile changes in serum with tumor burden and response in patients
           treated with this regimen.

        -  Correlate pharmacokinetic parameters, tissue expression of specific receptor tyrosine
           kinases (e.g., c-Kit, platelet-derived growth factor receptor [PDGFR], and
           phosphorylated PDGFR) in paraffin blocks, and pharmacodynamic assays with antitumor
           activity of this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is an open-label, dose-escalation study of docetaxel.

      Patients receive docetaxel IV over 1 hour on days 1, 8, and 15 and oral imatinib mesylate
      (STI571) on days 8-28 of course 1 and days 1-28 of all subsequent courses. Courses repeat
      every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity*. Patients with
      stable or responding disease after at least 2 courses of therapy may discontinue docetaxel
      and continue therapy with single-agent STI571 until disease progression.

      NOTE: *Patients experiencing excessive docetaxel-related toxicity who have completed at least
      2 full courses may continue on single-agent STI571 in the absence of disease progression or
      excessive STI571-related toxicity.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of docetaxel until the maximum tolerated
      dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2
      of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. An additional cohort of 6-12 patients
      receives treatment at the MTD.

      Patients are followed at 30 days.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately of 18-30 patients will be accrued for this study.
