  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial is studying how well tanespimycin works in treating patients with stage
      III or stage IV melanoma. Antitumor antibiotics such as tanespimycin may stop the growth of
      melanoma by stopping blood flow to the tumor.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine if treatment with 17-AAG results in measurable anti-tumor effects and calculate
      the proportion of clinical responses.

      II. Test the hypothesis that treatment with 17-AAG can disrupt the MAPK pathway by depleting
      intra-tumor stores of RAF kinases and/or downstream proteins such as phospho-ERK, CDK4 and
      cyclin D1.

      III. Determine if either of these effects correlates with the presence of mutated BRAF within
      the melanoma tumor.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to presence of BRAF
      mutation in tumor (yes vs no).

      Patients receive tanespimycin IV over 1-6 hours once weekly for 6 weeks. Courses repeat every
      56 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
