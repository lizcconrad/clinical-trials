      This Phase II study is designed to treat patients who have been diagnosed with Stage IV
      Breast Cancer, which has progressed despite treatment with primary therapies, including
      hormonal therapy, chemotherapy, and antibody therapy. Thirty-three patients will be treated
      with the monoclonal antibody MDX-010. The initial antitumor activity profile of MDX-010 will
      be determined, as well as identification of the induction of any antitumor immunity following
      the MDX-010 treatment.
