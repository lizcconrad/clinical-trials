      RATIONALE: Drugs such as melphalan, thalidomide, and dexamethasone may be effective in
      treating patients with primary systemic amyloidosis.

      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well giving melphalan together with thalidomide
      and dexamethasone works in treating patients with primary systemic amyloidosis.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Determine the 2-year and overall progression-free survival of patients with newly
           diagnosed, previously untreated primary systemic (AL) amyloidosis treated with
           risk-adapted melphalan followed by thalidomide and dexamethasone.

      Secondary

        -  Determine plasma cell disease response in these patients at 3, 12, and 24 months after
           treatment with this regimen.

        -  Determine amyloid-related disease response in these patients at 12 and 24 months after
           treatment with this regimen.

        -  Determine the prognostic significance of immunoglobulin light-chain variable-region
           germline gene expression by AL plasma cell clones in patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine whether there is molecular minimal residual disease at 12 and 24 months in
           patients achieving a complete hematologic response after treatment with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: Patients are stratified according to the extent of amyloid-related disease (low-risk
      vs high-risk).

        -  High-risk disease: Patients receive 2 courses of low-dose melphalan IV, dexamethasone,
           and filgrastim (G-CSF). After 3 months, patients receive thalidomide and dexamethasone
           if plasma cell disease persists.

        -  Low-risk disease: Patients receive 1 course of high-dose melphalan IV and G-CSF.
           Patients then receive thalidomide and dexamethasone as in high-risk disease regimen.

      Patients are followed at 3, 12, and 24 months.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 82 patients will be accrued for this study.
