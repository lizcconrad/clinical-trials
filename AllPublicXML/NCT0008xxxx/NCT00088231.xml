  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical research study is to find the highest safe doses of PTK 787
      (vatalanib) and Gleevec (imatinib mesylate) that can be given to treat Chronic Myelogenous
      Leukemia-Blastic Phase (CML-BP), Refractory Acute Myelogenous Leukemia (AML), or Agnogenic
      Myeloid Metaplasia (AMM). Another goal is to see how effective this combination treatment is.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Rationale: The purpose of this study is to combine PTK-787, a potent orally vascular
      endothelial growth factor (VEGF) receptor inhibitor (in disorders where VEGF is known to be
      involved in the pathophysiology), with Imatinib mesylate (IM), a protein-tyrosine kinase
      inhibitor of abl, Bcr-Abl, platelet derived growth factor (PDGF), and c-Kit (in same
      disorders where these kinases are believed to be important). The potential synergy between
      oral agents that inhibit these kinases in disorders where each of the two agents have some,
      but inadequate, single agent activity is being studied in this protocol. We will also have an
      opportunity to assess if there is any correlation between response and individual kinase
      mutations e.g., c-Kit in patients with AML. If improved outcomes are observed, further
      studies will be indicated to investigate which, if either, agent is predominantly responsible
      for such a benefit - these studies will be facilitated by the availability of more potent
      e.g., (AMN107 as an abl inhibitor), (Bevacizumab, AG013736 as VEGF inhibitors) agents which
      will help to define the relative importance of the various inhibitory activities.

      Objectives: To determine the maximum tolerated doses (MTD) and pharmacokinetics (PK) of PTK
      787 and imatinib mesylate, when given in combination to patients with refractory acute
      myelogenous leukemia (AML), agnogenic myeloid metaplasia (AMM) and chronic myelogenous
      leukemia in blastic phase (CML-BP).

      To determine the efficacy (response rate, survival, time to progression, time to treatment
      failure, duration of response) of the MTD in these study populations.

    <description>For 1 week prior to receipt of study combination regimen, all patients will receive single agent PTK 787 at dose specified for that dose level of the study combination regimen to allow stabilization of PTK 787 levels. Patients should not have a grade 3 or 4 PTK 787-related adverse events in order to begin study combination therapy with a imatinib on day 8. On Day 8, PTK 787 250 mg by mouth every day and imatinib 600 mg by mouth every day (for Acute Myelogenous Leukemia (AML), Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia- blastic phase (CML-BP) and imatinib 400 mg by mouth every day (for Agnogenic Myeloid Metaplasia (AMM). Length of therapy is four courses; each course equals 28 days. Patients assessed for response after each course.</description>

             Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while participating in this
             study, she should inform her treating physician immediately. If the partner of a male
             patient taking PTK 787 and/or Gleevec conceives, the physician should be notified

             required to control elevated blast levels or platelet counts. Within the first 28 days
             of treatment, hydroxyurea may be given at a maximum dose of 5 g daily for up to a
             total of 7 days. For leukopheresis, a maximum of 2 procedures per week or 4 procedures

             limit compliance with study requirements.

          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, not limited to, ongoing uncontrolled
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac
             arrhythmia, uncontrolled high blood pressure, history of labile hypertension, history
             of poor compliance with an antihypertensive regimen, myocardial infarction less than
             or equal to 6 months prior to registration, uncontrolled diabetes, interstitial
             pneumonia or extensive and symptomatic interstitial fibrosis of lung, chronic liver
             disease or psychiatric illness/social situations that limits compliance with study
             requirements.

          -  Pleural effusion or ascites that causes respiratory compromise (greater than or equal
             to Common Toxicity Criteria (CTC) grade 2 dyspnea).

          -  Impairment of gastrointestinal (GI) function or GI disease that may significantly
             alter the absorption of PTK787 (i.e., ulcerative disease, uncontrolled nausea,

             excluded - A separate study for patients with HIV will be performed if indicated.

          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because PTK 787 and imatinib may have a
             potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects. Because there is an unknown but
             potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the
             mother with PTK 787 or imatinib, breastfeeding patients will not be eligible.

          -  Patients with known central nervous system (CNS) disease are excluded.

          -  Patients w/ recent major surgery are excluded (less than 4 wks of starting this study)
             or minor surgery less than or equal to 2 weeks prior to randomization. Insertion of a
             vascular access device is not considered major or minor surgery in this regard.
             Patients must have recovered from all surgery-related toxicities.

          -  Patients who are taking warfarin sodium (Coumadin) or similar oral anticoagulants that
