    <textblock>
      This study will examine the long-term effects, particularly on bone metabolism, of the drug
      tenofovir DF in children with HIV infection. Tenofovir DF is approved for treating
      HIV-infected adults, but its use in children has not yet been approved. The drug may be
      helpful for children who have been treated with many other drugs and still have detectable
      HIV in their blood despite ongoing therapy. In a previous study, many children given
      tenofovir DF responded well, with increases in T-cell counts and decreases in viral load.
      However, many children also experienced bone thinning. This study will explore the problem of
      bone thinning in children taking tenofovir DF in combination with highly active
      antiretroviral therapy (HAART).

      HIV-infected patients from 4 to 20 years old who are taking tenofovir DF or for whom
      tenofovir DF treatment has been recommended may be eligible for this 3-year study.

      Participants take tenofovir DF every day in addition to their antiretroviral therapy. They
      have frequent follow-up visits for tests and procedures as follows:

        -  Study days 0, 2, and 4: blood tests.

        -  Screening and every study visit starting day 6: Physical exam, medical history, blood
           and urine tests.

        -  Baseline and every 48 weeks: Dental and eye examinations, kidney ultrasound, tuberculin
           skin testing, chest x-ray, electrocardiogram and echocardiogram, computed tomography
           (CT) scan, neuropsychological testing and neurologic assessment.

        -  The bone age hand x-rays are done every 24 weeks, unless the growth plates are fused
           (i.e. the child has stopped growing)

        -  DEXAs are done at 0, 12, 24 weeks and every 24 weeks thereafter. Dual energy x-ray
           absorptionometry (DEXA) scan is used to assess bone density. The patient lies still on a
           table while the spine and hip are scanned using a small amount of radiation. Only the
           spine and hip are scanned in the DEXA scan test.

        -  Baseline and week 24: Optional bone biopsy. Some patients are asked to undergo a bone
           biopsy to better understand the effect of Tenofovir DF on bone. For the procedure, the
           child is given a sedative. The skin over the hipbone is numbed with a small needle, a
           small incision is made and a larger needle is inserted into the bone. Some of the bone
           tissue is withdrawn through the needle and the incision is closed.

        -  Possible lumbar puncture (spinal tap): This optional procedure analyzes cerebrospinal
           fluid (CSF), the fluid that bathes the brain and spinal cord. The patient is given a
           local anesthetic and a needle is inserted into the space between the bones in the lower
           back where the CSF circulates below the spinal cord. A small amount of fluid is
           collected through the needle. There is no specific schedule for this procedure if the
           patient opts for it.

      Patients who are benefiting from tenofovir DF therapy but show signs of bone effects are
      offered treatment with pamidronate (Aredia), a drug used to treat hypercalcemia (too much
      calcium in the blood). Patients who stop taking tenofovir DF because of bone toxicity
      continue to be followed on the regular study schedule. Those who stop the drug for toxicity
      other than bone toxicity or for toxicity not related to tenofovir DF are followed every 4
      weeks until their laboratory test results improve.

      Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) was approved for the treatment of HIV-infected adults in
      October 2001. In November 2001, we began enrollment to our phase I/II study of tenofovir DF
      in HIV-infected children (02-C-0006). That study has completed enrollment. The virologic and
      immunologic responses seen on that study in a group of heavily treatment-experienced children
      with multidrug resistant HIV were surprisingly good. The drug was well tolerated, but
      significant decreases in bone mineral density were seen in a minority of patients.

      With the current study we will enroll and systematically investigate HIV-infected children
      for whom tenofovir DF is being used as part of salvage combination HIV therapy. The primary
      objective of the study is to characterize the change in bone mineral density (BMD), as
      measured by lumbar spine dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA), during and following
      treatment with tenofovir DF-containing antiretroviral therapy in HIV-infected children. The
      study will enroll 3 cohorts of children: 1) HIV-infected children about to start a tenofovir
      DF-containing antiretroviral regimen, 2) HIV-infected children already on tenofovir DF with
      available baseline DEXA results, and 3) HIV-infected children already on tenofovir DF but
      without baseline DEXA results who will come here for investigations of bone metabolism.
      Studies of bone metabolism will include periodic measurements of serum and urine calcium and
      phosphorus, PTH and vitamin D levels, bone resorption markers (urinary collagen cross-linked
      N-telopeptide and free deoxypyridinoline), bone formation markers (serum osteocalcin and bone
      specific alkaline phosphatase), IGF-1 levels, bone age, and DEXA scans. Patients about to
      start tenofovir DF (cohort 1) will be offered the option of having a transiliac crest core
      bone biopsy with tetracycline labeling performed at baseline and at 6 months to assess static
      and dynamic parameters of bone quality and turnover (histomorphometry). Subjects with
      substantial presumed tenofovir DF-related bone toxicity who are deriving benefit from their
      tenofovir DF-containing antiretroviral drug regimen will be offered the option of pamidronate
      therapy. The effects of pamidronate treatment on bone toxicity associated with tenofovir DF
      in these patients will be assessed in an exploratory fashion. It is expected that up to 40
      patients with baseline BMD measurements will be enrolled onto this protocol. An additional 10
      patients who are undergoing tenofovir DF treatment but who did not receive baseline BMD
      measurements will also be permitted to enroll in order to contribute to the data used to
      characterize changes in toxicity.
