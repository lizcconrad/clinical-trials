      This study is a Phase I/II study. In Phase I of this study, the objective is to determine the
      maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of combination therapy with Aroplatin and capecitabine in
      subjects with unresectable, local recurrence or distant metastases of colorectal cancer
      refractory to 5-FU/leucovorin and irinotecan. In Phase II, the primary objective is to
      evaluate the response proportion and duration with Aroplatin/capecitabine therapy. Secondary
      objectives are to evaluate frequency and severity of adverse events.

      Phase II Primary Objective:

        -  Evaluate the response proportion and duration with Aroplatin/capecitabine therapy.

      Phase II Secondary Objective:

        -  Evaluate the frequency of adverse events.

          -  Measurable disease (RECIST criteria);

          -  Refractory to 5-FU / leucovorin and irinotecan as described below;

          -  No prior therapy with oxaliplatin, any other platinum or capecitabine;

          -  ECOG score 0-2 (Karnofsky 100-70%);

          -  Life expectancy of greater then or equal to 5 months;

          -  Adequate hematopoietic, liver and renal function;

          -  Women of child-bearing potential have to practice adequate contraception;

          -  Signed written informed consent;

          -  Subjects must be willing to be followed during the course of treatment/observation and
             follow-up.

        Refractory metastatic colorectal cancer

        The following subjects are regarded refractory to treatment:

          -  Those with progression while receiving 5-FU/LV/irinotecan;

          -  Those with progression on irinotecan after prior 5-FU/LV treatment;

          -  Progression within six months of adjuvant 5-FU/LV/irinotecan;

          -  Progression within six months of adjuvant 5-FU/LV followed by progression on
             irinotecan

        Subjects must have received at least one or more commonly used 5-FU/leucovorin and
        irinotecan regimens. Prior adjuvant therapy is allowed including 5-FU/leucovorin or other
        fluoropyrimidines except capecitabine and irinotecan.

        Exclusion criteria:

          -  Previously diagnosed brain metastases if symptomatic and requiring active therapy;

          -  Other cancers within the last five years, with the exception of adequately treated
