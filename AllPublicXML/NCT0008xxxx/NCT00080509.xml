    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether a potential drug known as KOS-862 or
      &quot;Epothilone D&quot; has an effect as a 2nd line treatment in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC)
      for patients having failed one prior platinum-containing chemotherapy regimen.

    <textblock>
      To determine the antitumor activity, based on the confirmed objective response rate, of
      KOS-862, administered intravenously weekly for 3 weeks every 4 weeks, in patients with
      non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) whose disease has progressed following initial
      chemotherapy for advanced or metastatic disease.
