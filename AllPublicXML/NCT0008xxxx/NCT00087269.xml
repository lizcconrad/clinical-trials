  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial is studying how well erlotinib works in treating patients with stage I,
      stage II, or stage IIIA non-small cell lung cancer. Erlotinib may stop the growth of tumor
      cells by blocking the enzymes necessary for their growth. Giving erlotinib before surgery may
      shrink the tumor so that it can be removed.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the biochemical response rate (&gt; 75% decrease in P-MAPK and/or P-AKT) with
      daily oral OSI-774 (erlotinib) for 14 consecutive days in patients with early stage, operable
      NSCLC.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the safety and tolerance of daily oral OSI-774 (erlotinib) as pre-operative
      treatment for early stage operable NSCLC.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To correlate antiproliferative (Ki-67, p27) and apoptotic (TUNEL assay) tumor responses to
      OSI-774 (erlotinib) with pre-therapy tumor and skin EGFR pathway functional status and
      post-therapy tumor and skin EGFR pathway inhibition in patients with resectable NSCLC treated
      preoperatively with OSI-774 (erlotinib) for 14 days.

      II. Assessment of functional EGFR status: HER1, HER-2, HER3, HER4, PHER1, AKT, P-AKT,
      MAPK-P-MAPK, STAT-3, P-STAT-3, EGFR-III by immunohistochemistry (IHC).

      III. Assessment of proliferative response: Ki67 and p27 by IHC. IV. Assessment of apoptotic
      response: TUNEL assay. V. To study the role of the gastrin-releasing factor and estrogen
      receptor pathways in the sensitivity and resistance of NSCLC to OSI-774 (erlotinib).

      VI. To identify patterns of gene and protein expression pre-therapy and post-therapy that are
      associated with tumor clinical, biochemical, antiproliferative, and apoptotic responses.

      VII. To study the antitumor activity of OSI-774 (erlotinib) in NSCLC tumors
      heterotransplanted in nude mice after surgical resection and to investigate the sequential
      molecular changes associated with tumor response to OSI-774 (erlotinib) therapy.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive oral erlotinib once daily on days 1-14 or days 1-21 in the absence of
      unacceptable toxicity. Patients then undergo surgical resection on the last day of study drug
      administration (day 14 or day 21). Patients may receive chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy
      after surgical resection at the discretion of the primary physician.

      Patients are followed for 5 years after study registration.
