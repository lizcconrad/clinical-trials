      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of Thelin™ (sitaxsentan
      sodium) as compared to placebo in the treatment of patients with PAH. A cohort of patients
      will be randomized to usual treatment with Tracleer® (bosentan) for observational comparisons
      of safety and efficacy.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Have a current diagnosis of symptomatic PAH classified by one of the following:

               1. primary pulmonary hypertension (PPH) - also known as idiopathic pulmonary
                  arterial hypertension (IPAH);

               2. PAH associated with connective tissue diseases;

               3. PAH associated with one of the following congenital heart defects:

                    1. repaired ASD, VSD or PDA greater than one year post-operative

                    2. un-repaired secundum ASD (with resting oxygen saturation greater than 88
                       percent in room air measured by oximeter)

          -  World Health Organization (WHO) functional class II, III, IV

          -  Greater than 12 and less than 75 years of age
