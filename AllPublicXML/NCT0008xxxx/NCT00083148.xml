      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as irinotecan and capecitabine, work in different
      ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Irinotecan may help
      capecitabine kill more tumor cells by making tumor cells more sensitive to the drug.

      PURPOSE: This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of irinotecan and
      capecitabine in treating women with advanced breast cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the maximum tolerated dose of capecitabine and irinotecan in women with
           advanced breast cancer.

        -  Determine the degree of accumulation of cells in S-phase in tumor biopsies from patients
           treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine the dose-limiting toxicity and other major or unusual toxic effects of this
           regimen in these patients.

        -  Determine any antitumor activity of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Determine the pharmacokinetics of this regimen, including the active metabolite SN-38,
           in these patients.

        -  Correlate pharmacokinetic parameters of this regimen with the biological changes
           observed in these patients.

        -  Determine, preliminarily, the relationship of tumor response with modulation of S-phase
           in patients treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.

      Patients receive irinotecan IV over 1.5 hours on days 1, 8, 22, and 29 and oral capecitabine
      twice daily on days 1-14 and 23-36. Treatment continues in the absence of disease progression
      or unacceptable toxicity.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of irinotecan and capecitabine until the
      maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at
      which 2 of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 8-37 patients will be accrued for this study within 18-24
      months.
