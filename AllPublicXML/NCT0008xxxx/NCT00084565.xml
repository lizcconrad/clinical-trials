      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as paclitaxel, topotecan, and estramustine, work
      in different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Giving more
      than one chemotherapy drug may kill more tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well giving paclitaxel, topotecan, and
      estramustine together works in treating patients with metastatic hormone therapy-refractory
      prostate cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Determine the objective response rate in patients with metastatic hormone-refractory
           prostate cancer treated with paclitaxel, topotecan, and estramustine.

        -  Determine the progression-free and overall survival of patients treated with this
           regimen.

        -  Determine the toxic effects of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Determine the pharmacokinetics of this regimen in these patients.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the frequency and number of circulating tumor cells in patients before and
           after treatment with this regimen and at disease progression.

        -  Determine the microtubule morphology, β-tubulin isotype pattern, apoptotic markers, and
           metaphase chromosome alignment in circulating tumor cells in patients before and after
           treatment with this regimen and at disease progression.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive paclitaxel IV over 1 hour on days 1, 8, and 15; topotecan IV over
      30 minutes on days 2, 9, and 16; and oral estramustine twice daily on days 1 and 2 of course
      1 and on days 0-2, 7-9, and 14-16 of all subsequent courses. Courses repeat every 28 days in
      the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 18-38 patients will be accrued for this study.

                  lung metastases)

               -  Radiologic evidence of hydronephrosis alone dose not constitute metastatic
                  disease

             hormone-releasing hormone blocker and flutamide) or bilateral orchiectomy

               -  Patients previously treated with flutamide or bicalutamide must have evidence of
                  disease progression i.e., increasing Prostate-Specific Antigen (PSA)
