    <textblock>
      This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of irinotecan and 3-AP in
      treating patients with metastatic or unresectable solid tumors. Drugs used in chemotherapy
      such as irinotecan work in different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop
      growing or die. 3-AP may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking the enzymes necessary for
      their growth and may help irinotecan kill more tumor cells by making them more sensitive to
      the drug.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To find the maximal tolerated dose for the combination of irinotecan and Triapine® in
      patients with refractory solid tumors.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To find the severity and frequency of toxicity associated with this combination and to
      observe for and record any antitumor activity.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the effect of Triapine®/irinotecan on the ribonucleotide reductase tyrosyl
      radical in vivo by Electron Paramagnetic Spectroscopy (EPR) in buccal mucosal cells,
      peripheral blood lymphocytes and in tumor biopsies. Formation of low molecular weight
      iron-Triapine® chelates will also be assessed by EPR.

      II. To evaluate the effect of Triapine® /irinotecan on cell cycle in vivo by measuring
      S-phase arrest in buccal mucosal cells.

      III. To evaluate the effect of Triapine® /irinotecan on MDR gene expression and polymorphisms
      in blood.

      IV. To evaluate the effect of Triapine® /irinotecan on ribonucleotide reductase R2 mRNA and
      Immunohistochemistry.

      V. To evaluate the pharmacokinetic profile of the combination.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.

      Patients receive irinotecan IV over 1 hour on day 1 and 3-AP (Triapine®) IV over 2 hours on
      days 1-3. Courses repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of irinotecan and 3-AP (Triapine®) until the
      maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at
      which 2 of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. Once the MTD is
      determined, 6 additional patients are treated at that dose.

      Patients are followed until disease progression.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients must have histologically confirmed malignancy that is metastatic or
             unresectable and for which standard curative or palliative chemotherapy measures do
             not exist or are no longer effective

          -  Patients must not have previously received irinotecan

          -  Patients must not have received radiation to &gt; 25% of bone marrow

          -  Life expectancy of greater than 12 weeks

          -  Leukocytes &gt;= 3,000/μl

          -  Absolute neutrophil count &gt;= 1,500/μl

          -  Platelets &gt;= 100,000/μl

          -  Total bilirubin within normal institutional limits

          -  AST(SGOT)/ALT(SGPT) =&lt; 2.5 X institutional upper limit of normal

          -  Creatinine =&lt; 1.5 mg/dl OR creatinine clearance &gt;= 50 mL/min/1.73 m^2 for patients
             with creatinine levels above institutional normal

          -  Patients must have measurable or evaluable disease

          -  Patients must have baseline screening for G6PD (glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase)
             deficiency; G6PD must be no lower than the lower limit of normal prior to starting
             study treatment; patients who are above the upper limit of normal may enroll in the
             trial

          -  The effects of Triapine® on the developing human fetus are unknown; for this reason
             and because heterocyclic carboxaldehyde thiosemicarbazones as well as other
             therapeutic agents used in this trial are known to be teratogenic, women of
             child-bearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or
             barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry and for the duration
             of study participation; should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant
             while participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician
             immediately

          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document

          -  Patients must have a baseline screening test for UGT1A1; the UGT1A1 cannot be the 7/7
             genotype; patients who have any other combinations (6/6, 6/7, 5/7, etc.) may enroll in
             the trial

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients who have had chemotherapy or radiotherapy within 4 weeks (6 weeks for
             nitrosoureas or mitomycin C) prior to entering the study

          -  Patients who have not recovered from adverse events due to agents administered more
             than 4 weeks earlier; patients with grade 1 adverse events from prior therapies are
             eligible at the investigator's discretion

          -  Patients may not be receiving any other investigational agents

          -  History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic
             composition to Triapine® or other agents used in study

          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac
             arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with
             study requirements

          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because Triapine® is a heterocyclic
             carboxaldehyde thiosemicarbazone with the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient
             effects; because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing
             infants secondary to treatment of the mother with Triapine®, breastfeeding should be
             discontinued if the mother is treated with Triapine®; these potential risks may also
             apply to other agents used in this study

          -  Patients with immune deficiency are at increased risk of lethal infections when
             treated with marrow-suppressive therapy; therefore, HIV-positive patients receiving
             combination anti-retroviral therapy are excluded from the study because of possible
             pharmacokinetic interactions with Triapine® or other agents administered during the
             study; appropriate studies will be undertaken in patients receiving combination
             anti-retroviral therapy when indicated

          -  Patients with known G6PD deficiency are excluded

          -  Patients with a history of myocardial infarction or severe pulmonary disease requiring
             oxygen are excluded

          -  Because of the potential for enzyme-inducing anticonvulsant agents (EIACAs) to alter
             the metabolism and pharmacokinetics of irinotecan, patients who are taking EIACAs are
             excluded

          -  Metastatic brain or meningeal tumors unless the subject is &gt; 6 months from definitive
             therapy, had a negative imaging study within 4 weeks of study entry and is clinically
             stable with respect to the tumor at the time of study entry; also the patient must not
             be undergoing acute steroid therapy or taper

          -  Patients with UGT1A1 7/7 genotype are excluded
