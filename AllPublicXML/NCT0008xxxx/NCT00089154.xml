  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial is studying how well apolizumab works in treating patients with chronic
      lymphocytic leukemia or small lymphocytic lymphoma. Monoclonal antibodies such as apolizumab
      can locate cancer cells and either kill them or deliver cancer-killing substances to them
      without harming normal cells.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the response rate and progression-free survival rate in patients with relapsed
      or refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) or noncontiguous stage II or stage III or IV
      small lymphocytic lymphoma treated with apolizumab.

      II. Determine the safety of this drug, in terms of the frequency and severity of
      treatment-related adverse events, in these patients.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine clinical response to apolizumab varies by genetic subtype of CLL. II. Determine
      if pharmacokinetic clearance is truly predicted by 1D10 antigen density on the individual
      patient CLL cell and how apolizumab clearance correlates with response and selected
      toxicities observed.

      III. To determine the importance of reactive oxygen species and specific signaling pathways
      in promoting apolizumab-mediated apoptosis in vitro and in vivo in primary CLL cells and if
      this correlates with clinical response to therapy.

      IV. To determine the cellular properties which convey resistance to apolizumab in CLL in
      vivo.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive apolizumab IV over 2-4 hours on days 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 10, 12, 15, 17, 19, 22,
      24, and 26 in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are followed at 1 week, at 1 and 2 months, every 3 months for 1 year, and then every
      6 months for 3 years.
