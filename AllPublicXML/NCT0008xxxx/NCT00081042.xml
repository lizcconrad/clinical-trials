      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as ABI-007, work in different ways to stop tumor
      cells from dividing so they stop growing or die.

      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well ABI-007 works in treating patients with
      inoperable (unresectable) locally recurrent or metastatic melanoma.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Determine the antitumor activity of ABI-007 in patients with inoperable locally
           recurrent or metastatic melanoma.

        -  Determine the safety and tolerability of this drug in these patients.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the time to disease progression, in terms of the rate and duration of response
           or stable disease, in patients treated with this drug.

        -  Determine the survival of patients treated with this drug.

        -  Determine the effects of this drug on biomarkers of melanoma in these patients.

        -  Correlate biomarker levels with response in patients treated with this drug.

      OUTLINE: This is an open-label, multicenter study. Patients are assigned to 1 of 2 treatment
      cohorts according to prior cytotoxic chemotherapy (previously treated vs chemotherapy-naïve).

        -  Cohort I (previously treated): Patients receive ABI-007 IV over 30 minutes on days 1, 8,
           and 15.

        -  Cohort II (chemotherapy-naïve): Patients receive a higher dose of ABI-007 as in cohort
           I.

      In both cohorts, courses repeat every 4 weeks in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are followed monthly for 6 months and then every 3 months thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 24-70 patients (12-35 per cohort) will be accrued for this
      study.
