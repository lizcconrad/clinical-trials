  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Approximately 18-45 patients with Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC) will be treated with DENSPM
      at approximately 5 centers in the United States. First, we will be trying to determine the
      highest dose that can be given safely and is well tolerated (this is called the maximally
      tolerated dose, or the MTD, for short). Once that is established, we will enroll additional
      patients to learn more about potential side effects and to see whether DENSPM can slow the
      growth of HCC tumors. We also want to learn about the safety of DENSPM. Many medications used
      to treat cancer cause side effects (discomforts or illness). In this study, we want to
      understand what side effects occur in patients with HCC who are treated with DENSPM.Study was
      terminated after initial assessment of insufficient data to support clinical benefit in this
      population.

  <why_stopped>
    This study was terminated early by Genzyme because there were insufficient data to support
    clinical benefit to HCC patients on the study.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Histologically proven HCC, or if the patient is not a medically appropriate candidate
             for biopsy, then all of the following criteria must be met: A.History of cirrhosis or
             chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) or hepatitis C virus (HCV)infection. B.A focal liver
             lesion ≥ 3 cm on CT or MRI with arterial hypervascularization. C.Confirmation of the
             liver lesion by a second imaging modality (US/ CT/ MRI).D.AFP ≥1000 ng/ml, or ≥ 4000
             ng/ml if Hepatitis B surface Ag positive.

          -  For recurrent HCC, radiographic evidence of progression.

          -  Not appropriate for curative therapy (surgical resection) or refuses potentially
             curative therapy

          -  Measurable disease, defined as having at least one measurable intrahepatic tumor
             lesion (using Response Criteria in Solid Tumors [RECIST]). Prior therapy is acceptable
             only if there is documented progression of the selected measurable lesion(s) following
             completion of the therapy.
