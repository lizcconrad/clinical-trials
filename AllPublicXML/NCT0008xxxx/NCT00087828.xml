      The purpose of this study is to identify the substances in cranberry juice that make it
      effective in reducing urinary tract infections (UTIs) in women.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are a significant health issue, with one fourth of all women
      experiencing symptoms during their lifetimes. Cranberry juice has been shown to reduce the
      incidence of UTIs by preventing bacteria from adhering to the bladder. However, the compounds
      that direct this activity have not been identified. This study will identify and examine
      UTI-reducing compounds in cranberry juice.

      Participants in this study will drink a specified amount of water following an overnight
      fast. Their urine will be collected 1 to 3 hours after the water is consumed. Several days
      later, the women will be provided with cranberry juice to replace the water in the regimen.
      Urine samples will be analyzed for compounds that have antibacterial or antiadhesion activity
      against the bacteria that cause UTIs.
