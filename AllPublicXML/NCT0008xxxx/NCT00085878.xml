  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase I, open-label, dose-escalation study of SB-485232. Subjects will receive
      SB-485232 administered as subcutaneous injections daily for 14 days. Dose escalation
      (enrollment into the next cohort) cannot occur until all three subjects have completed the
      previous cohort; 5 doses will be tested. An additional dosing regimen has been added to
      evaluate higher doses given twice weekly for 7 weeks. Therefore, the full evaluation period
      for each patient will extend out to approximately eleven weeks after the first day of
      SB-485232 dosing.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Histologically or cytologically confirmed diagnosis of malignancy.

          -  Subjects with solid tumors must have locally advanced or metastatic disease at the
             time of enrollment.

          -  Measurable or evaluable disease that is refractory or resistant to standard therapy or
             for which there is no effective standard therapy.

          -  Predicted life expectancy of at least 12 weeks.

          -  Kinesin spindle protein (KPS) of greater than 70%.

          -  No chemotherapy, immunotherapy, hormonal therapy, or biological therapy for cancer,
             radiotherapy, or surgical procedures (except for minor surgical procedures) within 4
             weeks before beginning treatment with SB-485232 (6 weeks for nitrosoureas and
             mitomycin C).

          -  Subjects must have recovered from toxicities (incurred as a result of previous
             therapy) sufficiently to be entered into a Phase I study.

          -  Provide written informed consent.

          -  Absence of anti-SB-485232 antibodies.

          -  Hemoglobin greater than or equal to 9 g/dL.

          -  Absolute neutrophil count greater than or equal to 1.5 X 109 /L.

          -  Platelet count greater than or equal to 100 X 109 /L.

          -  Partial thromboplastin time (PTT) and prothrombin time/international normalized ratio
             (PT/INR) within normal limits.

          -  Serum creatinine less than or equal to 1.5 mg/dL (135 Âµmol/L) or estimated creatinine
             clearance greater than 50 mL/min (calculated by the Cockcroft-Gault Formula).

          -  Total serum bilirubin less than or equal to 1.5 mg/dL.

          -  Aspartate transaminase (AST) and alanine transaminase (ALT) less than or equal to 3 X
             ULN.

          -  Sexually active males or females of reproductive capacity must use adequate
             contraception.

          -  For subjects with a history of coronary artery disease, stress test must be within
             normal limits.

          -  Subjects with a history of congestive heart failure, myocardial infarction or prior
             anthracycline chemotherapy must have a Multiple Gated Acquisition (MUGA) scan with a
             left ventricular ejection fraction of greater than 40%.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Women who are pregnant or are breast-feeding.

          -  Severe or uncontrolled infections requiring systemic antibiotic therapy.

          -  Any serious medical or psychiatric disorder that would interfere with subject safety
             or informed consent.

          -  Known leptomeningeal disease or evidence of prior or current metastatic brain disease.

          -  Receiving concurrent chemotherapy, immunotherapy, radiotherapy, or investigational
             therapy.

          -  Receiving concurrent systemic steroids.

          -  History of ventricular arrhythmias requiring drug or device therapy.

          -  Any severe concurrent disease or condition, including significant autoimmune diseases,
             which in the judgment of the principal investigator, would make the subject
             inappropriate for study participation.

          -  Any unresolved or unstable serious toxicity from prior administration of another
             investigational drug.

          -  Any investigational drug within 30 days or 5 half-lives (whichever is longer)
             preceding the first dose of SB-485232.

          -  Psychological, familial, sociological, or geographical conditions that do not permit
             compliance with the study.

          -  Received prior treatment with SB-485232.

          -  Poor venous access.
