  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Candida is the most common fungal pathogen identified in hospitalized patients. This study
      will seek to enroll adult patients (18 years of age or older) with invasive Candida
      infections (involving deep tissues and organs). The study will not enroll patients whose only
      site of Candida infection was the bloodstream. Patients that fulfill all study entry criteria
      will receive a single daily dose of caspofungin. Caspofungin, an intravenous echinocandin
      antifungal agent, is already approved for the treatment of invasive candidiasis. The dosage
      strength and duration of caspofungin will be individualized for each patient based on
      disease, severity of disease and extent of infection.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  All patients must have at least 1 positive culture for Candida species obtained from
             an otherwise sterile, non-blood body site within 96 hours of the study entry.

          -  The patient must also have clinical evidence of Candida infection (e.g., oral
             temperature &gt;100 degrees Fahrenheit, signs of inflammation from infected site,
             systolic blood pressure &lt;90) within 96 hours of study entry.

          -  The patient must be at least 18 years old, and if a woman of child bearing potential,
             must have a negative serum or urine pregnancy test sensitive to 25 IU HCG prior to
             enrollment.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients whose only site of Candida infection was the bloodstream.
