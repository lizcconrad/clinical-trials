      RATIONALE: Measuring levels of CA 125 in blood samples of women who have a high risk of
      developing ovarian cancer may help doctors detect cancer early and plan more effective
      treatment.

      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying CA-125 levels in screening for cancer in women who
      are at high risk of developing ovarian cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Determine the feasibility of prospective screening for ovarian cancer in high-risk
           patients.

        -  Determine normal ranges and distributions of CA 125 within and between these patients
           (with subclassification by menopausal status, estrogen replacement therapy usage, and
           prophylactic oophorectomy).

      Secondary

        -  Determine estimates of the specificity and positive predictive value of a risk of cancer
           algorithm suitable for designing a definitive trial of screening for ovarian cancer in
           these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter, pilot study.

      Patients undergo blood collection and CA 125 levels are measured at baseline and then every 3
      months for 1-2 years. Patients may be referred for an ovarian ultrasound if indicated by the
      CA 125 results.

      Patients are followed at 6 months and then annually thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 2,400 patients will be accrued for this study within 1 year.

        DISEASE CHARACTERISTICS:

          -  At high risk for developing ovarian cancer, as determined by meeting criteria for 1 of
             the following:

               -  Family history of at least 2 ovarian or breast* cancers among the patient and
                  first- and second-degree relatives within the same lineage**

                    -  If breast cancer* is required to meet this criterion, at least 1 breast
                       cancer* must be premenopausal (diagnosed at age 50 or under if menopausal
                       status unknown) NOTE: **Multiple primary cancers in the same person
                       satisfies this criterion

               -  Ashkenazi Jewish ethnicity and meets criteria for 1 of the following:

                    -  Prior breast cancer* diagnosis

                    -  One first-degree or 2 second-degree relatives with breast* or ovarian cancer

                         -  If breast cancer is required to meet this criterion, at least 1 breast
                            cancer* must be premenopausal (diagnosed at age 50 or under if
                            menopausal status unknown)

               -  Probability of BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation greater than 20%, as determined by BRCAPRO
                  95% posterior probability interval
