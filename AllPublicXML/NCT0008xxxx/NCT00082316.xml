  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a randomized, open-label multi-center evaluation of the tolerability of
      treatment with NGX-4010 in conjunction with pre-patch topical application of one of three 4%
      lidocaine-based local anesthetic products. Eligible subjects will have moderate to severe
      neuropathic pain secondary to painful diabetic neuropathy (PDN), postherpetic neuralgia (PHN)
      or HIV-associated neuropathy (HIV-AN), with average numeric pain rating scale (NPRS) scores
      during screening of 3 to 8 (inclusive).
