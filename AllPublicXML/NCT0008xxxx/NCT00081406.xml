      Children and their parents will complete a comprehensive diagnostic assessment to determine
      eligibility. The assessment will include an individual diagnostic interview with the child,
      interviews with the parents, and written observations of the child from family members and
      teachers. Participants will then be randomly assigned to receive individual cognitive
      behavioral therapy (ICBT), family CBT (FCBT), or education/support/attention (ESA) for 5
      months. Children in the ICBT group will meet individually with a therapist. In the FCBT and
      ESA treatment groups, children and their parents will meet weekly with a therapist.

      At the end of treatment and 1 year following treatment completion, families will complete
      another assessment to determine the effectiveness of each treatment at reducing short- and
      long-term anxiety symptoms in their children.
