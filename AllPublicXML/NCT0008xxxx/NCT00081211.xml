      Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of intratumoral (in the tumor) PV701 in treating
      patients who have advanced or recurrent unresectable squamous cell carcinoma (cancer) of the
      head and neck. Vaccines made from a specially-modified virus such as PV701 may make the body
      build an immune response to kill tumor cells while leaving normal cells undamaged. Injecting
      PV701 directly into the tumor may cause a stronger immune response and kill more tumor cells

      OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of PV701 administered by direct intratumoral
      injection in patients with advanced or recurrent unresectable squamous cell carcinoma of the
      head and neck.

      II. Determine the toxicity of intratumoral PV701 in these patients. III. Determine response
      rate and time to progression at the injection site in patients treated with this drug.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study. Patients receive intratumoral PV701 once weekly for
      3 weeks. Courses repeat every 6 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity. Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of PV701 until the maximum
      tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2
      of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. Once the MTD is determined, at
      least 6 evaluable patients are treated at that dose.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A maximum of 30 patients will be accrued for this study within 6-10
      months.
