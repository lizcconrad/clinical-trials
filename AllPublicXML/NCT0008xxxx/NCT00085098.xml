      RATIONALE: Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to damage tumor cells. Drugs used in
      chemotherapy work in different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or
      die. It is not yet known whether radiation therapy alone is as effective as chemotherapy plus
      radiation therapy in treating germ cell tumor.

      PURPOSE: This randomized phase III trial is studying radiation therapy alone to see how well
      it works compared to chemotherapy and radiation therapy in treating patients with newly
      diagnosed primary CNS germ cell tumor.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Compare event-free survival and overall survival of patients with newly diagnosed
           primary CNS germ cell tumor treated with conventional radiotherapy alone (regimen A) vs
           chemotherapy followed by tumor response-based radiotherapy (regimen B).

      Secondary

        -  Determine the complete response rate in patients treated with regimen B.

        -  Determine the acute and subacute toxicity of regimen B in these patients.

        -  Compare treatment-related morbidity, in terms of verbal learning and memory, executive
           functioning, and quality of life, in patients treated with these regimens.

        -  Determine the prognostic value of baseline serum, lumbar, and intraventricular levels of
           human chorionic gonadotropin levels from patients treated with these regimens.

        -  Determine the prognostic value of extent of disease (M+ vs modified M+ vs M0) on
           event-free survival and overall survival of patients treated with these regimens.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to tumor
      location (pineal vs suprasellar vs pineal + suprasellar or other), and disease stage
      (disseminated vs occult multi-focal vs localized). Patients are randomized to 1 of 2
      treatment regimens.

      All patients undergo an operative procedure (endoscopic biopsy, stereotactic biopsy, or open
      craniotomy) to confirm the diagnosis of pure germ cell germinoma followed by an
      intraoperative and perioperative staging evaluation.

        -  Regimen A (radiotherapy only): Within 52 days of surgery, patients undergo standard-dose
           radiotherapy once daily on days 1-5 for approximately 5-6 weeks.

        -  Regimen B (chemotherapy plus radiotherapy):

             -  Courses 1 and 2: Patients receive carboplatin IV over 1 hour on days 1 and 2 and
                etoposide IV over 2 hours on days 1-3. Treatment repeats every 21 days for 2
                courses.

      Patients achieving a complete response (CR) proceed to reduced-dose radiotherapy. Patients
      with minimal residual disease (MRD), a partial response (PR), or stable disease (SD) receive
      chemotherapy courses 3 and 4 as outlined below. Patients with progressive disease undergo a
      second surgical procedure for biopsy and are restaged. Patients with a confirmed diagnosis of
      germ cell tumor with no change in tumor markers and no new lesions after restaging proceed to
      chemotherapy courses 3 and 4.

        -  Courses 3 and 4: Patients receive cisplatin IV over 6 hours on day 1, cyclophosphamide
           IV over 1 hour on days 2 and 3, and filgrastim (G-CSF) subcutaneously or IV beginning on
           day 4 and continuing until blood counts recover. Treatment repeats every 21 days for 2
           courses.

      Patients achieving a CR or MRD proceed to reduced-dose radiotherapy. Patients with a PR, SD,
      or progressive disease are restaged. Patients with a confirmed diagnosis of germ cell tumor
      after restaging undergo standard radiotherapy as in regimen A.

        -  Reduced-dose radiotherapy: Within 6 weeks of starting course 4, patients undergo
           lower-dose radiotherapy once daily on days 1-5 for 5 weeks.

      Treatment in both regimens continues in the absence of unacceptable toxicity or in the event
      that a non-germinomatous germ cell tumor is detected.

      Quality of life and neuropsychological function within the domains of intelligence,
      attention-concentration, memory, and executive functioning are assessed at 9, 30, and 60
      months after diagnosis.

      Patients are followed every 4 months for 2 years, and then annually thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 225 patients (approximately 112 per treatment regimen) will be
      accrued for this study within 5 years.

    <description>Data will be summarized as number of patients in the following categories at the time of data cutoff for analyses of 3-year EFS: 1)Experienced a qualifying event (QE) (see below);2)Event-free through 3 years of follow-up;3)Event-free until data cutoff (if less than 3 years of follow-up);4)Withdrew from study;5)Lost to follow-up.
QEs: 1)disease progression, defined as increase &gt;= 40% in tumor volume or &gt;= 25% in tumor area of target lesions;2)development of new lesions;3)occurrence of a second malignant neoplasm, defined as a malignancy with different histological type from trial-qualifying diagnosis;4)death from any cause.
Stat. analyses will be based on time from enrollment to the earliest of: 1)occurrence of any of the QEs;2)withdrawal from study or lost to follow-up;3)completion of three years of follow-up event-free;4)data cutoff for completion of the statistical analyses for the protocol's primary objective.

    <time_frame>From the beginning of treatment, assessed up to 5 years</time_frame>
    <description>The analysis of toxicity will focus on estimating the rates of key acute and subacute toxicity occurring during the first induction chemotherapy. Estimates will be obtained using life-table methods with an event defined as the first occurrence of a key acute or sub-acute toxicity. Patients who have progression or recurrence of disease will be censored in these analyses. The precision of the estimates of toxicity rate can be approximated by an analysis of binomial proportions.</description>

    <description>The primary endpoints for QOL and NP assessments will be the global scale value from each of these instruments at the two-year time point. Analyses of subscales (if they exist) and of assessments at other times will be of secondary interest. It is assumed that scale values are standardized to a reference normal population. Comparisons of each treatment group with the standard population mean, using a two-sided test with Type I error 0.025 (an adjustment for multiple comparison) will be able to detect differences from the standard mean that are 20% smaller.</description>

Courses 3 and 4: Patients receive cisplatin IV over 6 hours on day 1, cyclophosphamide IV over 1 hour on days 2 and 3, and filgrastim (G-CSF) SC or IV beginning on day 4 and continuing until blood counts recover.
Treatment repeats every 21 days for 2 courses. Patients achieving a CR or MRD proceed to reduced-dose radiotherapy. Patients with a PR, SD, or PD are restaged and may undergo standard radiation therapy as in regimen A.
Reduced-dose radiation therapy: Within 6 weeks of starting course 4, patients undergo lower-dose radiation therapy once daily on days 1-5 for 5 weeks</description>

        <description>The analysis of toxicity will focus on estimating the rates of key acute and subacute toxicity occurring during the first induction chemotherapy. Estimates will be obtained using life-table methods with an event defined as the first occurrence of a key acute or sub-acute toxicity. Patients who have progression or recurrence of disease will be censored in these analyses. The precision of the estimates of toxicity rate can be approximated by an analysis of binomial proportions.</description>

        <description>The primary endpoints for QOL and NP assessments will be the global scale value from each of these instruments at the two-year time point. Analyses of subscales (if they exist) and of assessments at other times will be of secondary interest. It is assumed that scale values are standardized to a reference normal population. Comparisons of each treatment group with the standard population mean, using a two-sided test with Type I error 0.025 (an adjustment for multiple comparison) will be able to detect differences from the standard mean that are 20% smaller.</description>
