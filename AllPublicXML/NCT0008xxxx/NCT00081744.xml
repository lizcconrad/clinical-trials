        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Male or female subjects, ≥ 8 years of age and a weight of ≥ 35 kilograms

          -  Subjects with selected culture-positive infections caused by a multiple
             antibiotic-resistant pathogen presumed to be susceptible to tigecycline

          -  Subjects who have failed or are intolerant of other available appropriate antibiotic
             therapies or whose pathogens are resistant to other available antibiotics

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects who are moribund with an expected survival of less than 2 weeks.

          -  Subjects who have been designated as &quot;Do Not Resuscitate&quot;, unless it is anticipated
             within a reasonable degree of medical certainty that they can achieve benefit from
             potentially curative antibiotic therapy

          -  Known or suspected hypersensitivity to tigecycline, tetracyclines, or other compounds
             related to this class of antibacterial agents
