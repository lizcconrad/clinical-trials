      BACKGROUND:

      Insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) is the main mediator of effects of growth hormone (GH)
      and an important regulator of cell cycle/differentiation and inhibitor of apoptosis.
      Consistent with laboratory studies showing potentially beneficial effects of IGF-I on the
      cardiovascular and cerebrovascular systems, GH-deficient individuals have high cardiovascular
      disease (CVD) mortality and evidence of premature atherosclerotic disease that is reversible
      with GH replacement. In addition, several epidemiological and clinical studies have shown an
      association between low serum IGF-I levels and myocardial infarction (MI) and congestive
      heart failure (CHF) among persons without frank abnormalities of the GH/IGF-I axis.

      DESIGN NARRATIVE:

      The study is the first prospective investigation to assess whether serum levels of IGF-I and
      two of its important binding proteins, IGFBP-3, and IGFBP-1, are associated with incidence of
      confirmed incident cardiovascular disease (CVD) events in older male and female adults.
      Specimens and data for this study will be obtained from the Cardiovascular Health Study
      (CHS), a large, multi-center NHLBI-funded prospective cohort study of 5,888
      community-dwelling men and women 65 years or older. The study uses an efficient case-cohort
      study design to select specimens for testing, involving evaluation of 750 incident myocardial
      infarction (MI)/fatal coronary heart disease (CHD) cases, 500 incident stroke cases, 750
      incident congestive heart failure (CHF) cases, and a comparison sub-cohort of 750 individuals
      selected at random from the study population. The study examines the association between
      baseline serum IGF-I, IGFBP-1, and IGFBP-3 level and the future occurrence of first incident
      MI/fatal CHD, ischemic stroke, and CHF. Multivariate regression models are used to control
      for potential confounding factors including age, sex, race/ethnicity, anthropometry and body
      composition, fasting and 2-hour post-load glucose and insulin levels, dietary intake,
      physical activity, hormone replacement therapy and other medications, and other CVD risk
      markers such as lipids, inflammatory factors, and coagulation/fibrinolysis markers.
