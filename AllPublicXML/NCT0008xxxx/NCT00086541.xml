  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This Phase 3 clinical study is designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of
      two dose levels of Infergen (interferon alfacon-1, CIFN) plus Ribavirin administered daily
      for 48 weeks and no treatment in patients chronically infected with hepatitis C who are
      nonresponders to previous pegylated interferon alfa plus ribavirin therapy.

      Patients are randomized 1:1:1 to receive Interferon Alfacon-1 (9 or 15 µg) + Ribavirin (both
      administered daily) or no treatment for up to 48 weeks.

      The protocol and informed consent form that will be used must be approved by the
      Investigator’s Institutional Review Board (IRB)/Independent Ethics Committee (IEC) before the
      study is initiated.
