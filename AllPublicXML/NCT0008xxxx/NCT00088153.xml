      This study is to determine the effects of anorexia nervosa on bone mass and hormone levels in
      adolescents. Whether administration of estrogen, a normal hormone present during puberty, can
      help maintain bone development in girls with anorexia nervosa will be determined.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Adolescence is a critical time for bone mineral accretion as between 60-90% of peak bone mass
      is established during this period, and peak bone mass is a major determinant of bone density
      and osteoporosis risk during adulthood. Anorexia nervosa (AN) is the third most common
      chronic illness among adolescent girls, with a prevalence of 0.2-1.0%. Therefore, AN occurs
      at a time during which patients are the most vulnerable to disruption of bone mineral
      accretion. Osteopenia is a major co-morbid complication of AN in 50-75% of female adolescents
      and adult women with this eating disorder. Women with the onset of the disorder during
      adolescence have more severe osteopenia than women with onset during adulthood. Little is
      known about the pathogenesis of osteopenia in this adolescent population and there are no
      established therapies. Improved understanding of bone mineral metabolism and factors which
      predict recovery of bone mineral accretion are critical in the development of therapeutic
      strategies to preserve and maximize bone mass in girls with the onset of AN during
      adolescence. Estrogen is known to be a critical factor in the development of peak bone mass.
      Although AN is associated with profound estrogen deficiency, there are no controlled studies
      investigating the effects of estrogen administration in this population.

      This research proposal will address critical unanswered questions regarding bone
      abnormalities in adolescents with anorexia nervosa. Defining changes in bone formation with
      weight recuperation and hormonal variables would provide insight into the factors essential
      for bone mineral accretion during adolescence, as well as those that predict recovery.
      Determination of dose-dependent estrogen effects in this population will be key in targeting
      interventions during the time of active disease, with the long-term goal of preserving peak
      bone mass accretion in this vulnerable group of patients. Data obtained from women with
      post-menopausal osteoporosis or from women with AN cannot be extrapolated to adolescent
      patients who are in an active period of bone growth and mineralization as well as remodeling.
      Given the increasing prevalence of AN and its profound consequences on bone health, these
      studies will provide much needed data to enable treatment strategies for this severe
      co-morbid disease.

    <measure>Percent Change in Spine Bone Density Over the Study Duration (18 Months)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 18 months</time_frame>
    <description>Bone density at the spine (lumbar 1-4 vertebrae) was measured using dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) at baseline, 6 months, 12 months and 18 months.
The primary outcome was the percent change in bone density at the spine from baseline to 18 months. Areal bone density is measured as g/cm2. The unit of measure for the percent change in bone density is 'percent' Percent change in bone density= [[Bone density at 18 months- Bone density at baseline)*100/Bone density at baseline]%</description>

    <description>Bone density at the spine (lumbar 1-4 vertebrae) was measured using dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) at baseline, 6 months, 12 months and 18 months.
The other primary outcome was the change in spine bone density Z-score from baseline to 18 months. The bone density Z-score is a standard deviation score that compares one's bone density to the mean for age and gender, and the Z-score, therefore, does not have any units. It is simply referred to as a Z-score. Change in bone density Z-score= [Bone density Z-score at 18 months- Bone density Z-score at baseline]</description>

    <description>P1NP is a surrogate marker of bone formation that is measured in serum. P1NP levels were measured at baseline, 6, 12 and 18 months.
A secondary outcome was the change in P1NP levels from baseline to 18 months: [P1NP at 18 months - P1NP at baseline). The unit is ng/ml</description>

      <recruitment_details>Period of recruitment: 2003-2009. Location: Massachusetts General Hospital (Boston) and Hospital for Sick Children (Toronto).
We screened 150 girls with anorexia nervosa (AN) (110 at MGH and 40 at SickKids) and 88 normal-weight controls 12-18 years. Following the screen, 110 AN and 40 controls were enrolled for the prospective study.</recruitment_details>

        <title>Percent Change in Spine Bone Density Over the Study Duration (18 Months)</title>
        <description>Bone density at the spine (lumbar 1-4 vertebrae) was measured using dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) at baseline, 6 months, 12 months and 18 months.
The primary outcome was the percent change in bone density at the spine from baseline to 18 months. Areal bone density is measured as g/cm2. The unit of measure for the percent change in bone density is 'percent' Percent change in bone density= [[Bone density at 18 months- Bone density at baseline)*100/Bone density at baseline]%</description>

        <population>The number of participants was determined using power calculations based on preliminary data. For our primary longitudinal analysis, bone mineral density (BMD) changes were analyzed using a mixed model analysis of variance (intent-to-treat model). For secondary analysis, we examined BMD changes after controlling for age and weight changes.</population>

The pooled SD in that study was 0.046. Based on these data, with a sample size of 110 girls with anorexia nervosa (AN), half of whom are randomized to receive estrogen and half placebo (with a 10% drop-out rate), there will be an 80% chance that we will detect an increase in bone density to 75% of normal in the girls who receive estrogen.</groups_desc>
