      This is a 48-week study to compare TNX-355 plus OBT to placebo plus OBT in HIV subjects. You
      must have a stable viral load of at least 10,000 copies/ml, been treated with highly active
      antiretroviral therapy (HAART) for at least 6 months, be triple class experienced, and
      presently failing or have failed a HAART regimen. Subjects will receive infusions every week
      for 8 weeks, then every two weeks.

    <textblock>
      This 48-week, multicenter, randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled, multi-dose,
      three-arm safety and efficacy study of approximately 80 subjects will compare TNX-355 plus
      OBT to placebo plus OBT in adult subjects infected with HIV-1. Subjects must: 1) have a
      stable viral load of 10,000 copies/mL, determined within 8 weeks prior to randomization (Day
      1); 2) have been treated with HAART for at least 6 months (cumulatively); 3) be triple class
      experienced, with historical evidence of exposure to each of the three traditional classes of
      antiretroviral therapy (ART): nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs),
      non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs), and protease inhibitors (PIs); and
      4) be presently failing or have failed a HAART regimen within 8 weeks prior to screening
      (Screening visit 1).

      Subjects will be assigned to OBT based upon their past medication history and the results of
      the virus sensitivity testing (PSGT, ViroLogic, Inc.), and then randomized to a study arm to
      begin receiving OBT plus study medication at the Day 1 visit. Fusion/entry inhibitors will
      not be permitted as part of the optimized background therapy. All subjects will be randomized
      equally (1:1:1 ratio), in a double-blinded fashion, among three arms to receive OBT plus one
      of the following: Arm A, alternating intravenous infusions of TNX-355, 15 mg/kg and placebo
      weekly for the first 9 doses (through the Week 8 visit), and then intravenous infusions of
      TNX-355, 15 mg/kg every two weeks; Arm B, TNX-355, 10 mg/kg intravenous infusions weekly for
      the first 9 doses (through the Week 8 visit), and then intravenous infusions of TNX-355, 10
      mg/kg every two weeks; or Arm C, weekly intravenous infusions of placebo for the first 9
      doses (through the Week 8 visit), and then intravenous infusions of placebo every two weeks.

      Subjects will continue to receive blinded therapy until that therapy fails. Subjects that do
      not achieve a viral load reduction of at least 0.5 log10 from their baseline value on two
      consecutive protocol-defined assessments after Week 12 will be considered virologic failures.
      Subjects that experience virologic failure after Week 16 (i.e., earliest point at which
      virologic failure can be confirmed after Week 12) will have the option of being assigned to
      new OBT plus open-label TNX-355 given as a 15 mg/kg infusion every two weeks. Subjects that
      experience a second virologic failure will be discontinued from the study. The total duration
      of study treatment will be 48 weeks, with the primary endpoint at Week 24.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

        Subjects must have all of the following to be included in the study:

          -  Triple-class experience, with no minimum exposure to any class (historical exposure to
             NRTI, NNRTI, PI)

          -  Cumulative HAART experience for a minimum of 6 months

          -  Virus susceptibility to one or more antiretroviral drugs in their selected OBT as
             determined by the PhenoSenseGT or similar assay and medication history

          -  Stable plasma HIV-1 RNA levels quantitated by reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain
             reaction (RT-PCR) of 10,000 copies/mL within 8 weeks prior to randomization (Day 1),
             while receiving a stable HAART regimen for a minimum of 4 weeks prior to screening.
             Stable viral load is defined as a difference of 0.5-log10 in HIV-1 RNA copies/mL from
             two measurements obtained at least 48 hours apart during the screening period

          -  Subjects must be failing their current HAART regimen or have discontinued a failing
             HAART regimen within 8 weeks prior to screening (screening visit 1)

          -  CD4+ cell count 50 cells/mL

          -  If sexually active, willingness to use an effective, medically accepted (including
             barrier) method of contraception during the study. To prevent superinfection, any male
             subject and the male sexual partner of any study subject should use a condom. All
             study subjects and all of their sexual partners should practice additional safe sex
             techniques to prevent spread of HIV.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Subjects with any of the following characteristics will be excluded from the study:

          -  Any significant diseases (other than HIV infection) or clinically significant
             findings, including psychiatric and behavioral problems, medical history and/or
             physical examination, determined from screening, that, in the investigator’s opinion,
             would preclude the subject from participating in this study

          -  Acute illness within one week prior to administration of study drug (including
             diarrhea and/or vomiting and fever and/or other signs and symptoms of infection such
             as leukocytosis, etc.)

          -  Any active infection secondary to HIV, requiring acute therapy. However, subjects that
             require maintenance therapy (i.e. secondary prophylaxis for opportunistic infections)
             will be eligible for the study

          -  Any immunomodulating therapy or systemic chemotherapy within 12 weeks prior to
             randomization (Day 1)

          -  Any investigational drug use within 30 days prior to randomization (Day 1). This does
             not include investigational drugs for the treatment of HIV-1 (NRTI, NNRTI or PI) under
             expanded access. OBT may include drugs not currently approved, but prescribed under
             expanded access (limited to NRTI’s, NNRTI’s and PI’s).

          -  Any prior participation in an HIV vaccine study

          -  Opportunistic infections (OIs) in the previous 12 weeks prior to randomization (Day 1)

          -  Any prior exposure to TNX-355 (Hu5A8)

          -  Vaccination within 21 days (3 weeks) prior to randomization (Day 1)

          -  Any previous exposure to any virus/fusion entry inhibitor/s

          -  Any previous exposure to a monoclonal antibody (prior treatment with hepatitis B
             immune globulin [HBIG] or intravenous immune globulin [IVIG] is acceptable)

          -  Life expectancy of less than 12 months

          -  Female subjects who are either pregnant or breastfeeding

          -  Any illicit intravenous drugs within 6 months prior to randomization (Day 1)

          -  Any current alcohol or illicit drug use that, in the investigator’s opinion, will
             interfere with the subject’s ability to comply with the dosing schedule and protocol
             evaluations

          -  Clinically significant laboratory findings obtained during screening including:

               -  Serum creatinine or BUN (&gt;1.5 X Upper Limit of Normal [ULN])

               -  Alkaline phosphatase, aspartase aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase
                  (ALT) (any &gt; 2.5 [ULN])

               -  Total bilirubin (&gt;1.5 ULN)

               -  Pancreatic amylase and/or lipase (&gt;1.5 ULN)
