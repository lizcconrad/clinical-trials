  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research is to study how helpful the combination of thalidomide and
      Pamidronate is in controlling multiple myeloma and to study any side effects that may be
      experienced.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Recently, laboratory research found that thalidomide can inhibit the formation of new blood
      vessels that are necessary for the growth and spread of cancer. In order to grow and increase
      in size, tumors require new blood vessels to supply them with the necessary blood to grow. If
      we can prevent these new blood vessels feeding the tumor from being formed by using
      thalidomide we might slow or stop the growth of the tumor. This concept is called
      &quot;anti-angiogenesis&quot;. It is hoped that thalidomide will slow or stop the growth myeloma.
      However, it cannot be guaranteed that you will benefit if you take part in this study. The
      treatment you receive may even be harmful.
