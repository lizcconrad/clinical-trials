      RATIONALE: New imaging procedures such as CT-on-rails™ may improve the ability to pinpoint
      the location of the tumor and decrease radiation therapy damage to healthy tissue.

      PURPOSE: This phase I/II trial is studying how well computed tomography (CT) scans using
      CT-on-rails™ work in pinpointing the location of the tumor in patients with prostate cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Validate the software for CT-on-rails™ by comparing prostate target localization via
           daily ultrasound vs computed tomography (CT) in patients undergoing radiotherapy for
           prostate cancer.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the potential benefit of using fiducials in the prostate of patients
           undergoing daily CT scans and/or ultrasounds for localization.

        -  Determine the intra- and inter-radiation treatment setup and target position
           uncertainties, in terms of isocenter coordinates in space, using both the ultrasound and
           CT scans compared to the coordinates of the isocenter determined at simulation, in these
           patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a pilot study.

        -  Phase I: Patients undergo computed tomography (CT) using CT-on-rails™ twice weekly.
           Patients undergo BAT™ ultrasound daily for prostate localization. Patients undergo
           concurrent daily radiotherapy off study after imaging. After radiotherapy treatment is
           complete, patients continue to undergo scanning using CT-on-rails™ twice weekly.

        -  Phase II: Patients undergo local anesthesia and surgical insertion of gold fiducial
           markers into the prostate. After 1 week, patients undergo a daily CT scan using
           CT-on-rails™ and bi-weekly BAT™ ultrasound. Patients undergo daily radiotherapy off
           study after imaging. After radiotherapy treatment is complete, patients continue to
           undergo scanning using CT-on-rails™ twice weekly.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 40 patients (20 per study phase) will be accrued for this
      study.
