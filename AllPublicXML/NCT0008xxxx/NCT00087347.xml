      RATIONALE: Diagnostic procedures such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) using ferumoxytol
      may improve the ability to detect cancer that has spread to the lymph nodes and may help plan
      effective cancer treatment.

      PURPOSE: This clinical trial is studying how well MRI using ferumoxytol works in detecting
      metastases to the lymph nodes in patients with primary prostate cancer or primary breast
      cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Determine the range of optimal timing for magnetic resonance imaging of lymph nodes
           after administration of ferumoxytol, in terms of assessing signal intensity using
           pre-defined pulse sequences in regions of interest and visual criteria, in patients with
           primary prostate or breast cancer who are scheduled to undergo surgical lymph node
           dissection or sampling.

      Secondary

        -  Correlate MRI signal intensity with histological findings in patients undergoing this
           procedure.

      OUTLINE: This is an open-label, pilot study.

      Patients undergo a baseline MRI. Within 24 hours after the baseline MRI, patients receive
      ferumoxytol IV over 10-15 seconds (or over 1 hour). Patients then undergo MRI immediately
      after ferumoxytol administration (at the discretion of the principal investigator) and then
      at 24-28 hours.

      Patients are followed at 2 weeks.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 10-14 patients (6-8 with prostate cancer and 4-6 with breast
      cancer) will be accrued for this study.
