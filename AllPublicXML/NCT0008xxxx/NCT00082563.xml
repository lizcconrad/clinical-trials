  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if Azithromycin in combination with chloroquine is
      superior to chloroquine alone in eradicating P. falciparum asexual parasitemia in
      asymptomatic, semi-immune adults in Western Kenya.

      The trial was terminated prematurely 9 November 2004 due to the inability to recruit the
      planned number of subjects. There were no safety or efficacy concerns regarding the study in
      the decision to terminate the trial.
