      This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of decitabine and valproic acid
      in treating patients with non-small cell lung cancer. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as
      decitabine and valproic acid, work in different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so
      they stop growing or die. Combining more than one drug may kill more tumor cells.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the safety and tolerability of decitabine and valproic acid in patients with
      non-small cell lung cancer.

      II. Determine the recommended phase II dose of this regimen in these patients.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the ability of this regimen to lead to biological changes in tumor and surrogate
      tissues in these patients, including hypomethylation of target genes known to be methylated
      in NSCLC (CDKN2, APC, BMP3B, CDH1 and RASSF1A) in biopsy specimens and surrogate tissues
      (peripheral blood mononuclear cells [PBMC] and plasma/serum DNA); acetylation and methylation
      changes in histones from tumor and surrogate tissues (PBMC and oral epithelial cells);
      inhibition of histone deacetylase (HDAC) activity in peripheral blood; pharmacokinetic
      analysis of Decitabine and Valproic Acid; DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1) protein loss in
      PBMC and buccal cells; response of hemoglobin F in patients with non-hematologic conditions
      to DNMT and HDAC inhibition; and preliminary evidence of antitumor activity in non-small cell
      lung cancer.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.

      Patients receive decitabine IV over 1 hour on days 1-10 and oral valproic acid three times
      daily on days 5-21. Treatment repeats every 28 days for 6 courses in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of decitabine and valproic acid until the
      maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at
      which 2 of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. After the MTD is
      determined, an additional 6 patients are treated at that dose.
