      The purpose of this study is to assess tiagabine for the treatment of cocaine dependence.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      To assess the efficacy and safety of tiagabine in reducing cocaine use in subjects with
      cocaine dependence. It is hypothesized that tiagabine treatment, compared to placebo, will be
      associated with fewer days of cocaine use as assessed by self-report confirmed with urine
      assays for benzoylecgonine (BE). This is a double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group
      design study, in which, after screening and a 2-week baseline assessment period, subjects
      will be equally randomly assigned to 1 of 2 treatment groups, tiagabine or matched placebo.
