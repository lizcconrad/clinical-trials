    <textblock>
      The primary objective is to confirm the hypothesis that azithromycin plus chloroquine is
      non-inferior to atovaquone-proguanil for the treatment of symptomatic, uncomplicated malaria
      due to P. falciparum.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Written informed consent of the subject or a legally authorized representative

          -  Females and males &gt;= 18 years of age with uncomplicated, symptomatic malaria as
             indicated by the presence of both of the following: a.) Blood smears positive for
             Plasmodium falciparum asexual parasitemia between 1000 - 40,000 parasites/mL; b.)
             Fever or history of fever (&gt;= 38.5 C/101.2 F rectal or tympanic; &gt;= 37.5 C/99.5 F
             axillary or &gt;= 38 C/100.4 F oral) within the prior 24 hours

          -  Serum glucose &gt;= 60 mg/dL (by fingerstick or peripheral blood collection)

          -  Positive rapid diagnostic test (Binax NOW ICT) positive for P. falciparum

          -  Subjects must be willing to be treated in the inpatient setting for a minimum of three
             days or more until parasitemia has cleared and the Investigator deems the subject fit
             for discharge

          -  Women of childbearing potential (that is, women who have not been surgically
             sterilized or are not clearly post-menopausal), must have a negative urine
             gonadotropin prior to entry into the study and must agree to use adequate
             contraception during the entire study and for one month after the last study visit

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Severe or complicated malaria including subjects with any of the following: a.)
             Impaired consciousness (e.g. obtundation, unarousable coma, delirium, stupor),
             seizures (any seizure within a 24 hour prior to enrollment) or abnormal neurologic
             exam suggestive of severe or complicated malaria b.) Hemoglobinuria c.) Jaundice d.)
             Respiratory distress (respiratory rate â‰¥ 30 breaths/minute) e.) Persistent vomiting
             f.) Hematuria, as reported by the patient

          -  Pregnant or breast-feeding women

          -  History of allergy to or hypersensitivity to azithromycin or any macrolide,
             atovaquone, proguanil or chloroquine

          -  Concomitant administration of rifampin or rifabutin and metoclopramide

          -  History of epilepsy or psoriasis

          -  History of treatment with any antimalarial drug (chloroquine, quinine, mefloquine,
             atovaquone/proguanil, sulfadoxine/pyrimethamine, artemisinin compounds) or
             antibacterial with known antimalarial activity (macrolides, doxycycline, clindamycin)
             within 2 weeks prior to enrollment into the study

          -  Known or suspected cardiovascular, hepatic or renal abnormality that in the opinion of
             the Investigator would place the subject at increased risk to participate in the
             study. The following findings are specific exclusions: a.) Known or suspected
             creatinine clearance &lt;30 mL/min b.) ALT and/or AST &gt; 3 x upper limit of normal

             evaluation of the study drug

          -  Specific systemic diseases or other medical conditions that would interfere with the
             evaluation of the therapeutic response or safety of the study drug

          -  Inability to comprehend and/or unwillingness follow to the study protocol
