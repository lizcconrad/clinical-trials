      This study will evaluate the safety and effectiveness of combination therapy with
      peginterferon alpha-2a and ribavirin for treating hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection in
      HIV-infected patients. Peginterferon alpha with ribavirin is the therapy of choice for people
      with HCV alone. Peginterferon alpha-2a is a compound that results from attaching a
      polyethylene glycol molecule to interferon alpha-2a. This compound stays in the blood longer
      than unmodified interferon alpha-2a, causing a higher blood concentration and thus
      maintaining greater activity against the hepatitis C virus.

      HIV-infected patients 18 years of age and older with chronic hepatitis C infection and a
      viral load greater than 2000 copies/mL may be eligible for this 2-1/2 year study. Candidates
      are screened with a medical history and physical examination, blood and urine tests, eye
      examination, chest x-ray, electrocardiogram (EKG), liver ultrasound, and pregnancy test in
      women who are able to become pregnant. If a recent liver biopsy is not available, this test
      is done to determine the type and severity of liver disease. The patient is given a sedative
      before the procedure. Then, the skin in the area over the biopsy site is numbed with a local
      anesthetic and a needle is inserted rapidly into and out of the liver to obtain a small
      tissue sample. The patient remains in the hospital overnight for monitoring.

      Participants begin treatment with injections under the skin of peginterferon alpha-2a and
      ribavirin pills by mouth on study day 0. Peginterferon is given either once or twice a week
      for 4 weeks and then once a week for 44 weeks. Ribavirin is given daily. In addition,
      patients continue to take all other medications prescribed by their doctor. Clinic visits are
      scheduled for the following procedures:

        -  Days 1, 3, 4, 7, 10 and weeks 2, 3, and 4 - Blood tests for safety measures and to
           measure blood levels of HIV and HCV.

        -  Weeks 6, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 28, 32, 36, 40, 44 - Blood and urine tests to determine the
           side effects of treatment and its effect on the HCV infection. In addition, eye
           examinations are done every 3 months, and pregnancy and thyroid function tests are done
           several times during the treatment period.

        -  Week 48 or end of treatment - Treatment stops after 48 weeks. At this time, or earlier
           for those who do not complete the 48 weeks, patients return to the clinic for a chest
           x-ray, EKG, blood tests, and abdominal ultrasound. Patients are hospitalized for a
           repeat liver biopsy.

        -  Weeks 52, 56, 64 and 72 - Blood and urine tests to determine the side effects of
           treatment and its effect on the HCV infection, and a urine pregnancy test in women.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hepatitis C infection occurs in one-third of all HIV-infected individuals. Liver disease has
      become more significant among patients coinfected with HIV and HCV. Several studies have
      shown that coinfected individuals develop earlier and more severe liver disease. Pegylated
      interferon alpha with ribavirin has become the therapy of choice among people with HCV alone.
      This is a randomized controlled study to address the safety and efficacy of a 4 week
      induction therapy consisting of twice-weekly pegylated interferon alpha-2a and daily
      ribavirin on HIV-1 and hepatitis C coinfected individuals. Twenty-two patients who are
      infected with both HIV and HCV and who also have evidence of chronic hepatitis will be
      randomized to receive peginterferon alpha-2a either twice weekly or once weekly for four
      weeks. They will then continue with standard weekly peginterferon for 44 more weeks. The
      patients will receive standard daily dose of ribavirin during the entire 48 weeks. These
      patients will be monitored for peginterferon level, HCV viral load, HIV viral load and CD4
      counts and undergo a baseline liver biopsy and another at the end of 72 weeks. The results of
      the study will enable us to better delineate the efficacy of twice weekly peginterferon
      induction therapy in suppressing the hepatitis C virus in the first 4 weeks of the therapy.
      Since viral suppression for hepatitis C in the early phase of the combination treatment has
      predictive values for long term eradication of the virus, a therapy that improves early viral
      suppression may improve the long term cure rate. This will be especially important given the
      current low cure rate of HCV among HIV coinfected individuals.
