      This study will evaluate the safety and side effects of two experimental vaccines in patients
      with kidney cancer and determine whether the vaccines &quot;turn on&quot; an immune response to the
      cancer. Each vaccine contains one of two peptides (pieces of proteins) from the fibroblast
      growth factor 5 (FGF-5) antigen, a protein produced by some cancer cells, and an oil-based
      liquid called Incomplete Freud's Adjuvant (Montanide ISA-51) that enhances the immune
      response to the vaccine.

      Patients 16 years of age and older who have kidney cancer that has spread beyond the kidney
      or whose primary kidney tumor has been removed within 6 months before entering the study and
      are at high risk for disease recurrence may be eligible for this study. Patients must have
      tissue type human leukocyte antigen serotype within HLA-A A serotype group (HLA-A2) or human
      leukocyte antigen serotype within HLA-A A serotype group (HLA-A3) (determined by a blood test
      for human leukocyte antigen (HLA) typing) and their tumors must produce the FGF-5 peptide.
      Candidates are screened with a physical examination, blood and urine tests, electrocardiogram
      (EKG), tumor biopsy (removal of a small sample of tumor for examination) in patients whose
      tumor is easily accessible, and scans (computed tomography (CT), bone scans) and x-rays if
      current scans are not available.

      Participants are divided into two groups according to their HLA type (HLA-A2 or HLA-A3) to
      receive the vaccine appropriate for their HLA type. They are then further divided into three
      groups: 1) Group 1 includes patients who do not need or are ineligible for treatment with
      interleukin-2 (IL-2), a protein made by certain infection-fighting white cells that helps
      fight tumors) and patients who have previously had IL-2 therapy; 2) Group 2 includes patients
      who require immediate treatment with IL-2; and 3) Group 3 includes patients whose cancer has
      been surgically removed but who are at risk for recurrence.

      Patients in Groups 1 and 3 receive two peptide injections four times a week every 3 weeks for
      up to a year, or until their tumor grows (or returns in patients in Group 3) or the side
      effects are too severe to continue. Tumors are evaluated with a physical examination and
      scans or x-rays every 12 weeks and blood tests are done every 3 weeks. Patients in Group 2
      receive two peptide injections every day for 4 days, along with doses of IL-2 starting the
      day after the first peptide injection. The vaccines are given as injections under the skin of
      the thigh. IL-2 is infused through a vein over 15 minutes every 8 hours for up to 12 doses,
      depending on tolerance. The vaccine and IL-2 are repeated every 10 to 14 days, with tumor
      evaluations every 2 months. Patients stay in the hospital about 1 week during each treatment
      cycle to receive the IL-2.

      All patients undergo leukapheresis, a procedure for collecting large numbers of white blood
      cells. Blood is collected through a needle in an arm vein and flows through a cell separator
      machine, where the white cells are extracted. The rest of the blood is returned to the
      patient through the same needle or a needle in the other arm. The white cells are examined to
      evaluate how the vaccines change the action of immune cells. Some patients may undergo an
      additional biopsy of normal skin and tumor or lymph node to look at the effects of the
      vaccine on the immune cells in the tumor.

      Patients in Group 1 whose cancer grows and patients in Group C whose cancer returns may be
      offered IL-2 treatments as given to Group 2 patients, along with the peptide vaccine. If the
      disease responds to IL-2, the treatment may be repeated after 2 months.

      Background:

      Several preliminary clinical results in the treatment of cancer lend credence to the
      hypothesis that augmented T-cell responses will improve IL-2 therapy. A peptide vaccine
      derived from the melanoma/melanosomal antigen, GP100, when given with high-dose IL-2 resulted
      in a response rate over 30% in a small Phase II study. These results have led to efforts to
      identify similar T-cells and tumor-associated antigens for IL-2 responsive tumors such as
      renal cell cancer. Work in our laboratory generated a renal cancer-reactive T-cell clone,
      raised from tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) within a renal cell cancer (RCC) metastasis
      undergoing spontaneous regression. This clone was HLA-A3 restricted and recognized autologous
      tumor as well as a number of allogeneic RCC lines also expressing HLA-A3. Expression cloning
      of the antigen recognized by this clone demonstrated that the RCC-associated antigen being
      recognized was unmutated fibroblast growth factor 5 (FGF-5). We concluded from numerous
      studies that FGF-5 was a tumor associated antigen over-expressed by a majority of RCC and
      that it had several favorable characteristics as a target for immunotherapy. At this point,
      having demonstrated in the laboratory that tumor-reactive T-cells generated from patients
      with renal cancer can recognize naturally presented FGF-5 in either the context of HLA-A2 or
      HLA-A3 via the minimal determinants 117-126:FGF-5 (MLSVLEIFAV) or FGF-5:172-176/217-220
      (NTYASPRFK), respectively. With this study we plan to determine if vaccination with these
      peptides can enhance the number of FGF-5-reactive cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) precursors in
      patients with renal cancer or affect the anticipated response rate from high-dose IL-2.

      Objectives:

      The primary objective for patients with renal cell carcinoma will be to determine overall
      response rates and toxicity of peptide vaccination with HLA-A2 and HLA-A3- binding peptides
      from FGF-5 in HLA-appropriate patients, and to explore the effect of such vaccination on the
      response rate to high-dose IL-2. The primary objective for patients who are receiving
      vaccination in the adjuvant setting will be to evaluate the immunologic responses and
      toxicity of FGF-5 peptide vaccination who are likely to receive repeat vaccination prior to
      requiring IL-2. The secondary objective is to evaluate the immunologic responses to FGF-5
      peptide vaccination.

      Eligibility:

      Patients who are HLA-A2+ or HLA-A3+, must be age greater than or equal to 16, and have an
      expected survival greater than three months. For cohort A and B, patients must have
      measurable metastatic renal cancer and FGF-5 tumor expression. For cohort C, patients are
      required to have had a Stage III primary tumor (i.e. T3/T4 or N1/N2) excised within the last
      6 months.) Patients in cohorts A and B must have tumor sites safely accessible for biopsy or
      indications for resection of a site of tumor (e.g. an indicated nephrectomy or symptomatic
      metastasis) and be willing to undergo biopsy, and have FGF-5 expression determined by reverse
      transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and will only be eligible if it is
      detectable. Patients must meet specific safety laboratory criteria. May not have undergone
      other systemic therapies for their cancer in the past 3 weeks (6 weeks for nitrosureas), not
      have any major medical illnesses, or require systemic steroid therapy.

      Design:

      Patients will first be divided into cohorts with measurable metastatic disease (Cohorts A and
      B) or high-risk loco-regional disease (Cohort C). Patients with measurable metastatic disease
      will then be separated into those who require immediate IL-2 therapy (Cohort B) or those who
      do not (cohort A).

      Cohort A will begin receiving vaccination with HLA-appropriate peptide emulsified in
      Montanide ISA-51 or MontanideÂ® (Registered Trademark) ISA 51 VG daily for four days every 3
      weeks and will continue this for up to a year, or until tumor progression is documented. At
      that point, those ineligible for high-dose IL-2 or who have had previous IL-2 as an inpatient
      (considered high dose at doses greater than or equal to 600,000 IU/kg) will be taken off of
      study, and those still eligible for IL-2 who have not yet received it, will have high-dose
      intravenous bolus IL-2 (720,000 IU/kg/dose every 8 hours up to 12 doses) added to their
      peptide vaccination regimen. Two cycles, separated by 10-14 days, will be given during every
      two-month period (constitutes a course.). Patients in Cohort A crossing over to vaccination
      plus IL-2 therapy, will receive peptide in MONTANIDE ISA-51 or MontanideÂ® (Registered
      Trademark) ISA 51 VG vaccination the day prior to starting an IL-2 cycle (instead of every 3
      weeks, to accommodate the IL-2 regimen) and repeated daily for three additional days (for a
      total of four days) during IL-2 administration.

      Patients in Cohort B will begin with high-dose bolus IL-2 therapy in two cycles within every
      two month period, with each cycle preceded by a peptide in MONTANIDE ISA-51 or MontanideÂ®
      (Registered Trademark) ISA 51 VG vaccine the day prior to starting each IL-2 cycle with
      peptide in MONTANIDE ISA-51 or MontanideÂ® (Registered Trademark) ISA 51 VG repeated daily for
      three additional days (for a total of four days) during IL-2 administration.

      Patients in Cohort C will undergo the same HLA-appropriate vaccination with peptide and
      MONTANIDE ISA-51 or MontanideÂ® (Registered Trademark) ISA 51 VG daily for four days every 3
      weeks and continue for up to 6 months or until disease relapse is documented. At the time of
      relapse, eligible patients in Cohort C will receive treatment with high-dose bolus IL-2 and
      continuing peptide vaccination using the same schedule as specified for the Cohort A
      crossover arm above.

      For patients in cohort A on peptide vaccine alone, evaluation will be performed every 3
      months during the first 6 months of therapy and if stable, every 3-6 months thereafter. For
      cohorts A and B during peptide vaccine plus high-dose IL-2 therapy, evaluation will be
      performed every 2 months while on IL-2, and every 3-6 months for stable patients off therapy.
      For cohort C, evaluations will be performed every 3 months for the first year and every 6-12
      months thereafter.

      The maximal accrual possible would be 210 patients (Cohort A with 80 patients, Cohort B with
      66 patients and Cohort C with 64 patients), and maximal enrollment could take up to 5 years.

    <description>Overall response is defined as the best response (e.g. complete response...) recorded from the start of treatment until disease progression/recurrence. Complete response is the disappearance of all target lesions. Partial response is at least a 30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter (LD) of target lesions. Progressive disease is at least a 20% increase in the sum of LD of target lesions since the treatment started or the appearance of new lesion. Stable disease is neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for partial response nor sufficient increase to qualify for progressive disease.</description>

    <description>FGF-5 specific CTL (cytotoxic T lymphocytes) may be tested by cytokine release assay or ELISPOT (enzyme linked immunosorbent spot) assay using tumor, FGF-5 transfected or peptide-loaded target cells and compared to pre-treatment peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) to determine immune response to vaccination. In the assays, differences of 2-3 fold are indicative of true biologic difference.Due to text data entry field limitations, Pre vaccination and post vaccination will be shown in the results as Pre V and Post V, respectively. Patients entered in Group A did not complete sufficient vaccinations to permit immunological evaluation and in Group B, the co-administration of IL-2 is known to corrupt immunological evaluation (so only clinical responses are valid). Expanding information on cancer vaccines in general as wells as preliminary information from this trial on FGF-5 as a vaccine target both served to render the enrollment of additional patients to this trial obsolete.</description>

A3 FGF-5 (Fibroblast growth factor 5): 172-176/217-220 peptide - two 1 ml injections in the anterior thigh deep subcutaneous tissue within 2c of each other.
This is not a conventional crossoverâIf a patient in Group C has a recurrence after vaccination or cancer progresses in Group A, then we wanted to administer an approved, conventional therapy for recurrent disease (IL-2) which could have had synergy with the prior experimental vaccination. This was only exploratory and there was no specific endpoint targeted in patientâs crossing over and there was no impact on study size (too involved for the scope of this study).</description>

        <description>Overall response is defined as the best response (e.g. complete response...) recorded from the start of treatment until disease progression/recurrence. Complete response is the disappearance of all target lesions. Partial response is at least a 30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter (LD) of target lesions. Progressive disease is at least a 20% increase in the sum of LD of target lesions since the treatment started or the appearance of new lesion. Stable disease is neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for partial response nor sufficient increase to qualify for progressive disease.</description>

        <title>Immunologic Response to Peptide Vaccination Pre and Post Vaccination</title>
        <description>FGF-5 specific CTL (cytotoxic T lymphocytes) may be tested by cytokine release assay or ELISPOT (enzyme linked immunosorbent spot) assay using tumor, FGF-5 transfected or peptide-loaded target cells and compared to pre-treatment peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) to determine immune response to vaccination. In the assays, differences of 2-3 fold are indicative of true biologic difference.Due to text data entry field limitations, Pre vaccination and post vaccination will be shown in the results as Pre V and Post V, respectively. Patients entered in Group A did not complete sufficient vaccinations to permit immunological evaluation and in Group B, the co-administration of IL-2 is known to corrupt immunological evaluation (so only clinical responses are valid). Expanding information on cancer vaccines in general as wells as preliminary information from this trial on FGF-5 as a vaccine target both served to render the enrollment of additional patients to this trial obsolete.</description>
