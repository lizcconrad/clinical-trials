      RATIONALE: PEG-interferon alfa-2b may interfere with the growth of cancer cells.

      PURPOSE: This randomized phase I/II trial is studying the side effects and best dose of
      PEG-interferon alfa-2b and to see how well it works in treating patients with ovarian
      epithelial, peritoneal, or fallopian tube cancer that is resistant to platinum-based
      chemotherapy.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the optimum biologic dose of PEG-interferon alfa-2b in patients with
           platinum-resistant ovarian epithelial, peritoneal, or fallopian tube cancer.

        -  Determine the safety and tolerability of this drug in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized study. Patients are randomized to 1 of 3 different treatment
      arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive PEG-interferon alfa-2b (PEG IFN-α) subcutaneously (SC) on days
           1, 8, 15, and 22.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive PEG IFN-α SC (at a higher dose than in arm I) on days 1, 8, 15,
           and 22.

        -  Arm III: Patients receive PEG IFN-α SC (at a higher dose than in arm II) on days 1, 8,
           15, and 22.

      In all arms, treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 12 courses in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are followed for at least 28 days after study treatment.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A maximum of 75 patients will be accrued for this study within 19 months.
