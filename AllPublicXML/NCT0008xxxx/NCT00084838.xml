    <textblock>
      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy work in different ways to stop tumor cells from
      dividing so they stop growing or die. Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to damage
      tumor cells. Giving more than one chemotherapy drug with radiation therapy may kill more
      tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well giving intrathecal and systemic combination
      chemotherapy together with radiation therapy works in treating young patients with newly
      diagnosed central nervous system (CNS) atypical teratoid/rhabdoid tumors.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Determine the efficacy of intensive systemic and intrathecal chemotherapy and
           radiotherapy, in terms of medial survival, in children with newly diagnosed central
           nervous system atypical teratoid/rhabdoid tumors in comparison with historical outcomes
           from prior trials.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the toxicity profile and tolerability of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Determine the chemosensitivity of these patients' tumors by Magnetic Resonance Imaging
           (MRI) after an attempt at maximum surgical resection after 2 courses of this regimen.

        -  Determine the predictive value of the INI-1 gene mutation in determining prognosis by
           comparing tumor samples from patients with vs without this mutation treated with this
           regimen.

      STATISTICAL DESIGN: This was a single arm design evaluating median overall survival. The
      chosen historical control estimate of 7 months was based on 2 large multi-institutional
      studies in a similar setting and the alternative of 20.5 months based on a DFCI pilot study.
      There was 90% power to detect this improvement assuming 1-sided 0.10 alpha and 17 eligible
      patients. Sample size (n=20 patients) was inflated for expected 10-15% ineligible rate.

      TREATMENT: Induction chemotherapy was required to be initiated within 50 days of the most
      definitive surgery.

        -  Central Nervous System (CNS)/intrathecal therapy: All patients with M0 disease receive
           triple intrathecal (IT) chemotherapy comprising methotrexate (MTX), cytarabine, and
           hydrocortisone on day 1 of weeks 1, 2, 4, 7, 13, 19, 27, 33, 39, 45, and 51 followed by
           oral or intravenous (IV) leucovorin calcium given 24 hours after each MTX dose. Patients
           with initially positive cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) cytology (M+) receive triple IT
           chemotherapy weekly until 2 consecutive CSF samples are negative for malignant cells.

        -  Pre-irradiation induction therapy (weeks 1-6): Patients receive vincristine IV on day 1
           of weeks 1-6; cisplatin IV over 8 hours on day 1 and doxorubicin IV continuously over 48
           hours beginning on day 2 of weeks 1 and 4; cyclophosphamide IV continuously over 72
           hours beginning on day 2 of week 1; etoposide IV over 1 hour on days 1-3 of week 4; and
           filgrastim (G-CSF) subcutaneously (SC) beginning on day 6 of week 1 and day 4 of week 4
           and continuing until blood counts recover.

        -  Induction chemoradiotherapy (weeks 7-12): Patients receive vincristine IV on day 1 of
           weeks 7-12; cisplatin IV over 8 hours on day 1, cyclophosphamide IV over 1 hour on day
           2, etoposide IV over 1 hour on days 1-3 of weeks 7 and 10; and granulocyte-colony
           stimulating factor (G-CSF) subcutaneous (SC) daily beginning on day 4 of weeks 7 and 10
           and continuing until blood counts recover. Patients with M0 disease and patients under 3
           years of age with M+ disease undergo radiotherapy to the primary tumor daily on weeks
           7-12. Patients 3 years of age and over with M+ disease undergo craniospinal irradiation
           (CSI) daily on weeks 7-12 until negative cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) cytology is
           achieved.

        -  Post-radiation induction therapy (weeks 13-18): Patients receive vincristine IV on day 1
           of weeks 13 and 16; doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide as in pre-irradiation induction
           therapy beginning on day 1 of week 13; cyclophosphamide IV over 1 hour on days 1-3 of
           week 16; dactinomycin IV on days 1-5 of week 16; and G-CSF SC daily beginning on day 6
           of weeks 13 and 16 and continuing until blood counts recover.

        -  Maintenance chemotherapy (weeks 19-42): Patients receive vincristine IV on day 1 of
           weeks 27, 33, and 39 and days 1 and 5 of weeks 30, 36, and 42; doxorubicin and
           cyclophosphamide as in pre-irradiation induction beginning on day 1 of weeks 27 and 33;
           doxorubicin IV over 15 minutes and dexrazoxane (DX) IV over 15 minutes on days 1 and 2
           of week 39; cyclophosphamide IV over 1 hour on days 1-3 of weeks 30, 36, 39, and 42;
           dactinomycin IV on days 1-5 of weeks 30, 36, and 42 and on day 1 of weeks 19 and 23;
           oral temozolomide on days 1-5 of weeks 19 and 23; and G-CSF SC daily beginning on day 6
           of weeks 19, 23, 30, 36, and 42, day 5 of weeks 27 and 33, and day 4 of week 39 and
           continuing until blood counts recover.

        -  Doxorubicin continuation therapy (for patients not receiving CSI and mediastinal
           radiotherapy)(weeks 45-51): Patients receive vincristine IV on day 1 of weeks 45, 48,
           and 51 and day 5 of week 48; doxorubicin IV over 15 minutes and DX IV over 15 minutes on
           days 1 and 2 of weeks 45 and 51; cyclophosphamide IV over 1 hour on days 1-3 of weeks
           45, 48, and 51; dactinomycin IV on days 1-5 of week 48; and G-CSF SC daily beginning on
           day 4 of weeks 45 and 51 and day 6 of week 48 and continuing until blood counts recover.

        -  Non-doxorubicin continuation therapy (for patients receiving CSI or mediastinal
           radiotherapy)(weeks 45-51): Patients receive cyclophosphamide and G-CSF as in
           doxorubicin continuation therapy; vincristine IV on days 1 and 5 of weeks 45, 48, and
           51; and dactinomycin IV on days 1-5 of weeks 45, 48, and 51.

      Treatment continues in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

    <measure>2-yr Overall Survival</measure>
    <time_frame>Patients are followed for survival up to 5 yrs post-therapy completion or death; As of this analysis, median follow-up among survivors was 31 months with the longest follow-up being 40 months.</time_frame>
    <description>Overall survival is defined as the time from date of diagnosis to death or date of last follow-up. 2-year overall survival is the probability of patients remaining alive at 2-years from study entry estimated using Kaplan-Meier (KM) methods which censors patients at date of last follow-up. Precision of this conditional probability estimate was measured in terms of standard error. Median OS, the original primary endpoint, was not estimable based on the Kaplan-Meier method because of insufficient follow-up.</description>

        <title>2-yr Overall Survival</title>
        <description>Overall survival is defined as the time from date of diagnosis to death or date of last follow-up. 2-year overall survival is the probability of patients remaining alive at 2-years from study entry estimated using Kaplan-Meier (KM) methods which censors patients at date of last follow-up. Precision of this conditional probability estimate was measured in terms of standard error. Median OS, the original primary endpoint, was not estimable based on the Kaplan-Meier method because of insufficient follow-up.</description>
        <time_frame>Patients are followed for survival up to 5 yrs post-therapy completion or death; As of this analysis, median follow-up among survivors was 31 months with the longest follow-up being 40 months.</time_frame>
