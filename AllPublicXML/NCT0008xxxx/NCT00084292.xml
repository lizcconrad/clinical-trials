      This multi-center collaborative study will establish a database of information about stroke
      in infants and children.

      Participating children have their medical and research records reviewed for information about
      their stroke. The information is gathered and entered into a secure electronic database
      called REDCap. All information is de-identified.

      This study does not require any additional interventions but two outcome measures are
      typically administered: the Paediatric Stroke Outcome Measure (PSOM) and the Recovery and
      Recurrence Questionnaire (RRQ). The PSOM is used during clinic visits by the study
      co-investigator; the RRQ is a parental questionnaire that can be completed during clinic
      visits or by telephone interview for those parents who cannot attend the follow up
      appointment. Both measures assess neurological function.

      The IPSS also provides participating centers with the option to share de-identified patient
      CT and MRI's in the IPSS Imaging Repository housed at The Hospital for Sick Children in
      Toronto, Canada; incorporating a neuroimaging component would improve our understanding of
      the processes underlying plasticity and recovery in childhood stroke.

      Participating Investigators have the opportunity to access the larger dataset for use in
      group publications but each center will retain ownership of their own data. These
      contributing Investigators are recognized through authorship.

      The activities of the network are creating the opportunity for manuscript writing, grant
      development and collaboration on clinical challenges in paediatric stroke. Ultimately, this
      data will allow physicians to better diagnose, treat, and prevent stroke in children.

      OBJECTIVES: This is the first multi-center, multi-national study of children with stroke. It
      seeks to build a network of investigators and baseline disease data to enable childhood
      stroke clinical trials to be developed.

      STUDY POPULATION: Infants and children with ischemic stroke (arterial ischemic stroke and
      sinovenous thrombosis).

      DESIGN: This study is composed of a data collection component and collaborative process. Our
      network of over 150 active Investigators retrospectively and/or prospectively collect data on
      diagnosis, etiology, treatment and outcome. Collectively, they aim to develop standardized
      data collection forms and protocols for neonates and children with arterial ischemic stroke
      (AIS) and cerebral sinovenous thrombosis (CSVT).

      Children with diagnosis of stroke made after January 2003, will be prospectively enrolled
      into a web-based data entry system.

      OUTCOME MEASURES: This study will quantify outcome event rates (initial stroke
      characteristics, recurrent stroke, mortality, neurologic deficits), which can be used in
      designing future intervention studies and determining sample sizes. Analysis will be
      primarily descriptive. Some predictor testing for outcomes within strata may be utilized for
      web-based data.

    <description>The Pediatric Stroke Outcome Measure (PSOM) was developed out of a need for an objective, standardized outcome measures for children with acute, unilateral focal CNS such as cerebral infarction. The goal was to develop an assessment measure that defines clinically and functionally relevant outcome in pediatric stroke. This measure was designed for and tested in children with arterial ischemic stroke or cerebral sinovenous thrombosis.</description>

    <description>The Recurrence and Recovery Questionnaire (RRQ) was developed by converting the Pediatric Stroke Outcome Measure (PSOM) to a questionnaire for patient/parent telephone interview. The agreement and consistency of the PSOM and RRQ is then assessed, and identified conditions that contributed to differences between the 2 measures</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

        • A patient will be eligible for the study if s/he meets all of the following criteria for
        each stroke type:

        AIS

          -  Age: term birth (gestation &gt; 36 weeks) to 18 years of age

          -  Event diagnosed after January 1st, 2003

          -  Must have both clinical and radiological evidence present

               1. Focal neurological deficit of acute onset lasting greater than 20 minutes. AND
                  computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showing infarct in
                  location consistent with neurological signs and symptoms.

               2. Neonates: seizures or lethargy alone may be the only acute symptom AND CT or MRI
                  showing infarct.

               3. Haemorrhagic infarction (ischemic infarct with secondary haemorrhage)

               4. Hypoxic ischemic event with diffuse or bilateral infarction, if there is in
                  addition a definite focal, single arterial infarct in a specified vascular
                  territory. (e.g. middle cerebral artery, or MCA, mentioned in the radiographic
                  report.)

        CSVT

          -  Age: birth (premature infants included) to 18 years of age

          -  Event diagnosed after January 1st, 2003

          -  Must have both clinical and radiological evidence present

               1. Clinical criteria: any transient neurological dysfunction including

                    -  headache, seizure, decreased level of consciousness

                    -  focal neurological signs consistent with CSVT

               2. Neuroimaging criteria: thrombosis of cerebral veins or venous sinuses seen on
