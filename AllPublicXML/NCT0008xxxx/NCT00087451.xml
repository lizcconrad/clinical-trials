  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A Phase I, open-label, non-randomized, sequential dose escalation cohort trial of the safety,
      tolerability, and maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of AP23573 when administered intravenously as
      a 30-minute infusion, once daily for five days, repeated every two weeks, to patients with
      progressive or recurrent malignant glioma.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the study is to determine the safety, tolerability, and maximum
      tolerated dose (MTD) of AP23573 when administered intravenously once daily for five days
      repeated every two weeks to patients with progressive or recurrent gliomas who have failed
      standard therapy and who are or are not receiving enzyme-inducing anticonvulsant (EIAC)
      medications.

      The secondary objectives are to: characterize the pharmacokinetic profile of AP23573 when
      administered daily for five days repeated every two weeks at the indicated dosage levels in
      patients receiving and not receiving EIAC; describe the progression-free survival at six
      months; describe changes in proteins affected by mTOR inhibition; describe single timepoint
      status of proteins affected by mTOR inhibition in tumor tissue surgical specimens after
      AP23573 dosing; describe the status of key proteins in the mTOR signaling pathway in archival
      tumor samples, if available; describe health-related quality of life at the start of the
      trial and prior to study drug infusion and at various timepoints throughout the trial.

      Protocol Outline:

      This is a Phase I, open-label, non-randomized, sequential dose escalation cohort trial of the
      safety, tolerability, and MTD of AP23573 when administered intravenously as a 30-minute
      infusion, once daily for five days, repeated every two weeks, to patients with progressive or
      recurrent malignant glioma.

        Inclusion Criteria (Patients must meet each of the following criteria to be eligible for
        participation in the trial):

          -  Male or female patients â‰¥ 18 years of age

          -  Patients must have a radiographically suspected progressive or recurrent primary
             malignant glioma (glioblastoma multiforme or gliosarcoma) and must have failed
             standard therapy. Patients may not have received any systemic therapy for the
             treatment of this recurrence or relapse

          -  Patients must be candidates for surgical resection or open biopsy of the tumor

          -  Patients who have had previous surgical resection(s) are eligible

          -  Patients must have had minimum prior therapy of radiotherapy and documented
             progression of disease thereafter

          -  Patients must have had a tissue proven malignant glioma

          -  A minimum interval of at least four weeks prior to the first dose of AP23573 must have
             elapsed for all patients enrolling after either prior surgery or completion of prior
             external beam radiotherapy for initial primary diagnosis

          -  A minimum interval of four weeks prior to the first dose of AP23573 must have elapsed
             since receipt of any investigational therapy or any other chemotherapy

          -  Patients in the EIAC cohorts must be presently receiving a stable dose of EIAC (e.g.,
             dilantin, phenytoin, etc.) for at least two weeks prior to the first dose of AP23573

          -  For patients on corticosteroids, the dose must be stable for at least one week prior
             to the first dose of AP23573

          -  Patients must be neurologically stable for at least two weeks prior to the first dose
             of AP23573

          -  Patients must have an ECOG performance status of 0 or 1

          -  Patients must either not be of childbearing potential or have agreed to use a
             medically effective method of contraception
