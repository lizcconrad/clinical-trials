      RATIONALE: Chemoprevention therapy is the use of certain drugs to try to prevent the
      development or recurrence of cancer. The use of celecoxib may be effective in preventing
      breast cancer.

      PURPOSE: This randomized phase II trial is studying how well celecoxib works in preventing
      breast cancer in premenopausal women who are at risk for developing the disease.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Compare 1-year mammographic density in premenopausal women at high risk for developing
           breast cancer treated with celecoxib vs placebo.

        -  Compare 1-year proliferation of breast epithelial cells, as measured by Ki67 staining,
           in patients treated with these drugs.

        -  Compare the expression of other biomarkers, including cyclo-oxygenase-2 (COX-2) enzyme
           and a marker of apoptosis, in breast tissue of patients treated with these drugs.

        -  Compare 1-year plasma levels of insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-1, IGF binding
           protein-3, and prostaglandin E_2 in patients treated with these drugs.

        -  Compare the toxicity of these drugs in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, multicenter study. Patients
      are stratified according to risk category (lobular carcinoma in situ or ductal carcinoma in
      situ vs BRCA1/2 mutation AND any Gail risk vs Gail risk ≥1.7% but &lt; 5% vs Gail risk ≥ 5%) and
      prior tamoxifen use (yes vs no). Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

        -  Celocoxib: Patients receive oral celecoxib twice daily.

        -  Placebo: Patients receive oral placebo twice daily. In both arms, treatment continues
           for 12 months in the absence of unacceptable toxicity or diagnosis of cancer.

      Patients are followed at 1 month.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 100 patients (50 per treatment arm) will be accrued for this
      study.

        <title>Mammographic Density</title>
        <description>The primary outcome measure is change in mammographic density. The null hypothesis is that there is no difference between the arms in change in mammographic density over one year versus the alternative that the treatment arm reduces mammographic density by 10 points (percent of pixels highlighted) or more over one year compared to the change in the placebo arm.</description>
        <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
        <population>Counts represent number of patients for by arm for whom a 1 year mammographic density image was submitted. However, since the study was closed early due to poor accrual, there was insufficient accrual to evaluate study endpoints, and these images were never analyzed.</population>
