      This study will evaluate the molecular response to high dose Gleevec in newly diagnosed
      patients with Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia (CML) in Chronic Phase. This study will evaluate
      the ability of Gleevec to reduce the amount of abnormal protein that occurs in patients with
      CML.

      Patients who are eligible to participate will be treated for 18 months. This trial will
      include male or female patients 18 years or older who are newly diagnosed (within 6 months)
      with CML.
