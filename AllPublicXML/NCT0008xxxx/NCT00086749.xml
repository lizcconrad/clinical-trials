      RATIONALE: High estrogen levels may be associated with dense breast tissue and an increased
      risk of developing breast cancer. Tamoxifen may be effective in reducing breast density by
      decreasing estrogen levels.

      PURPOSE: This phase I trial is studying how well tamoxifen works in reducing breast density
      in premenopausal women with breast cancer or at high risk of developing breast cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Determine whether breast density, as measured by digital mammography, decreases in
           premenopausal women receiving tamoxifen for breast cancer or for breast cancer risk
           reduction.

        -  Determine whether breast density, as determined by a trained mammographer, decreases in
           patients treated with this drug.

        -  Correlate tamoxifen-induced symptoms in estrogen target tissue with change in salivary
           steroids in patients treated with this drug.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the effect of this drug on salivary steroids in regularly cycling and
           amenorrheic patients.

        -  Correlate changes in breast density with tamoxifen-induced alterations in sex steroid
           levels, as measured in the saliva, of patients treated with this drug.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive oral tamoxifen once daily. Treatment continues for 5 years in the
      absence of disease metastasis (patients with known breast cancer) or a diagnosis of breast
      cancer (patients undergoing risk reduction).

      Patients undergo mammography to determine breast density at baseline, at 6 and 12 months, and
      then annually for 4 years. Patients also collect daily salivary samples during the 30-day
      periods surrounding the imaging studies to measure salivary estradiol and progesterone
      levels. The results of the salivary hormone studies are correlated with density changes at
      study completion.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 100 patients will be accrued for this study.
