      The primary objective of this clinical research study is to evaluate the safety,
      tolerability, and maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of intravenous (IV) MST-997 formulated in
      Intralipid 20% administered on a weekly schedule to subjects with advanced malignant solid
      tumors.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Documented histological or cytological diagnosis confirming the presence of malignant
             solid tumor

          -  Tumor progression after conventional therapy for cancer or a malignant solid tumor for
             which no conventional therapy exists

          -  Subjects enrolled in the MTD confirmation cohort should have a documented histologic
             and/or cytologic diagnosis of metastatic breast cancer or non-small cell lung cancer
             (NSCLC) and should not have received more than 2 prior chemotherapy regimens for
             metastatic disease (adjuvant and neoadjuvant chemotherapy will not be included in the
             maximum of 2 prior regimens described above)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects with symptomatic or clinically active central nervous system (CNS)
             metastases. Subjects who have had prior treatment with radiotherapy or surgical
             resection for CNS metastases will be permitted if CNS metastases have remained stable
             and have not required any treatment for at least 3 months prior to first dose of test
             article

          -  History of any other primary malignancy with less than 5 years documentation of a
             disease-free state (Subjects with a history of basal cell or squamous cell carcinomas
             of the skin or cervical carcinoma in situ, which have been successfully treated, are
             not excluded)

          -  Recent major surgery (within 14 days before the first dose) or chemotherapy within 28
             days before the first dose of MST-997 (42 days if the previous chemotherapy included
             nitrosoureas or mitomycin C)
