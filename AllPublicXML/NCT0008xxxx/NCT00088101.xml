        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Male and female patients 18 years or older with one of the following malignancies:

          -  Histologically or cytologically confirmed hematological malignancy (other than Acute
             Myeloid Leukemia and Myelodysplastic Syndrome) and if treatment is medically
             indicated, or,

          -  Histologically-confirmed non-hematological malignancy that is metastatic or
             unresectable and for which no standard therapy is available.

          -  Patients with CLL, PLL, CML, CTCL, ATL, and Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma may be entered if
             they are refractory to or have relapsed following conventional chemotherapy regimens
             such as alkylating agents (e.g. chlorambucil and cyclophosphamide), anthracycline
             combinations [e.g. CHOP (cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, prednisone)],
             and/or purine analogues (e.g. fludarabine monophosphate and 2-CDA) and are not
             currently being considered for re-treatment with conventional regimens

          -  Patients with CLL and other leukemic malignancies will be staged according to the
             modified Rai staging criteria [low-risk, intermediate-risk and high risk]. All
             patients in the high-risk group (Stage III and IV) are eligible. Intermediate risk
             patients (Stage I and II) with one or more criteria of active disease (such as
             progressive lymphocytosis, lymphadenopathy, and splenomegaly, weight loss &gt; 10% within
             6 months, extreme fatigue, fever and/or night sweats without evidence of infection,
             etc.) are also eligible

          -  ECOG Performance Status of 0-2

          -  Life expectancy of greater than 12 weeks.

          -  Patients must have acceptable organ and marrow function at screening and pre-dose
             visits as defined below unless approved medically by the clinical investigator.

          -  Absolute neutrophils count greater than 1,000 cells/ul for patients with hematologic
             malignancies and â‰¥1,500 cells/ul for patients with solid tumors

          -  Platelets greater than 100,000/ul

          -  Hgb greater than 8.5 g/dL

          -  Total bilirubin must be &lt;1.5 mg/dL or &lt; 2X upper limit of normal

          -  AST (SGOT) &lt; 2.5 times the upper limit of normal

          -  ALT (SGPT) &lt; 2.5 times the upper limit of normal

          -  Adequate renal function (serum creatinine &lt; 2.0 mg/dL or a calculated creatinine
             clearance greater than 50 mL/min)

          -  Electrocardiogram without evidence of clinically significant conduction abnormalities
             or active ischemia as determined by the investigator.

          -  NCI grade 0-1 left ventricular ejection fraction within 30 days of dosing.

          -  The effects of STA-5312 on the developing human fetus are unknown. Therefore, women of
             childbearing potential (defined as women under 50 years of age or history of
             amenorrhea for &lt; 12 months prior to study entry) must agree to use adequate
             contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study
             entry and for the duration of study participation. Should a female patient become
             pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while participating in this study, she should
             inform the treating physician immediately.

          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Women who are pregnant or lactating.

          -  Patients who have had chemotherapy, radiotherapy (except palliative radiation
             delivered to &lt; 20% of bone marrow), immunotherapy, or corticosteroids ( &gt; 10 mg/day of
             prednisone or equivalent) within 4 weeks prior to entering the study or those who have
             not recovered from adverse events due to agents administered more than 4 weeks
             earlier.

          -  The use of nitrosoureas or mitomycin C within 6 weeks prior to study entry.

          -  Patients with prior peripheral blood stem cell rescue or bone marrow transplantation.

          -  History of primary brain tumors or active brain metastases. (Patients with previously
             treated brain metastases who are not receiving corticosteroids or anticonvulsants may
             be considered for enrollment)

          -  History of stroke or other significant neurologic limitations within 6 months prior to
             study enrollment

          -  Use of any investigational agents within 4 weeks of study enrollment.

          -  History of severe allergic reactions to excipients (e.g. Tween 80) or had
             hypersensitivity reactions to other chemotherapeutic agents similar in structure to
             STA-5312.

          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to ongoing or active
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac
             arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with
             study requirements, as determined by the investigator.

          -  History of active CNS-lymphoma, AIDS-related lymphoma, or any uncontrolled severe
             medical illness or infection.

          -  Grade 2 or higher sensory or motor neuropathy at screening.
