      This study will compare changes in atherosclerotic plaque in the coronary arteries (vessels
      on the surface of the heart that supply blood to the heart) with changes in the carotid
      arteries (vessels in the neck that supply blood to the brain) in patients enrolled in a
      Pfizer-sponsored treatment trial for coronary artery disease. Atherosclerosis is a buildup of
      fatty deposits (plaque) in arteries that can lead to blockage of the vessel, possibly
      resulting in heart attack or stroke. A major question in cardiovascular disease is how
      closely atherosclerotic changes in the coronary arteries correlate with changes in the
      carotid artery that occur with treatment. substudy of a Pfizer.

      Patients enrolled in the Pfizer trial comparing the effectiveness of the drug atorvastatin
      with a combination of atorvastatin and CETP inhibitor (a drug to increase HDL cholesterol
      levels) may be eligible for this substudy.

      Participants undergo magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and ultrasound of the carotid arteries
      to measure the thickness of the vessels. The results are then compared with the coronary
      artery images obtained as part of the patient's evaluation for the Pfizer trial.

      MRI

      MRI scans use a powerful magnet with an advanced computer system and radio waves to produce
      accurate, detailed pictures of organs and tissues. During the scan the patient lies on a
      table in a narrow cylinder containing a magnetic field, wearing earplugs to muffle loud
      noises that occur with electrical switching of the magnetic fields. A medicine called
      gadolinium contrast may be injected into a vein during part of the scan to brighten the
      images. The scan takes about 30 to 90 minutes. An electrocardiogram (ECG) is done during the
      scan to monitor the heart's electrical activity. Patients who agree to undergo another MRI
      test are also imaged in a scanner that uses a stronger (3 Tesla) magnet.

      Ultrasound

      An echocardiogram (ultrasound of the heart) uses sound waves to image the carotid arteries. A
      gel is applied to the area of the neck to be imaged and a small handheld ultrasound probe is
      held against the neck to take the pictures.

      Participants return after 2 years for a second set of tests.

      Under the general hypothesis that atherosclerosis is a systemic disease; the purpose of this
      protocol is to compare coronary artery atherosclerotic abnormalities with carotid artery
      abnormalities. This is an NHLBI sponsored sub study to the Pfizer sponsored trial comparing
      atorvastatin or the combination of atorvastatin/CETP inhibitor as treatments for patients
      with coronary heart disease. The primary study is a multicenter, randomized, double blind,
      active-controlled study which uses intracoronary ultrasound to measure coronary plaque volume
      during the course of treatment. The scientific value of the NHLBI sub study will be the
      comparison of atherosclerotic abnormalities in two different vascular beds, the coronary
      artery and the carotid arteries. This study will examine correlations between invasive
      coronary measurements by intravascular ultrasound (IVUS), with 2-dimensional measurements of
      wall thickness by carotid intimal medial wall thickness (IMT), and with 3-dimensional
      measurements of carotid wall volume by MRI and 3D ultrasound. Secondary analysis will probe
      whether carotid plaque characteristics can predict atheroma regression. Secondary analysis
      will also assess the ability of noninvasive carotid measures to predict the degree of
      coronary regression determined in the coronary arteries by IVUS. It is important to note that
      the NHLBI study design remains blinded to the treatment group a subject is enrolled in since
      the sample size for a single center study is too small to detect the conservatively estimated
      additional benefit of combination atorvastatin/CETP inhibitor treatment over the already
      effective atorvastatin alone. Thus, the NHLBI sub study is primarily a pathophysiological
      study correlating carotid and coronary atherosclerotic changes as well as a technological
      comparison of IVU, carotid IMT, and carotid vessel wall volume by MRI. If successful, this
      study could provide the framework for following treatment trials of this nature with
      noninvasive tools, either ultrasound or MRI, in place of the accurate but invasive IVUS.
