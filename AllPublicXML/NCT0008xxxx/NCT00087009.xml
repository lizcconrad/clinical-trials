      RATIONALE: Monoclonal antibodies such as rituximab can locate cancer cells and either kill
      them or deliver cancer-killing substances to them without harming normal cells. Beta-glucan
      may increase the effectiveness of rituximab by making cancer cells more sensitive to the
      monoclonal antibody.

      PURPOSE: This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of beta-glucan when
      given together with rituximab in treating young patients with relapsed or progressive
      lymphoma or leukemia or with lymphoproliferative disorder related to donor stem cell
      transplantation.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Determine the maximum tolerated dose of beta-glucan when given in combination with
           rituximab in pediatric patients with relapsed or progressive CD20-positive lymphoma or
           leukemia or post-allogeneic stem cell transplant-related lymphoproliferative disorder.

        -  Determine the toxicity of this regimen, with special emphasis on the degree of B-cell
           depletion and immune suppression, in these patients.

        -  Determine the effects of beta-glucan on leukocyte-mediated cytotoxic effects in patients
           treated with this regimen.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the antitumor effect of this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of beta-glucan. Patients are assigned to 1 of 2
      treatment groups according to diagnosis.

        -  Group I (lymphoma or leukemia): Patients receive rituximab IV on days 1, 8, 15, and 22
           and oral beta-glucan once daily on days 1-28 (days 8-28 of course 1). Treatment repeats
           every 42 days for 4 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
           toxicity.

        -  Group II (post-allogeneic stem cell transplant-related lymphoproliferative disorder):
           Patients receive rituximab IV on days 1, 4, 8, 15, and 22 and oral beta-glucan once
           daily on days 8-28. Beginning on day 42, patients with responding disease may receive
           monthly rituximab prophylaxis until their CD4 cell count is &gt; 200/mm^3.

      Cohorts of 6 patients receive escalating doses of beta-glucan until the maximum tolerated
      dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 6
      patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.

      Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 6-24 patients will be accrued for this study within 2 years.
