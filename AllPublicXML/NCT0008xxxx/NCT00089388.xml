  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This randomized phase II trial is studying how well cilengitide works in treating patients
      with acute myeloid leukemia. Cilengitide may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking the
      enzymes necessary for their growth

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine 10-month relapse-free survival of patients with acute myeloid leukemia in first
      complete remission treated with cilengitide as maintenance therapy.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine overall survival of patients treated with this drug. II. Determine the safety
      and toxicity of this drug in these patients. III. Determine the biological activity of this
      drug in cells from these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized study. Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

      Arm I: Patients receive cilengitide IV at a lower dose over 1 hour twice weekly for 4 weeks.

      Arm II: Patients receive cilengitide IV at a higher dose over 1 hour twice weekly for 4
      weeks.

      In both arms, courses repeat every 4 weeks in the absence of disease relapse or unacceptable
      toxicity.
