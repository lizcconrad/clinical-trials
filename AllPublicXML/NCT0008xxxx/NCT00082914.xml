      RATIONALE: Denileukin diftitox may be able to make the body build an immune response to kill
      tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well denileukin diftitox works in treating
      patients with metastatic melanoma or metastatic kidney cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Determine the clinical response in patients with metastatic melanoma or metastatic
           kidney cancer treated with denileukin diftitox.

      Secondary

        -  Determine whether changes occur in levels of CD4-positive CD25-positive lymphocytes in
           the peripheral blood of these patients before and after treatment with this drug.

        -  Determine the toxicity profile of this drug in these patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients are stratified according to disease type (metastatic melanoma vs metastatic
      kidney cancer).

      Patients receive denileukin diftitox IV over 1 hour on days 1-5, 21-25, 42-46, and 63-67.
      Treatment repeats every 84 days (12 weeks) for up to a maximum total of 5 courses in the
      absence of disease progression, autoimmune ocular toxicity attributable to denileukin
      diftitox, or any other unacceptable toxicity. At any time during therapy, patients achieving
      a complete response receive 1 additional course of therapy after the complete response.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 10-96 patients (5-48 per stratum) will be accrued for this
      study within 3-4 years.
