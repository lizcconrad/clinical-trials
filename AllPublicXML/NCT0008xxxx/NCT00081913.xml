  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if cell therapy with your own cells (autologous
      cells) delivered with a catheter to regions of the heart with poor blood flow will be safe
      and if it will relieve your chest pain and/or your ability to exercise.

      The goal of this study is to determine the safety of various doses of autologous (one's own)
      stem cells, delivered with a catheter into the regions of the heart with poor blood flow.
      Stem cells are primitive cells produced by bone marrow that can develop into blood cells or
      other types of cells. In addition to determining whether this new approach is safe, the
      diagnostic tests may offer preliminary insights into the usefulness of this approach for
      treating myocardial ischemia (the condition where areas in the heart are lacking enough
      oxygen and blood flow to keep the heart muscle working well).

      This is a blinded, randomized study to compare a certain type of stem cell called
      CD34-positive versus a placebo agent (normal saline). You will have a 3:1 chance of receiving
      your CD34-positive stem cells versus the placebo agent (normal saline). You will not know
      whether you received the CD34-positive cells or the placebo agent (normal saline). If you are
      randomized to receive placebo (normal saline), you will undergo all of the pre-treatment
      phases of this study (including the stem cell mobilization phase and the apheresis
      procedure), but rather than receiving injections of CD34-positive cells, you will receive
      injections of the placebo agent (normal saline). There is some research evidence that
      suggests CD34-positive cells may help develop new blood vessels or improve blood flow when
      injected directly into the heart muscle.
