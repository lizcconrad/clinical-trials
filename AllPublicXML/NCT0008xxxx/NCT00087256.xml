      RATIONALE: Chemoprevention therapy is the use of certain drugs to try to prevent the
      development of cancer. It is not yet known whether celecoxib is effective in preventing
      polyps in patients with colon cancer.

      PURPOSE: Randomized phase III trial to study the effectiveness of celecoxib in preventing the
      development of polyps in patients who have undergone surgery for stage I colon cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Compare celecoxib vs placebo, in terms of decreasing the incidence of adenomatous polyps
           of the colon and rectum, in patients with resected stage I adenocarcinoma of the colon.

      Secondary

        -  Compare disease-free survival of patients treated with these regimens.

        -  Compare the effect of these regimens on self-reported symptoms and health-related
           quality of life of these patients.

        -  Compare the quality of life of patients treated with these regimens.

        -  Compare the benefits of celecoxib in patients with primary tumors or polyps that express
           cyclo-oxygenase-2 (COX-2) with those that do not express COX-2.

        -  Compare the expression of signaling targets such as serine/threonine AKT, extracellular
           signal-regulated kinase 2 (ERK2), and endoplasmic reticulum Ca+2- ATPases in the index
           tumor and polyps.

        -  Determine the toxicity and safety of celecoxib in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter study. Patients
      are stratified according to gender, tumor stage (T1 vs T2), age (≤ 49 vs 50 to 59 vs ≥ 60
      years), and current aspirin use (yes vs no). Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment
      arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive oral celecoxib twice daily for 3 years.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive oral placebo twice daily for 3 years. In both arms, treatment
           continues in the absence of unacceptable toxicity or the diagnosis of invasive colon
           cancer, carcinoma in situ of the colon or rectum, or a non-colon primary cancer.

      Quality of life is assessed at baseline and then at 6, 12, 24, 36, and 42 months.

      Patients are followed at 6 months and at 2 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 1,200 patients (600 per treatment arm) will be accrued for this
      study within 2.5 years.
