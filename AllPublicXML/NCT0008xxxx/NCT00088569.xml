  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will test a new electrical technique called direct current (DC) polarization that
      is able to change brain activity in subtle ways for a short time. A recent study showed that,
      depending on its direction, the current could make people perform a little better or perhaps
      slightly worse on a test of the function of the brain's frontal lobe. This study will use
      positron emission tomography (PET) scanning to examine how DC polarization affects brain
      activity.

      Healthy volunteers between 20 and 70 years of age who are right handed and who are not taking
      any medications that affect the brain may be eligible for this study. Candidates are screened
      with a brief medical history and neurological evaluation.

      Participants have a PET scan on three different days at least 3 days apart. Each scanning
      session takes 2-1/2 to 3 hours. For the scan, radioactive water is injected into the body
      through a vein. Subjects lie on a bed that slides in and out of the doughnut-shaped scanner,
      with their head held from the back by a padded holder and in front by a custom-molded plastic
      mask with holes for the eyes, nose, and mouth. DC electrodes made of wet sponges are placed
      on the right side of the head and over the left eye and are held in place with elastic
      bandages.

      Three kinds of DC polarization are tested. In two tests the current is the same, but in
      opposite directions. The third is a sham (placebo) condition with no current delivered. Each
      of the three scans is separated by at least 3 days. On each day, a series of scans is done in
      a single session. Before each injection of tracer, the DC current is turned on. This may
      cause a tingling or slight burning on the skin under the electrodes, which disappears when
      the current is turned off. In each session, the subject receives 16 injections of tracer
      about 8 minutes apart, with DC polarization turned on for 4 out of the 8 minutes.

      During most of the 8-minute periods, subjects are shown a pattern of dots about every 2
      seconds. Sometimes the subject just looks at the patterns, and sometimes subjects are asked
      to push a button corresponding to the pattern they saw just before the current one. Sometimes
      they will be asked to push a button corresponding to the pattern that came before that one
      and so on, up to three patterns before the current one. The task lasts for about 2 minutes
      each time, with time to relax in between.

      Objective: The passage of weak DC currents across the head (DC polarization) is a safe and
      painless means of altering the activity of cortical neurons and their response to exogenous
      stimulation. This has been demonstrated in the human motor cortex where local anodal
      polarization increases, and cathodal decreases, the motor evoked potential from TMS. Recent
      experiments from our lab suggest that polarization may have analogous effects on the
      prefrontal cortex, where anodal current enhances functions including verbal fluency and
      psychomotor speed and cathodal current produces slight performance decrements. We are
      interested in the potential of DC current to enhance function in patients with frontal lobe
      disorders and to reduce frontal overactivation in conditions such as drug craving. Treatments
      that alter frontal activity may also have mood altering properties. In order to establish the
      principle that DC polarization is able to alter frontal lobe activity we propose to combine
      DC polarization with a variably loaded frontal activation task and measure regional cerebral
      blood flow (rCBF with H(2)(15)O positron emission tomography (PET) scanning.

      Study population: Twenty healthy individuals will be studied.

      Design: On three different days, participants will receive right dorsolateral prefrontal
      anodal, cathodal, or sham treatment. On each day, rCBF will be measured during rest without
      and then with treatment. Then subjects will perform the N-back task (a test of working
      memory) during treatment with the working memory load (N) varied between 0 and 3 items from
      scan to scan.

      Outcome measures: Resting rCBF and the relationship between cognitive load and rCBF at the
      treatment site will be compared between treatments in order to look for effects on
      task-related activation and performance.
