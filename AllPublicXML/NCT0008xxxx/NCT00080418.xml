      The purpose of this study is to determine the highest dose of Liposome Entrapped Paclitaxel
      Easy to Use formulation (LEP-ETU) that can be safely administered by an intravenous infusion
      to patients with advanced cancer.

      LEP-ETU is a new formulation of the anti-cancer agent paclitaxel for injection or Taxol
      (paclitaxel and Cremophor EL). Paclitaxel is a drug currently used for treating a broad range
      of cancers. Paclitaxel is thought to prevent cells from dividing and growing, resulting in
      cell death. This new formulation consists of paclitaxel associated with liposomes, which are
      microscopic membrane-like structures created from lipids (fats). It is believed that LEP-ETU
      will maintain or enhance the anti-tumor properties of paclitaxel, while offering advantages
      to the patient of a shorter infusion time, routine premedication not required, fewer side
      effects at similar doses, and possibly greater effectiveness, especially if higher doses can
      be delivered without an increase in side effects.

      This study is designed to determine the following:

        -  The highest dose of LEP-ETU that can be given safely to patients.

        -  The pharmacokinetics of paclitaxel following intravenous infusion with LEP-ETU.

        -  Any anti-tumor effects of LEP-ETU.

      Up to 8 dose levels will be studied. LEP-ETU will be given to patients by intravenous
      infusion over 90 minutes, once every 21 days, until their disease progresses or side effects
      occur requiring the treatments to end. Patients will be evaluated for safety and how well
      they tolerate the treatments.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients must have advanced (local and/or metastatic) histologically documented cancer
             considered unresponsive to available conventional modalities or treatments, and no
             life-prolonging therapy or therapy with a greater potential for patient benefit is
             available.

          -  Patients must have an ECOG Performance Status of 0-2.

          -  Patients must have recovered from acute toxicities of prior treatment:

               -  ≥ 4 weeks must have elapsed since receiving any investigational agent.

               -  ≥ 3 weeks must have elapsed since receiving any radiotherapy, or treatment with
                  cytotoxic or biologic agents (≥ 6 weeks for mitomycin or nitrosureas). Chronic
                  treatment with non-investigational gonadotropin-releasing hormone analogs or
                  other hormonal or supportive care is permitted.

               -  &gt; 6 months must have elapsed since receiving a high-dose chemotherapy regime with
                  stem cell support.

               -  ≥ 2 weeks must have elapsed since any prior surgery or granulocyte-stimulating
                  growth factor therapy.

          -  Patients must be in adequate condition as evidenced by the following clinical
             laboratory values:
