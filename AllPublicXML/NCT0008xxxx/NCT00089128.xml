      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as gemcitabine and irinotecan, work in different
      ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Combining more than one
      drug may kill more tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well giving gemcitabine together with irinotecan
      works in treating patients with locally advanced or metastatic bladder cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Determine response in patients with locally advanced or metastatic transitional cell
           carcinoma of the bladder treated with gemcitabine and irinotecan.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the duration of response in patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine the tolerance to and toxicity of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Determine the median and progression-free survival of patients treated with this
           regimen.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive gemcitabine IV over 30 minutes and irinotecan IV over 90 minutes on
      days 1 and 8. Courses repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity. Patients with responding disease receive 2 additional courses beyond
      best response.

      Patients are followed every 3 months for 1 year, every 6 months for 2 years, and then
      annually thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 25 patients will be accrued for this study within 24 months.
