  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to determine if it is possible to identify and perform a needle
      biopsy of the sentinel lymph node. The investigators hope to identify breast cancer cells in
      the lymph nodes under the arm without making an operation necessary.

      The rationale for this study is that for patients without enlarged lymph nodes under the arm,
      sentinel lymph node biopsy is the standard way of determining if breast cancer has spread to
      the lymph nodes under the arm. While the complications from a sentinel lymph node dissection
      are less than that of a complete axillary lymph node dissection, sentinel lymph node
      dissection still carries small risks of arm swelling, decreased movement, fluid collections,
      nerve injury, and pain. Furthermore, the majority of sentinel lymph nodes do not contain
      cancer. The investigators hope to develop a method to find cancer in the axillary lymph nodes
      and avoid the complications of an operation.

      In patients already scheduled to undergo sentinel lymph node dissection in the operating
      room, the investigators will first perform an axillary ultrasound guided core needle biopsy
      percutaneously. Patients will have already undergone prior injection of radioisotope and blue
      dye and as a standard procedure or the sentinel lymph node dissection. After induction of
      anesthesia, the investigators will identify the location of the sentinel node with a gamma
      probe to identify the &quot;pre-incision hot spot.&quot; Axillary ultrasound will then be used to
      identify the location of the lymph node and a percutaneous core needle biopsy of the targeted
      lymph node will be performed. The core biopsy specimen will be evaluated for the presence of
      blue staining and radioisotope uptake intraoperatively. The core biopsy specimen will then
      will be sent for pathologic analysis. The percutaneous biopsy should take about 10 minutes of
      additional operating room time. The operation will then proceed as planned with dissection
      and removal of the remaining sentinel node(s). Core samples and sentinel lymph nodes will be
      evaluated in a similar fashion per existing sentinel node protocol.
