      Cancer patients have an increased risk of developing blood clots in the veins compared to
      non-cancer patients. Cancer patients who develop blood clots can lead to reduced life
      expectancy, delayed cancer treatment, and decreased quality of life. Prevention is the most
      effective way to decrease the complications associated with blood clots in the veins.
      Although previous clinical trials have shown some benefit on the use of medication to prevent
      blood clots in the veins in ambulatory cancer patients, these studies have been inconclusive
      in demonstrating that existing blood thinners significantly reduce the rate of blood clots in
      cancer patients. One possible explanation relates to the fact that these studies have
      included a large proportion of cancer patients who are a low risk of developing blood clots
      in the veins. We are proposing to identify cancer patients who are at a high risk of
      developing blood clots by using a validated tool at the time of their cancer diagnosis. The
      identified high risk cancer patients will be asked to participate in a trial to test the
      safety and efficacy of a new oral medication that has been used to prevent blood clots in
      patients undergoing surgery. We are enrolling 574 patients in 7 Canadian centers (Ottawa,
      Halifax, Montreal, Vancouver, Sault Ste. Marie, Toronto and Hamilton). 287 patients will
      receive the study drug and 287 will receive an inactive substance. Analysis will be performed
      to assess the safety and the superiority of the study drug.

      Patients holding a malignancy have a 7 to 28-fold higher risk for venous thromboembolism
      (VTE) than non-cancer patients(1). Since most cancer patients are currently treated in the
      outpatient setting, an acute episode of VTE has important implications on their care due to
      its effects on reduced life expectancy, high rates of VTE recurrence, therapeutic failures,
      delays in chemotherapy and the risk of bleeding during anticoagulation.

      The best treatment of an acute episode of VTE is its prevention (thromboprophylaxis).
      Although previous clinical trials have shown some benefit on the use of thromboprophylaxis in
      ambulatory cancer patients, these studies have been inconclusive to convincingly demonstrate
      that existing anticoagulants significantly reduce the rate of VTE in cancer patients.
      Possible explanations are related to the fact that these studies have included a large number
      of cancer patients whose risk for VTE has been low and in consequence, the benefit of
      anticoagulation has become diluted by the large proportion of low risk cancer patients.

      To increase the success of thromboprophylaxis in cancer outpatients, we propose, first, to
      include validated methods for predicting the risk of VTE at the time of cancer diagnosis(2,
      3). This strategy will facilitate to identify cancer patients at high-risk for VTE and then,
      optimize the risk-to benefit ratio with anticoagulation. Second, to assess safety and
      efficacy of new oral anticoagulants in cancer patients as they represent an attractive
      alternative for an extended use of thromboprophylaxis. As a choice, new oral agents can be
      administered in fixed doses, do not require laboratory monitoring, have minimal interaction
      with additional drugs and provide a pain free alternative in patients who require injections.
