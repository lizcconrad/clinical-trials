    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether individuals with chronic insomnia disorder
      have a higher degree of physiologic arousal (resulting in their trouble sleeping) than good
      sleepers. The primary goal is to perform a rigorous quantitative assessment of physiologic
      hyper-arousal across two domains (autonomic nervous system and neurophysiology) in patients
      with chronic primary insomnia as compared to good sleepers matched for sex, age, body mass
      index (BMI) and race/ethnicity.

    <description>The balance between sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous control of the heart will be determined by spectral analysis of heart rate variability using continuous electrocardiogram (ECG) recording for 24 hours, including the normal sleep period.</description>

    <description>The EEG will be measured continuously during sleep and at frequent intervals during wake. The signal will be submitted to power spectral analysis to examine spectral power in frequency bands that are typical of arousal and in frequency bands that are typical of deep sleep.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria for Insomniacs:

          -  Men and women with primary insomnia of at least 3 months in duration

          -  ages 21-65 years old

          -  BMI &lt;35 kg/m2 to enable microneurography

          -  Moderate to severe insomnia based on the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) questionnaire

          -  Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) &gt; 5

          -  Self-reported habitual sleep duration &lt; 6.5 hours

        Inclusion criteria for good sleepers:

          -  21-65 years old men and women with BMI &lt;35 kg/m2

          -  No insomnia based on ISI questionnaire

          -  Self-reported habitual sleep duration ≥ 6.5 hours but &lt; 9 hours

          -  PSQI&lt;5

          -  Sleep efficiency on PSG with TRT of 8 hours &gt; 85%
