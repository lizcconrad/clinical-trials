  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Given the propensity for venous leg ulcers to become refractory, long standing lesions,
      incorporating active biologic grafts into the standard compression therapy, has shown to
      accelerate wound healing.

      The two products to be compared in this study are both commonly used for the treatment of
      venous leg ulcers. Apligraf is considered a medical device by the FDA, and was cleared for
      the treatment of venous leg ulcers in 1998. It is a staple for the treatment of venous leg
      ulcers, and is widely used throughout the United States. It is composed of a type 1 collagen
      matrix in which human foreskin-derived neonatal fibroblasts are grown, and over which human
      foreskin-derived neonatal keratinocytes are then cultured and allowed to stratify.

      TheraSkin is composed of a split thickness skin graft harvested within 24 hours post-mortem,
      from an organ donor who has cleared the standard safety screenings. It is classified by the
      FDA as a donated tissue. Once harvested, the graft is sanitized according to FDA
      specifications, and cryopreserved, until it is delivered to the clinic for application to the
      foot ulcer. It is also a widely used treatment for diabetic foot ulcers.

      TREATMENT RATIONALE FOR THIS STUDY Chronic wounds of the lower extremities affect a
      substantial proportion of the population. Venous leg ulcers (VLU) account for 40-70% of lower
      extremity wounds. The standard of care for treatment of VLU's in wound centers in the United
      States is compression therapy combined with application of biologic graft materials to the
      wound bed.

      This study may assist physicians who treat VLU's by comparing efficacy and costs of two
      commonly used biologic graft materials for VLU's in a randomized prospective study. In
      addition to standard compression therapy, this investigation will be a head-to-head study
      comparing widely used bio-engineered skin substitute (Apligraf) to cryopreserved, human skin
      allograft (Theraskin). There is no randomized, prospective data comparing these two graft
      options in the treatment of VLU's.

      The products to be considered will be Apligraf, which is a bioengineered skin substitute, and
      TheraSkin, which is a cryopreserved split-thickness human skin allograft. This is a
      head-to-head designed study to observe the performance of each product and compare the
      results so that the clinician can readily see advantages in healing times, infection rates,
      and costs associated with each product. The study sponsors are Soluble Systems and Life Net
      Health.

      The Study will have three phases:

      The first phase will consist of a series of screening assessments designed to determine
      eligibility. The prospective patients must meet inclusion and exclusion criteria. They will
      be randomly assigned to one of the two cohorts in equal numbers.

      In the second phase, the study treatment will be administered and the patient will be
      followed until the study ulcer has completely healed (i.e., 100% closure as determined by the
      Investigator, for up to 12 weeks. During the Treatment Phase subjects will be evaluated on a
      weekly basis. Efficacy evaluations each week will include Investigator assessment of wound
      closure and evaluations of ulcer size.

      During the third phase, which will immediately follow the initial 12 weeks of the second
      phase, all patients remaining with non-healed study wounds will be treated and followed
      through an additional 8 weeks of treatment.

      Safety Assessments throughout the study will include assessment of adverse events and
      measurement of clinical laboratory parameters.

      STUDY ENROLLMENT This study will initially include 100 subjects, enrolled randomly into two
      groups, to be treated with either Apligraf or TheraSkin. The sample size was determined with
      a power calculation based on the anticipated difference in healing rate between Apligraf and
      TheraSkin. The following parameters were used to calculate the sample size. The literature on
      these two products predicts a closure rate of 68% with TheraSkin, and 47% for Apligraf within
      12 weeks.

      Assuming a 68% closure rate with TheraSkin, and a 47% closure rate, with a desired alpha
      value of p&lt;0.05 and a power of 80%, 64 subjects would be needed. However, if a difference in
      closure rate is assumed to be only 10%, with a closure rate of 68% with TheraSkin and 47%
      with Apligraf, the power calculation predicts that 142 subjects would be needed. A compromise
      difference of 13% was used to predict that 84 subjects would be needed. If we assume a 20%
      dropout rate due to lack of compliance or adverse events, we will need to enroll a total of
      100 subjects.

        be excluded from enrollment and subsequent randomization.

          1. Subject has suspected gangrene or wound infection on any part of the affected limb.
             (Subjects with wound infection at the screening visit may be treated and re-screened
             for participation in the study after eradication of the infection).

          2. Subject has a history of hypersensitivity to bovine collage and agarose shipping media
             as listed in the Apligraf directions for use.

             agents listed in the TheraSkin Instructions for Use.

          4. Subject was previously treated under this clinical study protocol.

          5. Subject has participated in another clinical trial involving a device or a
