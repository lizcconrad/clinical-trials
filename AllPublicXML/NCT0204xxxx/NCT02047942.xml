  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cardiovascular diseases are the main cause of death worldwide. Aerobic fitness is related to
      long-term survival and a reduction in mortality and recurrent nonfatal myocardial infarction
      in subjects with cardiovascular disease. However, the majority of cardiac patients do not
      engage in enough physical activity to obtain benefits or in the long-term struggle to
      maintain a physically active lifestyle. There is a need for innovative rehabilitation methods
      aiming at increasing longer-term adherence and hence more sustained effects on health related
      physical fitness. One strategy might be the use of home-based training in combination of
      telemonitoring guidance. Therefore, the main objective of this randomized controlled clinical
      trial is to compare the longer-term (=1 year) effects of a 3-month supervised center-based
      rehabilitation program with a patient-tailored home-based cardiac rehabilitation program with
      telemonitoring guidance in CAD patients (phase III). The primary outcome measure is physical
      fitness. It is hypothesized that patients randomized to a home-based training program with
      telemonitoring guidance will demonstrate higher levels of physical activity at one year of
      follow-up, resulting in higher levels of physical fitness, compared to patients who have been
      enrolled to the supervised center-based cardiac rehabilitation program or control group.
      Ninety patients will be randomized to Home-based training, a center-based cardiac
      rehabilitation program or an advice only group (= control group). Assessment will be
      performed at baseline, immediately at completion of the intervention and at one-year of
      follow-up and will include measurements of exercise tolerance, cardiovascular risk factors,
      physical activity, muscle strength, endothelial function, health-related quality.
