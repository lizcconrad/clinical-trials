  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a clinical research study of an investigational (FDA IND-BB 10091) treatment for
      patients with advanced colorectal cancer that no longer responds to standard therapies.

      The treatment is being evaluated for its effect on tumor growth. It consists of the placement
      (implantation) of small beads that contain mouse renal adenocarcinoma cells (RENCA
      macrobeads). The cells in the macrobeads produce substances that have been shown to slow or
      stop the growth of tumors in experimental animals and veterinary patients. It has been tested
      in 31 human subjects with different types of cancers in a Phase I safety trial. Phase II
      studies in patients with colorectal, pancreatic or prostate cancers are in progress

      This is a Phase IIb, multicenter, nonrandomized, open-label study with RENCA macrobeads in
      patients with treatment-resistant, metastatic colorectal carcinoma to determine the effect of
      RENCA macrobead implantation on overall survival compared with best supportive care.

      Two treatment groups will be enrolled in this study, as follows:

        -  Group A (n=40) - patients who will undergo up to 4 implantations of RENCA macrobeads, at
           an amount of 8 RENCA macrobeads /kg body weight

        -  Group B (n=80) - patients who will receive or are receiving best supportive care,
           defined as management of symptoms aimed at maintaining or improving quality of life, but
           not including approved therapies targeting the patient's malignancy
