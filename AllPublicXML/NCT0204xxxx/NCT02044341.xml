  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Children ages 2 months to less than 19 years old, who have been diagnosed with a middle ear
      infection may receive either medicated ear drops (AR01) or glycerin (placebo) ear drops. The
      patient or caregiver will measure the amount of ear pain before and after the ear drops to
      establish if the medicated ear drops decrease the amount of pain more than the placebo ear
      drops. The subject may leave the clinic 60 minutes after the first dose. The ear drops can be
      used up to 4 days, as needed for ear pain.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study involves the initial clinic visit, using the ear drops at home and keeping a diary
      about the ear pain experienced and medications taken. The patient will return to the clinic 4
      days later for evaluation and to return the ear drops and diary. The clinic staff will call
      to follow-up about the patient's condition seven days after the initial visit.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects 2 mo. to &lt; 19 yrs of age, with signs and symptoms of AOM, with moderate to
             severe pain (current episode 2 wks duration). Moderate to severe pain is defined as a
             score of 5 (on a scale of 0 - 10) on the FAECC pain scale as evaluated by a trained
             clinical staff or 6 (on a scale of 0 - 10) on the FPS-R as evaluated by the subject.
             Moderate to severe pain criteria must be met at eligibility and the pre-dose pain
             assessment.

          -  Males or non-pregnant, non-lactating females.

          -  The subject's caregiver must have read and signed the written informed consent
             (including assent from subjects 18 yrs as applicable according to Investigational
             review board (IRB) guidelines) prior to study participation.

          -  Subjects 18 yrs old must have read and signed the written informed consent prior to
             study participation.

          -  Normally active and otherwise judged to be in good health on the basis of medical
             history and limited physical examination.

          -  Females of childbearing potential must have a urine pregnancy test at the
             randomization visit with negative results returned prior to randomization.

        Exclusion Criteria

          -  Perforated tympanic membrane, history of a perforated tympanic membrane in the last 6
             months, or if a perforated tympanic membrane could not be ruled out by speculum
             examination, impedance testing tympanometry, pneumatic otoscopy, or Valsalva maneuver.
             Subjects who are subsequently diagnosed with a perforated membrane during treatment
             are to be discontinued immediately. Subjects with tympanostomy tubes are not allowed.

          -  Acute or chronic otitis externa.

          -  Chronic otitis media (refers to current episode 2 wks).

          -  Seborrheic dermatitis involving the affected external ear canal or pinna.

          -  Any otic, topical, or systemic antibiotic received within 14 days prior to study entry
             (topical or systemic antibiotics for acne will be allowed on a chronic basis for
             subjects who have been on a stable dose for at least 14 days prior to entry).

          -  Any topical drying agent or over-the-counter therapy for otitis media received within
             36 hrs prior to enrollment.

          -  Known hypersensitivity to drug or similar compounds including any of the inactive
             ingredients.

          -  Subjects receiving medication on a chronic basis for pain (including steroidal or
             non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs) who have not been on a stable dose for at least
             1 month prior to entry into the study.

          -  Clinically significant mental illness that may interfere with the conduct of the study
             (determined by Investigator).

          -  Exposure to any investigational agent within 30 days prior to study entry.

          -  Previous enrollment in this study.

          -  Subject/caregiver has a condition the Investigator believes would interfere with the
             ability to provide consent or assent (age-appropriate) or comply with study
             instructions, or that might confound the interpretation of the study results, or put
             the subject at undue risk.

          -  Subject has a glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency or is taking concomitant
             medications associated with methemoglobinemia (such as nitrates or nitrites; aniline
             dyes; or medications, including lidocaine, prilocaine, phenazopyridine hydrochloride
             [Pyridium], and others).

          -  Subject shows clinical signs of anemia. The absolute amount of deoxygenated or
             abnormal hemoglobin (rather than its percentage) is required for cyanosis to be
             clinically evident. Subjects with moderate-to-severe anemia may not appear cyanotic,
             even with elevated percentages of deoxygenated or abnormal hemoglobins.

          -  Subject has congenital (i.e., hereditary) methemoglobinemia.

          -  Subject has a recent history of acute gastroenteritis within 14 days prior to study
             entry.

          -  Subject exhibits clinical signs of methemoglobinemia, such as unexplained bluish
             coloring of skin, fatigue, shortness of breath, failure to thrive, and headache.

          -  Subjects 5 to &lt;19 yrs old who are unable to satisfactorily complete FPS-R screening
             test.
