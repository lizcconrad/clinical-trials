      SUMMARY Rationale: Fifty-six percent of patients with Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA) are
      position dependent, defined as having an AHI, which is at least twice as high in supine
      sleeping position compared to the AHI during sleep in other positions. Standard therapy for
      patients having mild or moderate POSA is treatment with an Oral Appliance Trainer (OAT).
      Recently a new device Sleep Position Trainer (SPT) is been introduced especially for patients
      with POSA.

      Objective: To compare the effect of positional therapy with the SPT versus OAT on
      polysomnographic (PSG) parameters, to evaluate the compliance and measuring the possible
      learning effect that might occur with POSA patients using the SPT for positional therapy over
      a long term.

      Study design: Randomised controlled trial Study population: The participants of the research
      will be recruited from the departments of Otolaryngology and Clinical Neurophysiology, Saint
      Lucas Andreas Hospital, Amsterdam, the Netherlands.

      Participants will be males or females older than 18 years with diagnosis of positional OSA.

      Intervention: The SPT is a sensor positioned in an elastic band attached around the body. The
      SPT measures the body position and vibrates when the patient lies in supine position. Oral
      appliance therapy (OAT) is an intra-oral prosthesis, which holds the mandible in a protrusive
      position. Because of this position more pharyngeal space will be available and the AHI will
      decrease. After randomisation the first group (n=45) will sleep for a period of 90 +/- 2 days
      with the SPT every night. The second group (n=45) will also sleep for a period of 90 +/- 2
      days only with OAT. After this period the PSG is repeated. Long- term outcome in AHI is
      measured by repeating the PSG after 1 year. Main study parameters/ endpoints: Primary
      endpoints; reduction of PSG parameters, in particular AHI, AI, HI, DI, reduction of % of
      sleeping supine sleep position, without disturbance of the sleep quality.

      Secondary endpoints: Outcome of Quality of Life questionnaires; EQ-5D, ESS, FOSQ and MFIQ.

      Compliance and learning effect will also be evaluated for the time period of 3 and 12 months.
      Finally cardiovascular parameters like blood pressure, pulse rate and BMI/neck circumference
      will be assessed.

      Nature and extent of the burden and risks associated with participation, benefit and group
      relatedness: The risks for patients participating in this study are negligible.
      Inconveniences of the SPT can be discomfort caused by irritation of the band, difficulties
      with an increased sleeping period on the side or difficulties sleeping with the SPT. This can
      be compensated by the expected improvement of sleep quality caused by the therapy. Possible
      side effects of OAT may be discomfort in the jaw, sensitivity of the teeth and a dry mouth.
      Withdrawing from this therapy means immediate relief of inconveniences.
