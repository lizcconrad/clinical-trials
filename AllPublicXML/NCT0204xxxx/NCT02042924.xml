    <textblock>
      This is a pilot sub-study of patients receiving myeloablative transplant using total body
      irradiation (TBI) or total marrow irradiation (TMI) in their preparative regimen. The
      objective of this stub-study is to estimate the heterogeneity in cellular proliferation
      (FLT-PET uptake) as well the heterogeneity in marrow composition distribution (measured using
      whole body water-fat MRI) using positron emission tomography imaging. This will be used to
      design future trials as well as to determine the feasibility of PET and MRI imaging.

               -  Relapsed, including relapse after hematopoietic cell transplant

               -  Planned hematopoietic cell transplant (if enrolling at &quot;close&quot;) or within 100
                  days post hematopoietic cell transplant (if enrolling post-transplant) with a
                  preparative regimen that includes either total marrow irradiation (TMI) or total
                  body irradiation (TBI)

             determined by a serum creatinine level performed as a part of standard of care within
             7 days of imaging

          -  Able and willing to provide written consent

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Otherwise eligible patients meeting one or more of the contraindicates for an MRI, may
