  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This project applies a randomized community design to test the effectiveness of health center
      level co-packaging and counseling messages to improve provider and caregiver behavior in the
      treatment of diarrhea with zinc &amp; oral rehydration salts (ORS) and treatment of pneumonia
      with zinc &amp; antibiotics in children aged 2-59 mo old. We will evaluate the adherence of
      caregivers in 10 health posts in 5 municipalities randomly assigned to receive the health
      center level co-packaging and counseling messages in addition to current standard care, by
      comparing them with the caregivers in 10 health posts in 5 municipalities randomly assigned
      to the receive only the current standard of care. Cost-effectiveness of co-packaging at the
      health-center level, as a means of improving provider treatment and counseling practices and
      caregiver adherence, will be evaluated.

      The main objective is to establish the effectiveness of a facility level co-packaging and
      counseling messages for increasing the adherence by caregivers of children aged 2-59 mo old
      to the prescribed 10 day treatment with zinc to complement ORS for the treatment of diarrhea
      and zinc to complement the antibiotics for the treatment of pneumonia diagnosed and treated
      in public health posts.

      Specific Quantitative Objectives:

      • To determine if visible co-packaging with pre-tested counseling messages:

        -  Improves adherence of caregivers of children towards the prescribed zinc treatment.

        -  Improves knowledge, awareness or attitudes of caregivers of children and health
           providers at public health care centers towards the prescribed zinc treatment.

        -  Results in overall increase in health care-seeking for the treatment of diarrhea and
           pneumonia at public health care centers.

      Specific Qualitative Objectives:

        -  To establish the perception, attitudes and experiences of caregivers towards the visible
           co-packaging with pre-tested counseling messages to promote the prescribed zinc
           treatment.

        -  To establish the perception, attitudes and experiences of health providers at public
           health care centers towards the visible co-packaging with pre-tested counseling messages
           to promote the prescribed zinc treatment.

        -  To establish the perception, attitudes and experiences of children aged 4 to 5 years old
           towards the visible co-packaging with pre-tested counseling messages to promote the
           prescribed zinc treatment.

    <description>Current standard care at public health center ( zinc ORS for treatment of diarrhea and antibiotics for treatment of of pneumonia).
The intervention consists of health center level co-packaging and visual counseling messages (zinc &amp; ORS packaged at health center for diarrhea, and zinc &amp; antibiotics co-packaged at health center for pneumonia) Co-packaging is done in a plastic bag, which is covered with pre-tested zinc treatment messages - a distinct packaging has been designed for diarrhea and for pneumonia</description>

    <description>The intervention involves co-packaging in 2 distinct packages: 1) for diarrhea treatment to package zinc &amp; ORS for the treatment of diarrhea using a plastic bag with printed messages that were pre-tested in formative research; and 2) for pneumonia treatment to co-package zinc &amp; antibiotics in a plastic bag with printed messages that were pre-tested in a formative research phase. Pre-tested zinc treatment messages will be on posters displayed in the intervention health centers. Orientation will be provided to health facility staff in control and intervention areas.</description>
