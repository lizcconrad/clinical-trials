      Colorectal cancer patients with metastases (mCRC) at response under first-line chemotherapy
      are candidates for an convenient maintenance treatment.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Colorectal cancer is one of the most common malignant tumors, with the morbidity of
      approximate 100 million cases per year. About 40% of patients present with metastatic (stage
      IV) colorectal cancer at the time of diagnosis, and about 25% of patients with local lesion
      will ultimately develop metastatic disease.Therefore, our study is designed to investigate
      that colorectal cancer patients with metastases (mCRC) at response under first-line
      chemotherapy are candidates for an convenient maintenance treatment.
