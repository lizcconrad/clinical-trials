             for AS within 12 weeks prior to randomization (any biological immunomodulating agents
             are excluded)

          4. Usage of any investigational drug within 30 days prior to randomization or the planned
             use of an investigational drug during the course of the actual study

             criteria:

               -  Have signs or symptoms suggestive of current active or latent TB upon medical
                  history, physical examination and/or a chest radiograph (both posterior-anterior
                  and lateral views, taken within 3 months prior to the first administration of
                  study drug and read by a qualified radiologist)

               -  Have history of latent or active TB prior to screening, except for patients who

                  months prior to the first administration of study agent

               -  Have positive QuantiFERON-TB Gold In-Tube test within 2 months prior to or during
                  screening, in which active TB has not been ruled out, except for patients with
                  history of latent TB and documentation of having completed an adequate treatment
                  regimen at least 6 months prior to the first administration of study agent

         11. Any documented active or suspected malignancy or history of malignancy within 5 years

             in situ carcinoma of uterine cervix

         12. Evidence of current or previous clinically significant disease, medical condition
             other than AS, finding of the medical examination (including vital signs and ECG), or
             laboratory value at the screening visit outside the reference range that is of
             clinical relevance, that in the opinion of the Investigator, would compromise the
             safety of the patient or the quality of the data. This criterion provides an
             opportunity for the investigator to exclude patients based on clinical judgment, even
             if other eligibility criteria are satisfied.

         13. History of allergy/hypersensitivity to a systemically administered biologic agent or
             its excipients
