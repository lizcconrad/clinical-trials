    <textblock>
      In this study, the aim is to compare the efficacy of Periarticular multimodal drug
      injection(group PI) and Fascia Iliaca Compartment Block ( group FI)for total knee
      arthroplasty.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Total knee arthroplasty is very painful surgical intervention.Patients were assigned to 2
      groups to receive either periarticular multimodal drug injection or fascia iliaca compartment
      block for postoperative pain.
