      Prospective nonrandomized phase I study

      The purpose of this study is to determine safety and efficacy of zileuton when added to
      dasatinib in patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The standard treatment for chronic myelogenous leukemia is therapy with tyrosine kinase
      inhibitors (TKIs). This treatment can diminish the amount of disease to very low levels that
      only very sensitive and specialized techniques can measure; it does not, however, provide a
      cure.

      Dr. Shaoguang Li and colleagues at University of Massachusetts have published a unique
      discovery that the arachidonate 5-lipoxygenase (5-LO) gene (Alox5) is a critical regulator
      for LSCs in BCR-ABL-induced CML (Chen Y et al. Loss of the Alox5 gene impairs leukemia stem
      cells and prevents chronic myeloid leukemia. Nature Genetics 41:783-792, 2009). In the
      absence of Alox5, BCR-ABL failed to induce CML in preclinical studies. While deficiency in
      Alox5 had no effect on normal hematopoiesis, impairment of the LSCs function through
      differentiation and cell division of CML LSCs was observed. This defect led to a depletion of
      LSCs and a failure of CML development. Treatment with a 5-LO inhibitor (zileuton) also
      impaired the function of LSCs and prolonged survival. These results demonstrate that a
      specific target gene can be found in cancer stem cells and its inhibition can completely
      inhibit the function of these stem cells. These findings provide an exciting opportunity to
      develop the first anti-cancer stem cell therapy for treating CML.

      Patients who did not respond or did not tolerate two TKIs will be considered for this study.
