  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To determine the safety of using kidney organ from hepatitis B surface antigen positive
      donor, the author conducted the single-center, prospective study of the use of these kidneys
      for recipients who have protective level of hepatitis B surface antibodies.

      The kidney transplant registry was conducted in KCMH since the year of 2000 until the
      present.

      The inclusion criterion was:

        -  All kidney allograft recipients who received at least one month after transplantation.

        -  All kidney recipients who already had the protective antibody against hepatitis B virus
           infection defined by anti-HBs titer above 100 mIU/mL at pre-transplantation period.

      The exclusion criterion was:

        -  The recipients with positive hepatitis C virus antibody.

        -  The recipients who had received a previous or simultaneous non-kidney solid organ
           transplant.

        -  The recipients those lost to follow-up.

      Study group:

        -  The recipients who received kidney allograft from the HBsAg(+) donor.

      Control group:

        -  The recipients who received kidney allograft from the HBsAg(-) donor.

      According to the Thai Red Cross National Organ Donation and our institute's policy, the
      HBsAg(+) kidney allografts were distributed to only and informed consent.

      Data collection:

        -  Baseline characteristic data e.g. donor and recipient age, donor and recipient gender,
           HLA, PRA, anti-HBs titer, immunity against HBV status (both natural and
           vaccinated),immunosuppressive regimens were collected.

        -  The recipients were prospective followed up at month 3, 6, 9, 12, 18, 24, 36, 48, 60,
           72, 84, 96, 108, 120.

        -  Clinical data including jaundice, hepatitis, graft rejection were collected

        -  Laboratory data of HBsAg, anti-HBc, HBV DNA, SGOT, SGOT, eGFR were collected.

        -  Pathological data of allograft biopsy at month 12 and 24 were retrieved.

      Outcomes:

        -  Primary outcome: hepatitis B transmission rate.

        -  Secondary outcome: graft survival, patient survival.
