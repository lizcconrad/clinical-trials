    <textblock>
      Probiotics have been proposed for the treatment of dyslipidemia. the investigators aimed to
      evaluate efficacy, tolerability and safety of a new symbiotic formulation containing a
      combination of probiotic and prebiotics and amine in the treatment of children affected by
      familial hypercholesterolemia (FH).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      FH subjects, aged 6-12 years, consecutively observed a Tertiary Center for Pediatric
      Nutrition were randomly allocated to two groups of intervention for 6 months: active group,
      received a low saturated fats diet plus the symbiotic (2.5×109cfu, bid) for 6 months; control
      group, received low saturated fats diet alone. All children received written indications for
      low saturated fats diet. The plasmatic lipid profile was assessed by peripheral blood
      sampling at T0 and T1.
