      The purpose of this multi-center pilot study is to determine if the drug tocilizumab
      (Actemra) is effective in the treatment of patients with refractory adult polymyositis (PM)
      and dermatomyositis (DM).

    <textblock>
      Although there are several studies supporting the efficacy of tocilizumab (TCZ) in Rheumatoid
      Arthritis (RA) and systemic onset juvenile idiopathic arthritis, it's use in other autoimmune
      disorders has also been propose. A consensus statement on blocking the effects of IL-6 in RA
      and other autoimmune conditions has been recently published. IL-6 is involved in the growth
      and differentiation of many inflammatory cells. In addition to its initial role in triggering
      B-cell stimulating factor, it also induces T cell growth and differentiation and plays a
      critical role in both adaptive and innate immune responses. IL-6, produced by many cells
      including T cells, B cells, monocytes and endothelial cells, binds to its receptor (IL-6R)
      and subsequently triggers several intracellular pathways leading to the release of
      inflammatory mediators and stimulation of the immune system. Inhibition of IL-6 has been
      studied in phase II and III clinical trials of RA. It has led to a decrease in acute phase
      reactants and other indicators of chronic inflammation. IL-6 is also a potential therapeutic
      target in systemic sclerosis, and since IL-6 induces differentiation of B cells into antibody
      forming cells and contributes to T cells transforming into effector cells, its use in
      Systemic Lupus erythematosus (SLE) has also been suggested.

      The use of TCZ in myositis proposed in this protocol is supported by the aforementioned
      rationale and its efficacy in other rheumatologic disorders. Patients with refractory
      polymyositis (PM) were treated with tocilizumab and responded favorably. In dermatomyositis,
      tissue inflammation implicates soluble cytokine networks contributing to disease
      pathogenesis. Work on a mouse model of myositis noted IL-6 as a mediator of muscle
      inflammation. Other investigators studying peripheral blood samples and clinical data on both
      adult and juvenile dermatomyositis (DM) noted that serum levels of IL-6 were significantly
      correlated with disease activity. In this same study, correlations between serum IL-6 levels
      and both the type I interferon gene and chemokine signatures were also identified in DM.
      These authors suggest that the coordinated dysregulation of IL-6 production and Type I
      interferon signaling implicates these pathways as contributing to disease pathogenesis in DM.

      In a mouse model of PM, C protein-induced myositis (CIM), the pathology reportedly mimics
      that seen in human PM. Mice were treated with anti-IL-6 receptor monoclonal antibodies or
      control antibodies and muscle tissue was histologically and immunohistochemically analyzed.
      CIM was ameliorated in this mouse model implicating IL-6 in the development of myositis.
      These results not only identified this model as useful to understanding PM but they suggest
      that IL-6 blockade be considered as a new therapeutic approach in the treatment of myositis.

      Thus, the collective findings described above provide evidence for the involvement of IL-6 in
      the pathogenesis of both adult PM and DM as well as supporting its role from animal models
      and human studies.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

        Patients will be included in the trial based on the following criteria:

          1. Definite or probable PM or DM by the criteria of Bohan and Peter (as modified by
             IMACS) in adults over the age of 18. We will also allow enrollment of JDM patients
             (considered to have DM) over the age of 18 who otherwise meet the inclusion criteria
             stipulated below.

          2. Subjects must either have the classic rash(es) of DM (heliotrope, Gottron sign or
             Gottron papules), possess one of the myositis-associated autoantibodies (e.g.
             anti-synthetase, anti-SRP, anti-Mi-2, anti-PM-Scl, anti TIF1-γ etc.), or have the
             diagnosis of PM agreed upon by a 3-member Adjudication Committee consisting of a
             rheumatologist, neurologist and neuromuscular pathologist.

          3. Refractory myositis patients are defined (see Section 3.1.1) as having failed (or
             considered intolerant to) an adequate course of glucocorticoids or having failed
             glucocorticoids and at least one other immunosuppressive (IS) or immunomodulatory
             agent (e.g. methotrexate, azathioprine, cyclosporine, tacrolimus, mycophenolate
             mofetil, cyclophosphamide, IVIg, anti-TNF agents, and rituximab).

          4. Subjects with an MMT-8 score ≤ 66 (see Appendix B) must also have at least 2 other
             core set measures meeting the criteria listed below.

          5. Subjects with an MMT-8 score &gt; 66 must have at least 3 other core set measures meeting
             the criteria listed below and a global extramuscular VAS score on the MDAAT ≥ 5cm on a
             10cm scale.

          6. Criteria for core set measures for study entry:

               1. Patient global VAS with a minimum value of 2.0cm on a 10cm scale.

               2. MD global VAS with a minimum value of 2.0cm on a 10cm scale.

               3. HAQ disability index with a minimum value of 0.25

               4. Elevation of at least one of the muscle enzymes (CK, AST, ALT, aldolase, LDH) at
                  a minimum level of 1.3x the ULN.

               5. Global extramuscular disease activity score with a minimum value of 1.0cm on a
                  10cm VAS scale on the Myositis Disease Activity Assessment Tool (MDAAT).

          7. If on prednisone, the dose must be stable for 4 weeks prior to the screening visit.
             Tapering of the prednisone dose will only be allowed after the subject meets the DOI
             or if safety/toxicity issues supervene.

               1. Prednisone Tapering: Prednisone should be held constant without tapering or
                  escalation (unless there is a serious adverse event or disease flare) until the
                  subject has achieved the DOI. Then, tapering of prednisone may commence using a
                  schedule approximating a 20-25% taper of the existing dose every 4 weeks based on
                  the clinical judgment of the clinical site investigator. Prednisone tapering
                  using the aforementioned guidelines can be commenced at any time if: (a) the
                  patient achieves the DOI or (b) there are complications or circumstances that, in
                  the clinical site investigator's opinion, necessitate the tapering of
                  corticosteroids.

               2. Prednisone at Entry: It is also recommended that patients be on less than
                  1mg/kg/day of prednisone at study entry.

               3. Prednisone Dosing During Flare: If in the clinical site investigator's opinion
                  there are complications or worsening of disease that necessitate an increase in
                  the prednisone dose then the smallest reasonable increase should be considered.

          8. If an IS agent was discontinued prior to the screening visit there may be a washout as
             stipulated below or individualized according to the patients treating physician:

               1. 4 week washout for methotrexate

               2. 8 week washout for any other IS agent (e.g. azathioprine, cyclosporine,
                  tacrolimus, mycophenolate mofetil)

               3. 3 month washout for leflunomide, IVIg or cyclophosphamide

               4. 6 month washout for rituximab

               5. 8 week washout for infliximab or adalimumab

               6. 2 week washout for etanercept

               7. 1 week washout for anakinra

          9. If an IS agent is continued, the dose must remain stable for 4 weeks prior to
             enrollment and at least until the DOI is met or if safety/toxicity issues supervene.
             Concomitant IS medications permitted include methotrexate, azathioprine, cyclosporine,
             mycophenolate mofetil, and tacrolimus. IVIg will also be allowed as an
             immunomodulatory agent. Careful patient safety monitoring along with ACR guidelines
             for monitoring these medications will be employed if those toxicity monitoring
             laboratory studies are not already being assessed as part of this trial. No
             concomitant biologic agents are allowed (rituximab, anti-TNFs, abatacept) as well as
             cyclophosphamide or tofacitinib as concomitant immunosuppressive agents. Investigators
             will be certain to assess and classify adverse events as being secondary to either
             study drug as well as any concomitant immunosuppressive agent(s). That is, there
             should be attribution of the AE to the appropriate agent.

         10. Normal organ function, except if abnormal due to the disease under investigation

         11. Men and women of reproductive potential must agree to use an acceptable method of
             birth control during treatment and for twelve months after completion of treatment.

         12. Subject has provided written informed consent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        A patient will be excluded if any of the following criteria are met:

          1. Subjects under the age of 18.
