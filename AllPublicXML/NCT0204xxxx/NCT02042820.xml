  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In vivo confocal microscopy (IVCM) is a sensitive imaging tool for detecting dry
      eye-associated subclinical inflammation. Studies have previously shown that IVCM provides an
      in vivo metric to measure inflammatory changes in the central cornea. The objective of the
      current study is to assess inflammatory response changes in the peripheral cornea and the
      conjunctiva by analyzing epithelial immune cell density and morphology in these areas and
      then correlating the IVCM findings to clinical signs and symptoms to establish novel
      objective imaging biomarkers.
