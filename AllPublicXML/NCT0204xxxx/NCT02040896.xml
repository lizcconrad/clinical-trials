    <textblock>
      The primary objectives are:

        1. To investigate which healthcare workers and other individuals contribute to the decision
           to order computed tomography (CT) scans for emergency department (ED) patients.

        2. To investigate the specific reasons healthcare workers and other individuals order or
           request CT scans for ED patients.

        3. To determine the frequency of clinically important actions following CT scan results.

      Once the drivers of ED CT utilization are identified, interventions including education,
      incentives for compliance with evidence-based best practices, and interventions for
      noncompliance could be targeted appropriately.

    <description>Results will be categorized by body region of CT and patient age. For each CT region and age category, the percentage of CT scans requested by each demographic group (e.g., patient, emergency physician, etc.), will be reported, with 95% confidence intervals.
CTs not requested by emergency physicians, the percentage of each type of scan requested by each demographic group will be reported, with 95% confidence intervals.</description>

    <measure>Abnormal vs. normal CT scans</measure>
    <time_frame>January 2014 - January 2015</time_frame>
    <description>The frequency of abnormal CT results and clinical interventions will be calculated, for CTs requested by emergency physicians and for those not requested by emergency physicians (this includes all other parties).</description>
