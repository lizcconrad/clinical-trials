  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study proposes to compare two forms of treatment for Hoarding Disorder (HD), a common
      and impairing neuropsychiatric syndrome that has a profound impact on the lives and
      functioning of individuals, families, and society. Specifically, we will compare a novel
      community-based group treatment led by individuals from the community who are not mental
      health professionals to the current standard of care treatment for Hoarding Disorder,
      cognitive behavioral therapy, conducted by psychologists in a group setting. We hypothesized
      that both treatment types will be similarly effective in reducing hoarding severity.

      The study design for this proposal is a stratified, randomized, single-blind, non-
      inferiority trial comparing the current standard of care for treatment of Hoarding Disorder
      (HD), Group Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (G-CBT), to an innovative and promising
      community-based treatment, Group Buried in Treasures (G-BiT). Participants will be stratified
      by gender, psychiatric status (high vs. low burden of psychiatric symptoms) and insurance
      status (insured vs. under- or un-insured) so that equal numbers of individuals with each of
      these characteristics are randomized to each treatment arm. They will then be randomly
      assigned (randomized) to either G-CBT or G-BiT. Participants will know which treatment group
      they are assigned to, but those members of the research team who are conducting clinical or
      neuropsychological assessments or analyzing the data will not; they will be blinded to
      participant group assignment, and group leaders will be blinded to the psychiatric status,
      neurocognitive status, insurance status, etc, of participants. The study is a non-inferiority
      trial, that is, the hypothesis to be tested is that G-BiT is as effective, or no less
      effective, than G-CBT. We chose a non-inferiority design because we have no reason to believe
      G-BiT is better than G-CBT and our preliminary data, as well as outcomes previously reported
      for G- CBT and G-BiT, suggest that these treatments may have similar efficacies.

    <description>Group therapy over approximately 20 weeks, based on a structured manual adapted from the individual CBT workbook for hoarding by Steketee and Frost (2006). Each session will be 2 hours in length and consists of weekly check-ins, psychoeducation about hoarding, developing understanding and awareness of one's hoarding symptoms and patterns, behavior modification, cognitive restructuring, goal-setting, motivational enhancement, in vivo and imaginal exposure for discarding and acquisition, executive skills training (organization, sorting, planning, decision-making, problem-solving, etc.), guidelines on establishing &quot;clutter buddies&quot;, and relapse prevention. Groups will be led by clinical postdoctoral psychology fellows in the Department of Psychiatry at UCSF.</description>

    <description>Sixteen sessions of peer facilitated, group support, over the course of 20 weeks, based on a structured manualized approach (Buried in Treasures: Help for Compulsive Acquiring, Saving, and Hoarding). Each session will be 2 hours in length. In this model, two trained peers, usually, but not necessarily, with personal lived experience of hoarding, will guide the group chapter by chapter through the Buried in Treasures manual.</description>
