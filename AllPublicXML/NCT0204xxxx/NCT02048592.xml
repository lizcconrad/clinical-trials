  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objectives:

      To evaluate the effect of immunonutrition on the adult patient suffering from cystic fibrosis

        1. Safety of immunonutrition

        2. The effect of immunonutrition on parameters of oxidative stress

        3. The effect of immunonutrition on the inflammatory parameters

        4. The effect of immunonutrition on nutrition status

      Hypothesis

      The high oxidative stress is present in patients with cystic fibrosis. Immunonutrition has
      been shown to positively modulate oxidative stress in the different clinical setting however
      it has not yet been evaluated inpatients with cystic fibrosis who frequently need some
      support by means of enteral nutrition. We anticipate that the substitution of routine enteral
      nutrition by immunonutrition will result in improving of oxidative stress parameters.

      Method Crossover open study will take 16 weeks. The patients eligible for the study according
      to inclusion and exclusion criteria are going to be divided into 2 groups after signing the
      informed consent. In both groups their nutrition status, humoral and cellular immunity,
      respiratory system function and parameters of oxidative stress will be evaluated before
      entering the intervention.

      Afterwards the patients are going to be divided into one group who will receive nutrition
      support using immunonutrition for the next 8 weeks while the second one will continue with
      their nutrition support using routine sipping support with no immunonutrition. According to
      our hypothesis oxidative stress parameters will improve in the group of patients on
      immunonutrition comparing to the other group. Afterwards the patients will change their
      nutrition support for another 8 weeks. The patients who took immunonutrition in the first
      half of study will switch back to routine sipping support and contrary the patients who were
      in the first part of study on routine sipping will take immunonutrition. After the end of
      this period of study we expect the return of oxidative stress parameters to the baseline
      values in the group of patients who took immunonutrition in the first half of study but who
      were returned to routine nutrition support and contrary the improvement of oxidative stress
      parameters in the patients who started to take immunonutrition in the second half of study.

      The total energy support will be identical in both periods for each individual patient. After
      the first 8 weeks and after the completion of study the same examination are going to be
      evaluate as it was on the entrance to study.

      Statistical analysis: means, SD, t-test, chi square test, Mann Whitney test, linear
      correlation and multilinear analysis
