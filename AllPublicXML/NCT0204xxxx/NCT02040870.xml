  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A single-Arm, open-label, multi-center, phase I/II study in which the pharmacokinetics,
      safety, tolerability and efficacy of LDK378 will be assessed in adult Chinese patients with
      locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC harboring a confirmed ALK rearrangement. Patients must
      have demonstrated progression during or after crizotinib treatment whether or not previously
      treated with cytotoxic chemotherapy. Approximately 100 patients will be enrolled. For the
      first 15 patients enrolled in this study, patients will have an additional 5-day PK run-in
      period before treatment period. The pharmacokinetics profile of LDK378 in Chinese adult
      patients with ALK-rearranged NSCLC will be evaluated.

    <textblock>
      This is a phase I/II, open-label, multi-center study in which the PK, safety, tolerability
      and efficacy of LDK378 will be assessed in adult Chinese patients with locally advanced or
      metastatic NSCLC harboring a confirmed ALK rearrangement (positive) as assessed using the
      Vysis ALK Break Apart FISH Probe Kit (Abbott Molecular Inc.) or positive as assessed by
      immunohistochemistry (IHC) test (Ventana Medical Systems, Inc) using rabbit monoclonal
      primary antibody assay (D5F3).

      Patients must have demonstrated progression during or after crizotinib treatment whether or
      not previously treated with cytotoxic chemotherapy.

      Approximately 100 patients with locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC which carry ALK
      -rearrangement will be enrolled in the study. The first 15 patients to be enrolled in the
      study will have PK sampling over 120-hour during the 5-day PK run-in period following a
      single oral dose at 750 mg. After the PK run-in period, the treatment period will start in
      which LDK378 will be given starting on Cycle 1 Day 1 in a continuous daily oral dosing in
      28-day cycles. Separated from these 15 patients, the rest of the enrolled patients will
      receive LDK378 treatment at 750 mg QD on Cycle 1 Day 1.

      Tumor response will be evaluated every 8 weeks (i.e. every 2 cycles) starting from the first
      day of treatment with LDK378 until the time of RECIST-defined PD by investigator assessment,
      withdrawal of consent for further follow-up, loss to follow-up or death.
