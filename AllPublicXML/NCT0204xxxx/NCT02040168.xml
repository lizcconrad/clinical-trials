  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Mechanical ventilation is a common procedure used in pediatric intensive care units (ICU).
      Its use requires almost always the establishment of a sedation. Sedation is a generic term
      for all procedures, pharmacological or not, ensuring physical and psychological comfort and
      the safety of patient admitted in intensive care units.

      An inadequate sedation, insufficient or excessive, has common side effects, as increase of
      the duration of mechanical ventilation and of hospital-acquired infections (in particular,
      ventilator associated pneumonia), of hemodynamic disorders, of extubation failure or
      accidental extubation, of withdrawal syndrome, and of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).
      All these complications increase mechanical ventilation time and ICU length of stay. Several
      studies in adult's population have shown that the implementation of a sedation algorithm
      allowed to decrease the incidence of these complications.

      We hypothetized that the duration of mechanical ventilation would be reduced by a
      nurse-implemented sedative management protocol.

      1. During the first period (15 months), no protocol is used. This period consists to assess
           current analgesia-sedation procedure used in the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU),
           associated with the collection of medical and socio-demographical data about mechanical
           ventilation duration, sedation complications, PTSD development. The severity of
           pathology can be evaluated using PIM2 and POPC scores. The sedation deepness will be
           determined using COMFORT-B scale. Eight weeks after hospitalization, families will be
           phoned to assess children memories, anxious troubles, and PTSD symptoms for the patients
           of more than 18 months old.

        2. During the transition period (6 months), nurses and physicians develop the protocol and
           undergo training in its use.

      During the third period, a nurse-implemented sedation is used. The collected data are the
      same that the collected data during the first period
