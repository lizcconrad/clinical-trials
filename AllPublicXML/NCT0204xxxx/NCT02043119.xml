  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Currently, healthy mothers willing to breastfeed their babies are discharged from the
      hospital on an average 2 days after a vaginal delivery or 3.5 days after a C-section, at a
      time where breastfeeding is far to be well established. Following discharge, women can access
      breastfeeding support from Public Health Units, lactation consultants, health care providers,
      and Internet (e.g. from breastfeeding associations). Despite the current support, duration
      and exclusivity rates of breastfeeding drop precipitously in the first weeks and months after
      birth.

      We have obtained funding from the Ontario Ministry of Health and Long Term Care to evaluate
      the efficacy and cost effectiveness of a post-partum clinic based in the community. This
      clinic, staffed by a family physician (in the morning), a registered nurse and a lactation
      consultant, will provide breastfeeding support during the first month after delivery as well
      as ensure a safe transition from hospital to the community for mothers and newborn babies.
      The clinic, affiliated with TOH, will be found at Harmony Medical Centre, 152 Cleopatra
      Drive, located south-west of downtown, a 15 minute drive from the Civic campus and 20 minutes
      from the General campus. The Harmony Clinic has abundant parking (free on the street or a
      small fee inside the associated lot) and is fully accessible.

      In its initial phase, the future clinic would enroll only women willing to participate in a
      research program to evaluate this new program. The clinic will be opening in November 2013
      and currently (July - October 2013) we are conducting a pilot study to test feasibility of
      recruitment and test the surveys and database for this project. Women will be recruited at
      the Ottawa Hospital (General and Civic campus) and randomized to either receive standard-care
      or to be given access to the post-partum clinic and be discharged within approximately 24
      hours following a vaginal delivery or 48 hours following a C-section. They will have an
      appointment booked at the breastfeeding clinic within 48 hours after discharge for maternal
      and neonatal care as well as breastfeeding support. Enrolled women will have access to
      additional clinic visits for one month after delivery. Information will be collected from
      their medical chart as well as through surveys that will be sent to them at 15 days, 30 days
      and 3 months after delivery. We will compare the data and information on the experience of
      women who attended the breastfeeding clinic and those who did not attend the clinic. With
      this data we will be able to determine if this type of breastfeeding clinic is beneficial to
      new mothers and their newborn babies and if it really does increase the exclusive
      breastfeeding rate at 3 months (primary outcome).
