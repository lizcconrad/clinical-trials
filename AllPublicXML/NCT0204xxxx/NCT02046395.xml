  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to study the effect of blocking the renin angiotensin system on
      urinary free light chain excretion as compared to urine microalbumin creatinine ratio in
      subjects with type 2 diabetes. The long term goal is to assess urinary free-light chains as a
      biomarker of earlier detection of kidney function impairment in subjects with diabetes
      mellitus.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Free light chains (FLCs) are low-molecular-mass molecules (kappa and lambda light chains),
      which are by-products of normal immunoglobulin synthesis and are normally excreted through
      the kidneys. Presence of light chains in the urine is a marker of tubular dysfunction. In
      patients with impaired kidney function, serum concentrations and urinary excretion of
      polyclonal FLCs have been noted to be increased. Increased excretion of FLCs and other
      low-molecular weight proteins [cystatin C, NGAL] in the urine may contribute to progression
      of chronic kidney disease. Higher Cystatin C has been demonstrated to be related to
      development of albuminuria. Neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipcalin (NGAL) excretion in the
      urine is a marker of tubular injury in the kidney and has been shown to be elevated in
      subjects with type 1 and 2 diabetes mellitus (DM). Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors
      (Ace Inh) and angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARB) class of drugs are renoprotective in
      nature and are the first line therapy for treatment of diabetic nephropathy. There is no
      longitudinal data evaluating the effect of Ace Inh and ARB class of drugs on urinary FLCs
      (UFLCs).

      Our hypothesis is that UFLCs are increased in patients with DM with and without kidney
      disease and that treatment with Ace Inh and/or ARB will decrease UFLCs in these patients.
      Additionally, we will explore the change in other low molecular weight proteins [cystatin C,
      and NGAL] in response to treatment with Ace Inh and ARB.

    <description>In the washout period, the Ace Inh or ARB classes of medicine(s) that are part of the patient's antihypertensive regimen will be discontinued. The patient will be started on alternative therapy with medications that are approved by the Food and Drug Administration for treatment of high blood pressure (such as amlodipine, hydralazine, terazosin or Hydrochlorothiazide) for control of their blood pressure. The goal for their blood pressure will be set at &lt; 140/90 mm/Hg. The washout period will last for four weeks at the end of which the patient will enter the test period.</description>
