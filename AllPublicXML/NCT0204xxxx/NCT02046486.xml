      This is a single-center, prospective, randomized, single-blind, investigator initiated,
      pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic study of parallel design.Patients with ST elevation
      myocardial infarction (symptom onset&lt;12 hours), undergoing primary percutaneous coronary
      intervention, who are P2Y12 inhibitor naïve, will be randomized after informed consent,
      immediately after diagnostic coronary angiography, in a 1:1 ratio to either:

        -  Ticagrelor 180mg loading dose, in the form of 2 whole tablets administered per os in the
           supine position (standard administration)

        -  Ticagrelor 180mg loading dose, in the form of 2 tablets crushed and dispersed in
           purified water and administered per os with 1-minute-stay in a 60-70 degrees
           semi-upright sitting position Platelet reactivity assessment will be performed at
           randomization (Hour 0) and at 0.5, 1, 2, 4 and 6 hours after randomization, using the
           VerifyNow assay, in platelet reactivity units (PRU). The cutoff &gt;208 PRU will be used
           for definition of high platelet reactivity (HPR). All platelet reactivity assessments
           will be performed by a physician blind to the actual treatment given. Additional blood
           samples will be collected at the same time points for pharmacokinetic analysis. These
           samples will be collected in vacuum tubes with lithium heparin and will be kept in ice
           until centrifugation (3000 rpm at 4°C for 10 min, within 30 min of sampling). The
           resultant plasma will be transferred into a plain polypropylene tube (screw cap) and
           stored at or below -20°C until analysed.

      Preparation of Ticagrelor liquid formulation:

      Crushed and dispersed Ticagrelor 180mg for oral administration will be prepared as follows:
      two ticagrelor 90mg tablets are placed in a mortar and crushed for 60 s using a pestle. 20 mL
      of purified water will be added in the mortar and stirred for 60s. The liquid is transferred
      to a dosing cup and another 15 mL of purified water is added to the mortar and stirred,
      ensuring that all powder has been dispersed and none remained on the mortar and pestle. Again
      the liquid is transferred to the dosing cup. The same procedure is repeated with 15 ml of
      purified water.The total contents are stirred for another 30 s to ensure that all remaining
      tablet particles are dispersed.
