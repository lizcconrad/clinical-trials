      This phase I/II trial studies the side effects and best dose of mitoxantrone hydrochloride
      when given together with filgrastim, cladribine, and cytarabine and to see how well they work
      in treating patients with acute myeloid leukemia or high-risk myelodysplastic syndromes that
      is newly diagnosed, has returned, or does not respond to treatment. Drugs used in
      chemotherapy, such as filgrastim, cladribine, cytarabine, and mitoxantrone hydrochloride,
      work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells, by
      stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Estimate the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of dose-intensified mitoxantrone hydrochloride
      (mitoxantrone) as part of the filgrastim (G-CSF), cladribine, cytarabine, mitoxantrone
      hydrochloride (G-CLAM) regimen separately for adults with newly diagnosed acute myeloid
      leukemia (AML) and those with relapsed/refractory AML receiving first or greater salvage
      therapy.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine, within the limits of a phase 1/2 study, disease response and duration of
      remission separately for patients with newly diagnosed and relapsed/refractory AML.

      II. To describe, within the limits of a phase 1/2 study, the toxicity profile of the study
      regimen separately for patients with newly diagnosed and relapsed/refractory AML.

      OUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose-escalation study of mitoxantrone hydrochloride followed by
      phase II study.

      INDUCTION CHEMOTHERAPY (G-CLAM): Patients receive G-CLAM chemotherapy comprising filgrastim
      subcutaneously (SC) daily on days 0-5, mitoxantrone hydrochloride intravenously (IV) over 60
      minutes on days 1-3, cladribine IV over 2 hours daily on days 1-5, and cytarabine IV over 2
      hours daily on days 1-5. Patients achieving complete remission with incomplete peripheral
      blood count recovery (CRi), partial remission, or persistent disease may receive a second
      course of induction chemotherapy. Patients achieving complete remission (CR) or CR with
      incomplete platelet count recovery (CRp) may continue on to Consolidation Chemotherapy.

      CONSOLIDATION CHEMOTHERAPY (G-CLA): Beginning within 6 weeks of achieving CR/CRp/CRi,
      patients receive G-CLA comprising filgrastim SC on days 0-5, cladribine IV over 2 hours daily
      on days 1-5, and cytarabine IV over 2 hours daily on days 1-5. Treatment continues for up to
      4 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up periodically for up to 5 years.

             practice guidelines

          -  For patients with relapsed/refractory disease: patients with prior autologous or
             allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) for MDS/AML are eligible if

             stable use of immunosuppressive agents

          -  Treatment-related mortality (TRM) score =&lt; 6.9 as calculated with simplified model

          -  The use of hydroxyurea prior to study registration is allowed; patients with

          -  For patients with relapsed/refractory disease: patients may have previously received
             chemotherapy with a mitoxantrone- or cladribine-based regimen for MDS or AML; if that
             patient has received G-CLAM before and has been sensitive to this regimen, eligibility
             will be determined on a case-by-case basis by the study principal investigator (PI)

          -  Should be off any active systemic therapy for AML with the exception of hydroxyurea
             for at least 14 days prior to study registration unless patient has rapidly
             progressive disease, and all grade 2-4 non-hematologic toxicities should have resolved

          -  Bilirubin =&lt; 2.5 x institutional upper limit of normal (IULN) unless elevation is
             thought to be due to hepatic infiltration by AML, Gilbert's syndrome, or hemolysis
             (assessed within 14 days prior to study day 0)

          -  Serum creatinine =&lt; 2.0 mg/dL (assessed within 14 days prior to study day 0)

          -  Left ventricular ejection fraction &gt;= 45%, assessed within 3 months prior to study day
             0, e.g. by multi gated acquisition scan (MUGA) scan or echocardiography, or other
             appropriate diagnostic modality and no clinical evidence of congestive heart failure;
             if the patient had anthracycline-based therapy since the most recent cardiac
             assessment, cardiac evaluation should be repeated if there is clinical or radiographic
             suspicion of cardiac dysfunction, or if the previous cardiac assessment was abnormal

          -  Women of childbearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception

          -  Provide written informed consent

        Exclusion Criteria:

             considered candidate for tyrosine kinase inhibitor treatment

          -  Concomitant illness associated with a likely survival of &lt; 1 year

          -  Active systemic fungal, bacterial, viral, or other infection, unless disease is under
             treatment with anti-microbials and/or controlled or stable (e.g. if specific,
             effective therapy is not available/feasible or desired [e.g. chronic viral hepatitis,
             human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)]); patient needs to be clinically stable as defined
             as being afebrile and hemodynamically stable for 24 hours; patients with fever thought
             to be likely secondary to leukemia are eligible

          -  Known hypersensitivity to any study drug

          -  Pregnancy or lactation

          -  Treatment with any other investigational agent
