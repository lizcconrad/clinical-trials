    <description>Patients received additional education on basic facts about asthma, role of medications, the difference between long-term control medications and quick-relief medications, as well as patient skills in the first visit then reinforcement every two weeks.. The importance of proper inhaler technique, avoidance of asthma triggers and self-monitoring of asthma were also highlighted. Visual aids, physical demonstration as well as written information resources were supplied. Asthma care plans were tailored to patient needs and preferences. Patients were informed how to detect early signs of worsening asthma, when and how to seek medical care as appropriate.</description>

    <description>Patients received usual care delivered by physician without pharmacist intervention. Patients were prescribed asthma medication with summarized basic information on asthma and medication use. Follow-up visits were not planned on consistent basis, but rather individually according to the disease status. No asthma action plans were provided.</description>
