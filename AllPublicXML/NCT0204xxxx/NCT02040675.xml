  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to validate a novel method of diagnosing arrhythmias using the
      NAVA catheter-positioning screen in patients who have a NAVA catheter in place.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The population will be a convenience sample of adults with various arrhythmias who are
      scheduled to undergo an electrophysiology study and-or ablation (EPSA) under general
      anesthesia (GETA) at The Toledo Hospital.

      After the patient has been successfully intubated at the beginning of the procedure, a
      trained nurse, using standard technique for placement of a oro/nasogastric tube, will place
      an appropriately sized NAVA catheter in the patient. The lumen of the NAVA tube can be used
      as a conventional oro/nasogastric tube and the electrodes will be connected to the Servo-I
      ventilator. Although the Servo-I is a ventilator, it will be used only as a monitor for this
      study. The position of the nasogastric tube will then be refined using the catheter
      positioning screen as needed.

      During the course of the EPSA various arrhythmias may become evident. When these are noted,
      screen shots will be saved on the Servo-i monitor. Surface and electrogram recordings will be
      saved at the same time. The NAVA catheter will be disconnected from the Servo-I monitor
      during the ablation part of the procedure to prevent inadvertent damage to the monitor.
