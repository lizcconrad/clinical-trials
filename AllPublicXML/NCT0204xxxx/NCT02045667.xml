  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main objective of this study is to explore whether multiple trials with individual
      patients (N-of-1 trials) can produce a reliable evidence base for coverage decisions on
      clinical and cost-effectiveness of drug treatment for patients with rare diseases. As a case
      study, we will study the clinical and cost-effectiveness of Mexiletine in patients with
      Non-Dystrophic myotonia. The results of this analysis will be compared with the results
      obtained from a recently published international, multi-centre, randomized,
      placebo-controlled trial of Mexiletine in patients with Non-Dystrophic Myotonia
      (clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT00832000).

      The secondary objective of this proposal is to assess whether mexiletine improves myotonia
      measured (both quantitatively and qualitative) in patients with non-dystrophic myotonia.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Rationale: A current problem in the context of a coverage decision for the use of mexiletine
      for NDM patients is the lack of a sufficient evidence base. An innovative trial design could
      facilitate in establishing such an evidence base in a small group of rather heterogeneous
      patients. As more than 7000 rare diseases in Europe and the USA suffer from a similar lack of
      treatment evidence, more experience with this innovative trial design would be very helpful.

      Study design: A double-blind, randomized and placebo-controlled combined N-of-1- trial using
      a Bayesian statistical approach.

      Study population: Non-dystrophic myotonia (NDM) patients, at least 18 years old, with a
      genetically confirmed diagnosis.

      Intervention: Each N-of-1 trial consists out of a minimum of one, and a maximum of 4
      treatment sets, each comprising a 4-week period of active treatment (Mexiletine) and a 4-week
      period of treatment with placebo, in random order, with one week for wash-out in between.
      Within each mexiletine period, treatment dosage of mexiletine will be built up from 200 mg 1
      time a day PO on the first day of the first week, to 200 mg 2 times a day on the second day
      of the first week, to the desired dosage of 200 mg 3 times a day PO on the third day of the
      first week and throughout the remaining days of the 4-week treatment period. A similar
      build-up scheme will be used within each placebo period.

      Main study parameters/endpoints: The primary outcome measure for this study is a decrease in
      the most prominent clinical symptom: stiffness. Stiffness will be quantified by an
      Interactive Voice Response System (IVR) in which the patient will rate their mean daily IVR
      participant-assessed severity of stiffness on an ordinal scale (1-9). The secondary outcome
      measures will include changes in pain, weakness, and fatigue on IVR, Individual Neuromuscular
      Quality of Life (INQoL), the Short Form (36) Health Survey (SF-36) a patient-reported survey
      of patient health, blood plasma levels of mexiletine, clinical myotonia assessments,
      quantitative handgrip myotonia, biceps force test and needle-electromyography (EMG).

      Nature and extent of the burden and risks associated with participation, benefit and group
      relatedness: In the screening phase, electrocardiography (ECG) and EMG recordings, laboratory
      values and baseline blood plasma levels of mexiletine will be tested. Medical history and
      written consent will also be obtained in this phase. Patients will be asked to visit the
      department of Neurology between 4-16 visits (depending on number of treatment sets necessary
      to obtain enough evidence) during the study enrolment. Each visit will approximately cost 2
      hours; within each visit two questionnaires (INQoL, SF-36) need to be filled, blood plasma
      levels of mexiletine will be measured and clinical and electrophysiological myotonia tests
      need to be performed. Furthermore, an ECG and EMG will be recorded at the end of each
      treatment or placebo period. In addition, patients will have to call in to an interactive
      voice response system to report their mean daily IVR participant-assessed severity of
      stiffness once a week in every first and second week and daily in every third and fourth week
      of each treatment or placebo period.

    <measure>Change in Clinical myotonia bedside-tests (Seconds)</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 4 of each period - up to 44 weeks.</time_frame>
    <description>Eye closure myotonia. The participant will be instructed to close the eyes tightly for three seconds and then to open the eyes. Eye closure myotonia is present if there is difficulty fully opening the eyelids. This will be repeated for a total of 5 times. Each attempt will be timed.
Hand-grip myotonia. The participant will be instructed to forcefully close the fingers in a fist for three seconds and then rapidly open the fist and extend the fingers. Hand-grip myotonia is present if the fingers cannot be immediately extended. The time it takes (in seconds) for the fingers to be fully extended will be recorded. This will be repeated for a total of 5 times. Each attempt will be timed.

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Muscle relaxation times measured with quantitative grip myometry (Seconds)</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 4 of each period - up to 44 weeks.</time_frame>
    <description>Maximum Voluntary Isometric Contractions (MVIC's) of the long finger flexors and the subsequent relaxation time (myotonia) will be measured using a technique developed at the University of Rochester. To measure the extent of grip myotonia of resting forearm muscle, each participant will squeeze the grip handle with a maximum grip for 3 seconds then relax until the force returns to baseline. The time required for relaxation (the relaxation time (RT)) following this initial MVIC will be used to calculate the degree of myotonia. To determine if repeated muscle contractions shorten the time required for full muscle relaxation, eg., warm-up, a series of five MVICs will be made, each for three seconds duration followed by a ten second period of rest. The measurement of warm-up will be made by comparing relaxation time for the initial MVIC compared to the relaxation time following the final contraction in the series of five contractions used as warm-up exercise.</description>

    <measure>Change in Graded Myotonia by Needle Electromyography</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 4 of each period - up to 44 weeks.</time_frame>
    <description>Concentric needle EMG will be performed in the rectus femoris muscles. These muscle were chosen based on the data from the NDM natural history study as performed in Jeroen Trip his PhD-thesis, and will be consistent throughout this study. According to established criteria myotonic discharges will be defined and quantified: Myotonic discharges must be at least 500 msec and elicited in three areas of the muscle outside of the endplate zone. Grading of myotonic discharges: 1+: fulfills minimal requirements; 2+: myotonic discharges in more than ½ of needle locations; 3+: myotonic discharges with each needle movement in all examined areas.</description>

    <description>Mexiletine is a lidocaine-derivate and belongs to the class of 1B antiarrhythmic agents (Vaughan-Williams Classification of Antiarrhytmica). Class I antiarrhythmics have membrane-stabilizing properties. Drugs in this class work by interfering with the fast influx of sodium by inhibition of sodium ionchannels during the fast depolarization phase, thereby decreasing the maximal voltage and upshoot phase of the action potential.
Mexiletine study-medication will be purchased from Stabilimento Chimico Farmaceutico Militare, Firenze, Italy.</description>
