      There are no standard neodjuvant regimens adapted according to the different subtypes of
      breast cancer. This is a phase 2, randomized study to evaluate several regimens in different
      subtypes of breast cancer.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Breast cancer is a heterogenous disease with at least 4 intrinsic subtypes including Luminal
      A, Luminal B, HER2 enriched, Basal-like and normal breast like. Different subtypes have
      different prognosis and treatment sensitivity. Thus, it would be more suitable to administer
      different chemo-regimen in different subtypes. This is especially true in neoadjuvant
      chemotherapy setting where no standard regimen has ever been established. Therefore, we
      designed this phase 2 randomized clinical trial to explore potential effective regimens in
      variable subtypes of breast cancer in neoadjuvant treatment. Patients were first classified
      into Luminal type, Her2 positive type and triple-negative type by immunohistochemistry exam
      of ER/PR/HER2 in core needle biopsy and then randomized to received either dose dense
      paclitaxel in Luminal type or dose dense paclitaxel plus carboplatin with or without
      trastuzumab in HER2 positive type or dose dense paclitaxel plus carboplatin in
      triple-negative type.The control groups in each subtype all receive paclitaxel plus
      epirubicin every 3 weeks. The duration of treatment is 4-6 cycles. Primary endpoint is the
      pathological CR rate in each subtypes. Secondary endpoints include disease free survival,
      objective response rate, safety. Tissue samples and blood samples will be collected at
      baseline and during treatment. There will be exploratory biomarkers analyses to identify
      predictive markers for efficacy in every subtypes.

    <description>pathological complete response(pCR) of breast and axilla after surgery means after operation, no invasive component can be found in both breast and axillary lymph nodes. The pCR rate is calculated by number of patients having pCR after sugery divided by number of patients receiving neoadjuvant chemotherapy.</description>
