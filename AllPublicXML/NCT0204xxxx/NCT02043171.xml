  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Men and women lose muscle mass and strength with age. Loss of muscle mass and strength is
      accompanied by a loss of muscle function which can lead to diminished quality of life and
      more importantly can lead to serious fall requiring medical treatment. The investigators
      hypothesize that the combined supplements of Calcium-HMB and Vitamin D will lead to decreased
      falls and to improved quality of life (QOL) for older adults. The investigators further
      hypothesize that the addition of a modest exercise regimen to these supplements will enhance
      the synergistic effects of both Calcium-HMB and Vitamin D.

      Subjects will consume the dietary supplement 2 times per day for 12 months. Tests will
      consist of the following: a) strength of subjects' legs and elbow by Isokinetic Dynamometer;
      b) body composition; c) hand-grip strength by hand-grip dynamometer; d) functional mobility,
      balance and agility (Get-Up and Get-Up-and-Go tests); e) filling out questionnaires; and g)
      having blood drawn for biochemical measurements. Testing will be performed at the baseline (0
      months) and at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months.
