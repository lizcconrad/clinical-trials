  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Insomnia is a widespread condition in which approximately one-third of adults in the United
      States are symptomatic with 6% of the population meeting the diagnostic criteria for
      insomnia. There is an increased risk of insomnia in certain segments of the population
      including women, middle-aged and older adults, shift workers and individuals with medical or
      psychiatric disorders. Individuals with insomnia have a decreased quality of life compared to
      those who report other serious illnesses such as major depression and congestive heart
      failure. Chronic insomnia can be caused by medications, drug or alcohol abuse, psychiatric
      disorders, medical and neurologic disorders. It can impair cognitive and physical
      functioning.

      Propofol is an approved drug administered intravenously for use in the induction and
      maintenance of anesthesia or sedation. Some research suggests that propofol when administered
      as a two hour infusion may improve the ease of sleep onset, sleep quality, ease of awakening
      and the integrity of behavior following waking.

      This study will be conducted in the Broward Health Medical Center Sleep Lab, under the direct
      care of a Board Certified Anesthesiologist, dedicated to the study involving participants who
      have refractory chronic primary insomnia and have not responded to conventional pharmacologic
      therapies within the past 90 days. Each qualifying participant will receive an IV infusion of
      the study medication for 5 consecutive nights. Assessments including polysomnography with
      completion of questionnaires will occur at screening, Days 1 through 5 of study product
      administration, Day 6 and Day 90. Follow-up questionnaires will also be distributed on Day
      180.

An additional bolus may be given by the investigator in order to maintain the level of sleep. This procedure will be conducted over 5 consecutive nights.</description>
