    <textblock>
      The purpose of this trial is to investigate a novel treatment for cannabis dependence:
      cannabidiol. Between 96 and 168 young people who want to quit cannabis and meet criteria for
      moderate cannabis use disorder (DSM-5) will be recruited from the community. Stage one aims
      to identify the Most Effective Dose (MEDmg) of oral cannabidiol for reducing cannabis use
      over four treatment weeks. Stage two will determine whether the MED identified in stage 1 can
      offer an effective treatment for cannabis dependence.
