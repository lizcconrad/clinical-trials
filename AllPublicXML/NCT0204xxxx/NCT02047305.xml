    <textblock>
      Patients with MGIN, HGIN or flat-type early SCCA of the esophagus will be treated on 3 month
      intervals with Radiofrequency Ablation (RFA) until complete eradication (CR: no MGIN or worse
      in the biopsies) will be achieved. All patients will undergo an endoscopy at 12 months after
      baseline, and the patients with CR will undergo annual endoscopy with biopsies for 5 years.

      A patient population with a histopathological diagnosis of moderate-grade intra-epithelial
      neoplasia (MGIN), high-grade intra-epithelial neoplasia (HGIN) and/or early flat-type SCCA of
      the esophagus, in lesions measuring 3 to 12cm in length, will be treated with radiofrequency
      ablation (RFA) using the HALO ablation system. Additional RFA sessions will be performed on 3
      month intervals until complete response (CR; no MGIN or worse in biopsies) will be achieved.
      All patients will then undergo an endoscopy at 12 months after baseline. Patients with CR at
      12 months will be followed-up for 5 years with annual endoscopy and biopsies, and additional
      treatment if necessary. Patients with no CR at 12 months are considered failures.

               1. Within the last 3 months, subject demonstrated a new diagnosis or a reconfirmed
                  diagnosis of squamous MGIN and/or HGIN of the esophagus, or...

               2. within the last 3 months, subject demonstrated a new diagnosis of a flat-type
                  (type 0-IIb) SCCA (G1/G2 only)

          3. On endoscopic examination, subject has at least one USL that measures at least 3 cm in
             at least one dimension and has MGIN or worse (MGIN+) on biopsy

          4. The maximum allowable linear length of &quot;USL-bearing esophagus&quot; is 12 cm

          5. Baseline EUS (all patients) shows no exclusionary findings for the trial

             procedure

             pacemaker) and has not received clearance for enrollment in this study by specialist
             responsible for the pacing device
