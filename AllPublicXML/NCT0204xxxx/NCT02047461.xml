  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients will receive daily IV infusions of ALXN1101 starting on Day 1. After a prescribed
      period, dosing will increase monthly based on defined patient safety measures. After Month 6,
      patients will continue daily dosing through Month 66 at their last tolerated dose.
