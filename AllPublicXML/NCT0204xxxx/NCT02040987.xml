    <measure>The effect of a single oral dose of moxifloxacin on the changes in time-matched QTcF intervals compared with placebo.</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 69 days</time_frame>
    <description>The heart rate corrected QT (QTcF) will be calculated using Fridericia's formula.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The safety and tolerability of AZD3293 in healthy male subjects by assessing a panel of adverse events measures</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 69 days</time_frame>
    <description>Physical examination, electrocardiogram, pulse and blood pressure, weight and laboratory variables</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Plasma concentrations, AUC, Cmax and tmax of single dose AZD3293 and moxifloxacin in healthy male subjects</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 69 days</time_frame>
    <description>AUC(0-t): Area under the concentration versus time curve from time 0 to the time of the last quantifiable concentration to be calculated by a combination of linear and logarithmic trapezoidal methods (linear up-log down) Cmax: Maximum observed plasma concentration obtained directly from the concentration vs. time data tmax: Time to reach Cmax following dose, obtained directly from the concentration vs. time data</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The effect of AZD3293 on additional electrocardiogram (ECG) variables (heart rate, RR, PR, QRS, QT and QTcB)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 69 days</time_frame>
    <description>RR: The time between corresponding points on 2 consecutive R waves on ECG. PR: ECG interval measured from the onset of the P wave to the onset of the QRS complex. QRS: ECG interval measured from the onset of the QRS complex to the J point. QT: ECG interval measured from the onset of the QRS complex to the offset of the T wave. QTcB: The heart rate corrected QT calculated using Bazett's formula.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>

    <measure>The relationship between plasma concentrations of AZD3293 and changes in QTcF parameters</measure>
