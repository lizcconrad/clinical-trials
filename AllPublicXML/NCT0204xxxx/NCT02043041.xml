  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We will invite a convenience sample of up to 45 enrolled subjects to participate in an
      optional, self-administered blood specimen collection procedure to determine optimal
      procedures for collection.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Participants will be recruited to this one-time assessment during their follow-up visits.
      After completing a consent procedure specific to this study component, participants will be
      provided with instructions on how to fully self-administer the procedure of a finger stick
      and also blotting to collect a blood specimen using a 1, 3 or 5 blood spot specimen
      collection card. These specimens will be labeled with the participant's unique identification
      number, and no other identifying information. The dried blood spots will be evaluated by a
      laboratorian to assess quality, but will not be tested for HIV. This evaluation will help
      determine what number of self-collected dried blood spots yields the highest usable quantity
      of sample for HIV testing. There will be a separate monetary incentive of $30 for this
      procedure.
