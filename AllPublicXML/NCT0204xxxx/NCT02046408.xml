  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study tests the use of handheld computer tablets to promote the integration of 5A's
      (Ask, Advise, Assess, Assist, Arrange) for smoking cessation in academic and community
      primary care clinics. Although most patients receive the &quot;ask&quot; and &quot;advise&quot; steps, only
      slightly more than half are &quot;assessed&quot; for readiness to change, less than half receive
      &quot;assistance&quot; in changing, and only 9% have an &quot;arranged&quot; follow-up. While the large majority
      of primary care providers support the 5A's model, negative attitudes and the lack of time,
      knowledge, and cessation skills are common obstacles. Alternate service delivery systems that
      address these obstacles and evidence-based strategies to promote their implementation are
      needed to improve provider adherence and 5A's fidelity.

      This project develops and tests a computer-facilitated 5A's (CF-5A's) model that administers
      the 5A's intervention to patients then prompts providers for reinforcing next steps. CF-5A's
      could efficiently and effectively promote smoking cessation while educating providers about
      cessation resources and appropriate follow-up. Based on the Technology Acceptance Model,
      clinically tailored strategies to promote CF-5A's implementation will be developed and tested
      to ensure the appropriate use and uptake of this new service delivery model. Development of
      the model, materials, and strategies will occur in years 1 and 2.

      Baseline data collection occurs in year 2, followed by a randomized trial of CF- 5A's where
      the provider is the unit of randomization. Provider use of the 5A's will primarily be
      assessed with a brief phone call to the patient after the primary care visit has occurred.

      Although focused on 5A's for smoking cessation, this study examines the underlying
      implementation science of computer-aided service delivery models with important implications
      for the integration of other substance use or behavioral health interventions in primary
      care. Implementation factors will be assessed using qualitative interviews and brief pre-post
      surveys.

    <description>Baseline and post-tablet intervention assessments of primary care provider adherence to 5A's protocol for smoking cessation. Patients are called after their primary care appointment and asked a series of questions to determine if (and which of) the 5A's were used during that visit.</description>
