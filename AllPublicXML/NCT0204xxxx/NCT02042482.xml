      The purpose of this study is determine whether combination Q10 , L-carnitine and multivitamin
      and mineral complex is effective in treatment of patients with low and intermidiate1-2 risk
      Myelodysplastic syndrome

      The primary objectives of this study are to assess response (as measured by increase in blood
      counts, cytogenetic/molecular changes in the bone marrow, improved endurance) to the
      supplements treatment.

      The secondary objectives are to determine:

      Quality of life assessment(FACT: QOL Questionnaire) Cancer fatigue reduction. Physiological
      functioning assessment Rate and depth transfusion reduction Duration of response. Time to
      progression. Overall survival. Estimated cytokine profile and another immunological and
      biochemical parameters of mitochondrial function before and after six months of treatment.
