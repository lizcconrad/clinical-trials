    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to: 1. Evaluate the safety and tolerability of KamRAB in
      comparison with HRIG comparator product. 2. To assess whether KamRAB interferes with the
      development of self active antibodies when given simultaneously with active rabies vaccine,
      as compared to the HRIG comparator product, also given in conjunction with the active rabies
      vaccine.
