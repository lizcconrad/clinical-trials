  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This single-centre study was carried out in collaboration with the Cardiovascular Research
      Laboratory of Harvard University (Boston, USA). This preliminary study does not include a
      control group.

      The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of a hybrid reconditioning programme
      (electrostimulation of the lower limb muscles associated with voluntary strengthening of the
      upper limbs) on a specially developed rowing machine in patients presenting stabilized
      paraplegia of a traumatic origin. This study will bear on the increase in maximal aerobic
      capacity (VO2max) between the start and end of the 9-month reconditioning programme.
