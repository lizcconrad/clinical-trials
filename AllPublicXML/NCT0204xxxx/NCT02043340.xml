  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In recent years, there has been a growing interest in the use of dental lasers for treatment
      of periodontal diseases. Commercially available photodynamic therapy for periodontal diseases
      utilizes methylene blue as a photosensitizer. In this study, the effects of a novel
      photosensitizer dye, indocyanine green (ICG), as an adjunct to nonsurgical treatment of
      chronic periodontitis will be evaluated.

      Background and objective: Periodontal disease is caused by periodontal pathogens that
      colonize the dental plaque and the subsequent host-microbial interactions. The recent years
      have witnessed a rapid increase in the usage of Light Amplification by Stimulated Emission of
      Radiation (Laser) in dentistry for the treatment of periodontal diseases. The additive
      therapeutic effects when a photoactivated dye such as methylene blue is used in conjunction
      with Laser is well documented. Indocyanine green (ICG), a tri-carbocyanine that belongs to
      family of cyanine dyes is widely used in the fields of Ophthalmology and Cardiac imaging.
      Recent in vitro studies have reported its efficacy in killing potent periodontal pathogens
      like A. actinomycetemcomitans and P. gingivalis when combined with 810 nm diode laser. The
      present study aims at evaluating the effects of ICG as an adjunct to non-surgical treatment
      of chronic periodontitis in biofilm environment of human periodontal pockets in terms of
      immediate reduction in percentage of viable bacteria and at the same to quantitatively assess
      host tissue injury. Methods: The study included 30 patients diagnosed with chronic
      periodontitis. Three sites from three different quadrants were selected and assigned to three
      groups namely, SRP group - scaling and root planing, LASER group - scaling and root planing
      with application of 810 nm diode laser and ICG group - scaling and root planing with
      application of 810 nm diode laser and ICG at a concentration of 5 mg/mL. Primary parameters
      included estimation of decrease in percentage of viable bacteria at baseline, immediate post
      treatment and end of 1 week and Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels at baseline and end of 1
      week. Secondary parameters included site-specific measures of plaque, gingivitis, pocket
      depth (PD) and clinical attachment loss (CAL) at specific time intervals.

    <description>Percentage of viable bacteria were estimated from the subgingival plaque samples at baseline, immediately after treatment and at the end of 1 week using a commercially available bacterial viability kit (LIVE/DEAD® BacLight™ Bacterial Viability Kit, Invitrogen, Leiden, The Netherlands).</description>

    <description>LDH activity is used as an indicator of relative cell viability and plasma membrane integrity.,28 Quantitative total LDH was assayed by using a commercially available kit (LDH-Cytotoxicity Assay Kit II (Colorimetric) ®, Abcam, Cambridge, MA, USA). Initially, 10 μL of mammalian cell lysis solution (Cell Lysis Solution, Abcam, Cambridge, MA, USA) was added to every 100 μL of the GCF collected which was subsequently incubated at 30ºC for 5 minutes. The manufacturer's instructions were subsequently followed and the absorbance at 450nm background after subtracting the zero well/NADH background from all readings was recorded by using a colorimetric microplate reader (iMark™ Microplate Absorbance Reader, Bio-Rad, Hyderabad, India). The results are expressed as total LDH activity (mUnits/site) per sample where one unit LDH is the amount of enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of lactate to pyruvate to generate 1.0 μmol to NADH per minute at 37°C.</description>

    <description>Immediately after the laser application to the LASER group and 0.5 ml of 5mg/ml Indocyanine green dye along with laser to the ICG group by the second operator subgingival plaque samples were collected from the 3 sites by the first operator. The patients were recalled at the end of 1 week for collection of GCF and subgingival plaque samples for the assay of LDH levels and bacterial viability respectively. PI and MGI scores were recorded at the end of 1, 4, 12 and 24 weeks, while PD and CAL were recorded at the end of 12 and 24 weeks.</description>
