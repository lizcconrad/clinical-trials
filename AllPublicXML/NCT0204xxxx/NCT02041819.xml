  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Nimotuzumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody against epidermal growth factor receptor
      (EGFR),has been shown to be effective and safe in some studies with head-neck
      cancers.Nab-paclitaxel regimen in advanced NSCLC has a better tumor response rate and safety
      than solvent-based paclitaxel.However,the safety and efficacy of Nimotuzumab plus
      nab-paclitaxel regimen is uncertain in neoadjuvant therapy in esophageal cancer.The
      investigators then initiated a phase II clinical trial with Nimotuzumab plus
      Nab-paclitaxel/cisplatin as the neoadjuvant chemotherapy in patients with locally advanced
      esophageal squamous cell carcinoma to observe the efficacy and safety of the combination.

      In the past decade, clinical trials have evaluated the role of neoadjuvant chemotherapy,
      radiation, or both, for patients with surgically resectable esophageal carcinoma, but have
      all failed to demonstrate a consistent survival benefit. In Eastern countries, preoperative
      chemotherapy followed by radical surgery became one of the treatment strategies for
      resectable, clinical stage II or III esophageal cancer. In an effort to improve the efficacy
      of systemic chemotherapy, we conducted a prospective study to evaluate the regimen of
      Nimotuzumab plus Nab-paclitaxel/cisplatin as perioperative therapy for patients with
      resectable esophageal squamous cell carcinoma.
