  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Large population studies of hypopituitary adults (patients with pituitary gland failure) on
      conventional hormone replacement, but not growth hormone, have an approximate two fold
      increase in death rate (mortality). The vast majority of this excess mortality relates to
      vascular disease. While it is possible that overreplacement with steroids, underreplacement
      with thyroid hormones and sex hormone deficiency contribute, there are increasing data to
      support a role for GH in the cause of the excess vascular risk. Although a number of
      surrogates of vascular risk are described in patients with GH deficiency (GHD), how these
      translate mechanistically into atherothrombotic (blockage of the arteries) disease has not
      been fully elucidated.

      This proposed study will analyse both traditional (body composition, serum lipids, handling
      of sugars)and more complex markers (inflammation, procoagulation, fibrinolysis) of vascular
      risk/disease. In addition the study will examine 24hr blood pressure, arterial wall
      thickness, clot structure and function, as well as platelet action. Measurements will be
      performed at baseline and will be reassessed after patients have been on a stable dose of GH
      replacement for at least three months.

      The results of the study will characterise risk factors for vascular disease, and take this a
      step further to elucidate how these changes translate mechanistically in to vascular damage.
