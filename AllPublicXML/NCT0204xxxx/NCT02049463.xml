      Purpose: To investigate the different sound spectrum of carotid arteries and to analyze its
      relationship to the vessel disease, and to build a new biomarker about vascular disorder.

      Methods: To record the carotid phonoangiography with digital stereoscopy and analysis the
      spectrum with different algorithm such as FFT, wavelet, entropy, complexity, and HHT. The
      results will be correlated and comparison to the finding in clinical, carotid Doppler and
      duplex, CTA, MR, and catheter angiography.

      Statistics:

      The significance of difference between parameters was computed using t-tests or paired t-test
      etc. A p value &lt;0.05 is defined as significant.

      The investigators plan to recruit data from patients that come to their department for
      angiography study and intervention (n=300) with different disease entity such as
      atherosclerosis, tumor, aneurysm, arteriovenous malformation or fistula, and other vascular
      disorders. A period of about 20 seconds of the carotid phonoangiography was recorded.

      Standard for comparison: catheter angiography, CTA, MRI/MRA. The degree of stenosis, the wall
      thickness, SI and density change was clustered and compared. The clinical and laboratory data
      will be reviewed and the vascular risk factors will be calculated.

      Spectrum analysis: The sound spectrum will be analysis with the FFT, wavelet, entropy,
      complexity, and HHT algorithms.

      The correlation between change of spectrums and also the correlated clinical, images, and
      laboratory change will be further analysis by statistic method.
