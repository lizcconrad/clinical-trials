  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To investigate the relative bioavailability of dabigatran etexilate as pellets on food and of
      dabigatran etexilate as granules resolved in reconstitution solution, each with dabigatran
      etexilate as capsule following oral administration. To evaluate acceptability and

        Inclusion criteria:

          1. Healthy males according to the investigator's assessment, as based on the following
             criteria: a complete medical history including a physical examination, vital signs
             (Blood Pressure, Pulse Rate), 12-lead electrocardiogram, and clinical laboratory tests

          2. Age 18 to 55 years (incl.)

          3. Body Mass Index 18.5 to 29.9 kg/m2 (incl.)

          4. Signed and dated written informed consent prior to admission to the study in
             accordance with GCP and local legislation

        Exclusion criteria:

          1. Any finding in the medical examination (including Blood Pressure, Pulse Rate or
             electrocardiogram) deviating from normal and judged clinically relevant by the
             investigator.

          2. Repeated measurement of systolic blood pressure greater than 140 mm Hg or diastolic
             blood pressure greater than 90 mm Hg

          3. Any laboratory value outside the reference range that the investigator considers to be
             of clinical relevance

          4. Any evidence of a concomitant disease judged clinically relevant by the investigator

                  participation

               -  History of arteriovenous malformation or aneurysm

               -  History of gastroduodenal ulcer disease or gastrointestinal haemorrhage

Study drug (150 mg dabigatran etexilate) was administrated twice daily on Day 1 and Day 2 and once on Day 3. The dosage forms used were: hard capsule, granules resolved in reconstitution solution and pellets on food. Treatment periods were separated by a washout phase of at least 5 days between last drug administration of one treatment and the first drug administration of the next treatment.</description>
