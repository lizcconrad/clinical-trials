  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Our expectations (hypotheses) are:

      Primary outcome

        1. Regular bidet use will improve quality of life around elimination in adults with
           impaired functional status. Functional status will be measured by activities of daily
           living (ADL).

        2. Regular bidet use by adults with impaired functional status will improve the quality of
           life around toileting for their caregivers.

           Secondary

        3. Regular bidet use will reduce the incidence, frequency and severity of constipation (as
           measured by self-report) in adults with impaired functional status.

        4. Regular bidet use will reduce the incidence of urinary tract infection (UTI) in adult
           women with impaired functional status.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will assess the use of a bidet (a device that is attached to the toilet which
      allows a person to wash their genitalia after elimination) in improving toilet related
      quality of life for functionally impaired individuals as measured by ADLs and caregivers of
      functionally impaired adults. We also want to see if bidet use is effective in lowering the
      incidence of urinary tract infections in this high risk population.

      Functional impairment around toileting has been shown to negatively impact quality of life
      (QOL) for both patients and their caregivers. We hope to learn if the use of bidet will
      improve QOL in this population.

      Urinary tract infections increase the risk of morbidity and mortality in women with impaired
      functional status. Specifically the risk of hospitalization, sepsis, kidney failure and other
      complications. There are not currently effective forms of non-pharmaceutical prevention.
      Bidets are safe, inexpensive and hygienic. Individuals with functional impairment often have
      difficulty maintaining their hygiene due to frailty and functional limitations. It is our
      hope that addressing these issues will lead to a reduced incidence of UTI.

      Constipation is a common problem in elderly adults and in adults with impaired functional
      status. It is our hope that the bidet will reduce the frequency and severity of constipation
      (as measured by self report).

    <description>Every month we will screen female patients in both arms of the study to ask them if they have had any symptoms of UTI or sought medical attention for UTI.
We will also review their chart for diagnosis of UTI or prescription of a medication for UTI. Either self-report of a diagnosis or prescription for a medication of a UTI or a report of UTI in the chart will be considered an incidence of UTI.</description>
