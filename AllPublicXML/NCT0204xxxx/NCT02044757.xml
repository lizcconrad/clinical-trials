  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study to investigate the addictive properties of soda and other sugar
      sweetened beverages (SBBs) in teenagers aged 13-18 years. It is hypothesized that
      participants who were regularly consuming sweetened and caffeinated beverages will experience
      symptoms typical of caffeine withdrawal, such as headache and fatigue, during the SSB
      withdrawal period.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Symptoms of withdrawal</measure>
    <time_frame>Days 1-3 and days 6-8</time_frame>
    <description>Symptoms of withdrawal during the SSB withdrawal period (days 6-8) will be compared to symptoms of withdrawal during usual consumption period (days 1-3). Three measures are used to assess withdrawal symptoms: Griffiths' withdrawal scale, the relative reinforcing value of soda, and daily check in questions on well-being.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in diet</measure>
    <time_frame>Days 1-2, 6-8</time_frame>
    <description>Changes in diet will be assessed by 24-hour dietary recalls and beverage recalls</description>
  </secondary_outcome>

    <measure>Change in impulsivity</measure>
    <time_frame>Days 1 and 8</time_frame>
    <description>Impulsivity will be assessed via the delayed discounting task</description>
  </secondary_outcome>

    <measure>Change in stress</measure>
    <time_frame>Days 1 and 8</time_frame>
    <description>Stress will be assessed via salivary cortisol samples</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in preference for soda</measure>
    <time_frame>Days 1-3, 6-8</time_frame>
    <description>Preference for soda will be measured through the Labeled Affective Magnitude Scale (LAMS) and daily check-in questions</description>

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Compliance with intervention to only drink water and unflavored milk during the SSB withdrawal phase</measure>
    <time_frame>Days 6-8</time_frame>
    <description>Using measure of salivary caffeine, beverage recalls, and 24-hour dietary recalls, we will assess compliance.</description>
