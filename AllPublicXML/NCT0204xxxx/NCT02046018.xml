  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), many children die from diarrhoea, acute respiratory illness
      (ARI) and malaria, despite well- recognized, inexpensive and highly effective treatments,
      since health access and human resources are limited. Healthy Child Uganda (HCU) is a
      Ugandan-Canadian partnership that since 2003, has developed, implemented and evaluated a
      Village Health Volunteer (VHV) program in 175 rural villages. Volunteers, selected by peers,
      provide health education and refer sick children. Volunteer retention (94%) and significant
      decreases in child deaths are remarkable. Now, HCU wonders whether VHV scope can extend to
      provide treatment for sick children using Oral Rehydration Salts (ORS)/Zinc, antibiotics, and
      antimalarials. Use of lay providers in this capacity, called integrated community case
      management (iCCM), has been proposed as a potential inexpensive solution to SSA's human
      health resource crisis.

      PRIMARY QUESTION: In rural southwest Uganda, can iCCM provided by lay volunteers, improve the
      proportion of children with diarrhoea receiving ORS/Zn, ARI receiving antibiotics, and
      fever/malaria receiving antimalarials? Secondary study questions consider VHV capacity to
      prescribe appropriate drug, dose, duration; iCCM acceptance by family, and VHV; VHV
      retention/motivation; program cost. Selected VHV will be iCCM trained then receive treatments
      for distribution. Qualitative and quantitative methods including household surveys, and focus
      groups will consider pre/post intervention differences and differences in control and
      intervention populations. A research short course and micro research grants (~ $3000 to
      multidisciplinary groups pursuing relevant questions) will promote health system evaluation
      capacity. Lessons learned are critical as SSA countries move forward in planning for
      increased iCCM programming.
