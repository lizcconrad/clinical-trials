  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this first in human study the aim is to assess the safety, pharmacokinetics and
      pharmacodynamics of 2B3-201 in a randomized, first in human, double-blind, placebo- and
      active comparator- controlled 3-way crossover study in 18 healthy male subjects (part 1).
      Furthermore, the findings obtained from part 1 will be extended and confirmed in a subsequent
      parallel open label study in 18 healthy male and 12 MS patients and an open label study with
      methylprednisolone as comparator in 12 female volunteers (part 2).
