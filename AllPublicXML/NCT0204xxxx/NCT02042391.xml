  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorders (PTLD) differ clinically from lymphoma in the
      general (immunocompetent) population due to their higher incidence and their frequent
      association with Epstein-Barr virus. Previous clinical trials have shown their remarkably
      good response to rituximab as well as to chemotherapy.

      The PTLD-1 trial demonstrated the efficacy and safety of sequential immunochemotherapy with 4
      courses of rituximab IV followed by 4 cycles of CHOP chemotherapy. Compared to trials of
      rituximab monotherapy in PTLD, median overall survival was extended from 2.4 to 6.5 years.
      Compared to previous trials of chemotherapy, complications were reduced. In addition, we
      noted that those patients who already had a good response to the first four cycles of
      rituximab did better overall than those who did not. As a consequence, the PTLD-1/3 trial
      introduced risk-stratification in sequential treatment according to the response to the first
      4 courses of rituximab monotherapy. Those patients with a complete remission went on to
      receive four further courses of rituximab whereas those who did not received rituximab and
      CHOP chemotherapy. Interim results have demonstrated that it is safe to restrict chemotherapy
      treatment in this manner and thus established the concept of treatment stratification based
      on the response to rituximab.

      The PTLD-2 trial is the next step in the development of this strategy. Compared to the
      PTLD-1/3 trial, the key difference is the use of subcutaneous instead of intravenous
      rituximab application. Interim results from an ongoing trial of patients with follicular
      lymphoma (NCT01200758) have shown that subcutaneous administration results in increased blood
      levels and in non-inferior remission rates. Furthermore, the stratification strategy is
      refined based on observations from the previous PTLD-1 and PTLD1/3 trials: Risk groups are
      now defined not only based on response to rituximab therapy but also on the international
      prognostic index (IPI, a well-established lymphoma risk score) and the transplanted organ.
      The major advantage of this new stratification is an extended low-risk group that is eligible
      for subcutaneous rituximab monotherapy: Patients with a low risk of disease progression,
      defined as those who achieve a complete remission after the first four courses of
      subcutaneous rituximab monotherapy and those with an IPI of 0 to 2 who achieve a partial
      remission at interim staging, will go on with rituximab monotherapy. Patients with high IPI
      who achieve a partial remission, patients with stable disease at interim staging and
      non-thoracic transplant recipients with progressive disease at interim staging will be
      considered high risk. These patients will go on with 4 cycles of rituximab plus CHOP
      chemotherapy similar to the PTLD-1/3 protocol. Thoracic transplant recipients refractory to
      rituximab will be considered very high risk and will go on with rituximab subcutaneous plus
      alternating chemotherapy with CHOP and DHAOx.

      The trial hypothesis is that the new protocol will improve the event-free survival, a measure
      integrating unfavorable events such as death, disease progression and treatment
      complications, particularly infections, in the low risk-group compared to the results of the
      PTLD-1 trial. In very high-risk patients data from the PTLD-1 and PTLD-1/3 trial have shown
      that the current treatment is not sufficient to control the disease. Death due to disease
      progression was observed in more than 80% of patients. Here, rituximab combined with
      alternating chemotherapy cycles of CHOP and DHAOx (+GCSF) may increase treatment efficacy
      with an acceptable toxicity profile.

      In summary, the PTLD-2 trials tests if the substitution of subcutaneous for intravenous
      rituximab and an updated stratification strategy that deescalates treatment for those at low
      risk and escalates treatment for those at very high risk can further improve the overall
      efficacy and safety of PTLD therapy.
