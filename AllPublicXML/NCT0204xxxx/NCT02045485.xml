      Background:

      Several reports have demonstrated an association between psoriasis and cardiovascular
      diseases. P wave dispersion (PWD) is the most important electrocardiographic (ECG) markers
      used to evaluate the risk of atrial arrhythmias. QT dispersion (QTD) can be used to assess
      homogeneity of cardiac repolarization and may be a risk for ventricular arrhythmias.

      Aim: To search PWD and QTD in patients with psoriasis. Methods: Ninety-four outpatient
      psoriasis patients and 51 healthy people were evaluated by physical examination, 12-lead ECG
      and transthoracic echocardiography. Severity of the psoriasis was evaluated by psoriasis Area
      and Severity Index (PASI).

      Ninety-four outpatient psoriasis patients and 51 healthy people were included in the study.
      Patients having systemic hypertension, diabetes mellitus, history of ischemic heart disease,
      significant valvular heart disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, hypo or
      hyper-thyroidism, renal failure or any associated systemic disease were excluded. Diagnosis
      of psoriasis was confirmed by dermatological examination and/or punch biopsy. Severity of the
      psoriasis was evaluated by psoriasis area and severity index (PASI). Patients were evaluated
      by physical examination, 12-lead electrocardiography and transthoracic echocardiography.
