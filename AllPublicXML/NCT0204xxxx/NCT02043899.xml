      This study aims to show that 3-dimensional PET/CT imaging with a new novel PET tracer (called
      [124I]mIBG) can detect as many or more sites of neuroblastoma (a type of childhood cancer)
      compared to the recommended 1-dimensional routine scans (called [123I]mIBG planar
      scintigraphy).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Neuroblastoma is the most common tumour of childhood after brain tumours. Approximately half
      of cases are high risk and despite extensive treatments outcome is very poor. More than 60%
      of high risk patients suffer relapse or further spread of their disease and long-term
      survival is below 10%. Existing imaging techniques are not sensitive enough to accurately
      assess the level of risk which is critical in determining the best choice of treatment. This
      study will compare a new type of imaging against the existing imaging techniques. The new
      scans use a new tracer called [124I]mIBG which is taken up by the cancer tissue much more
      than by normal tissues. This tracer can be used with a 3D imaging technique called PET/CT to
      pinpoint where the disease has spread and quantify the amount of disease. Patients will be
      those scheduled to have an [123I]mIBG scan for routine care during a planned break in
      treatment.

    <description>Single intravenous administration of [124I]mIBG Solution for Injection on Day 1 with a maximum radioactive dose of 1.42 MBq/kg (±10%) and a maximum injected dose of 50 MBq [124I]mIBG equating to a maximum chemical dose of 10 micrograms of stable mIBG. The activity to paediatric patients will be scaled by weight based upon the EANM paediatric dose card (Lassmann et al., 2007). This will result in an activity between 10 MBq and 50 MBq depending on the patient's weight.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Histologically proven Stage 4 neuroblastoma as defined by the International
             Neuroblastoma Staging System (INSS).

          2. Aged ≥ 1 year at the time that written informed consent is given.

          3. Planned to undergo conventional [123I]mIBG planar scintigraphy for routine clinical
             care of neuroblastoma.

          4. Life expectancy of at least 12 weeks.

          5. World Health Organisation (WHO) performance status of 0, 1 or 2 (Appendix 2) for
             patients aged &gt; 12 years old or Lansky play scale score of ≥ 50% (Appendix 3) for
             patients aged ≤ 12 years old.

          6. Written (signed and dated) informed consent from patient ≥ 16 years old and/or parent
             or legal guardian for patients &lt;16 years old and the patient be capable of
             co-operating with scanning requirements. (N.B. Written or verbal assent as appropriate
             should be sought from all patients who are under 16 years old).

        Additional Inclusion Criteria for Biokinetic sub-study

          1. Aged ≤ 16 years at the time that written informed consent is given.

          2. No requirement for general anaesthesia to undergo PET/CT scanning.

          3. Written (signed and dated) informed consent for the sub-study from patients aged 16
             years or from the patient's parent or guardian for patients aged &lt;16 years. Capable of
             co-operating with the additional study PET/CT scans. (N.B. Written or verbal assent as
             appropriate should be sought from all patients who are under 16 years old.)

        Additional Inclusion Criteria for PET/MRI sub-study

          1. No requirement for general anaesthesia to undergo hybrid PET/MRI scanning.

          2. No previous experience of claustrophobia.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Treatment with any medications contra-indicated with mIBG scanning as listed in
             Appendix 4. For example, decongestants containing pseudoephedrine, phenylpropalomine
             and phenylephrine, sympathomimetics, cocaine, antihypertensives, tricyclic
             antidepressants. These drugs should be stopped before administration as indicated in
             this list (usually for four biological half-lives to allow almost complete wash-out

             Off-Study assessment on Day 3 to Day 7, see schedule of assessments in Section 7. N.B.
             Patients should not be enrolled in the study if their participation will delay their
             subsequent treatment for neuroblastoma.

          4. Female patients who are pregnant or lactating.

          5. At high medical risk because of non-malignant systemic disease including active
