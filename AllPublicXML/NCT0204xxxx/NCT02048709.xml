  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label Phase I study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and
      pharmacokinetics of escalating oral doses of GDC-0919, an investigational agent intended to
      inhibit the indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase 1 (IDO1) enzyme and help the human immune system
      attack solid tumor cells more effectively.
