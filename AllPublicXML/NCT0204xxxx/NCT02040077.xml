  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Unintentional fatal drug overdose (OD) is now the 2nd leading cause of accidental death in
      the general population. Fatal OD from opioid analgesics specifically has increased over 400%
      between 1999 and 2008, and nonfatal overdose occurs at a rate 3-7 greater than fatal OD.
      Unintentional opioid OD is a public health crisis in several societal populations including
      drug users, patients being treated for chronic pain, elderly individuals, adolescents, and
      children. Educational interventions have been developed to increase knowledge regarding
      opioid OD risk factors, symptoms, and appropriate responses, however no randomized controlled
      evaluations of these interventions have been conducted. Within-subject evaluations report
      immediate and sustained increases in participant knowledge and behavior change, yet these
      programs suffer from limitations that may limit their widespread dissemination. Thus, there
      is an urgent, critical need to develop an opioid OD educational intervention that can be
      accessed by a broad audience, and produces immediate and sustained gains in knowledge in an
      easily administered and cost-effective way. This study will develop a web-based,
      computerized, interactive, opioid OD education training program that will incorporate
      multi-media learning components and fluency training to produce knowledge gains. This program
      will be evaluated using a randomized, controlled comparison of the active intervention
      against two control interventions. Participants will be recruited from a brief inpatient
      detoxification (n=75), will receive the intervention immediately upon completing the
      detoxification (post-treatment), and will complete 2 follow-up visits to evaluate sustained
      knowledge. The primary outcome will be percent change from baseline on a knowledge test that
      is administered immediately before and after the intervention, and at a 1 and 3-month
      follow-up visit. Secondary outcomes will include self-reported behavior change and
      participant acceptance of the intervention. The study hypothesis is that participants who
      receive the primary intervention will evidence the largest increase in knowledge gain and
      retention over time, compared to the control groups. The rationale and public health benefit
      of this research cannot be understated- this project will make available a brief,
      empirically-supported intervention that can be administered quickly and easily within
      hundreds of settings (e.g., treatment centers, prisons and jails, needle exchange centers,
      primary care offices, schools), and to diverse patient populations (e.g., drug users, chronic
      pain patients, elderly, student, children, parents). These outcomes are expected to have a
      positive impact because they will provide cheap, easily-administered intervention strategy
      that will help reduce the current national epidemic of opioid OD, and will expand the use of
      computerized interventions to address public health issues more broadly.

    <description>The primary outcome is based on performance in the randomized, controlled trial and is change from baseline on a knowledge test that is administered immediately before and after the intervention.
At the time of the study, no validated scales to assess general information regarding overdose in a true/false manner were available. Therefore the study developed a scale for the purpose of measuring knowledge increase. The scale included 51 items, rated as &quot;true&quot;, &quot;false&quot;, or &quot;I don't know&quot; (to discourage random guessing from resulting in accurate responses accidentally). The answers to all items were included as part of the intervention content so it was possible for every answer to be learned. The scale was summed together as a single measure of number correct responses (range 0-51) with no subscales. Higher values indicated more correct responses.</description>
