    <textblock>
      The focus of the study is to evaluate the safety of multiple study drug administrations and
      the study drug selectively reducing or eliminating a specific bacteria in the mouth. It will
      compare a liquid and gel product applied in different modes.

      The study will evaluate the safety of multiple study drug administrations as assessed by
      adverse event monitoring, oral cavity assessments, targeted physical exams and vital signs.
      The study will also assess the study drug's ability to selectively reduce or eliminate
      specific bacteria in the mouth by comparing a liquid and gel product applied in different
      modes, such as mouth rinse administration and gel application using a dental tray, electric
      toothbrush or manual toothbrush administered over 7 consecutive days. Subjects will be
      followed for approximately 8 days after the last study drug administration for safety and
      microbiology.

          -  Healthy, as determined by the Investigator (in consultation with the Medical Monitor,
             as needed), based on medical and dental history, laboratory results, concomitant
             medications, oral cavity assessment, and targeted physical examination (extraoral,
             head and neck) during Screening

          -  Have a minimum of six unrestored bicuspids and molars with less than 50% of molars and

          -  Demonstrated ability to swish 10 mL of water for 4 minutes

             products during the study

          -  Willing to postpone elective dental procedures (e.g. dental cleanings) between
             Screening and final post-treatment visit (End of Study or Early Termination)

          -  Advanced periodontal disease

          -  Active caries lesion(s) within 30 days prior to study drug administration (confirmed
             by dental examination and standard radiographs).

          -  Medical condition (e.g., artificial heart valve, history of infective endocarditis,
             cardiac transplant with valvular dysfunction, congenital heart disease or total joint
             replacement) for which antibiotics are recommended prior to dental visits and/or
             procedures

          -  Pathologic lesions of the oral cavity (suspicious or confirmed)

          -  Full or partial dentures, or orthodontic appliances, e.g. night guards, permanent

             study requirements
