  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to determine whether aspirin is effective in
      alleviating symptoms of the clinical high risk (CHR) syndrome for psychosis. The
      investigators further aim to determine whether it may delay or prevent the onset of psychosis
      in those currently experiencing CHR symptoms. As secondary measures the investigators aim to
      collect laboratory studies of inflammation markers and genetic samples to determine whether
      certain genetic profiles correlate with risk for psychosis, or response to aspirin treatment.
