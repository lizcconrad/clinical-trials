      Primary objective:

        -  To determine the safety and immunogenicity of tetanus and diphtheria toxoids adsorbed
           combined with component pertussis and inactivated poliomyelitis vaccine grown on vero
           cells (TdcP-IPV) compared to tetanus and diphtheria toxoids adsorbed combined with
           component pertussis and inactivated poliomyelitis vaccine grown on vero cells (TdcP-IPV)
           and Hepatitis B vaccine administered concurrently in adolescents 11-14 years of age.

      Secondary objective:

        -  To determine whether concurrent administration of TdcP-IPV and Hepatitis B vaccines at
           11-14 years of age results in detectable immunologic interactions between components of
           the two vaccines.

      Participants will be randomized into one of 2 groups to receive either a dose of the TdcP-IPV
      on Day 0 (visit 1) and Hepatitis B vaccine on subsequent visits 2, 3 and 4 (Group 1); or no
      vaccination on Day 0, concomitant administration of TdcP-IPV and Hepatitis B vaccine on Day
      28 (Visit 2) and Hepatitis B vaccine on subsequent visits 3 and 4 (Group 2).

      All participants will be followed up for immunogenicity and safety

          -  Prior receipt of any pertussis, diphtheria, tetanus or polio containing vaccines,
             including Hepatitis B vaccine, within the past 5 years.

             disease, renal or hepatic dysfunction.

          -  Known impairment of neurologic function or seizure disorder of any etiology.

          -  Personal history of physician diagnosed or laboratory confirmed pertussis disease
             within the last 2 years.
