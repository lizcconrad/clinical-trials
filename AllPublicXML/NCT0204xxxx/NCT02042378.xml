  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether oral rucaparib is effective in the
      treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic pancreatic cancer and a known
      deleterious BRCA mutation.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Rucaparib is an orally available, small molecule inhibitor of poly-adenosine diphosphate
      [ADP] ribose polymerase (PARP) that inhibits a specific DNA repair pathway known as base
      excision repair (BER). PARP inhibitors (PARPi) have been shown to effectively kill tumors
      with a defect in BRCA1 or BRCA2. Clinical benefit has been observed in patients with a gBRCA
      mutation as well as in those with a somatic BRCA (sBRCA) mutation. Clinical data have also
      shown that pancreatic cancer patients with a gBRCA mutation benefit from PARPi treatment.
      Clinical activity of PARP inhibitors in BRCA-mutated pancreatic cancer combined with the
      paucity of 2nd line therapies support evaluation of rucaparib in pancreatic cancer patients
      known to harbor a deleterious BRCA mutation.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Confirmed diagnosis of pancreatic cancer (ductal adenocarcinoma and related subtypes
             eligible; endocrine and neuroendocrine tumors excluded)

          -  Received at least 1, but no more than 2, chemotherapy-based regimens for locally
             advanced or metastatic disease and has relapsed or progressive disease. Patients no
             longer able to continue treatment with chemotherapy due to intolerable toxicity may be
             considered for study participation provided that radiology assessment confirms either
             stable disease or disease progression (i.e. no response to treatment)

          -  Documented deleterious or suspected deleterious (or equivalent interpretation) BRCA
             mutation (germline or somatic) as assessed by a local laboratory

          -  Measurable disease

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Presence of another active cancer

          -  Prior treatment with any PARP inhibitor, including rucaparib. Patients treated with
             prior iniparib are eligible.

          -  Symptomatic and/or untreated central nervous system metastases.

          -  Clinical evidence of malabsorption and/or any other gastrointestinal disorder or
             defect that would, in the opinion of the investigator, interfere with the absorption
             of rucaparib.
