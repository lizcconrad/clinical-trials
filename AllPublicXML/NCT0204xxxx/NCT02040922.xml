  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The principal research objective is to determine the impact of antibiotic use on the risk of
      developing long term bowel symptoms after infection with the germ Campylobacter.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The secondary research objectives are:

        -  To investigate how the particular strain of the Campylobacter germ that causes the
           infection, and the strength of the immune response that it stimulates in the bowel,
           affect the risk of long term bowel symptoms.

        -  To explore what changes occur after Campylobacter infection in the bacteria that usually
           live in the large bowel (microbiota) and the chemicals that they produce (short-chain
           fatty acids) when they digest nutrients. We will look for differences between people who
           recover fully and people who have long term bowel symptoms.
