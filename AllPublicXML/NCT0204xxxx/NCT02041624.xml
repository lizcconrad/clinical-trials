      Primary objective:

      To describe the patient's perception of the impact of ORALAIR® on his/her health related
      generic and disease specific quality of life during the grass pollen season in real-life
      settings.

      Secondary objectives:

      - To describe the patient's perceived effectiveness of ORALAIR® in allergic
      rhinoconjunctivitis management in terms of disease intensity, satisfaction and rescue
      medication

        Patients with allergic rhino-conjunctivitis are visiting their allergist during
        grass-pollen season when symptoms are strong. In accordance with the terms of the Marketing
        Authorization, ORALAIR® treatment has to be set-up &quot;at the right moment&quot; about 4 months
        before the next grass-pollen season.
