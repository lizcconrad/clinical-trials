      The purpose of this study is to define the dose-limiting toxicities and maximum tolerated
      dose of the poly ADP-ribose polymerase inhibitor niraparib and escalating doses of
      temozolomide in patients with pre-treated incurable Ewing sarcoma.

    <description>Dose limiting toxicity describes side effects of a drug or other treatment that are serious enough to prevent an increase in dose or level of that treatment. The maximum tolerated dose is the highest dose of a drug or treatment that does not cause unacceptable side effects.</description>

          -  If patient &gt; 18 years, must be willing to undergo on-treatment tumor biopsy unless
             medically contra-indicated

          -  Adequate organ function

          -  Patients must have received as a minimum a first line chemotherapy regimen consisting
             of at least 2 of the following agents: doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide, ifosfamide,
             etoposide.

          -  Time elapsed from previous therapy must be ≥ 3 weeks for systemic therapy, ≥ 2 weeks
             for radiation therapy or major surgery.

          -  Patients who have undergone autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation are
             eligible once they have recovered from all toxicities from therapy

          -  Patients who have received allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation will be
             eligible 6 months after the procedure provided there is no evidence of active

             least 30 days.

          -  Patients with central nervous system disease are eligible for enrollment if they have
             received prior radiotherapy or surgery to sites of central nervous system metastatic
             disease, have been off glucocorticoids for at least 4 weeks, have no overt evidence of

             be likely to interfere with the study procedures or results.

          -  Patients with baseline QTc &gt; 480 msec.

          -  Inability to swallow capsules.

          -  Known hypersensitivity to any of the components of niraparib or prior hypersensitivity
             reactions to that class of drugs.

          -  Known hypersensitivity reaction to temozolomide or any of its components, or
             dacarbazine (DTIC) if enrolled on ARM 1 or irinotecan or any of its components if
             enrolled on ARM 2

          -  Concomitant use of any other investigational or anticancer agent(s).

          -  Pregnant patients or patients who are breast feeding. Subjects capable of pregnancy
