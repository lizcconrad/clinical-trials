  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The proposed study is a randomized, double blind placebo controlled multicenter study to
      determine the effectiveness of mirabegron in the treatment of neurogenic bladder dysfunction.
      Patients will be randomized into one of two trial arms: mirabegron 25mg for two weeks, with
      escalation to 50mg for the remaining 8 weeks, or matched placebo capsule for two weeks, with
      placebo escalation for the remaining 8 weeks. Each of these trial arms will be stratified
      based on whether the patient is already taking an anticholinergic medication or not. The
      study will treat a total of 144 patients (72 with placebo, 72 with mirabegron). The study
      hypothesis is that mirabegron will result in a statistically superior (increased) urodynamic
      bladder capacity.

      The study duration is 12 weeks, with a 1-4 week run in period where no active or placebo
      treatment will be administered. The primary outcome measure will be based on an increase in
      urodynamic bladder capacity. Secondary outcome measures will be additional urodynamic
      parameters, urinary symptom scales, urinary quality of life indices, and voiding diary
      results.

      Patients who are over 18 years of age with a diagnosis of multiple sclerosis or spinal cord
      injury will be eligible to participate. All eligible patients will have urodynamic studies
      performed within 4 weeks of trial enrollment, and at the end of study (week 9-10). Adverse
      events and study outcomes will be assessed at predefined study time points.
