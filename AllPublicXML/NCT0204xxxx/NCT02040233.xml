  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a study to investigate the safety, tolerability and early effects on cardiac function
      of the partial A1 agonist BAY1067197 in patients with chronic heart failure. BAY1067197 will
      be applied once daily over 7 days in addition to standard therapy including a beta-blocker.
      The aim of the study is to assess if a 7 day treatment with BAY1067197 is well tolerated when
      given on top of standard therapy for heart failure. Furthermore, the study aims to assess if
      cardiac function improves in the early course of therapy.

    <description>A complete standard 12-lead ECG was recorded and evaluated parameters such as heart rate, PR/PQinterval, QRSD interval, QT interval (uncorrected). Clinically relevant findings in ECG such as a second degree AV-block Mobitz type I (Wenkebach), Mobitz type II - or any third-degree AV block were recorded and reported. A 24-hour Holter ECG was recorded with a standard Holter ECG recorder for the purpose of detecting AV blocks, no higher degree AV blocks &gt; 1 or clinically relevant effect on HR were observed during Holter monitoring periods.</description>

LVEF is the fraction of blood (in percent) pumped out of the heart's left ventricular chamber with each heart beat, and is a measure of cardiac output for the heart.</description>
