    <textblock>
      ACT-PFK-158 is a novel anti-cancer agent that inhibits glucose uptake in cancer cells. The
      primary objective of the study will be to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and to
      describe any dose limiting toxicity. The secondary objectives of the study will be to
      determine the safety profile of the drug, to determine the pharmacokinetic profile, to
      identify any anti-tumor activity, and to determine the pharmacodynamic profile of
      ACT-PFK-158.

          8. Patients must have adequate renal function as evidenced by a serum creatinine ≤ 1.5 X
             ULN for the reference laboratory OR a calculated creatinine clearance of ≥ 60 mL/min
             by the Cockroft-Gault equation.

          9. Patients must have adequate hepatic function as evidenced by AST and ALT values ≤ 3 X
             ULN (≤ 5 X ULN if the liver is known to be involved by metastatic disease) and serum
             total bilirubin values of ≤ 1.5 X ULN for the reference laboratory.

         10. Patients must have INR and PTT values ≤ 1.5X ULN for the reference laboratory.

         11. Patients must be recovered from the effects of any prior chemotherapy, radiotherapy or
             surgery (i.e., toxicity no worse than Grade 1); for patients who have been on
             monoclonal antibody therapy, at least one half-life or 4 weeks (whichever is shorter)
             should have elapsed prior to the first scheduled day of dosing with PFK-158.

         12. Patients on prior investigational agents must wait at least 5 half-lives before
             enrollment into the trial, or 4 weeks if the half-life of the investigational agent is
             not known.

         13. Female patients of childbearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test within 7
             days of the start of treatment.

         14. Women of childbearing potential and men with female sexual partners of childbearing
