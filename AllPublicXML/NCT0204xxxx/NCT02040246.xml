  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The prevalence of diabetes is up to 11.6% according to the data released in 2013 by the China
      Noncommunicable Disease Surveillance Group.Less than 40% of all diagnosed-diabetes were well
      controlled.Among all kinds of antidiabetic medications, metformin is recommended as the
      first-line antihyperglycemic management for type 2 diabetes. Insulin secretagogue,repaglinide
      is still one of the most widely used antidiabetic medications in China. However, there were
      few studies comparing the effects of these two medications on glycaemic control in Chinese
      patients with type 2 diabetes.
