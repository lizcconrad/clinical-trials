    <textblock>
      Although regorafenib was approved for use in patients who had progressive GIST despite
      imatinib and/or sunitinib on the basis of phase II and phase III data, it has not been
      examined in a systematic fashion in patients with other forms of sarcoma.

      Given the activity of sorafenib, sunitinib and pazopanib in soft tissue sarcomas, and
      evidence of activity of sorafenib in osteogenic sarcoma and possibly Ewing/Ewing-like
      sarcoma, there is precedent to examine SMOKIs (small molecule oral kinase inhibitors) such as
      regorafenib in sarcomas other than GIST. It is also recognized that SMOKIs (small molecule
      oral kinase inhibitors)such as regorafenib, sorafenib, pazopanib, and sunitinib have
      overlapping panels of kinases that are inhibited simultaneously. While not equivalent, most
      of these SMOKIs (small molecule oral kinase inhibitors) block vascular endothelial growth
      factor and platelet derived growth factors receptors (VEGFRs and PDGFRs), speaking to a
      common mechanism of action of several of these agents.
