  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Highest treatment efficacy in patients with refractory myeloma may be achieved with regimens
      combining novel agents and alkylating agents. However, in applying this approach the patients
      are at substantial risks of a critical myelosuppression. Pomalidomide demonstrates
      significant activity in combination with Dexamethasone in relapsed or refractory multiple
      myeloma. This trial is an attempt to further improve the efficacy of
      Pomalidomide/Dexamethasone as well as to balance efficacy and toxicity. Integration of
      Cyclophosphamide in the treatment in case of suboptimal response or first evidence of
      progressive disease has the aim to significantly increase duration of treatment that should
      have a positive impact on PFS. It is furthermore an attempt to optimize the potential of
      Pomalidomide in the antimyeloma efficacy. Based on the recent findings, that myeloma is a
      disease with a wide clonal heterogeneity, combination treatment in case of suboptimal myeloma
      control might lead to a more effective suppression especially of aggressive subclones and
      might reduce early resistance. In addition, with the goal of keeping the individual patient
      as long as possible under an effective IMiD treatment, the potential of the drug might be
      optimized according to the current view of maintenance treatment resulting ideally in an
      outgrowth of indolent clones in the bone marrow niche.
