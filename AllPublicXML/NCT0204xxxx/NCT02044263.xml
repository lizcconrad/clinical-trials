  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: Insomnia is a highly prevalent and disabling disorder where Cognitive Behavior
      Therapy for Insomnia (CBT-I) is established as the best available treatment. Still, only a
      negligible number of patients with insomnia receive this treatment. One potential way of
      improving the dissemination of CBT-I is by using online adaptations of CBT-I. This is a new
      method for delivering CBT-I and it is not known how effective online treatment is compared to
      face-to-face CBT-I. This trial's purpose is to compare face-to-face CBT-I with online CBT-I.
      Because of the great advantage of online treatment in both availability and cost, the trial
      is designed as a noninferiority trial.

      Aim: To test if online CBT-I is noninferior in reducing insomnia complaints compared with
      CBT-I as delivered face-to-face by a therapist.

    <description>Computer program SHUTi is based on the same theoretical model of insomnia and involves the same interventions as ordinary CBT-I: a structured treatment focusing on education, behaviors and cognitions. Specifically, CBT-I usually consists of one or more of the following: psychoeducation about sleep, sleep restriction therapy, stimulus control, relaxation techniques, and challenging beliefs and perception of sleep.</description>
