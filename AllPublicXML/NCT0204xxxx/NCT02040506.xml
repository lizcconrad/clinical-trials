    <textblock>
      This study will examine the safety and tolerability of IGN523 administered as an IV infusion.
      The main purpose of the study is to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD), which is the
      highest dose that does not cause unacceptable side effects of IGN523 in patients with acute
      myeloid leukemia (AML). The MTD will be determined by observing the dose-limiting toxicities
      (the side effects that prevent further increases in dose) of IGN523. In addition, the
      pharmacokinetic profile and anti-leukemia activity of IGN523 will be assessed. A recommended
      Phase 2 dose (RP2D) of IGN523 will be identified, on the basis of safety, pharmacokinetic
      (PK), and pharmacodynamic (PD) data.

      Primary Objectives:

        -  Evaluate the safety and tolerability of IGN523 administered weekly

        -  Determine the MTD and dose limiting toxicity (DLT) of IGN523 when administered weekly
           during the DLT Evaluation Period

        -  Identify a recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) of IGN523 on the basis of safety, PK, and PD
           data

      Secondary Objectives:

        -  Assess the incidence of antibody formation to IGN523

        -  Characterize the PK of IGN523 in subjects with relapsed or refractory AML

        -  Perform a preliminary assessment of the anti-leukemic activity of IGN523 in subjects
           with relapsed or refractory AML

        -  Perform a preliminary assessment of biologic markers that might predict IGN523
           anti-leukemic activity

      March 2016 Estimated Primary Completion Date: September 2015 (Final data collection for
