  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether a dietary supplement (DS) is effective in
      protecting against sad mood during early cigarette withdrawal. This study will also assess
      whether the dietary supplement will be well tolerated during early cigarette withdrawal.

      100 subjects who smoke at least 20 cigarettes per day will come in on two different days, at
      least one week apart, in a randomized, double blind, within subject, placebo controlled
      design. On each day subjects will refrain from smoking cigarettes for 8 hours. On one day
      subjects will take the active DS (taken in two doses, the evening dose is taken at 22:00 of
      the night before the test day and the morning dose is taken at 8:00 of the test day) and on
      the other day subjects will take placebo (also taken in two doses at the same time points of
      the active DS). Mood symptoms and symptoms of cigarette withdrawal will be compared across
      the two different days. Measures of mood symptom monitoring will include self report on a
      scale of 1 to 10, standardized rater questions about mood, and 6 hours into withdrawal, a
      standardized mood induction will be done with mood assessment. Symptoms of cigarette
      withdrawal will be assessed over the duration of withdrawal with applied standardized rating
      scales by trained raters. For the first 15 - 30 subjects, on each day, a health assessment of
      a physical exam and blood work will be completed at the end of the withdrawal period on both
      test days as well as for the initial assessment appointment.

    <measure>Change in the Visual Analog Scale as Compared to Baseline Compared Across Two Conditions</measure>
    <time_frame>Two sessions at least one week apart</time_frame>
    <description>VAS uses a 10-cm scale for participants to indicate the extent to which each of them feel happy or sad. The change in VAS before versus after sad mood induction is the change score in VAS. The change score on the day with active dietary supplement is compared to the change score on the day with the placebo dietary supplement.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Potential Side Effects Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>Twice on both test days: once in the morning right before the morning active or placebo dietary supplement and once more right after the observed break</time_frame>
    <description>Structured questionnaires to assess the potential occurrence of side effects from Component A and Component B of the DS. In general, reported Component A side effects are fairly minor. Some of the reported side effects include nausea, headaches, fatigue, heartburn and joint pain. Reported side effects with Component B include: drowsiness, nausea and headaches, dizziness, fatigue, and lethargy</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Profile of Mood States</measure>
    <time_frame>Anytime during initial assessment visit. On both test days, at least 1 week apart at: (7:35-8:00); (8:40-9:05); (11:20-11:45); (12:25-12:50); (13:10-13:30); (14:30-14:55)</time_frame>
    <description>The POMS contains 65 adjectives rated by participants on a 5-point scale. Six factors are derived that include tension, depression, anger, fatigue, vigor and confusion.</description>
