    <textblock>
      One of the most common postoperative complications after open cardiac surgery is fluid
      accumulation between the pleural membranes or in the pericardial sac. This study investigates
      the consequence of such fluid accumulations on physical performance, recovery-time, cardiac
      and respiratory complications, and quality of life. Half of the participants will be followed
      closely and offered fluid drainage at a low threshold, and half of the participants will
      follow the current postoperative regimen.

      Introduction:

      Knowledge concerning the impact of pleural and pericardial effusions on physical performance,
      recovery-time, cardiac and respiratory complications, and quality of life after open cardiac
      surgery is scarce. A more aggressive approach towards effusions has been suggested, but
      further studies are needed.

      Objectives:

        1. to determine the size of pleural and pericardial effusion that results in at least 30%
           reduction of physical performance in the 6-minute walk test.

        2. to compare the improvement in physical performance between the intervention group and
           the control group, measured from baseline to day 30 after surgery.

      Materials and methods:

      A randomised controlled intervention trial. Patients admitted for open cardiac surgery
      (aortic valve surgery, coronary artery bypass graft surgery and combinations) will be
      randomised into either an intervention group or a control group. The intervention group will
      be followed with physical tests and ultrasonic examination the month following surgery.
      Pleural or pericardial effusion of a predefined size will be drained. The control group will
      follow the current postoperative regimen.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>change in walking distance before and after intervention</measure>
    <time_frame>day 4, day 15, day 30</time_frame>
    <description>The primary outcome measure is the change in walking distance before and after pleuracentesis, subsequently the size of pleural effusion (both cm measured on ultrasound and drained volume) that results in a reduction of distance in the 6 minute walk test of at least 30%.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>change in walking distance from baseline to day 30 after surgery</measure>
    <time_frame>day 0 and day 30</time_frame>
    <description>The difference in walking distance from before surgery (day 0) to after surgery (day 30) will be compared between the intervention arm (+ pleuracentesis) and the control arm (standard postoperative regimen)</description>

    <measure>needle pleuracentesis versus pigtail catheter</measure>
    <time_frame>day 0, day 4, day 15 and day 30</time_frame>
    <description>To asses how much of the pleural effusion is drained when performing needle puncture instead of inserting a pigtail catheter. Secondary to compare the complication rate of the two procedures.</description>

    <description>The group will follow the current postoperative regimen. In addition they will be followed with ultrasound examination, clinical examination, spirometry examination and 6 minute walk test. In case of either a) pleural effusion &gt; 400ml OR b) pleural effusion&lt; 400ml with symptoms in rest or during the walk test, the effusion will be drained and examinations will be repeated. In case of pericardial effusion of predefined size and location, either the surgeon on call or a cardiologist will be consulted.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Age &gt;18 years.

          -  Admitted for elective aortic valve surgery, coronary artery bypass graft surgery or
             combinations.

          -  Be able to understand the written and oral patient information and to give informed
             consent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Surgical combinations involving the mitral valve since they are already examined with
             full echocardiography prior to discharge, which may influence protocol driven
             decisions.
