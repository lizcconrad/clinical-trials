  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will determine whether Ataciguat (HMR1766) is well-tolerated in patients with mild
      to moderate calcific aortic valve stenosis. The primary focus of these studies will be on
      changes in blood pressure and orthostatic tolerance (i.e., ability to stand up without
      passing out), and determining whether treatment with Ataciguat results in significant
      reductions in blood pressure in this patient population.

    <description>The primary objective of the current study is to determine whether Ataciguat (HMR1766) is well-tolerated by patients with moderate calcific aortic valve stenosis. In this particular patient population, incidence of orthostatic intolerance/symptomatic hypotension is a potential concern.</description>

In this particular patient population, incidence of orthostatic intolerance/symptomatic hypotension is a potential concern. Transitioning from sitting to standing is a functional test that will allow us to examine the effects of Ataciguat on blood pressure regulation in response to a relevant orthostatic stress.</description>

In this particular patient population, incidence of orthostatic intolerance/symptomatic hypotension is a potential concern. Tilt table testing will allow us to examine the effects of Ataciguat on blood pressure regulation in response to a tightly controlled orthostatic stress.</description>

    <description>The primary objective of the current study is to determine whether Ataciguat (HMR1766) is well-tolerated by patients with moderate calcific aortic valve stenosis. In this particular patient population, incidence of orthostatic intolerance/symptomatic hypotension is a potential concern. Evaluating subject perceptions of light-headedness/orthostatic intolerance will help us to understand the relationship between changes in blood pressure and changes in symptoms in this patient population before and after treatment with Ataciguat.</description>
