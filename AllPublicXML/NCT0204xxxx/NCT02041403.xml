  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      An observational trial aiming to verify whether does any relationship exist between renal
      resistive index and postoperative outcome in major high risk surgery
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Renal resistive index was measured just after major high risk operations and then patients
      were observed searching for any surgical and medical-related complications during the first
      post-operative week
