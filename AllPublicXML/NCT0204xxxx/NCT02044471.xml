  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Continuous-flow (CF) left ventricular assist devices (LVADs) are an important tool in the
      treatment of end-stage heart failure, affording patients significantly improved quantity and
      quality of life. In recent years, tens of thousands of LVADs have been implanted worldwide,
      with nearly 1,000 at the Texas Heart Institute (THI). Despite the benefits from LVAD therapy,
      one major weakness is the high frequency of late strokes, reported up to 19%. CF LVADs
      minimize or remove the pulsatility within the blood system, introducing a new and
      incompletely understood physiology.

      Increased sympathetic (&quot;fight or flight&quot; nervous system) tone secondary to lack of pulse in
      the blood system can cause high blood pressure, with subsequent hemorrhaging strokes
      (bleeding into the brain) are one possible explanation for this high adverse event rate in CF
      LVAD patients. A simple intervention to decrease the increased sympathetic tone is called
      &quot;ischemic conditioning&quot;; a sphygmomanometer (blood pressure cuff) is placed on the patient's
      arm to compress a major artery (ischemia) with subsequent release of the cuff (reperfusion)
      for set periods of time. This has been shown to reduce blood pressure and major adverse
      cardiovascular events in other patient populations.

      We plan to conduct a trial to evaluate this intervention, ischemic conditioning, in patients
      with CF LVADs. We hypothesize that IC will cause a reduction in blood pressure and strokes in
      this patient population.

    <description>Our intervention will be ischemic conditioning (IC) remotely applied using a sphygmomanometer. We will use the standard, validated protocol, which is inflation of the sphygmomanometer to 200 mmHg for 5 minutes, then deflation with 5 minutes of reperfusion, repeated for 3 cycles (total 30 minutes). This will be done in the dominant arm, twice daily.
Once patients are discharged home on a stable pharmacotherapy regimen, they will be expected to follow the above intervention for 6 weeks, followed by another 6 weeks in the control (no intervention) phase. Patients will be randomized as to which phase they begin the study.</description>
