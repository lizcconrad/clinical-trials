  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Endoscopic implantation of plastic or covered metal stents is widely used in a variety of
      benign pancreaticobiliary diseases, including duct stricture, large or difficult stones, bile
      or pancreatic juice leak, etc. There are some late-stage adverse events after stent
      insertion, such as stent occlusion, proximal or distal migration, secondary duct injury and
      failure of stent removal, etc. The longer the stents were inserted, more likely the adverse
      events would happen.

      Although the optimal time of stent placement has not been well established, it has been
      recommended that plastic stent should be removed/exchanged within 3-4 months and covered
      metal stent be removed within 6 months. However, it was not uncommon that patients with stent
      implantation did not follow the recommendation of further stent management by endoscopists.

      Many methods have been used to improve the adherence of patients in medical service. With the
      advance of mobile technology and popular use of mobile phones, it was believed that the
      patient-centered outcome could be improved by mobile telecommunication with the timely
      support of a patient by a health professional. Thus we hypothesize that mobile technology,
      reminding the patients the necessity of stent management in time by short message service
      (SMS), might increase the patient adherence in patients with benign pancreaticobiliary
      diseases after ERCP.

    <description>Each month after stent implantation, one investigator sent a text massage by SMS to inform patients the necessity of regular stent removal/exchange and the disadvantage of delayed management, and to remind them the appropriate date back to the hospital for stent management. Patients were requested to response by SMS and were encouraged to contact with the investigator if they had any questions about stent management.</description>

    <description>After stent implantation, all patients received oral instruction about further management. If single or multiple plastic stents were inserted, patients were informed back to our hospital at 3 months for stent removal/exchange; if FCSEMS was inserted, they were informed back to the hospital at 6 months.</description>
