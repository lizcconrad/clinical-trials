  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      An adverse event (AE) is defined as unintended injury or complication, which results in
      disability, death or prolongation of hospital stay, and is caused by healthcare management
      (including omissions) rather than the patient's disease. Retrospective record reviews in
      several countries have shown that 2,9% to 16,6% of patients in acute hospitals experience one
      or more AEs. A patient with an AE may require a higher level of care. Although all AEs are
      important, preventable AEs that result in an upgraded level of patient care are of particular
      concern. In this study it's defined as an unplanned admission to intensive care unit (ICU) or
      a Mobile Emergency Team (MET) intervention. The objectives of this study are to determine the
      incidence of (preventable) adverse events requiring ICU admission or MET intervention and to
      assess the level of harm of each AE.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  All patients being transferred to a higher level of care during the study period
             (November 2011 - May 2012)

          -  In practice, the higher level of care means

          -  (1) (re)admission to the Intensive Care Unit from other care units in the hospital
             providing lower intensity care,

          -  (2) to an intervention by a Medical Emergency Team due to an unanticipated change in
             the patient's clinical status
