  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      From the British Thoracic Guidelines1 and a PUBMED search there are no randomised controlled
      trials exploring optimum antibiotic duration for chest infections. The standard course of
      intravenous antibiotics for exacerbations of bronchiectasis is 14 days. This is a preliminary
      open labelled study to assess whether it is feasible to stop treatment earlier (day 8 or day
      11) if the bacterial load is low or absent at days 7 or day 10 (it takes 24 hours for the
      results to be processed). All patients will therefore have a minimum of 7 days intravenous
      antibiotics. The intravenous antibiotic chosen is routinely used for exacerbations in
      bronchiectasis.

      Our hypothesis is that patients could have personalised treatment and be able to stop
      antibiotics when the sputum bacterial load is low (&lt;10^6 colony forming units/ml (cfu/ml)).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      We will investigate 90 patients with bronchiectasis who are developing an exacerbation as
      defined by the British Thoracic Society guidelines requiring intravenous antibiotics.

      After being consented, patients will be randomly allocated to one of two arms (computer
      generated). 45 patients will have length of treatment guided by the bacterial load and 45
      patients will have 14 days IV Meropenem.

      Next they will all attend for their baseline visit. Here, they will be asked to provide a 24
      hour sputum collected the day prior to the visit, a spontaneous sample collected within 4
      hours from rising (sample used for sputum colour and microbiological analysis), undergo
      spirometry testing, incremental shuttle walk test, blood sampling (for inflammatory markers
      Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate, C Reactive Protein, Full Blood Count, procalcitonin), fill
      out a leicester cough questionnaire to assess their cough (LCQ) and a health related quality
      of life questionnaire (St George's respiratory questionnaire, SGRQ).

      All patients will be started on intravenous meropenem 2g, tds (assuming no previous
      documented resistant microbiology results or allergies).

      They will all return on day 7 for a check on their clinical progress. At this time they will
      again provide a 24hour sputum, spontaneous sputum sample and blood samples as documented
      above. Arm one (intervention arm) will have their antibiotics stopped on day 8 if the
      bacterial load is less than 10^6cfu/ml. Arm two will continue intravenous meropenem
      regardless of bacterial count.

      All patients will return again on day 10, they will again provide a 24hour sputum,
      spontaneous sputum sample and blood samples as documented above. Arm one (intervention arm)
      will have their antibiotics stopped on day 11 if the bacterial load is less than 10^6cfu/ml.
      Arm two will continue intravenous meropenem regardless of bacterial count.

      All patients will return on day 14. All above assessments as on baseline will be repeated
      except the LCQ and SGRQ. All antibiotics for all patients will stop after 14 days of
      treatment.

      All patients will return on day 21 where all the above assessments will be repeated. The LCQ
      and SGRQ will be completed on day 21. The date of and time to next exacerbation will be
      recorded at the next routine outpatient appointment.

    <time_frame>21 days</time_frame>
    <description>Clinical recovery defined in this study is based on our clinical experience and our study evaluating useful endpoints in monitoring exacerbations.
Clinical recovery is defined as: patients feeling better (quantitatively assessed using a 4 point or more improvement in St George's Respiratory Questionnaire or a 1.3 unit improvement or more in the Leicester Cough Questionnaire) and either a reduction in sputum purulence (purulent to mucopurulent, mucoid or no sputum; or mucopurulent to mucoid or no sputum) or a 50% reduction or more in 24 hour sputum volume. The reason for the two options here is that in clinical practice, some patients sputum purulence does not change but have a significant reduction in sputum volume.</description>
