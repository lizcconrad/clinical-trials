    <textblock>
      Chronic neck pain (CNP) is defined as pain or intense discomfort in the lateral or back of
      the neck with an establishment and/or persistence period of over 12 weeks.

      The socio-economic system is seriously affected by chronic neck pain due to direct and
      indirect costs on the health system Physical exercise is used to improve physical function
      and reduce the symptoms of pain and stiffness due to chronic neck pain.

      It has been demonstrated that therapeutic exercise in water is effective to improve
      functional capacity and symptoms in patients with chronic neck pain. In adition, health
      education and posture is an important component of the overall treatment of neck pain.

      Interventions that integrate physical activity, adapted swimming and health education as an
      intervention for chronic neck pain sufferers have not been found. Furthermore the aim of this
      study is to analyse the effect of a physiothperapy treatment that combine adapted swimming,
      therapeutic exercise and health education in patients with chronic neck pain.

      Hypothesis: the present intervention will be an effective tool to treat patients suffering
      chronic neck pain.

      Methods: chronic neck pain patients from a community-based centre will be recruite
      participate in this prospective study.

      Intervention: 60 min session: 30 min of land exercise dedicated to improve mobility, motor
      control, resistance and strengthening of the neck muscles, 30 min of adapted swimming with
      aerobic exercise keeping neutral neck position by using a snorkel. Health education will be
      provided by the physiotherapist before and during the sessions using a decalogue on chronic
      neck pain and constant repetition of brief advice.

      Study outcomes: disability (Neck Disability Index), physical and mental health state and
      quality of life of patients (SF-12 and EuroQoL 5D respectively).

      Differences between baseline data and that at the 8-week follow-up were calculated for all
      outcome variables.

      Statistical Analysis: descriptive statistics. Analysis of the normal distribution of the
      variables using the KS-test. Comparison of variables pre - post intervencición: T-Student for
      parametric variables and Wilcoxon test for non parametric variables.

      Data will be analysed descriptively and for statistical significance using Statistical
      Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) (version 17.0 for Windows, Illinois, USA).
