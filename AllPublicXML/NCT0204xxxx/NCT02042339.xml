  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hyperbaric oxygenation (HBO) involves breathing of 100% oxygen under elevated ambient
      pressure. In correlation to the pressure level oxygen dissolves in the plasma resulting in an
      increase of total oxygen in the body. The elevated tissue levels of oxygen may persist for
      hours, instigating healing processes in wounds caused by disturbances in of perfusion in
      small vessels, a condition often found in patient with diabetes.

      We plan a prospective, double-blind randomized clinical study in 80 patients with chronic
      diabetic ulcer. All will have optimum treatment of diabetes. The HBO group will be given HBO
      at 2.4 bar, 90 min., 30 sessions, controls will have sham HBO. Routine wound care will be
      identical in both groups. Before, during and after treatment (3, 6 and 12 months), a number
      of monitoring and imaging procedures will be done, cells in the bloodstream indicating
      improved healing will be determined.

      Hypothesis: HBO will instigate the healing process in the majority of patients with chronic
      diabetic leg ulcer, provided the patency of the large vessels is given.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      We plan a prospective, double-blind randomized clinical study (phase III) in 80 patients with
      diabetes mellitus. All of them will receive the optimum metabolic treatment for their
      underlying disease. The treatment group will be administered HBO according to the problem
      wound schedule, the controls will have sham treatment in the hyperbaric chamber. Routine
      wound care (dressings, physiotherapy, antibiotics if necessary) will be identical in both
      groups and according to its clinical needs.

      Before treatment, indocyanine green videoangiography (ICG), transcutaneous (partial) oxygen
      pressure (TcPO2) and LifeViz 3D (three-dimensional medical imaging and reconstruction)
      documentation will be done and endothelial progenitor cells (EPC) as well as markers of bone
      metabolism will be determined in all patients.

      The measurements will be repeated according to the schedule during the treatment period and
      at controls after 3, 6 and 12 months.

    <description>The patients will be transferred into the chamber like the treatment group.

    <description>The treatment will be applied in a large walk-in drive-in hyperbaric chamber. Depending on their general condition, the patients will sit in comfortable chairs or remain in their own wheelchair or bed in relaxed position. They will be accompanied by a medical attendant or by a hyperbaric physician if necessary due to their general condition. Oxygen 100% will be distributed over a tight fitting oxygen-mask connected to the overboard-dumping system. The treatment will be administered according to the so-called problem-wound schedule once a day for six consecutive weeks. On weekends and on public holidays the patients will be off therapy.</description>
