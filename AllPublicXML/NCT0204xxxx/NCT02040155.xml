  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an observational study. The purpose is to determine the feasibility of using a novel
      nano-scintillator fiber-optic dosimeter (nanoFOD) for the real time dosimetric monitoring of
      brachytherapy treatment. Women with gynecologic cancers treated with brachytherapy as part of
      their standard therapeutic regimen will represent the study population.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Brachytherapy is a curative treatment for many malignancies, brachytherapy delivers a high
      radiation dose to a very small and well-specified target within a patient with cancer. Yet
      there is no current convenient, inexpensive, real time method of confirming the radiation
      dose delivered. There is no current monitoring or fail-safe device for radiation oncologists
      and their patients if the radiation dose becomes too high, especially to radiation sensitive
      organs, or conversely if the target receives too little dose.High dose-rate(HDR)
      brachytherapy is a highly advanced radiation-based cancer treatment, where a very small
      radioactive source, Iridium-192, is placed in or near the tumor through a catheter or
      channel. This provides a high radiation dose to the tumor in 5-15 minutes with a precise
      location, while minimizing radiation exposure to surrounding tissue and organs. This protocol
      will determine the feasibility of using a novel nano-material based fiber-optic dosimeter
      (nanoFOD) device, with dimensions less than 1 mm wide, to measure real-time, pin-point,
      in-vivo radiation dose given during radiation therapy treatments. The size of the device
      allows placement through a catheter or channel near areas of interest, or within already
      placed brachytherapy delivery catheters.

    <description>This will only be possible in a subset of women whose implant geometry will result in a radially symmetric dose cloud (i.e. vaginal cylinder cases) so that both the nanoFOD and the reference dosimeter may be placed in a position expected to have the same, or closely similar dose.</description>

    <description>Feasibility in this context will mean ease of clinical use (subjective), lack of device failures, and accordance of the nanoFOD dosimetric reading with the planned dose as calculated by the planning software.</description>
