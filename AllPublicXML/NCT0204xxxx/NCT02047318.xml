        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Experienced an adverse event or serious adverse event (SAE) related to the study drug
             during the LUM001-302 protocol that led to the discontinuation of the subject from the
             core study.

          -  Any conditions or abnormalities (including laboratory abnormalities) which, in the
