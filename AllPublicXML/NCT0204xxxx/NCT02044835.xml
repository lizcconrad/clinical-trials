      • Background: Since evidence show that renal-artery stenting did not confer a significant
      benefit with respect to the prevention of clinical events when added to comprehensive,
      multifactorial medical therapy in people with atherosclerotic renal-artery stenosis[1], the
      aim of our study was to confirm Fu-zheng-qu-zhuo (FZQZc) oral liquid, a herbal medicine,
      combined with optimal medical therapy of internal medicine (OMT), including anti-platelet
      therapy and other protocol-driven medical therapies to control blood pressure and glucose and
      lipid levels in accordance with guidelines,resulted in greater renal function protection in
      patients with atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis ( ARAS) compared with OMT alone.

      Methods : A randomized, placebo-controlled, single centre clinical design. Sixty patients
      with diagnosed atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis and had chronic kidney disease stage 3
      will be recruited, and will be randomized into two groups in a 1:1 ratio ( FZQZ and placebo
      Group, 30 respectively). FZQZ Oral liquid or placebo 20 ml every time, three times a day for
      different groups, meanwhile, all participants in both treatment groups received OMT, 6 months
      therapeutic period. Serum creatinine, estimated glomerular filtration rate(eGFR), urine
      protein, and cardiovascular and renal events (a composite end point of death from
      cardiovascular or renal causes, myocardial infarction, stroke, hospitalization for congestive
      heart failure, progressive renal insufficiency, or the need for renal-replacement therapy)
      will be compared between the Groups as the outcome.
