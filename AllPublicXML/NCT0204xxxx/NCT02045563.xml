  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      -  Our research hypothesis is to show that a certain number of genetic polymorphisms of the
           proteins involved in glucose, lipid and adipocyte metabolism are factors that favour the
           development of steatosis in patients with Type 2 diabetes.

        -  We also wish to evaluate more thoroughly lipid anomalies associated with the presence of
           steatosis, notably with regard to monocyte expression of LDL receptors. We hypothesize
           that hepatic steatosis is accompanied by activation of transcription factors involved in
           lipogenesis, notably SREBP factors. The activation of these factors could cause an
           increase in the expression of LDL receptors, leading to increased LDL catabolism.

        -  Chronological description of the study During an outpatient consultation at the
           endocrinology department, diabetic patients, programmed to undergo an examination to
           assess their diabetes will be invited to participate in the study. Once written informed
           consent has been provided and clinical data has been recorded, patients with type 1 or
           type 2 diabetes will have standard biological examination, which is systematically done
           in such patients (Fasting glycemia, HBA1c, aspartate aminotransferase, alanine amino
           transferase, Gammaglutamyl-transferases, PAL, bilirubin, blood proteins, albuminemia,
           Total Cholesterol total, HDL cholesterol, triglycerides, Sedimentation Rate, C-reactive
           protein, fibrinogen).

      As well as the systematic biological tests, 3 additional tubes will be taken to screen for
      genetic polymorphism in 3 proteins (Microsomal Transfer Protein, Adiponectin receptor - 1,
      Apolipoprotein A - II).

      IN addition, magnetic resonance imaging and magnetic resonance spectroscopy will be done to
      look for the presence of liver steatosis and to measure carotid intima-media thickness.
