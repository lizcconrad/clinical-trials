  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators' purpose is to study which exercise training modality: aerobic physical
      activity in conjunction with either resistance training or balance training, is most
      beneficial in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD 4-5: GFR &lt; 30 ml/min/1.73mUP[2]).
      Furthermore, our purpose is to evaluate the long-term effects of exercise training on
      functional status, cardiovascular morbidity, blood pressure control, heart rate variability,
      cardiac function, inflammation, body composition, nutritional status, progression of uraemia
      and health related quality of life. This interventional study is prospective, randomized and
      controlled comprising 150 prevalent and incident patients from our outpatient clinic.
      Patients are invited to participate in the study consecutively, irrespective of basic
      functional status. At start patients are randomised either to resistance or balance training
      and the programme is adapted and individualised to each patient's actual physical status and
      ability. The exercise prescription is to exercise for 30 minutes/day, 5 days/week, keeping
      the intensity constant at a level of &quot;somewhat strenuous&quot; to &quot;strenuous&quot; on the Borg scale
      rate of perceived exertion. The total observation period is 12 months with checks every four
      months. Although exercise training is a recommended therapy in CKD, there is a lack of
      medical and scientific evidence on optimal prescription. We hope that this study will provide
      evidence-based knowledge on exercise prescription and its effects on various risk factors in
      CKD patients. Finally, if patients achieve a higher degree of physical functional capacity
      they should be able to maintain an autonomous lifestyle, resulting in considerable reductions
      in societal costs for care and transportation.
