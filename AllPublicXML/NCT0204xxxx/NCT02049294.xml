    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate whether addition of Omalizumab enables a
      reduction in the dose of prednisone in patients with asthma and eosinophilic bronchitis.

      This will be a double-blind placebo-controlled, 3-centre, randomized parallel group trial
      divided into two sequential study periods.

      Period 1: After establishing the minimum dose of prednisone to maintain asthma control and
      maintain sputum eosinophils &lt;3%, subjects will be randomized to either placebo or Omalizumab
      for 16 weeks (either once monthly for 4 months or every 2 weeks for 4 months).

      Period 2: standardised prednisone reduction at intervals of 4-weeks until there is a clinical
      and eosinophilic exacerbation or bothersome steroid withdrawal effects. If patients have an
      exacerbation, they will be treated with prednisone. This patient will continue on Omalizumab
      or placebo during the entire duration of the study but not continue the phase of steroid
      reduction.
