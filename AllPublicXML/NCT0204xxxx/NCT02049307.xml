      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the potential effectiveness of losartan (100mg
      daily) for reducing inflammation and improving immune recovery.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Our general goal is to evaluate the potential effectiveness of losartan (100mg daily) for
      reducing inflammation and improving immune recovery, given the potential for these treatment
      effects to reduce risk for long-term non-AIDS-defining complications among older HIV positive
      participants. Prior to conducting a clinical outcome trial, candidate treatments must be
      studied among HIV positive patients given the unique pathogenesis driving inflammation and
      disease risk.

      The potential benefits of losartan (100mg daily) will be studied among HIV positive
      individuals over age 50 years whose CD4 counts remain â‰¤600 cells/mm3. Participants (n=110, 55
      per group) will be randomized to receive losartan or matching placebo daily. After
      randomization, participants will start losartan (or placebo) at a dose of 50mg once daily,
      increasing to 100mg once daily at the 2-week study visit pending results of a week 2 toxicity
      lab evaluation (see 2.4 below for criteria). Following month 1, participants will return for
      follow-up study visit procedures at months 3, 6, 9, and 12.

      Changes from baseline in measures of inflammation, immune activation, immune recovery and
      fibrosis within lymphatic tissues will be studied. The primary outcome will be the average of
      IL-6 levels over 12 months, and the main secondary outcome will be change in CD4 count in
      blood over 12 months.
