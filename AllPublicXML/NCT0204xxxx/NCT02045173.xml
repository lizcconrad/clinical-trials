      The purpose of the study is to compare, three months after implantable
      cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) or cardiac resynchronization therapy-defibrillator (CRT-D),
      the apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) obtained from conventional in-lab NPSG/NPG (AHIPSG) with
      similar indices obtained from autoscoring algorithms of the ApneaScan™, an implantable
      impedance-based respiration sensor (AHIAS).

      This is a prospective, multi center, phase-IV with blinded analysis and central reading of
      polysomnography trial.

      The study is performed in patients with a standard CRT-D or Implantable Cardioverter
      Defibrillator (ICD) devices indication. A total of 160 subjects will be recruited in France.
      The study duration is 03 months for each subject.
