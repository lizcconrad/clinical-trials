  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This project will evaluate the impact of resistance training on the synthesis and release of
      hormones and growth factors from the musculoskeletal system and the extent to which the
      communicative capacity influences glucose homeostasis In turn, the contribution of glucose
      regulation on the musculoskeletal system will also be evaluated. This small study will serve
      as a pilot/feasibility study to define a protocol for implementation of a resistance training
      intervention in the pediatric population. To establish feasibility, this study population is
      limited to overweight African American boys ages 7-11 years.

      In light of well-established accolades of resistance training, historical recommendations for
      avoidance among the pediatric population have deterred implementation of resistance training
      interventions in young adolescents. However, contemporary data indicating a profound benefit
      of resistance training to the skeletal system in pre-adolescents has led to the Academy of
      Sports Medicine, as well as various other pediatric health interest groups, to support
      supervised programs incorporating resistance training in young children, emphasizing large
      muscle and core strengthening. To date, such trials have not been conducted in the pediatric
      population

    <textblock>
      Early adolescence (pre-puberty) is associated with many physiological changes with the
      intersection of metabolic pathways and body composition at the core. Lifestyle behaviors
      provide substantial influence and the rise of sedentary behavior particularly among this
      population can exert profound disruption. Metabolic dysfunction associated with limited
      activity and thus limited strain on the muscles and bones is associated with poor
      musculoskeletal health. Metabolic disturbance within the system during critical periods of
      development such as pre-puberty confers long-term health consequences.

      Communication across systems is reliant upon various hormones which interact on the
      regulation of glucose homeostasis, bone metabolism, and muscle development. While it is
      well-established that bone and muscle growth are dependent upon fuel utilization, factors
      secreted by bone and muscle have been recently shown to play an interactive role in glucose
      homeostasis. Data derived primarily from animal models have demonstrated maintenance of
      physiological levels promote optimal growth and development, whereas these hormones appear to
      have adverse effects when levels are altered. While the data in animals is compelling,
      translation in humans has not been conducted.

      Speculatively, impaired glucose homeostasis, much attributable to decreased strain on the
      musculoskeletal system, promotes impairments in physiological roles of these hormones. As a
      result, disordered development may be of consequence, such that the bones grow bigger yet
      have impaired quality, and delivery of fuel to muscle is compromised. Obesity-induced
      perturbations in metabolism and tissue partitioning may be an added stress to the system,
      impairing muscle function, power, performance and overall quality. Strategies that optimize
      the protective effects of the musculoskeletal system may be encompassed by forced stress on
      the system via resistance training, known to influence synthesis and release of hormones
      involved in fuel delivery and utilization by muscle and bone. The strategy proposed will
      target optimization of musculoskeletal health, promoting synthesis and release of
      musculoskeletal-derived signals providing protection on metabolic health at a critical period
      of development.
