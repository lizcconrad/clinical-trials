  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It is still controversial about the necessity of endoscopy ultrasound guide fine needle
      aspiration (EUS-FNA) on diagnosis of pancreatic cystic lesions(PCL).The aim of this study is
      to find the influence of EUS-FNA on diagnosis and suggestions of EUS specialists.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      First, the investigators will send only EUS images of patients with PCL to diagnosis
      committee that is consisted with 8 EUS specialists from different countries.The diagnosis
      will be collected. Then the investigators send the results of EUS-FNA. The diagnosis and
      suggestions will be collected again. The investigators will calculate how much diagnosis has
      been changed because of results of EUS-FNA. The investigators will also follow up these
      patients for 5 years at least to find if these patients benefit from EUS-FNA and
      complications such as needle tract seeding metastases.
