  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study looks to assess whether monitoring sedation status in mechanically-ventilated
      Medical Surgical Intensive Care Unit (MSICU) patients using Bispectral index (BIS)
      monitor-augmented sedation monitoring as opposed to Richmond Agitation Sedation Scale (RASS)
      score is associated with decreased duration of mechanical ventilation.

      Investigators hypothesize that using BIS monitors to help monitor depth of sedation in
      mechanically ventilated ICU patient will result in a decreased duration of mechanical
      ventilation when compared to solely utilizing clinical sedation scales such as RASS.

      Participants will be randomized into two groups, the intervention group will receive sedation
      monitoring with BIS monitoring plus RASS. The control group will receive sedation monitoring
      with RASS score only. Randomization will be accomplished through online randomization
      software.

      For randomization purposes, the intervention group will be labeled as the &quot;A&quot; group. The
      control group will labeled as the &quot;B&quot; group. In the BIS-augmented group, sedation requirement
      will be titrated according to an average of BIS reading in the 5 minute period prior to
      assessment with a goal of maintaining a value of (60-70) in addition to a RASS score goal of
      (-1 to -2), provided no noxious stimulation such as endotracheal suctioning and/or wound
      dressing has occurred for at least 30 minutes, BIS values have been stable for at least 5
      minutes, signal quality index (&gt;80%), minimal EMG interference (&lt;50%), patient is not
      shivering, and patient does not have warmer or other devices that may produce an electric
      current on their body or nearby. In the RASS group, sedation requirements will be titrated to
      maintain a RASS score of (-1 to -2), will be assessed via the nurse taking care of the
      patient provided no noxious stimulation has occurred for at least 30 minutes prior to
      assessment.

      Both groups will have sedation assessment at least every 6 hours during a 12 hour shift and
      as needed as per ICU RN and/or physician. Nurses will be free to exercise their judgment if
      they deem that their patients require more or less sedation that is inconsistent with
      patient's BIS or RASS score, they will, however, be required to provide a rationale for their
      judgment and record such events on a special form created for this study.
