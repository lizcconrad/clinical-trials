  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Erlotinib, an anti-cancer agent targeting the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), is an
      active treatment of patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Effect of treatment is
      primary seen in patients harboring a mutation in the EGFR. However, 10-15% of patients does
      not harbor a mutation but respond as well. Identifying these patients is a problem and
      methods are lacking.

      Studies have shown that an early 18F FDG-PET might can predict response and outcome in these
      patients, but further studies are needed to confirm these findings.
