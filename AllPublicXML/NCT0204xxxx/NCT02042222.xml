    <textblock>
      Sickle cell disease is a disorder in which red blood cells (RBCs) are abnormally shaped. This
      can result in painful episodes, serious infections, chronic anemia (a decrease in the number
      of red blood cells), and damage to body organs. Hydroxyurea therapy offers significant
      benefits for infants, children, and adolescents with sickle cell anemia. These include a
      reduction in the frequency of pain crises and acute chest syndrome (inflammation of the
      lungs) and an increase in hemoglobin (the oxygen-carrying protein) in the blood. Patients on
      hydroxyurea who receive a maximum tolerated dose (MTD) that is specific for them have greater
      clinical benefit than those who receive a standard lower dose. There is, however, no way
      currently to predict the MTD for individual patients. As such, MTD for each patient is
      currently determined by gradual increases in the dose over several months. This process is
      time-consuming, requires monthly clinic visits, and delays the benefits of hydroxyurea
      therapy.

      Our research group has come up with an equation that could be used to predict each patient's
      MTD using baseline clinical and laboratory measures before starting hydroxyurea treatment.
      The purpose of this research study is to compare the use of our equation for predicting MTD
      to the current standard practice of gradually increasing the hydroxyurea dose until MTD is
      reached. We want to see if the use of our predictive equation will allow us to achieve MTD
      faster and with no more side effects than with the standard practice.

      To be eligible to participate in this study, patients must have decided that they want to
      begin hydroxyurea therapy. Patients choosing to participate in this study will be assigned
      randomly (like flipping a coin) to one of two hydroxyurea treatment groups. Both groups of
      patients will receive hydroxyurea treatment, but the determination of the starting
      hydroxyurea dose will be different between the two groups:

        1. Group 1: The standard (dose increase) group: Patients assigned to this group will be
           treated following the method that is currently standard for all patients starting
           hydroxyurea at our institution. All patients will be started at a dose of 20 milligrams
           per kilogram of body weight. Dose changes will be made every eight weeks until the
           patient is judged to be at his or her MTD.

        2. Group 2: The alternative (dose-prediction) group: Patients assigned to this group will
           have their predicted MTD determined using our dose-prediction equation and will be
           started directly at this dose.

      Patients in both groups will be assessed in clinic two weeks after starting treatment, and
      then monthly to see if they are having any side effects to hydroxyurea. We will also check to
      see if the MTD has been reached. Once it is decided that the patient has reached their
      maximum dose, they will continue to be monitored for two additional clinic visits
      (approximately eight additional weeks) to complete collection of end-of-study biological
      blood and urine samples and to ensure that there is no late harmful effects from hydroxyurea.
      The maximum time the patient will be on the study is 12 months after starting hydroxyurea
      therapy.

      Patients will also be asked to participate in 2 optional associated studies.

        1. Pharmacokinetic (PK) studies: The purpose of these studies is to analyze the body's
           absorption and clearance of hydroxyurea. Patients participating in these studies will
           receive a one-time dose of hydroxyurea, with blood sample collection at the following
           time points: right before the dose of hydroxyurea, 15 minutes, 30 minutes, 60 minutes, 2
           hours, and 4 hours after the dose. There will be a total of six blood samples drawn,
           each about half a teaspoon (2 milliliters).

        2. Biologic studies: The purpose of these studies is to determine the effect of hydroxyurea
           therapy on blood and urine markers of the severity of sickle cell disease. Patients
           participating in these studies they will have one blood sample of 2 teaspoons (10
           milliliters) and a urine sample collected before starting hydroxyurea therapy. Another
           blood and urine sample will be collected when they complete the study. These samples
           will be used to analyze markers associated with the following disease processes in
           sickle cell disease:

             1. inflammation, blood vessel damage and oxidative stress.

             2. blood viscosity.

             3. early kidney disease.

             4. early brain disease.

             5. altered function of white blood cells, red blood cells, and platelets.

    <description>Half of the subjects initiating hydroxyurea will be randomly assigned to the standard treatment arm, consisting of escalation to the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of hydroxyurea utilizing a previously published algorithm. Hydroxyurea dosing will commence at 20+/-2.5 mg/kg/day, given as a single daily oral dose. All patients will be offered the choice of a liquid formulation of hydroxyurea or hydroxyurea tablets, with the exact dose rounded up or down to the closest practical dose based on the chosen formulation but not differing from the intended dose by more than 2.5 mg/kg. It should take approximately 6 to 12 months for subjects to reach the MTD on this arm.</description>

    <description>Half of the subjects initiating hydroxyurea therapy will be assigned to the alternative treatment arm of the study. In this arm, the predicted hydroxyurea MTD will be calculated for each subject.
As in the dose-escalation arm, the exact dose will be rounded up or down to the closest practical dose based on the chosen formulation of hydroxyurea. Since the most common toxicity associated with hydroxyurea use is excessive myelosuppression, the maximum dose at which a subject in the dose-prediction arm will be started will be 30 mg/kg/day or 2000 mg/day. Patients with a higher predicted MTD will subsequently be escalated to this higher dose after four weeks on therapy if there is no evidence of toxicity.</description>
