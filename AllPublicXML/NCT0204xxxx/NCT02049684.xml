  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Rotator cuff tears (injury to the muscle or tendons which stabilise the shoulder) are one of
      the most common conditions affecting the shoulder. Small and medium sized rotator cuff tears
      can be managed with arthroscopic or keyhole surgery. Very large or massive tears are
      difficult to operate on and often have poor rates of healing. As a result surgeons have
      investigated the use of products to improve the outcome of surgery on massive tears.

      The product that the investigators are currently using to try to improve the outcome of
      surgery for massive rotator cuff tears is called a patch. The patch provides a scaffold to
      support the muscles of the rotator cuff. Studies of rotator cuff surgery using similar
      patches have found that recovery is improved and there is a lower rate of postsurgical
      problems. The aim of this study is to look at whether using the patch improves pain and the
      clinical function of the shoulder after surgery. In addition, the investigators would like to
      understand how the patch works. To do this the investigators will scan (take images of) the
      shoulder using magnetic resonance imaging to look at the muscle damage in the shoulder before
      and after surgery.
