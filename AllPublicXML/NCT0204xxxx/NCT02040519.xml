    <textblock>
      Sacral neuromodulation (SNM) is a minimally invasive secondary treatment for overactive
      bladder syndrome (OAB) or for non-obstructive urinary retention (NOR), when refractory to
      conservative treatment. Success rates range from 70 to 80%, and good long-term results are
      reported. The working mechanism of SNM is not completely understood, and the only prognostic
      factor for good response to this treatment is a successful test stimulation period. There is
      no consensus on the duration of this test stimulation period. The experience in our clinic
      during test stimulation period is that for responders it takes up to one week to achieve
      maximal effect, after the system is turned 'on'. On the other hand the investigators notice
      that after turning the neuromodulation system 'off', it will take a few hours for symptoms to
      return to the baseline situation. The fact is: no information concerning the so called &quot;time
      of onset&quot; and &quot;time of offset&quot; (or popular called: wash-in / wash-out) of sacral
      neuromodulation is available in current literature.
