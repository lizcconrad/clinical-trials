    <textblock>
      This trial is an exploratory study in order to determine whether the ingestion of one type of
      protein (milk protein/CHO/Fat) vs.placebo (CHO/Fat) 2 hours before bed time results in the
      extension of the post-prandial window of anabolism during the night by increasing whole body
      protein balance as well as muscle protein fractional synthesis rate (FSR).

    <measure>muscle FSR determination</measure>
    <time_frame>Within 24 hours of product intake</time_frame>
    <description>Muscle protein FSR (fractional synthesis rate) will be determined using primed constant infusions of [13C6] phenylalanine for 5 hours starting around from 03:00 a.m. (see flow chart attached). Whole body protein balance will be measured throughout the night using [15N]glycine (200mg) which will be orally taken with the trial product in the evening.</description>

    <time_frame>Within 24 hours after product intake</time_frame>
    <description>Activation of signaling pathways involved in skeletal muscle protein balance will be assessed through use of immunohistochemistry</description>

    <measure>Glucose metabolism</measure>
    <time_frame>Within 24 hours after product intake</time_frame>
    <description>Glucose metabolism will be assessed from circulating concentrations of glucose and insulin.</description>
