    <textblock>
      This study is being conducted to measure the relative bioavailability of the original gelatin
      capsule formulation and a new formulation, immediate release (IR) tablet of Afuresertib
      (GSK2110183). The study will be composed of Screening, Treatment, and Follow-up Periods. A
      subject's total time involved in the study will be approximately 9 weeks. The study will
      enroll approximately 18 healthy volunteers.
