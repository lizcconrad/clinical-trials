      The investigators aim to investigate the related risk factors and the independent risk
      factors of early recurrence, the rate of disease free survival and the rate of recurrence,
      furthermore, develop a rating system of risk factors.

      -  Radio frequency ablation (RFA), as a curable technology, has been recommended for the
           treatment of early hepatoma by the guidelines from different countries, however, the
           early (within 2 years) recurrence rate after this operation remains high, and as the
           investigators know the studies of the risk factors and the independent risk factor of
           this recurrence are only from retrospective studies, a multi-center prospective
           case-control study is needed. Therefore, the investigators aim to adopt this method to
           further identify the factor(s) from 86 patients with early hepatoma whom fulfill the
           diagnostic criteria of Milan and accept complete RFA during hospitalization.

        -  After RFA, informed consents are acquired from patients and the follow-up begins.
           According to the follow-up data, patients are assigned to the recurrence group or the
           un-recurrence group. The monitoring data of the risk factors was inputted to the Epi
           Date software and the statistic was analyzed by SPSS 18.0. The statistical method
           includes: Chi-square test for the comparison of rate, Logistical regression analysis for
           the related risk factors and the independent risk factors.
