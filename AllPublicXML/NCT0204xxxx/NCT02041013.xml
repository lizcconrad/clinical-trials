  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The research goal is to explore the use and effects of a custom-recordable audio discharge
      instruction card (Talking Card) in the pediatric health care setting. This study will address
      a primary, experimental research question: can pediatric asthma control be improved through
      the distribution of a custom-recorded audio asthma instruction card to parents at the health
      provider's office? Secondary, descriptive objectives will be to evaluate feasibility of
      Talking Card delivery and to collect and summarize parental reactions to the design and use
      of the audio discharge instruction card.

      The specific aims of this study are:

        1. To compare the change in mean Childhood Asthma Control Test (C-ACT) scores for children
           aged 4 through 11 years with uncontrolled asthma receiving a custom-recorded asthma
           instruction card to the change in mean C-ACT scores for those receiving usual care.

        2. To measure the use and impressions of a custom-recordable audio asthma discharge
           instruction card among primary caregivers of children with uncontrolled asthma through
           quantitative and qualitative survey questions.

      The investigators hypothesize that:

      1) Asthma control in children 4 through 11 years of age with uncontrolled asthma, as measured
      by the C-ACT, will improve to a greater extent among those receiving a custom-recordable
      audio discharge instruction card than among those receiving usual care.
