  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Posterior fossa mutism (PFM) occurs in up to 30% of patients after resection of a posterior
      fossa tumor, most commonly a medulloblastoma. PFM is characterized by delayed onset of mutism
      1-6 days after surgery that can spontaneously improve on average from 7-8 weeks later. Few
      patients recover normal speech. Most of their speech continues to be marked by dysarthria,
      dysfluency and slowed rate. Researchers have not identified the pathophysiologic mechanism
      for PFM nor have they found a cure. Despite the improvements in speech, patients with PFM
      have shown multiple areas of neurocognitive deficits 12 months after diagnosis. Few studies
      have looked at long term outcomes of patients affected by PFM. We propose to survey patients
      who developed PFM after resection of a medulloblastoma to determine long term effects of PFM
      on patient's quality of life.

        Patients must be between 8 years and 25 years of age at the time of enrollment and have
        completed treatment for their initial diagnosis of medulloblastoma.

        We will identify a group of patients who developed PFM as well as a group of appropriately
        matched controls with regard to age, sex and treatment protocol who did not develop PFM.
