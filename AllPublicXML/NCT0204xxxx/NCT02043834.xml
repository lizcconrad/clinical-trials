  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the present study is to evaluate an innovative virtual reality-based balance
      training intervention for improving clinically relevant motor performances (balance and gait)
      in older adults.

      We hypothesize that the virtual reality-based balance training intervention will improve
      balance and gait performances in older adults compared to a control group receiving usual
      care only.
