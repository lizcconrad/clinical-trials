  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Drug resistant TB is increasing and in order to enchance the efficacy of the current drugs,
      individualized therapy using plasma drug concentrations and minimal inhibitory concentration
      (MIC) determination may be of importance. This concept is defined as therapeutic drug
      monitoring (TDM).

      In this pilot study our hypothesis is that the ratio between MIC and drug concentration data
      is correlated to the bacterial load measured as time to positive liquid culture (TTP).

      In two sites in Sweden (Linköping and Karolinska Hospital Solna, Stockholm), 25 patients with
      pulmonary tuberculosis will be recruited. MIC-determination of Mycobacterium tuberculosis
      will be performed in BACTEC 960 MGIT and drug concentration will be determined at 2, 4 and 12
      weeks after treatment initiation using LC-MS/MS methodology. Sputum cultures will be obtained
      at 0, 2 days, 7 days, 2 weeks, 4 weeks and 8 weeks and TTP will be measured in duplicate
      samples. Clinical follow up according to WHO criteria will be performed 1 year after
      completion of treatment.
