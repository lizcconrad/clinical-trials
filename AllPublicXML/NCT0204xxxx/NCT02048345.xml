      The aim of this study is to understand the behavior of posaconazol gives as a suspension and
      solution in the gastrointestinal tract in human volunteers. The investigators know that
      supersaturation for this compound can be achieved by the influence of the gastrointestinal
      tract: The acid environment of the stomach creates a optimized environment for the basic
      compound to reach a high solubility, while the neutral environment of the small intestine
      creates a low solubility environment for the compound. The transit from stomach to small
      intestine gives the opportunity for the drug to create a supersaturated solution. Giving the
      drug as a solution to the healthy volunteer makes sure that precipitation is not occurring in
      the stomach and that precipitation has to happen in the small intestine. After all,
      supersaturation is a state that is not thermodynamic stable and always will want to
      precipitate. Giving the drug as a suspension to the healthy volunteers, can make it possible
      that still some particles of the drug are not in dissolution and that those particles will
      flow to the small intestine where other particles easily can bind to. This will make that
      almost the whole supersaturated solution is immediately precipitated.

      The investigators want to give the suspension by the authorized drug called Noxafil. On the
      other hand an aqueous solution will be made by adjusting the pH to 1.2 (which is conform with
      the pH of the stomach) and given to the volunteers by the stomach catheter. This 2
      formulations will be tested in a fasted state and a fed state (by giving 2 Ensure plus shakes
      to the volunteers before the experiment starts). After intake of the formulation, gastric and
      duodenal fluids will be aspirated by the catheters and analyzed at their laboratory. So the
      four conditions the investigators want to study are:

        1. 10 mL Suspension of posaconazol (Noxafil 40mg/mL) together with a glass of 240 mL water
           in a fasted state

        2. 250 mL solution of posaconazol, by dissolving 2.6 mL autohorized suspension (Noxafil) in
           247 mL water, adjusted to pH 1.2 by hydrochloric acid given to the volunteer in a fasted
           state.

        3. 10 mL Suspension of posaconazol (Noxafil 40mg/mL) together with a glass of 240 mL water
           in a fed state (by giving 20 minute before intake of the formulation, 2 ensure plus
           shakes)

        4. 250 mL solution of posaconazol, by dissolving 2.6 mL autohorized suspension (Noxafil) in
           247 mL water, adjusted to pH 1.2 by hydrochloric acid given to the volunteer in a fed
           state (by giving 20 minute before intake of the formulation, 2 ensure plus shakes).

      By getting more knowledge about the behavior of posaconazol (interplay supersaturation /
      precipitation) more insights can be achieved for the development of supersaturating drug
      delivery systems.
