  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Human papilloma virus (HPV) is a recognised cause of some head and neck cancers. Important
      questions remain however, regarding the role of specific types of HPV, their effect on
      prognosis and different subtypes of oral, pharyngeal and laryngeal cancer, interaction with
      other risk factors (such as smoking and alcohol), and potential geographical differences in
      the effect of HPV.

      Via the Alcohol-Related Cancers and Genetic Susceptibility in Europe (ARCAGE) study, which is
      an international collaboartive case-control study conducted in 15 centres in 11 European
      countries, and pooling our results with the HPV-AHEAD consortium, we will conduct a
      systematic analysis of HPV subtypes known or suspected to be involved in head and neck
      cancer. This will involve investigation of HPV risk by tumour site (oral, oropharynx,
      hypopharynx, larynx), tumour stage, country, sex and age, and whether risk is modified by
      exposure to other known or suspected carcinogens including tobacco, alcohol and medical
      history.

      It is intended that this work will contribute to the development of evidence that may feed
      into treatment protocols for these cancers as well as evaluations of the feasibility for
      extending HPV vaccine programs.
