  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-center study to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of three
      investigational devices, the Cook Custom Aortic Endograft, the Zenith t-Branch Endovascular
      Graft, and the Surgeon-Modified Endografts in the treatment of aortic pathologies involving
      the visceral vessels.

      The three investigational devices offer an endovascular approach to treat complex aortic
      pathologies that cannot be treated with commercially available devices. This customized,
      endovascular approach has the potential to decrease hospital length of stay, pulmonary
      complications, and in-hospital mortality.

      Once the participant has signed the approved informed consent the following tests will be
      done to determine final subject eligibility and which device will be used:

      Clinical Exam, Blood Tests, CT Scans (with and without contrast), Abdominal Device X-ray, and
      Angiography.

      The participants will be followed for 5 years.

    <description>Participants will receive the following: Clinical Exam, Blood Tests, CT Scans (with and without contrast) or Ultrasound, Abdominal Device X-ray, and Angiography. These tests will aid in the sizing of the the Zenith t-Branch Endovascular Graft. The Zenith t-Branch Endovascular Graft is a tubular graft with four branches and a covered stent at the proximal end that contains barbs for proximal fixation of the device. The graft is designed to be connected with celiac, superior mesenteric and two renal arteries via self-expanding covered bridging stents.</description>

             planned ≤30 days of the endovascular repair.

          -  Unstable angina, defined as a progressive increase in symptoms, new onset at rest or
             nocturnal angina, or onset of prolonged angina.

          -  Proximal Landing zone &lt;20mm in length. The proximal landing zone can be within zones 2
             through 8, with least 20mm of proximal seal and fixation in aorta or Dacron.

          -  Proximal neck, defined as the thoracic aorta distal to the native left carotid artery,
             measured outer wall to outer wall on a sectional image (CT) &gt;41 mm in diameter or &lt; 18
             mm in diameter

          -  Distal landing zone &lt;20mm in length if the landing zone is in the aorta, or &lt;20mm if
             the landing zone is in the iliac arteries or in Dacron (in the event the patient has
             had a previous or concomitant aortic or aorto-iliac reconstruction).

          -  Untreatable branch vessel stenosis.

          -  Anatomy that would not allow maintenance of at least one patent hypogastric artery.

          -  Signs that the inferior mesenteric artery is indispensable (i.e. angiographic
             visualization or a large IMA, filling of SMA via collaterals, stenosis of celiac or
             SMA or oblique views) and the indispensible IMA is not amenable to treatment with a
             graft branch or fenestration.
