      Phase 1, single-center, placebo-controlled, single-blind, first-in-human, single ascending
      dose (SAD) study followed by a multiple-dose cohort in healthy male and female subjects.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Approximately 20 male and female healthy adult subjects, 18 to 50 years of age at the time of
      dosing, will participate in this study. The SAD phase of the study is planned to have up to 4
      cohorts with 4 subjects (3 receiving TKM-100802 and 1 receiving saline) in each cohort.
      Additional cohorts may be enrolled in the SAD phase if a MTD is not established after the
      initial 4 cohorts. In the multiple-dose phase, one cohort is planned with 4 subjects (3
      receiving TKM-100802 and 1 receiving saline) at a maximum dose of 0.24 mg/kg TKM-100802.

    <description>Subjects will be monitored for treatment-emergent and dose-limiting toxicity (DLT). If there are any adverse events (changes from baseline in laboratory parameters, vitals and/or infusion reactions) during these monitoring periods, the Independent Safety Committee, will discuss the dosing of the remaining subjects.
Before proceeding to the next dose cohort, the Independent Safety Committee will evaluate whether dose escalation will be permitted based on demonstration of adequate safety and tolerability.</description>
