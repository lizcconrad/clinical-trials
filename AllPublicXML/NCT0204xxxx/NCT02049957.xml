          3. Female patients 18 years of age or older who:Are postmenopausal for at least 1 year
             before the Screening visit, where menopause is defined by: Age ≥ 55 years and 1 year

             oSurgical menopause with bilateral oophorectomy

             Note: Ovarian radiation or treatment with a luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone
             agonist (goserelin acetate or leuprolide acetate) is not permitted for induction of
             ovarian suppression.

          4. Patients who have a history of brain metastasis are eligible for the study provided
             that all the following criteria are met:

               -  Brain metastases which have been treated

               -  No evidence of disease progression for ≥ 3 months or hemorrhage after treatment

               -  Off-treatment with dexamethasone for 4 weeks before administration of the first
                  dose of MLN0128

               -  No ongoing requirement for dexamethasone or anti-epileptic drugs

          5. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status 0 to 2.

          6. Clinical laboratory values as specified below within 4 weeks before the first dose of
             MLN0128:

               -  Bone marrow reserve consistent with absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥ 1.5 x
                  10^9/L; platelet count ≥ 100 x 10^9/L; hemoglobin ≥ 9 g/dL

               -  Total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x the upper limit of the normal range (ULN), aspartate
                  aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) ≤ 2.5 x ULN (≤ 5 x ULN
                  if liver metastases are present)

               -  Creatinine clearance ≥ 50 mL/min based either on Cockcroft-Gault estimate or
                  based on a 12- or 24-hour urine collection

          7. Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) within 5 absolute percentage points of
             institutional standard of normal as measured by echocardiogram (ECHO) or multiple
             gated acquisition scan (MUGA) within 4 weeks before the first dose of MLN0128 (ie, if
             the institutional standard of normal is 50%, LVEF may be as low as 45% to be eligible
             for the study).

          8. Able to provide paraffin blocks or a minimum of 10 unstained slides of available
             archival tumor tissues (paraffin blocks are preferred). If archival tumor tissue is
             not available, a tumor biopsy may be performed before the patient begins treatment
             with MLN0128. If fewer than 10 slides are available or the tumor content/area
             requirements are not met, study eligibility will be determined upon discussion with
             the sponsor.

          9. Ability to swallow oral medications, willingness to perform mucositis prophylaxis, and
             suitable venous access for the study-required blood sampling.

         10. Voluntary written consent must be given before the performance of any study related
             procedure not part of standard medical care, with the understanding that consent may
             be withdrawn by the patient at any time without prejudice to future medical care.

             Phase 1b Only: In addition to the previously mentioned inclusion criteria, each
             patient must meet the following inclusion criterion to be enrolled in the phase 1b
             portion of the study:

         11. Patients may have SD or disease progression during their most recent treatment with
             exemestane or fulvestrant, or everolimus in combination with either exemestane (any
             country) or fulvestrant (US only). Exemestane or fulvestrant in combination with
             MLN0128 can also be initiated as a new line of therapy.

             Phase 2 Only: In addition to the previously mentioned inclusion criteria, each patient
             must meet all of the following inclusion criteria to be enrolled in the phase 2
             portion of the study:

         12. Measureable disease defined as follows:

               -  At least 1 extra-osseous lesion that can be accurately measured in at least 1
                  dimension. The lesion must measure ≥ 20 mm with conventional imaging techniques
                  or ≥ 10 mm with spiral CT or MRI, or

               -  Bone lesions (lytic or mixed [lytic plus sclerotic]) in the absence of measurable
                  disease as defined above

         13. Patients must have had disease progression during treatment with everolimus in
             combination with either exemestane (any country) or fulvestrant (US only) (duration of
             treatment ≥ 4 weeks) and must have tolerated everolimus treatment in combination with
             exemestane (any country) or fulvestrant (US only) adequately according to the treating
             physician's judgment. Everolimus in combination with exemestane or fulvestrant is not
             required to be the most recent treatment before enrollment, but progression on the
             most recent anticancer therapy is required for enrollment.

        Exclusion Criteria

        Patients meeting any of the following exclusion criteria are not to be enrolled in the
        study:
