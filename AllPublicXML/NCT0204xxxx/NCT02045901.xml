  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to compare the efficacy of Diclegis for the treatment
      of nausea and vomiting of pregnancy (NVP) in pregnant adolescents aged 12 to 17 years with
      placebo.

      The secondary objective of this study is to compare the safety of Diclegis in pregnant
      adolescents aged 12 to 17 years with placebo by assessing differences in the severity and
      occurrence of maternal adverse events (AEs).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter study in the treatment of NVP that will actively recruit pregnant
      adolescents from approximately 14-16 study sites in the United States. After obtaining
      informed consent on Day 1, a medical examination will be conducted to ensure eligibility.
      Participants will be randomized to receive Diclegis or placebo. On Day 1, all participants
      will take 2 tablets of study drug at bedtime. On Days 2 to 14, participants will take 2
      tablets of study drug at bedtime. The minimum dosage will be 2 tablets daily at bedtime,
      increasing, when indicated, to the maximal dosage of 4 tablets per day on Days 3 to 14.
      Participants will be required to complete a diary daily to assess the severity of their NVP
      by using the validated Pregnancy Unique Quantification of Emesis (PUQE) and to record any AEs
      experienced; the Global Assessment of Well being scale will be completed only on Days 1, 8
      and 15. Participants will receive telephone calls daily to assess whether the current dosing
      regimen is sufficient at relieving NVP symptoms, to review study procedures, and to address
      her questions/concerns. Participants will return to the clinic for evaluation on Day 4 (±1
      day) and Day 15 (±1 day) for an end of study visit.

      Eligible participants are those between 12 and 17 years of age, pregnant with a gestational
      age of 7 to 15 weeks + 0 days, suffering from NVP, with a PUQE score ≥6, and who have not
      responded to conservative management consisting of dietary/lifestyle advice according to the
      2004 American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology (ACOG) Practice Bulletin.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. The participant is a pregnant female between the following ages: at least 12 years on
             the day of recruitment (ie, Day 1) and not yet 18 years on the last day of the study
             (ie, Day 15).

          2. The participant must provide written informed consent and/or assent to participate in

             required study visits.

          3. The participant's entry ultrasound indicates a viable pregnancy and confirms
             gestational age of the fetus is 7-15 weeks + 0 days at the anticipated time of the
             first dose of study drug provided that her NVP symptoms began &lt;/= 10 weeks gestation.
             If an ultrasound was performed within 4 weeks of the study entry visit, and results
             can be obtained, an additional ultrasound is not necessary.

          4. The participant is suffering from NVP and has a PUQE score ≥6.

          5. The participant has not responded to conservative management consisting of
             dietary/lifestyle advice according to the 2004 ACOG Practice Bulletin.

          6. The participant agrees, if on a multivitamin, to continue on her current dose of
             multivitamin for the duration of the trial.

          7. The participant does not plan termination of the pregnancy.

          8. On the basis of medical history, physical examination and screening laboratory tests,
             the participant is judged to be in good health.

          9. The participant must be able to swallow the study drug whole (ie, without splitting,
             crushing, or chewing the tablets).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. The investigator confirms the participant's nausea and vomiting is of etiology other
             than NVP.

          2. The participant has gestational trophoblastic disease or multifetal gestation.

          3. The participant has a condition for which antihistamines, in the opinion of the
             investigator, are contraindicated (eg, epilepsy, alcoholism, glaucoma, chronic lung
             disease, urinary retention, and heart block).

          4. The participant has a known hypersensitivity to doxylamine succinate other
             ethanolamine derivative antihistamines, pyridoxine hydrochloride, or any inactive
             ingredient in the Diclegis or placebo formulation.

          5. The participant is taking a monoamine oxidase inhibitor.

             the previous 48 hours or plans to do so during the study.

          7. The participant is using drugs that have anticholinergic activity (eg, tricyclic
             antidepressants).

          8. The participant is taking multivitamins containing more than 10 mg of vitamin B6 or
             plans to do so during the study.

          9. The participant is taking supplementary vitamin B6 in addition to any multivitamin
             preparation or plans to do so during the study (e.g, total vitamin B6 greater than 10
