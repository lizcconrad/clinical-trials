  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This observational study will investigate the efficacy, safety, tolerability and symptom
      control of GIOTRIF (Afatinib) in daily routine first-line therapy in patients with locally
      advanced or metastatic NSCLC harboring EGFR-mutations. Eligible NSCLC patients, for whom the
      treating physician has decided to initiate treatment with GIOTRIF in first line according to
      the local label, will be followed up for approximately 24 months.
