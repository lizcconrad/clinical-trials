    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this study is to assess the effect of the
      Daclatasvir/Asunaprevir/BMS-791325 fixed dose combination (FDC) tablet on the
      pharmacokinetics of the cocktail CYP and transporter probe substrates and to assess the
      effect of the DCV 3DAA FDC [DCV 3DAA FDC = fixed dose combination formulation of 3
      direct-acting antivirals (3DAA) (DCV 30 mg, ASV 200 mg, and BMS-791325 75 mg)] + BMS-791325
      75-mg single-agent tablet on the Pharmacokinetic (PK) of the cocktail CYP and transporter
      probe substrates.

      Primary purpose: Other: study is being conducted to investigate the potential drug-drug
      interactions (DDIs) when the Daclatasvir/Asunaprevir/BMS-791325 FDC formulation is
      coadministered with a cocktail of cytochrome P450 (CYP) probe substrates (Caffeine,
      Metoprolol, Montelukast, Flurbiprofen, Omeprazole, and Midazolam) and transporter probe
      substrates (Digoxin and Pravastatin) in healthy subjects. It is also intended to characterize
      the PK of Daclatasvir (DCV), Asunaprevir (ASV), BMS-791325, and its major metabolite,
      BMS-794712, at steady state.
