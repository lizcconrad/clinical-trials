  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Liver cysts are fluid filled cavities located in the liver. They are present in 2-11% of the
      general population, typically not causing any symptoms or complications. However, in a small
      subset of patients complaints of pain, abdominal fullness and distension, dyspnea and nausea
      occur.

      Currently, aspiration and sclerotherapy is a treatment of choice in symptomatic patients with
      a large dominant liver cyst. However, studies reported early fluid reaccumulation and
      relative high recurrence rates of cyst growth after aspiration sclerotherapy ultimately
      leading to re-interventions. In this respect, somatostatin analogues are promising agents
      known for its volume reducing effect in patients with polycystic liver disease.

      In this study the investigators want to evaluate the effect of combining aspiration
      sclerotherapy with the multi-receptor binding, long-acting somatostatin analogue Pasireotide.

      The investigators hypothesize that administrating pasireotide before and after aspiration
      sclerotherapy could prevent early fluid reaccumulation and thereby result in a greater
      reduction of cyst diameter. Moreover, the investigators expect a lower rate of cyst
      recurrence and subsequently lower need for re-interventions.
