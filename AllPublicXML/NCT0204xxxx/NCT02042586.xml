  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators believe that the application of non-linear methods of analysis using the
      ganglion and neural network technique will make it possible to analyse all of the complex
      data obtained in patients with hip osteoarthritis before and then after total hip
      replacement, and should allow us to identify a combination of objective variables to classify
      the surgery as &quot; successful &quot; or &quot; unsuccessful &quot;.

      To this end, the study will take place as follows:

      Step 1: Screening, and inclusion. Step 2: Evaluation of the hip osteoarthritis and analysis
      of locomotor activity Step 3: Total hip replacement Step 4: Clinical evaluation of locomotor
      activity carried out between 6 months and 1 year after the THR Step 5: Data analysis
