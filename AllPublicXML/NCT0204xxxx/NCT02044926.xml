      Purpose:

      To investigate diagnostic performance of CT and MR in intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm
      with malignant change according to international consensus guidelines 2012.

      Hypothesis: According to 2012 consensus guidelines, enhanced solid component and main
      pancreatic duct size of larger than 10 mm will be significant.

      1. Purpose

             -  To investigate diagnostic performance of CT and MR in intraductal papillary
                mucinous neoplasm with malignant change according to international consensus
                guidelines 2012

        2. Enroll criteria

             -  Patient who is suspected to have pancreas IPMN on imaging

             -  Interval between imaging study and surgery is less than 2 months

             -  Who is scheduled for surgery due to IPMN
