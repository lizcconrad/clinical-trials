  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall aim of the study is to evaluate the performance of Artificial Pancreas or Closed
      Loop Glucose-Sensing Insulin-Delivery system in comparison to current best available
      technology represented by Sensor Augmented Pump Therapy (SAPT) in patients with Type 1
      Diabetes.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      At present, decisions regarding insulin dosing are made by the patient with intermittent
      support from their medical team. Even with glucose sensor augmented insulin pump therapy
      (SAPT), representing the most advanced technology currently available, there are emotional
      and intellectual demands placed upon the patient with the most well-educated, intelligent and
      diligent patients often unable to perfectly match insulin delivery with their varying
      requirements. SAPT does improve glycaemia in comparison with insulin pump therapy alone
      though a significant proportion of patients will still not meet target HbA1c (&lt;7.0%). A
      Closed Loop (CL) system whereby a computerised algorithm reviews continuous glucose
      information to determine a T1D patient's insulin requirements and controls insulin delivery
      will potentially have a major impact upon acute and chronic complications of diabetes as well
      as upon their quality of life. Overnight glycaemic control, without the added challenge of
      meals, physical activity and stress, is a realistic initial application of CL in clinical
      practice.

      This study aims to evaluate insulin pump therapy with an overnight CL system in comparison
      with current best available technology represented by SAPT in Type 1 Diabetes (T1D) patients,
      in both hospital and then at home. Outcomes of interest will include metabolic control and
      performance of the Medtronic CL overnight system compared with SAPT (OL), in both the
      Clinical Trials Centre (CTC) and in the home setting; the relationship between night-time and
      day-time metabolic control with CL and OL and nocturnal clinical, hormonal and inflammatory
      factors that may influence subsequent daytime metabolic control; anti-insulin antibody titres
      and dissociation constants (Rd) upon CL algorithm performance; sleep quality, cognition,
      satisfaction with treatment and psychological parameters.

      A two phase randomised crossover study design is to be employed with the first phase
      conducted for a single night in the clinical trials centre and the second phase over 5 days
      in an ambulatory setting.

    <description>A total of 24 participants with T1 Diabetes with sensor augmented insulin pump therapy (SAPT) experience will be recruited from four tertiary hospitals and will enter an un-masked randomised-control crossover trial, with a run-in period followed by two phases (in-hospital and at-home) in each of two stages (Closed Loop and Open Loop in random order). Closed Loop will be the intervention for this study, and its performance will be assessed compared to Open Loop (control treatment).</description>

    <description>The performance of closed loop system will be compared to open loop system (Sensor Augmented Pump Therapy). Therefore, the Open Loop system will be the control treatment.
In stage 1 of study, participants are randomized to either closed loop (CL) or open loop (OL). In stage 2, all participants will be crossed to the opposite study arm.
Throughout the study, those who randomised to OL will receive exactly the same medical attention as the CL participants.</description>
