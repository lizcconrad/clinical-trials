    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate a type of immunotherapy in which the patient's immune system will be
      stimulated to kill tumor cells. ICT-121 dendritic cell (DC)vaccine is made from patient's
      white blood cells. This vaccine will be tested in patients with recurrent glioblastoma to
      assess safety, tolerability and clinical response. Patient's white blood cells (WBC) will be
      collected from blood and cultured to yield autologous DC. The DC will be mixed with purified
      peptides from the CD133 antigen. The DC vaccine will be given back to the patient over
      several months. The goal is to stimulate the patient's immune system to CD133 to kill the
      patient's glioblastoma tumor cells.

      Immunotherapy holds promise in oncology for the potential to provide targeted anti-tumor
      therapy with minimal adverse events. The goal of this study is to assess immunotherapy
      directed to CD133 in an autologous dendritic cell product called ICT-121. CD133 antigen is
      overexpressed on many types of cancer cells and is associated with shortened survival. CD133
      positive cancer stem cells are resistant to chemotherapy. Patients with recurrent
      glioblastoma who have the HLA A2 phenotype will receive autologous vaccine of DC pulsed with
      purified peptides from CD133.

      Approximately 20 patients with any recurrence of glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) will be
      treated. After informed consent and screening, patients will undergo apheresis to collect
      peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). Monocytes will be purified and cultured into
      dendritic cells (DC) that are pulsed with purified peptides from CD133 antigen. The pulsed
      dendritic cells will then be aliquoted and frozen. Patients will have the autologous DCs
      reinfused intradermally. Patients will receive at least four intradermal injections of the
      autologous DC vaccine and additional vaccines during a maintenance phase. The goal is to
      induce a cytotoxic T cell response to CD133 positive cells. The primary objective of the
      study is to assess safety and tolerability. Clinical response rates will be monitored as well
      as the immune responses to CD133.
