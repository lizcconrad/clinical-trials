  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research is being done to determine if allopurinol can change the metabolism of the oral
      chemotherapeutic medication 6-mercaptopurine (6-MP) in children with acute lymphoblastic
      leukemia (ALL). 6-MP is originally started at a standard dose in children with ALL, but the
      dose is adjusted according to the absolute neutrophil count (ANC). Occasionally, 6-MP doses
      need to be increased in order to get the ANC into a specific target range. Also, increasing
      the 6-MP dose can lead to unwanted side effects, such as inflammation of the liver as shown
      by increases in laboratory values (ALT, aspartate aminotransferase (AST), bilirubin), nausea,
      and abdominal discomfort. Previous studies in children with inflammatory bowel disease has
      shown that combining allopurinol with 6-MP can decrease side effects associated with high
      doses of 6-MP and also increase the efficacy of 6-MP. Allopurinol is approved by the Food and
      Drug Administration for the treatment of tumor lysis syndrome in ALL. Through this research
      study, we hope to show that the combination of allopurinol and 6-MP will be safe, tolerable,
      and effective in children with ALL.

      -  Patients will have several visits to the Pediatric Oncology outpatient clinic. Each
           visit will consist of a physical examination and laboratory evaluation. Each laboratory
           evaluation will consist of taking approximately 10 to 15 milliliters of blood (or
           approximately three teaspoons). These clinic visits may actually coincide with clinic
           visits that were previously scheduled according to the patient's treatment protocol.

        -  At the first study visit, patients will have a physical examination and laboratory
           evaluation. At that visit, patients will be asked to stop taking 6-MP and methotrexate.

        -  At the second study visit, which is one week later, patients will again have a physical
           examination and laboratory evaluation. We will prescribe allopurinol and restart 6-MP
           and methotrexate at half of the patient's previous doses.

        -  Clinic visits for physical examination and laboratory evaluation will be scheduled every
           1-2 weeks for a total of 5 more visits. Doses of allopurinol, 6-MP, and methotrexate may
           be adjusted at these visits based on laboratory values or clinical symptoms.
