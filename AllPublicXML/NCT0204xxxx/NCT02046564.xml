    <measure>The Mean Change From Baseline in the Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) Total Score</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks after the start of the sertraline treatment period (Baseline), 6 weeks after the start of the double-blind period (Last Observation Carried Forward [LOCF])</time_frame>
    <description>The MADRS is a clinician-rated scale which evaluates the level of depression. The MADRS consists of 10 items assessing apparent sadness, reported sadness, inner tension, reduced sleep, reduced appetite, concentration difficulties, lassitude, inability to feel, pessimistic thoughts, suicidal thought. Each item is scored from 0 to 6, with higher scores indicating worse condition.Summed subscales are combined to compute a total score. Total score ranges from 0 to 60, with higher score indicating worse condition.</description>

    <description>The HAM-D is a clinician-rated scale which evaluates the level of depression. The HAM-D consists of 17 items such as depression mood, feeling of guilt, suicide, insomnia, work and activities, retardation, and so on.
Each item is scored from 0 to 2, 3 or 4, with higher scores indicating worse condition. Summed subscales are combined to compute a total score. Total score ranges from 0 to 52, with higher score indicating worse condition.</description>

    <description>The SASS is a self-rating scale which assesses the social motivation and behavior in participants with depression. The SASS consists of 21 items covering the different aspects of social interactions, global social attitude, and self-perception. Each item is scored from 0 to 3, with higher scores indicating better condition.</description>

          <title>The Mean Change From Baseline in the Self-rating Version of Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS-S) Total Score</title>
          <description>The MADRS-S is a patient-reported scale based on MADRS, administered to evaluate the level of depression. This scale consists of 9 items assessing patients' mood, feelings of unease, sleep, appetite, ability to concentrate, initiative, emotional involvement, pessimism and zest for life. Each item is scored from 0 to 3, with higher scores indicating worse condition. Summed subscales are combined to compute a total score. Total score ranges from 0 to 27, with higher score indicating worse condition.</description>
