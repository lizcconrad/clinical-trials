  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In Denmark and the western world, there is an increasing prevalence of obesity probably due
      to a combination of inadequate daily physical activity and a high energy intake. One approach
      to achieve weight loss and change life style is to participate in an intensive supervised
      prolonged life style modification course. The immediate effect is often positive, but over
      time the overall effect is limited as the majority will not maintain weight loss and a
      changed life style.

      In this study we will analyse the results of the intensive lifestyle intervention as it has
      been practised at Ubberup Folk High School over the last 13 years. As some people have
      several stays at Ubberup Folk High School we want to we have a special interest in the effect
      of repeated lifestyle intervention.

      Research question:

      What is the effect of several lifestyle interventions on weight loss maintenance?

      The study design is retrospective and descriptive and will be based on a lifestyle
      intervention, as it has practiced in a real life setting at Ubberup folk high school.
