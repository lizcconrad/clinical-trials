      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  ≥ 18 years of age

          -  Patients with prostate cancer that is recurrent or did not respond to previous hormone
             therapy and/or who have exhausted standard treatment options.

        For the dose escalation parts only:

        Patients who have exhausted standard treatment options with recurrent or refractory cancer
        (ovarian cancer, cervical squamous cell carcinoma, breast cancer, salivary gland cancer,
        endometrial cancer)

          -  Histologically or cytologically documented diagnosis of cancer

          -  Measurable disease according to RECIST Version 1.1 or for prostate cancer also
             evaluable disease according to Prostate Cancer Working Group 2 (PCWG2) eligibility
             criteria or for ovarian cancer also evaluable disease (non-measurable) according to
             Gynaecologic Cancer Intergroup (GCIG) criteria

          -  Absolute neutrophil count ≥1.5 (1500/mm3) and platelets ≥100 × 109/L (without platelet
             transfusion within the last 4 weeks before first study drug administration), and
             haemoglobin ≥9 g/dL at Screening

          -  Alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase ≤2.5 × the upper limit of
             normal (ULN), Total bilirubin ≤1.5 × ULN (exception: patients with liver metastasis
             are allowed to have aspartate aminotransferase ≤5 × ULN and alanine aminotransferase
             ≤5 × ULN) at screening

          -  Albumin ≥26 g/L at Screening

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Concurrent prior treatment-related toxicity of Grade 2 or higher. Exception: any
             toxicity that is in the view of the investigator not a clinically significant safety
             risk for Investigational medicinal product (IMP) administration.

          -  Previous treatment with cytotoxic chemotherapy or other anticancer therapy within 4
             weeks before the first dosing with study drug (at least 6 weeks for mitoxantrone,
             nitrosurea, and bicalutamide).

          -  Treatment with systemic glucocorticosteroids of more than a 2 mg dexamethasone
             equivalent per day or in cases of treatment with ≤2 mg dexamethasone equivalent per
             day:

               1. Dosing was changed within 6 weeks before Screening or

               2. The patient's cancer is responding to glucocorticosteroid intake

          -  Radiation therapy within 4 weeks prior to the first dosing with IMP.

          -  Treatment with a systemic IMP in a clinical trial within 28 days before the Screening
             Visit.

          -  Current or past history of clinically significant gastrointestinal disease or major
             gastrointestinal surgery, malabsorption syndrome, or other conditions that could
             interfere with enteral absorption.

          -  Concurrent clinically significant unrelated systemic illness (e.g., serious infection)
             or significant pulmonary, hepatic, or other organ dysfunction that would compromise
             the patient's ability to tolerate study treatment or would likely interfere with study
             procedures or results.
