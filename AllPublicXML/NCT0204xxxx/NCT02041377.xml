      The purpose of this study was to determine if subjects who have diabetes can operate the
      Investigational Blood Glucose Monitoring System (BGMS) with no training and obtain valid
      glucose results.

    <measure>Number of Self-Test Fingerstick Blood Glucose (BG) Results Within +/- 15 mg/dL (&lt;100 mg/dL) and Within +/- 15% (&gt;=100 mg/dL) of Laboratory Glucose Method</measure>
    <time_frame>1 hour</time_frame>
    <description>Subjects with diabetes self-tested fingerstick blood using an investigational Blood Glucose Monitoring System (BGMS) with no training. BGMS results were compared with subject capillary plasma BG results obtained with a Yellow Springs Instrument (YSI) Analyzer. YSI Analyzer BG results were used to calculate the number of BGMS results within +/-15 mg/dL (&lt;100 mg/dL YSI capillary plasma) and +/-15% (&gt;=100 mg/dL YSI capillary plasma).</description>

    <time_frame>1 hour</time_frame>
    <description>Study staff tested subject venous blood using an investigational Blood Glucose Monitoring System (BGMS). Venous BGMS results were compared with subject venous plasma BG results obtained with a Yellow Springs Instrument (YSI) Analyzer. YSI Analyzer venous plasma BG results were used to calculate the number of BGMS results within +/-15 mg/dL (&lt;100 mg/dL YSI venous plasma) and +/-15% (&gt;=100 mg/dL YSI venous plasma).</description>

          <title>Intended Users of the Monitoring System</title>
          <description>Subjects with diabetes use the Karajishi TS Investigational Blood Glucose Monitoring System with no training. The criteria for the intended use population:
At least 60% of subjects will be younger than age 65
At least 10% of subjects will have type 1 diabetes
Karajishi TS Investigational Blood Glucose Monitoring System: Subjects with diabetes perform self Blood Glucose (BG) tests with capillary fingerstick and palm blood using the Karajishi TS Investigational Blood Glucose Monitoring System with no training. All BG results are compared to reference method results obtained from subject capillary plasma. Also, study staff test subject venous blood and BG results are compared to reference method results obtained from subject venous plasma.</description>
