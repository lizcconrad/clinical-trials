      The study is designed to investigate the effect of physical surroundings on the effect of
      exercise therapy for knee and hip pain.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Context effect have been shown to be influential in health-care settings, such as hospitals.
      This study investigates if context effects can be caused by the physical surroundings of
      exercise.

      The study is designed as a double-blind randomized controlled clinical trial. Patients with
      knee and/or hip pain with a duration of a least 3 months are included in the trial and
      randomly assigned to 3 groups.

        1. Exercise in pre-existing, standard room

        2. Exercise in contextually enhanced room.

        3. Waiting list.

      The intervention consists markedly different between the two exercise rooms. The physical
      surroundings are described by factors such as acoustics, light source and intensity,
      decorations and air quality.

      The exercise program applied is based on a previously investigated neuromuscular exercise
      program, NEMEX. The same program is performed in both exercise rooms. Consequently, only the
      physical surroundings differ between intervention groups.

      Patients' &quot;global perceived effect&quot; is used as the primary outcome assessed at 8 weeks
      follow-up.

Patients exercise in standard physical surroundings. The room is marked by years of use. The room is placed in the basement, has artificial lighting, poor acoustics and bare concrete walls.</description>

    <description>Intervention: Exercise + contextually enhanced physical surroundings
Patients exercise in a contextually enhanced room. The room has both artificial lighting and daylight, view of a recreational park, better acoustics, decorations among other factors, which may cause or enhance the context effect.</description>

    <description>Different physical surroundings of exercise may affects the patients differently and consequently influence the effect of exercise. The exercise rooms are different from each other on parameters such as source of lighting, acoustics, materials and decorations.
The differences with the physical surroundings of exercise is the primary intervention for this study.</description>

    <description>The neuromuscular exercise program is the same across the two exercise groups. Consequently, this intervention is not the primary intervention of this study. The exercise program is based on the previously reported NEMEX program designed for patients with hip or knee osteoarthritis, originally published by Ageberg et al, 2010 in BMCMusculoskeletal Disorders.</description>
