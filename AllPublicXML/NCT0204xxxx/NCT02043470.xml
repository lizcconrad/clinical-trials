  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators propose using retinal oximetry to assess for abnormalities in regional
      retinal oxygen consumption in previously- irradiated patients, and relate these abnormalities
      to changes in regional retinal function (i.e. visual field abnormalities). Since different
      regions of retina receive different radiation doses, the investigators will assess for a dose
      response as well.

    <textblock>
      Radiation therapy (RT) is a common treatment for patients with cancers of the sinonasal area,
      orbit, skull base, nasopharynx, and brain. Because of the close proximity of these targets to
      the eyes, the retina is often incidentally and unavoidably irradiated. As a result, some
      patients develop radiation retinopathy and possibly vision loss. Clinicopathologic studies
      suggest similar microvascular mechanisms for both radiation- and diabetic retinopathy: small
      vessel occlusion and ischemia that can lead to neovascularization, increased capillary
      permeability, and visual loss in the regions of retina perfused by damaged vasculature. UNC
      has a novel, non-invasive retinal imaging technology called a Retinal Oximeter which measures
      hemoglobin oxygen saturation of retinal vessels. The difference in oxygen saturation between
      a retinal arteriole and venule pair reflects the oxygen consumption of the retinal region
      supplied by that vessel pair.
