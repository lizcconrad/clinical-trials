    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the absorption, metabolic pathways and excretion
      of JNJ-39823277 in healthy male adults after administration of a single oral dose of a 25 mg
      (0.5 mg/mL solution) of 14C-JNJ-39823277.

    <textblock>
      This is an open-label (all people know the identity of the intervention) and single-arm
      (group) study. The study consists of 3 phases including, the screening phase (within 3 weeks
      prior to the start of study medication), treatment phase (8 to 15 days), and the follow-up
      phase (up to 6 days after the discharge from the hospital). Approximately 6 participants will
      be receiving the 14C-JNJ-39823277 in the study. Safety will be evaluated by the assessment of
      adverse events, vital signs, physical examination, 12-lead electrocardiogram, and clinical
      laboratory tests which will be monitored throughout the study. The total duration of study
      will be up to approximately 6 weeks.

    <measure>Area Under the Plasma Concentration-Time Curve From Time Zero to Infinite Time (AUC[0-infinity]) of 14C-JNJ-39823277</measure>
    <time_frame>Predose; 15 and 30 minutes, 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 18, 24, 36, 48, 72, 120, and 168 hours post-dose</time_frame>
    <description>The AUC(0-infinity) is area under the plasma concentration-time curve from time zero to infinite time, calculated as the sum of Area under Curve (AUC) last and C(last)/lambda(z), in which C(last) is the last observed quantifiable concentration.</description>

    <description>T1/2 is the time measured for the plasma concentration to decrease by one-half of its original concentration. It is associated with the terminal rate-constant (lambda[z]) of the semi logarithmic drug concentration-time curve, and is calculated as 0.693/lambda(z).</description>
