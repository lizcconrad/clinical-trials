  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Vertical HCV Transmission has been extensively studied, with a risk around 5% (range: 3 to
      10%). Spontaneous viral clearance in infected children during childhood can occur, but data
      about this phenomenon are scarse, justifying the study.

    <textblock>
      Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) Mother-To-Child Transmission (MTCT) has been extensively studied,
      with a risk around 5% (range: 3 to 10%) from chronically infected pregnant women with a
      positive HCV RNA during pregnancy. Risk factors include: HCV RNA load level, HIV-HCV
      co-infection, duration of labour, HCV genotype, child gender, and invasive procedures either
      during pregnancy or at birth. Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) Mother-To-Child Transmission (MTCT)
      mainly occurs during the last trimester of pregnancy or at birth or around the birth
      (El-Shabrawi et al., World Journal of Gastroenterology 2013). Currently, using caesarian
      section to reduce the risk of Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) Mother-To-Child Transmission (MTCT) is
      still debated and not recommended in International Guidelines (EASL 2012). Spontaneous viral
      clearance in infected children during childhood seems to occur in 20% of cases, with
      predisposing genetic factors (Ruiz-Extremera A et al. Hepatology 2011 ; 53 : 1830-1838) but
      data about this phenomenon are scarse (Rerksuppaphol S et al. J Gastroenterol Hepatol 2004),
      justifying the study.
