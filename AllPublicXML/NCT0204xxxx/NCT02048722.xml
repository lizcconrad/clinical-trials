  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to see whether a drug called regorafenib might be effective in
      treating angiosarcoma. This study is for patients who have angiosarcoma that has gotten worse
      after they received chemotherapy. Regorafenib is a type of drug called a kinase inhibitor.
      Regorafenib interferes with how some kinase proteins work. Some of these kinases in cancer
      cells might normally help the cancer cells grow or form new blood vessels that could feed a
      growing tumor. By blocking these proteins, regorafenib may help stop the growth of certain
      cancers.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To define the progression-free survival (PFS) at 4 months with daily oral regorafenib (160
      mg) in previously treated locally advanced/metastatic angiosarcoma patients

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Progression-free rate at 3 and 6 months. II. Progression-free survival. III. Overall
      survival (up to 5 years). IV. Response rate (by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors
      [RECIST] version [v] 1.1).

      V. Rate and duration of tumor control (complete response [CR] + partial response [PR] +
      stable disease [SD]).

      VI. Safety/tolerability of regorafenib.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive regorafenib orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-21. Courses repeat every
      28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 6 months for up to 5
      years.
