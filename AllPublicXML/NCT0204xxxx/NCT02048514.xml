      The purpose of this clinical study is to evaluate the safety and device performance of the
      Nellix® EndoVascular Aneurysm Sealing System (Nellix System) for the treatment of infrarenal
      abdominal aortic aneurysms.

    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, multi-country prospective, single-arm, non-randomized clinical trial.
      The comparative control arm is a combination of patient data drawn from the abdominal aortic
      aneurysms (AAA) open surgical control arms of four commercially approved AAA devices as part
      of the Society of Vascular Surgeons. Patients enrolled in this study will be pre-screened and
      have a diagnosis of an infrarenal AAA with or without the need for treatment of iliac artery
      aneurysm, are candidates for endovascular repair, and meet the eligibility criteria. Patients
      enrolled in the study will participate in follow-up visits 31 days, 6 months and at 1 year
      following the index procedure. At the follow-up visits there will be a clinical assessment,
      blood collection, and abdominal CT imaging of the patient.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  At least 18 years of age

          -  Informed consent form understood and signed and patient agrees to all follow-up visits

          -  Is able and willing to comply with clinical follow-up requirements for one year

          -  Is able and willing to undergo Contrast-Enhanced Spiral CT scans

          -  Is a candidate for endovascular repair of an infrarenal aortic aneurysm with or
             without an iliac aneurysm with at least one of the following;

               1. aneurysm ≥ 4.5 cm in diameter, or

               2. aneurysm is twice the diameter of the normal infrarenal aorta, or

               3. aneurysm is growing at a rate of ≥ 10 % per year

          -  Non-aneurysmal aortic neck length ≥ 5mm below the most inferior renal artery

          -  Proximal aortic neck diameter between 16 and 36mm

          -  Aortic neck angulation to the sac ≤ 60

          -  Common iliac artery diameter 8 to 35mm bilaterally

          -  Aneurysm blood lumen diameter ≤ 60mm

          -  Iliac and femoral arteries suitable for endovascular access with the Nellix System

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Life expectancy ≤ 1 year

          -  Dissecting, ruptured, or leaking aneurysm (blood outside the aorta), has sustained
             recent trauma, is symptomatic, or is non-degenerative

          -  Aneurysm is thoraco-abdominal, suprarenal and/or mycotic

          -  Thoracic aneurysm ≥ 4.5cm in diameter

          -  AAA requires treatment that would result in bilateral occlusion of the internal iliac
             arteries

          -  Presence of mural thrombus &gt; 50% circumferentially in aortic neck

          -  Iliac aneurysm blood lumen diameter &gt; 35mm
