  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study has two major goals: 1) to measure the amount of two specific
      hormones interleukin (IL)-10 and interleukin (IL)-12p70 in mucous and blood; and 2) compare
      the hormone levels in two specific areas of the lung called the trachea (upper airway) and
      the bronchioles (lower airway). The hormones IL-10 and IL-12p70 are cytokines, special
      hormones cells use to communicate with each other during inflammation or infection. Cytokines
      can be measured in mucous and blood. The balance of one cytokine compared to another help
      doctors to understand how people respond differently to infection. Unfortunately, the amount
      of IL-10 and IL-12p70 is not known in children, especially children with a lung infection. In
      addition, we do not know if the balance of these cytokines differ in various regions of the
      lung. We believe the balance of IL-10 and IL-12p70 is similar whether measured in the upper
      or lower airways.

      This study is designed to measure the concentration and describe the distribution of cytokine
      IL-10 and IL-12p70 in a previously healthy pediatric population suffering direct lung injury
      by an infectious etiology, not yet described in the literature.

      In addition, this study seeks to determine whether tracheal aspirates (TA) obtained in early
      acute respiratory failure can be substituted for distal airway aspirates, obtained by
      non-bronchoscopic broncho-alevolar lavage (nb-BAL), for the purposes of investigating markers
      of inflammation. We will compare the ratio of IL-10 to IL-12p70 at each time point measured
      in tracheal secretion, bronchial secretion, and blood to assess for sample equivalence.

      Finally, this study will affirm the safety profile for repeated nb-BAL, establish a protocol
      for respiratory sample collection and storage for future larger scale studies, and generate
      feasibility data regarding consent rate, estimates of data completion, and fraction of
      missing data for us to determine whether a future study involving the ratio of IL-10 to
      IL-12p70 can be used as a predictor of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in this
      population.

      The data generated by this study regarding safety, comparison of nb-BAL and TA, and cytokine
      concentrations will be used as preliminary data informing the design of a larger multicenter
      study testing the hypothesis that IL-10 and IL-12p70 levels in airway secretions can predict
      risk for ARDS in this population. This may be approached via application to the Pediatric
      Acute Lung Injury and Sepsis (PALISI) clinical research network group.

    <description>Tracheal aspirates (TA), bronchial fluid (nb-BALF), and blood are collected within 48-hours following endotracheal intubation. All three samples are collected again at two additional time points following intubation: between days 3-4 and between days 5-7, so long as the patient remains endotracheally intubated. Three time points were chosen to show consistency in ratio of IL-10 to IL-12p70 between TA and nb-BALF throughout the first week of endotracheal intubation. If a patient is extubated before day 7 all sample collection will stop. No samples will be obtained after 7 days of intubation as we are focusing on the acute phase of lung injury only. An ELISA assay is performed to measure the concentration of IL-10 and IL-12p70 for ratio comparison.</description>

    <description>Pulse Oxygen Saturation (SpO2), heart rate (HR), blood pressure (BP), and cardiac rhythm are continuously monitored per clinical routine in intubated patients. These parameters will be recorded pre-procedure then monitored over the 1 hour post-procedure. Transient and inconsequential changes in these parameters are expected. The following changes will be considered adverse events and reported to data safety monitor (DSM):
Persistent (&gt;10 minute) decrease in SpO2 of more than 10% below pre-procedure baseline during the 1-hour post-procedure.
Persistent (&gt;10 minute) increase in HR of more than 30 beats per minute above pre-procedure baseline during the 1-hour post-procedure.

        Previously healthy patients presenting to UNC with respiratory failure presumptively caused
        by a primary lung infection will be screened. Only those patients intubated within 48-hours
        of potential enrollment and between the ages of ≥37 weeks gestation and 17 years will be
        considered. For purposes of this study, acute respiratory illness is defined as having
        upper respiratory infection symptoms and/or lower respiratory tract infection. Patient
        should have fever (&gt;38 oC) OR leukocytosis / leukopenia (&gt;10,000 or &lt;2,000) AND any of the
        following: tachypnea, hypoxia (saturation &lt;97%), cough, congestion, rhinorrhea, abnormal
        lung exam findings, or infiltrate on chest x-ray.
