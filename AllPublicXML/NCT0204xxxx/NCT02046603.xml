      This open-label study will evaluate the efficacy and safety of RoActemra/Actemra
      (tocilizumab) as monotherapy or in combination with methotrexate or other non-biologic DMARDs
      in patients with active rheumatoid arthritis and an inadequate response to to current
      non-biologic DMARD therapy or the first anti-TNF agent. Patients will receive
      RoActemra/Actemra 162 mg subcutaneously weekly for 52 weeks.

             therapy if permitted by the local guidance, defined as DAS28 score improvement of less
             than 1.2 or patients achieving a DAS28 score improvement of 1.2 but not acheiving low
             disease activity (current DAS28-ESR above 3.2)

          -  No previous exposure to RoActemra/Actemra (tocilizumab)
