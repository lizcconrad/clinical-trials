    <textblock>
      This is a phase 2, multicenter, open-label study in patients with Newly Diagnosed Multiple
      Myeloma (NDMM) who have not received prior systemic treatment for multiple myeloma (MM) and
      who are ineligible for high-dose therapy (HDT)-stem cell transplantation (SCT) due to age
      (ie, ≥ 65 years) or comorbid disease(s) or with Relapsed and/or Refractory Multiple Myeloma
      (RRMM)).

      The investigational drug being tested in this study is called MLN9708 also known as Ixazomib.
      This study will look at disease response rates and safety in people who take ixazomib in
      addition to cyclophosphamide and dexamethasone. NDMM participants will be randomly assigned
      (by chance, like flipping a coin) to one of two treatment groups and RRMM participants will
      be assigned to a third group:

        -  NDMM - ixazomib (MLN9708) 4.0 mg + 300 mg/m^2 Cyclophosphamide + dexamethasone

        -  NDMM - ixazomib (MLN9708) 4.0 mg + 400 mg/m^2 Cyclophosphamide + dexamethasone

        -  RRMM - ixazomib (MLN9708) 4.0 mg + 300 mg/m^2 Cyclophosphamide + dexamethasone

      The study will enroll approximately 148 participants. This multi-centre trial will be
      conducted in the United States, European Union, and Australia.

        following inclusion criteria to be enrolled in the study:

          1. Adult male or female participants 18 years of age or older with a confirmed diagnosis
             of symptomatic multiple myeloma (MM) according to standard criteria.

          2. Participants for whom cyclophosphamide and dexamethasone treatment is appropriate and
             who are considered not eligible for high-dose therapy (HDT)-stem cell transplantation
             (SCT) for 1 or more of the following reasons:

               -  The participant is 65 years of age or older.

               -  The participant is less than 65 years of age but has significant comorbid
                  condition(s) that are, in the opinion of the investigator, likely to have a
                  negative impact on tolerability of HDT-SCT.

        Each participant with relapsed and/or refractory multiple myeloma (RRMM) must meet all of
        the following inclusion criteria to be enrolled in the study:

          1. Adult male or female participants 18 years or older with a confirmed diagnosis of
             symptomatic MM either currently or at the time of initial diagnosis, according to
             standard criteria, and relapsed and/or refractory disease after 1 to 3 lines of prior
             therapy. A participant is considered to have refractory disease if disease progression
             occurred during the treatment period or within 60 days of receiving the last dose of a
             given therapy. A line of therapy is defined as 1 or more cycles of a single-agent or
             combination therapy or a sequence of planned treatments such as induction therapy
             followed by autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) and then maintenance therapy.

          2. No evidence of graft-versus-host disease for participants who have undergone prior
             allogeneic stem cell transplantation.

        In addition, all participants (NDMM and RRMM) must meet all of the remaining criteria:

          1. Participants must have measurable disease defined by at least 1 of the following 3
             measurements:

               -  Serum M-protein ≥ 1 g/dL (≥ 10 g/L).

               -  Urine M-protein ≥ 200 mg/24 hours.

               -  Serum free light chain assay: involved free light chain level ≥ 10 mg/dL (≥ 100

                  Platelet transfusions to help participants meet eligibility criteria are not
                  allowed within 3 days prior to administration of the study drug.

               -  Total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x the upper limit of the normal range (ULN).

               -  Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) ≤ 3 x ULN.

                  contraception, at the same time, from the time of signing the informed consent
                  through 90 days after the last dose of study drug, or

               -  agree to practice true abstinence over the period previously described, when this
                  is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of the participant. (Periodic
                  abstinence [ie, calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, postovulation methods] and
                  withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception.), and

               -  adhere to any treatment-specific pregnancy prevention guidelines for
                  cyclophosphamide and dexamethasone.

          5. Male participants, even if surgically sterilized (ie, status post-vasectomy), who:

               -  agree to practice effective barrier contraception during the entire study

               -  agree to practice true abstinence over the period previously described, when this
                  is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of the participant. (Periodic
                  abstinence [eg, calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, postovulation methods for the
                  female partner] and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception.), and

               -  adhere to any treatment-specific pregnancy prevention guidelines for
                  cyclophosphamide and dexamethasone.

          6. Voluntary written consent must be given before performance of any study-related
             procedure not part of standard medical care, with the understanding that consent may
             be withdrawn by the participant at any time without prejudice to future medical care.

             investigational regimen (for participants with NDMM only).

             NOTE: Prior treatment with corticosteroids (maximum dose of corticosteroids should not
             exceed the equivalent of 160 mg of dexamethasone over 14 days. Localized radiation is
             permitted as long as it is below a therapeutic level and administered at least 14 days
             prior to the first dose of study treatment.

          2. Diagnosis of smoldering MM, Waldenström's macroglobulinemia, POEMS (polyneuropathy,
             organomegaly, endocrinopathy, monoclonal gammopathy, and skin changes) syndrome,
             plasma cell leukemia, primary amyloidosis, myelodysplastic syndrome, or
             myeloproliferative syndrome.

          3. Central nervous system involvement.

          4. Diagnosed or treated for another malignancy within 2 years before the first dose or
             previously diagnosed with another malignancy and have any evidence of residual
             disease. Participants with nonmelanoma skin cancer or carcinoma in situ of any type
             are not excluded if they have undergone complete resection.

          5. Peripheral neuropathy Grade 1 with pain or Grade 2 or higher peripheral neuropathy of
             any cause on clinical examination during the Screening period.

          6. Known gastrointestinal (GI) disease or GI procedure that could interfere with the oral
             absorption or tolerance of study drug, including difficulty swallowing.

          7. Infection requiring intravenous (IV) antibiotic therapy or other serious infection
             within 14 days before the first dose of study drug.

          8. Ongoing or active infection, known human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) positive, active
             hepatitis B or C infection.

          9. Systemic treatment with strong inhibitors of CYP1A2 (fluvoxamine, enoxacin,
             ciprofloxacin), strong inhibitors of CYP3A (clarithromycin, telithromycin,
             itraconazole, voriconazole, ketoconazole, nefazodone, posaconazole) or strong CYP3A
             inducers (rifampin, rifapentine, rifabutin, carbamazepine, phenytoin, phenobarbital),
             or use of Ginkgo biloba or St. John's wort within 14 days before the first dose of
             study treatment.

             various formulations.

         11. Major surgery within 14 days before the first dose of study drug. (Note: kyphoplasty
             or vertebroplasty is not considered major surgery.)

         12. Female participants who are lactating and breastfeeding or have a positive serum
             pregnancy test during the Screening period.

         13. Any serious medical or psychiatric illness that could, in the investigator's opinion,
             potentially interfere with the completion of treatment according to this protocol.

         14. Comorbid systemic illnesses or other severe concurrent disease which, in the judgment
             of the investigator, would make the participant inappropriate for entry into this
             study or interfere significantly with the proper assessment of safety and toxicity of
             the prescribed regimens.

         15. Treatment with any investigational products for reasons other than MM within 30 days
             before the first dose of study drug.
