        4.1.4 Ability and willingness to provide adequate locator information.

        4.1.5 HIV-1 infection, documented by any licensed rapid HIV test or HIV enzyme or
        chemiluminescence immunoassay (E/CIA) test at any time before study entry and confirmed by
        a licensed Western blot, a second antibody test by a method other than rapid HIV or E/CIA;
        HIV-1 antigen; or plasma HIV-1 RNA viral load.

        4.1.6 Receiving a stable antiretroviral regimen consisting of 3 or more drugs belonging to
        two or more classes, one of which must be a protease inhibitor, an integrase inhibitor, or
        a non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor, without any changes due to virologic
        failure in the past 24 weeks, and with no plans to change antiretroviral regimen in the 40
        weeks following enrollment. If the regimen includes a protease inhibitor, ritonavir or an
        approved boosting agent known to increase trough levels of the protease inhibitor by at
        least 50% must also be a part of the regimen.

        NOTE A: Changes to the antiretroviral regimen 8 weeks or more prior to enrollment are
        allowed if the plasma HIV RNA was &lt;50 copies/mL at the time of the change, the reason for
        the change was not suspicion or documentation of virologic failure, and all other criteria
        for virologic control, as outlined in criterion 4.1.9 below, are met.

        NOTE B: For the purposes of this protocol, &quot;a change due to virologic failure&quot; is defined
        as any of the following events or combinations thereof happening in a patient who is
        receiving uninterrupted combination antiretroviral therapy including at least three agents
        belonging to at least two classes: a) plasma HIV RNA is &gt;200 copies/mL on two or more
        consecutive occasions; b) the treating physician determines that any given plasma HIV RNA
        value is indicative or suggestive of virologic failure, and recommends that the patient's
        regimen be modified as a result; c) a genotypic or phenotypic antiretroviral resistance
        test identifies the presence of resistance to any component of a patient's regimen that was
        not present before, and a physician recommends that the patient's regimen be modified as a
        result.

        4.1.7 For subjects who have a positive HBcAb only:

        • An antiretroviral regimen containing one or more of the following medications:
        lamivudine, emtricitabine, or tenofovir.

        4.1.11 Female subjects of reproductive potential must have a negative serum or urine
        pregnancy test at study entry and must affirm that they do not intend to become pregnant
        for the duration of the study.

        NOTE: For the purposes of this protocol, a female subject of reproductive potential is
        defined as one who has reached menarche, has not been post-menopausal for at least 24
        consecutive months (i.e., has had menses within the preceding 24 months), and has not
        undergone surgical sterilization (e.g., hysterectomy, tubal ligation, or bilateral
        oophorectomy).

        4.1.12 Female subjects of reproductive potential participating in sexual activity that
        could lead to pregnancy must agree to use at least one of the following forms of birth
        control for at least 30 days prior to study entry through 30 days after the final study
        visit:

          -  Condoms (male or female) with or without a spermicidal agent

          -  Diaphragm or cervical cap with spermicide

        PLUS at least one of the following:

          -  An FDA-approved copper intrauterine device (IUD), e.g. ParaGard®, or an FDA-approved
             hormone-releasing IUD, e.g. Mirena®

          -  An FDA-approved transdermal hormonal contraceptive, e.g. Ortho-Evra®

          -  An FDA-approved injectable hormonal contraceptive, e.g. Depo-Provera®

          -  An FDA-approved hormonal contraceptive in vaginal ring form, e.g. NuvaRing®

          -  An FDA-approved implantable hormonal contraceptive, e.g. Implanon® or Jadelle®

        NOTE A: Oral hormonal contraceptives, either combined or progestin-only, are not acceptable
        as a second contraceptive method.

        NOTE B: Women of reproductive potential who are using a hormonal contraceptive not included
        above may consider switching their contraceptive to one of the approved forms, but will be
        required to do so in consultation with their primary healthcare providers. Study
        investigators will not prescribe or recommend a specific form of contraception to study
        participants. The study will not cover the costs of contraceptives.

        4.1.13 Female subjects who are not of reproductive potential [i.e., women who have been
        post-menopausal for at least 24 consecutive months or women who have undergone surgical
        sterilization (e.g., hysterectomy, tubal ligation, or bilateral oophorectomy)] are eligible
        without requiring the use of a contraceptive. Acceptable documentation of sterilization,
        other contraception methods, menopause and reproductive potential is patient-reported
        history at any time prior to screening.

        4.1.14 Subjects must be determined by the investigators to have at least one fully active
        regimen available to them other than the regimen they are receiving at study entry. The
        determination of whether or not an alternative regimen is available must take into account
        both the subject's antiretroviral history and any previously obtained resistance testing. A
        valid alternative regimen must meet the recommendations for an active regimen outlined in
        the current DHHS guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in HIV-1-Infected Adults
        and Adolescents (93).

        4.2.3 Pregnant or breastfeeding.

        4.2.4 Active local or systemic infection (defined as requiring systemic antibiotics or
        other medical or surgical treatment) at the time of enrollment.

        4.2.5 Use of systemic cancer chemotherapy or radiation therapy, immunosuppressive or
        immunomodulatory therapy (e.g., interferons, tumor necrosis factor antagonists,
        interleukins) or any investigational therapy within 90 days prior to study entry or
        continued indication for such medications. A list of prohibited study medications is
        provided in appendix 1 of the Manual of Operations (MOPS).

        NOTE A: Use of inhaled or nasal steroids, the equivalent of 10 mg of prednisone or less per
        day or a less than 2-week course of steroids are not exclusionary.

        NOTE B: A single course of 1% hydrocortisone cream or equivalent applied up to 3 times a
        day to &lt;10 square inches area for &lt;2 weeks is permitted. The investigators will determine
        if other forms of limited, short-term topical steroid use are expected to interfere
        significantly with the study objectives and are therefore exclusionary.

        4.2.6 Receipt of a live attenuated vaccine within 30 days prior to study entry or expected
        need for such vaccines at any time during and for 30 days after the study.

        4.2.7 Known allergy/sensitivity or any hypersensitivity to components of the study drug or
        its formulation.

        antibody and positive HCV RNA in plasma) documented at the screening visit.

        NOTE A: For purposes of documenting hepatitis B status, an HBsAg or HBV DNA obtained in the
        6 months prior to and up to the date of the screening visit is acceptable EXCEPT for
        subjects with a positive HBcAb at screening (see Note B). A negative HBeAg during the same
        period in the absence of an HBsAg or HBV DNA is not sufficient evidence of HBV-negative
        status. If a clinically obtained test is not available at screening, an HBsAg will be drawn
        together with other evaluations at this visit.

        NOTE B: For subjects with a positive HBcAb at screening, an HBV DNA below the limit of
        quantification at any time from screening to study entry is required.

        NOTE C: For purposes of documenting HCV status, a negative HCV antibody obtained in the 6
        months prior to and up to the date of the screening visit is sufficient. For any subject
        with a positive HCV antibody, an HCV RNA measurement is required.

             endoscopy

          -  Major GI tract surgery within 45 days prior to study entry. Minor procedures involving
             only the anal canal such as condyloma ablations, hemorrhoidectomy, and anoscopy are
             permitted if cleared by the responsible surgeon.

          -  Continued need for, or use during the 7 days prior to the scheduled flex-sig
             procedure, of the following medications:
