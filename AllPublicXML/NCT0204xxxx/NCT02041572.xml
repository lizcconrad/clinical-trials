  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study has two goals. First to develop a computer-based intervention meant to alter
      cognitive biases that contribute to ongoing PTSD symptoms. Second, we sought to pilot test
      the intervention in a small sample of veterans for feasibility and acceptability.

      Aim 1: Develop Attentional Bias Retraining protocol (Phase 1)

        -  1.1 Computerized assessment &amp; retraining programs

        -  1.2 Procedures and measures

      Aim 2: Implement in pilot sample (Phase 2)

        -  2.1: Assess feasibility and tolerability

        -  2.2: Collect pilot data to plan future studies

        -  2.3: Efficacy estimates based on changes in response time to dot probe task

    <description>Each participant receives 12 sessions. The first three sessions are baseline (assessment only) sessions. The last four sessions must be treatment sessions. The attentional bias intervention starts randomly on sessions 4 - 8, and continues until the end of the 12 sessions.</description>
