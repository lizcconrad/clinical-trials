    <textblock>
      Myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI) is a nuclear scan using a radioisotope to see blood flow
      to the muscles of the heart when the heart is at rest and when it is under stress. The stress
      test in MPI can be done using medications, such as adenosine, that dilate coronary arteries
      and increase blood flow. Similarly, elevated carbon dioxide (CO2) levels in the blood, or
      hypercapnia, also dilates arteries and increases blood flow. Thornhill Research Inc. has
      developed the RespirAct ™ Gen4 sequential gas delivery system used to control CO2 levels in
      the blood. The RespirAct ™ Gen4 can deliver precise amounts of CO2 through a mouthpiece for
      inhalation to increase CO2 levels in the blood and thereby increasing blood flow like during
      stress.

      The objective of this study is to compare the differences in blood flow through the arteries
      of the heart during stress with hypercapnia and adenosine MPI. The imaging will be done using
      positron emission tomography (PET) with the radioisotope, or tracer, called Rubidium (Rb-82).
      The Rb-82 is given through a pump, or elution system.

      The investigators hypothesize that hypercapnia will induce a stress-to-rest increase in
      myocardial blood flow by a factor of 2 or more in myocardial regions supplied by non-stenotic
      arteries in normal volunteers and participants with coronary artery disease.

    <description>All participants will undergo a baseline rest Rb-82 positron emission tomography (PET) myocardial perfusion imaging scan (MPI) with low-dose computed tomography. Following this baseline study, serial Rb-82 PET MPI using three target levels of carbon dioxide (CO2) (50 mmHg, 55 mmHg, and 60 mmHg (± 3 mmHg)) as a stress agent will be performed. The 60 mmHg level will be repeated following a minimum 10 minute rest. A rest/stress Rb-82 PET MPI will be performed after return to normal CO2 levels (normocapnea) using adenosine as the stress agent.
