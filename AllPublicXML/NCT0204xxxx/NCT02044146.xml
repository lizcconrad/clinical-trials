  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In patients with heart attacks, the treatment of choice is to restore blood flow with
      percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) (use of stents (metal meshes) to open blockages).
      After PCI, the standard drug treatment includes aspirin and clopidogrel. These medications
      block full function of the platelet cells, which are responsible for clotting. Despite their
      use, patients after PCI are at risk for heart attacks, sudden clotting of stents or death. A
      major contributor may be resistance to clopidogrel. New more potent drugs, which can overcome
      the resistance, are now available; however, they come with an increase chance of severe
      bleeding and costs. An ideal solution would be to identify at-risk patients and selectively
      treat them with more potent drugs, while lower-risk patients continue with clopidogrel. This
      type of strategy (personalized strategy) would decrease heart attacks and death (compared to
      clopidogrel), while also preventing bleeding complications (compared to treating all patients
      with the new drugs).

      Of resistant patients, many carry genes (inherited units) that prevent proper absorption of
      clopidogrel. Our group has developed and tested a new bedside genetic test, which identifies
      carriers of at-risk genes. However, this technique alone does not identify all at-risk
      patients. Consequently, we have now devised a novel tool, which combines genetics with
      patient characteristics to identify high-risk patients.

      The present study combines this new tool into a strategy for personalized treatment. Patients
      with heart attacks who undergo PCI will be randomly assigned to 1 of 3 strategies: a) new
      personalized strategy, b) clopidogrel strategy (previous standard drug) or c) ticagrelor
      strategy (stronger approved drug). The function of the platelet cells will be measured at 1
      month to determine potential benefits. Evaluation of this new personalized strategy is
      important for improving patient outcomes after PCI. The hypothesis is that patients receiving
      a personalized strategy will have decrease risk for future heart attacks and bleeding.

The &quot;therapeutic window&quot; will be defined by platelet function values (VerifyNow P2Y12 assay - P2Y12 reaction unit (PRU) ≤ 208 (correlated with decreased ischemic outcomes) AND PRU &gt;= 85 (correlated with decrease bleeding).

    <description>A point-of-care bedside genetic test for CYP2C19*2 and CYP2C19*3 using a buccal swab will be conducted.2 P2Y12 inhibitory drug therapy will be then be directed based on a risk algorithm (integrating genotyping and clinical variables). Patients with &quot;high ischemic risk&quot; are defined as having (*2 or *3) and/or diabetes and/or (having age&gt;65 AND BMI&gt;=28). &quot;High-risk&quot; patients will be switched to prasugrel at 10mg daily, while &quot;low ischemic risk&quot; patients be kept on clopidogrel 75 daily. For patients &gt;age 75 or wt &lt; 60 kg, prasugrel will be reduced to 5mg daily.</description>
