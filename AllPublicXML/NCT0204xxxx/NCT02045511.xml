  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of the study is to develop and test the preliminary efficacy of a
      first-in-kind community-based intervention to provide affordable, accessible and effective
      hearing health care to low-income, minority older adults.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Age-related hearing impairment is strongly associated with poorer communicative functioning
      and social isolation, but hearing impairment often goes undiagnosed and untreated,
      particularly among minority and low-income older adults. Novel interventions that translate
      research on social engagement, minority health, and hearing technology are needed to expand
      delivery of hearing health care to underserved older adults. The Baltimore Hearing Equality
      through Accessible Research and Solutions (HEARS) project will develop and pilot a
      first-in-kind community-based intervention to provide affordable, accessible, and effective
      hearing health care to minority and low-income older adults and their communication partners.
      The study will follow a mixed-methods approach that will incorporate quantitative and
      qualitative components throughout the formative and evaluative processes. Participants and
      their communication partners will be randomized to an immediate treatment group or a 3-month
      delayed treatment group. The investigators hypothesize that the intervention is associated
      with increased social engagement and communication, improved quality of life, and decreased
      loneliness and third-party disability in the immediate treatment compared to the delayed
      treatment group.

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Hearing Handicap Inventory for the Elderly (HHIE)-S at 3 Months</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Mean change, Unpooled - comparing baseline to 3 month follow-up visit
Measure Description: Measure was collected through a one-on-one interview with a trained data collector.
Scoring:
0-8 suggests no hearing handicap 10-24 suggests mild-moderate hearing handicap 26-40 suggests significant hearing handicap</description>
  </primary_outcome>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Revised QDS at 3 Months</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Mean change, Unpooled - comparing baseline to 3 month follow-up visit
[1] Measure Description: Measure was collected through a one-on-one interview conducted by a trained data collector.
Survey includes 5 questions, scored Strongly disagree, Slightly disagree, neither, slightly agree, or strongly agree (1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
Scoring is from 1 (worst) to 5 (best). Scores were summed across each of the 5 survey questions resulting in a total range of 5 (worst) to 25 (best)
Although utilized in multiple studies, including Yueh et al., 2001, there are no numerical anchors for what would represent a clinically important difference.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Revised UCLA at 3 Months</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Mean change, Unpooled - comparing baseline to 3 month follow-up visit
[1] Measure Description: Measure was collected via a one-on-one interview conducted by a trained data collector.
20-item Likert-type scale. Total score is sum of the 20 items, scores range from 20 to 80. Lower values equate to lower levels of loneliness and higher values equate to higher levels of loneliness.
Perry et al., 1990 uses the following score ranges:
20-34 - Low degree of loneliness 35-49 - Moderate degree of loneliness 50-64 - Moderately high degree of loneliness 65-80 - High degree of loneliness</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in PHQ-9 at 3 Months</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Mean change, Unpooled - comparing baseline to 3 month follow-up visit
[1] Measure Description: Measure collected via one-on-one interview conducted by trained data collectors.
Total of 9 questions, scored from 0 to 3. The score from each question are summed to a total score, which can range from 0 to 27.
Interpretation of Total Score Total Score Depression Severity 0 No depression 1-4 Minimal depression 5-9 Mild depression 10-14 Moderate depression 15-19 Moderately severe depression 20-27 Severe depression.
Change from baseline to 3 months was reported. An increase in the score from baseline to three months (a positive number) indicates a worsening in depression severity. A decrease in the score from baseline to three months (a negative number) indicates a reduction in depression severity.</description>

    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Mean change, Unpooled - comparing baseline to 3 month follow-up visit
Data were collected via one-on-one interviews with trained data collectors.
Standard scoring can be found at http://www.rand.org/health/surveys_tools/mos/36-item-short-form/scoring.html.
Higher scores indicate better mental health functioning; U.S. population norm: M = 50.0, SD = 10.0, range = [2-74].</description>

          <title>Revised Quantified Denver Scale of Communication Function (QDS)</title>
          <description>Measure was collected through a one-on-one interview conducted by a trained data collector.
Survey includes 5 questions, scored Strongly disagree, Slightly disagree, neither, slightly agree, or strongly agree (1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
Scoring is from 1 (worst) to 5 (best).
The scores from the 5 questions are summed and reported as a total score. The range for the total score is 5 (worst) to 25 (best).
Although utilized in multiple studies, including Yueh et al., 2001, there are no numerical anchors for what would represent a clinically important difference.</description>
