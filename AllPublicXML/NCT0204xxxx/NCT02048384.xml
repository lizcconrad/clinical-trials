    <textblock>
      This is a phase 1b, multi-center, open label, randomized study to evaluate the safety and
      feasibility of administering metformin with or without rapamycin after disease stabilization
      on chemotherapy in subjects with metastatic PDA.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Subjects with metastatic PDA who have received FOLFIRINOX or a gemcitabine-containing regimen
      and have achieved stable disease or better will be enrolled onto this study. Subjects should
      have had at least 6 months of chemotherapy and decline continuation of chemotherapy and
      should have stable disease or better on 2 scans taken at least 6 weeks apart. If applicable,
      subjects should also have a stable or declining CA19-9.

      Twenty-two subjects will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to metformin (Arm A) or metformin +
      rapamycin (Arm B). Subjects will be stratified according to their prior chemotherapy regimen:
      FOLFIRINOX or a gemcitabine-containing regimen.

      Treatments will be administered orally on a 28 day cycle. Metformin will be administered
      850mg twice daily and rapamycin will be administered 4mg daily.
