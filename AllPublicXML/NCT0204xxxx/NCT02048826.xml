      The purpose of this study is to determine the effectiveness of training hand movement using
      FINGER robot after stroke. FINGER is a robot that measures finger movements and allows users
      to play computer games using those movements.

          -  do not have active major psychological problems, or problems affecting the
             stroke-affected arm or hand besides the stroke

          -  do not have active major brain disease other than the stroke

          -  have absence of pain in the stroke-affected arm and hand

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  severe stiffness of the arm or hand as measured on a standard clinical scale

          -  severe problems speaking or understanding speech as measured on a standard clinical
             scale

          -  severe reduced level of consciousness

          -  severe loss ability to sense movement of your limbs as measured on a standard clinical
             scale

          -  currently pregnant

          -  difficulty in understanding or complying with the instructions given by the researcher

          -  inability to perform the experimental task that will be studied

        Exclusion criteria that will prevent subjects from participating in the MRI:

          -  Subjects having any implanted metal such as metallic splinters, metallic surgical
             clips, prosthetic heart valves, pacemakers, neuro-stimulation devices, orthodontic
             work that contains ferromagnetic materials,

          -  Subjects whose occupation or activities may cause accidental lodging of ferromagnetic
             materials, or that may have imbedded metal fragments from military activities, unless
             cleared by a screening head CT scan

          -  Subjects with tattoo(s) presenting metallic or ferromagnetic color ingredients or with
