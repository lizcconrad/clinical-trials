  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Multiple sclerosis is a chronic and highly disabling disorder with considerable social impact
      and economic consequences. It is caused by damage to the myelin sheath, the protective
      covering that surrounds nerve cells. Different areas are affected, including manual
      dexterity, strength, coordination and function. The objective of this study is to evaluate
      the improvement in these variables in patients with multiple sclerosis after a 8-weeks
      intervention focused on upper limbs.

    <textblock>
      The total estimated prevalence rate of multiple sclerosis has been reported to be 83 per 100
      000 for the past three decades. It is also higher in northern countries and between females
      with a male ratio around 2.0. The highest prevalence rates have been estimated for the age
      group 35-64 years. The estimated European mean annual Multiple Sclerosis incidence rate is
      4.3 cases per 100 000.

      Multiple sclerosis can cause a variety of symptoms: hypoesthesia, muscle weakness, abnormal
      muscle spasms, or difficulty moving; difficulties with coordination and balance; dysarthria,
      dysphagia, visual problems fatigue and acute or chronic pain syndromes, bladder and bowel
      difficulties,cognitive impairment, or emotional symptomatology. The investigators focus on
      the benefits of an intervention on dexterity, strength, coordination and functionality.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in manual dexterity</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Changes from baseline to postintervention in manual dexterity assessed by the Purdue Pegboard test and coin rotation task. The Purdue pegboard test is a timed physical test used to measure manual dexterity. Test subjects are asked to place small pins into holes in the pegboard using a specific hand and following a specific process. The coin rotation task consists of rotate the coin during 10 seconds.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in apraxia</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Changes in apraxia from baseline to postintervention is going to be measured using the Apraxia Screen of Tulia. This is a screening test of upper limbs apraxia.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in grip strength</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The changes in the grip strength will be measured using a Jamar dynamometer with a standard protocol allowing three attempts on each side. During each measurement, patients were sitting with their shoulder adducted and elbow flexed to 90Â°. The maximum value achieved from all six attempts was used in analyses. kg/cm2.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in fatigue</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The fatigue change is going to be measured using the Fatigue Severity Scale, a 9-item scale focus on the severity of fatigue and how much it affects the person's activities and lifestyle in the patients.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Upper limb functioning</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The upper limb functioning is going to be measured with the Action Research Arm Test, it is a 19 item measure divided into 4 sub-tests (grasp, grip, pinch, and gross arm movement).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Pinch strength</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Pinch strength is going to be measured using a pinch dynamometer. The participants were asked to perform three repetitions on each side with five seconds rest provided between the measures. This was performed using the alternating-hands method, which allows rest between repetitions as the examiner records information and provides instructions for the alternate hand. Three pinchs were evaluated: lateral, distal and tripod pinch</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Tapping speed</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The tapping speed will be measured with the finger tapping test.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Quality of life</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Quality of life is going to be measured using a self-reported questionnaire, the short-form Health Survey, SF-36</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Goals achievement</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The achievement of the goals of the intervention will be measured with the Goal Attainment Scale, a method of scoring the extent to which patient's individual goals are achieved in the course of intervention.</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Functionality</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Functionality will be measured with the Functional Independence Measure, a questionnaire. This is the most widely accepted functional assessment measure in use in the rehabilitation community</description>
