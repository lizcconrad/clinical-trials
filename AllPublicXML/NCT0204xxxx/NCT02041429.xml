  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase I/II research study is evaluating a combination of drugs called paclitaxel and
      ruxolitinib as a possible treatment for inflammatory breast cancer. Ruxolitinib is a newly
      discovered drug that has been shown to block a pathway (called the IL6/JAK/Stat pathway) that
      may be important in cancer, including breast cancer. Blocking this pathway may stop cancer
      cells from growing. Ruxolitinib has been approved by the FDA for patients with bone marrow
      disease, and this is the first study using this drug in combination with paclitaxel for
      breast cancer. Paclitaxel (also called Taxol) is an FDA drug approved for breast cancer
      patients. Paclitaxel works by blocking the small microtubules inside cancer cells and
      preventing cell growth. Information from laboratory experiments suggests that ruxolitinib
      might also have effects on breast cancer.These studies have shown that ruxolitinib may make
      paclitaxel more effective.

      This study has two phases. The objective of Phase I to find the maximum dose (MTD) of
      Ruxolitinib when combined with standard dose of paclitaxel given weekly for advanced or
      metastatic breast cancer. Three participants will be entered at a dose ruxolitinib equaling
      10 mg orally twice daily with weekly paclitaxel. If no dose-limiting toxicity is seen after 6
      weeks of treatment (two cycles), then the dose of ruxolitinib will be escalated using a
      standard 3+3 design, until 2 participants experience dose limiting toxicity (DLT). The dose
      below the DLT is designated the MTD and this dose of ruxolitinib will be used in the phase II
      preoperative study for triple negative IBC.

      During Cycle 1 the participant will come into clinic every week. At each visit, the
      participant will have a physical exam and will be asked questions regarding general health
      and specific questions about any problems that the participant might be having with any
      medications. About 2-3 additional tablespoons of blood will be taken before the participant's
      begins ruxolitinib, on Cycle 2 Day 1, Cycle 3 Day 1, and at the end of the study for research
      blood tests. Because these tests are being performed for research, and their clinical
      usefulness is unknown, the participant will not receive the results of these tests. The
      investigator will assess the participant's tumor by CT scans or MRI every 2 cycles. In
      addition, if the participant has tumors that are visible or can be palpated (felt), then they
      will be measured by the participant's study doctor in the clinic. If the participant has had
      a history of cancer in the bones or suspected cancer in the bones, then a bone scan will be
      performed before the participant can begin ruxolitinib. The bone scan may be repeated every 2
      cycles and at the end of the study if the participant study doctor believes it is clinically
      needed. Otherwise, it does not need to be repeated. Photographs may be taken of the
      participant's tumor to assess the tumor response to the treatment.

      The phase II period of the study will treat triple negative inflammatory breast cancer
      participants with ruxolitinib combined with 12 weeks of weekly paclitaxel followed by
      standard care Doxorubicin and Cyclophosphamide (AC) chemotherapy, eligible participants will
      proceed to surgical mastectomy followed by radiation. The phase II study will begin once the
      phase I study has been completed.

      During the phase II study, participants will have a research biopsy of the breast followed by
      one week of ruxolitinib given twice daily. A second research biopsy of the breast is then
      performed and the participants will then receive combination ruxolitinib (at the MTD dose
      defined in the phase I study) and standard dose paclitaxel for 12 weeks. Participants will be
      seen weekly during treatment. One week after completing the combination therapy, participants
      will receive standard dose doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide (AC) every 2 weeks for 4 cycles.

      We will evaluate the effect of JAK inhibition by ruxolitinib on the tumor by comparing
      pSTAT3+ expression of the pre-treatment research biopsy with the pSTAT3+ expression on the
      second research biopsy performed after one week of ruxolitinib. Participants who have disease
      regression following 12 weeks of ruxolitinib and paclitaxel followed by AC chemotherapy will
      undergo mastectomy, and the amount of residual breast cancer will be assessed. We will
      correlate the degree of residual cancer in the mastectomy with the amount of pSTAT3+
      expression seen in the research biopsies. We will be checking standard blood tests, IL-6 and
      CRP levels throughout the treatment to see if the levels change in response to ruxolitinib
      treatment. This may be an easier method of determining treatment efficacy. Standard radiation
      therapy will be given following mastectomy.

          -  Either measurable or evaluable disease is allowed.

          -  Age ≥18 years. Because no dosing or adverse event data are currently available on the
             use of ruxolitinib in participants &lt;18 years of age, children are excluded from this
             study.

          -  Life expectancy of greater than 3 months.

          -  ECOG performance status ≤ 2 (see Appendix A).

          -  Participants must have normal organ and marrow function as defined below:

          -  Leukocytes ≥3,000/mcL

          -  Absolute neutrophil count ≥1,500/mcL

          -  Platelets ≥100,000/mcL

          -  Total bilirubin within normal institutional limits

          -  AST (SGOT)/ALT (SGPT) ≤ 2.5 X institutional upper limit of normal

          -  Creatinine within normal institutional limits or creatinine clearance ≥ 60 mL/min/1.73
             m2 for subjects with creatinine levels about institutional normal

          -  Both men and women are allowed.

          -  The effects of ruxolitinib on the developing human fetus are unknown. For this reason
             women of child-bearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception
             (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry and for
             the duration of study participation. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is
             pregnant while participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician
             immediately.

          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Phase I

          -  Participants who exhibit any of the following conditions at screening will not be
             eligible for admission into the study.

          -  Participants may not be receiving any other study agents within 2 weeks of initiating
             treatment.

          -  Participants with untreated or uncontrolled brain metastases are excluded from this
             clinical trial. Patients with treated and stable (&gt; 4 weeks) brain metastasis are
             allowed.

          -  History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic
             composition to ruxolitinib.

          -  Participants receiving any medications or substances that are strong inhibitors of
             CYP3A4 are ineligible. (Please refer to Appendix B for list and washout periods).

          -  Chronic corticosteroid use in excess of the equivalent of prednisone 10 mg once daily.

          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to ongoing or active
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac
             arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with
             study requirements.

          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because ruxolitinib is a JAK inhibitor
             with the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects. Because there is an
             unknown but potential risk of adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment
             of the mother with ruxolitinib, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is
             treated with ruxolitinib. These potential risks may also apply to other agents used in
             this study.

          -  Individuals with a history of a different malignancy are ineligible except for the
             following circumstances. Individuals with a history of other malignancies are eligible
             if they have been disease-free for at least 3 years and are deemed by the investigator
             to be at low risk for recurrence of that malignancy. Individuals with the following
             cancers are eligible if diagnosed and treated within the past 3 years: cervical cancer
             in situ, and basal cell or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin.

          -  Clinically significant malabsorption syndrome.

          -  Prior chemotherapy or radiation administered within 2 weeks from initiating study
             treatment.
