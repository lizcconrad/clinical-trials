    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to use a special eye imaging technique, anterior segment optical
      coherence tomography (AS-OCT), to image the lens (the curved, transparent part of the eye
      that helps you to see clearly by directing images of light onto the back of your eye) and
      note any changes in exfoliation syndrome. Exfoliation syndrome is a common condition that has
      many ways of showing up in the eye, including the formation of deposits in the eye, shakiness
      of the lens that can complicate cataract surgery, and a higher chance of developing a type of
      glaucoma called exfoliation glaucoma. In this study we plan to collect images and measure
      exfoliation deposits on the lens with AS-OCT, which can take high resolution pictures of the
      eye without requiring contact with the eye. We will compare lens images of subjects with
      exfoliation syndrome to those of subjects with primary open angle glaucoma and cataracts.
      This type of imaging could be used in patients with known diagnosis of exfoliation syndrome
      to track disease progression and see how they respond to possible treatments. We also hope
      that with this imaging technology we can detect early changes in currently unaffected eyes,
      which could be useful for predicting which patients may develop the disease.
