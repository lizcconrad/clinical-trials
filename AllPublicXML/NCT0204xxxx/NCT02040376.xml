  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A placebo controlled double blind crossover trial of metformin in 30 children treated with
      radiation for medulloblastoma - the most common malignant brain tumour. The investigators
      will use tests of thinking and learning and brain imaging techniques to examine whether
      metformin can enhance cognition or promote brain repair following radiation-induced brain
      injury.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion criteria: Survivors will be included if they:

          1. Have been treated with cranial or cranial-spinal radiation,

          2. Are between 5 and 21 years of age at time of consent, and

          3. Either declare English as their native language or have had at least two years of
             schooling in English at the time of their baseline assessment.

          4. Have been diagnosed with a brain tumour requiring treatment with cranial or
             cranial-spinal radiation at least 2 years ago, is not receiving active treatment and
             no more than 15 years may have elapsed between treatment with cranial-spinal radiation
             and time of the trial. Survivors with a shunt will be included in the trial, but will
             need to be identified prior to study enrollment to discuss any specific considerations
             for imaging.

          5. Meet criteria for adequate organ function requirements:

               1. Adequate renal function defined as: Creatinine clearance or radioisotope
                  glomerular filtration rate (GFR) &gt; 70ml/min/1.73 m2 or serum creatinine based on
                  age/gender as follows:

                  Maximum Serum Creatinine Level (mg/dL)

                  5 to &lt; 10 years: Male = 1; Female = 1

                  10 to &lt; 13 years: Male = 1.2; Female = 1.2

                  13 to &lt; 16 years: Male = 1.5; Female = 1.4

                  â‰¥ 16 years: Male = 1.7; Female = 1.4

               2. Adequate liver function defined as:

             Total bilirubin &lt; 1.5 x upper limit of normal (ULN) for age, and,

             serum glutamate oxaloacetate transaminase (SGOT) (AST) or serum glutamate pyruvate
             transaminase (SGPT) (ALT) &lt; 3 x upper limit of normal (ULN) for age.

          6. Females of childbearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test result and must
             agree to use a medically acceptable method of contraception throughout the entire
             study period and for 30 days after the last dose of study drug.

          7. Informed consent will be obtained from the participants and/or their legal guardians
             by study team members authorized to consent for this study.

        Exclusion criteria: Survivors will be excluded if they

          1. Are receiving palliative care.

          2. Are unable to participate in neuro-imaging without sedation as this is the primary
             outcome measure for the trial.

          3. Are unable to swallow tablets.

          4. Are unstable and/or insulin-dependent (Type 1) diabetic patients.

          5. Have acute or chronic metabolic acidosis and/or lactic acidosis.

          6. Any female patient or partner who has reached menarche and male patients who are not
             willing to use an effective method of contraception.

          7. Patient who is pregnant or lactating and does not agree to stop breastfeeding while
             receiving trial treatment.

          8. Have a history of renal disease or renal dysfunction e.g., as suggested by elevated
             serum creatinine levels (see 5.a. Inclusion criteria) or abnormal creatinine
             clearance.

          9. Have a history of congestive heart failure requiring pharmacologic treatment.

         10. Have a known hypersensitivity to metformin hydrochloride.
