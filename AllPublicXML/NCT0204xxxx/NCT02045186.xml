      The purpose of this research study is to determine whether and when patients with human
      papilloma virus positive squamous cell cancer of the oropharynx treated with radiation and
      chemotherapy clear their human papilloma virus infection.

    <description>Oral HPV infection will be assessed 14 times, once prior to starting CRT, weekly during CRT, and then serially post-treatment: 4-8 weeks, 3 months, 6 months, 12 months, 18 months, 24 months. Patients will provide samples of their saliva and exfoliated epithelial cells at these timepoints. Samples will be collected with supplies provided by and analyzed by OralDNA Labs.</description>

    <intervention_name>Assessment of Oral HPV Infection</intervention_name>
    <description>Saliva and exfoliated oral epithelial cells will be collected with collection supplies provided by OralDNA Labs. Patients will swish and gargle a saline solution for 30 seconds and expectorate it into a funneled collection tube. The collected specimen will be sent to OralDNA Labs. Three diagnostic tests will be performed on each sample to assess oral HPV infection:
Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for HPV DNA.
Fluorescent in-situ hybridization (FISH).
Viral expression: The test is based on the measurement of the viral RNA levels by methods of detection of the fluorochrome labeled HPV probes by flow cytometry.</description>
