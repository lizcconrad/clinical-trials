  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will be conducted in three parts (Part 1, Part 2 and Part 3). Part 1 of this study
      will evaluate the relative bioavailability of a single dose of GSK2140944 tablet formulation
      compared to the reference capsule formulation under fasted conditions. The effect of food on
      the pharmacokinetics (PK) of a single dose of the tablet formulation will also be assessed.
      Part 2 will evaluate the effect of repeat doses of itraconazole on the pharmacokinetics of
      GSK2140944 following a single dose. A decision will be made whether to use the current
      capsule formulation or the new tablet formulation in Part 2 based upon the safety and PK data
      obtained from Part 1. Part 3 is conditionally based upon progression of the tablet
      formulation from Part 1 and will evaluate the effect of food on the safety, tolerability, and
      pharmacokinetics of the tablet formulation following multiple doses in elderly healthy
      subjects.

             outside the reference range for the population being studied may be included only if
             the Investigator feels and documents that the finding is unlikely to introduce
             additional risk factors and will not interfere with the study procedures.

          -  Part 1 and 2: Male or female between 18 and 64 years of age inclusive, at the time of
             signing the informed consent. Part 3: Male or female subjects at least 65 years of age

             defined as pre-menopausal females with a documented tubal ligation or hysterectomy; or
             postmenopausal defined as 12 months of spontaneous amenorrhea. To confirm
             post-menopausal status, a blood sample for simultaneous follicle stimulating hormone
             (FSH) &gt;40 milli-International Units (MIU)/milliliter (mL) and estradiol &lt;40 picograms
             (pg)/mL (&lt;147 picomoles [pmol]/liter [L]) is confirmatory. Male subjects with female
             partners of child-bearing potential must agree to use one of the contraception
             methods. This criterion must be followed from the time of the first dose of study
             medication until the final follow-up visit.

          -  Body weight &gt;=50 kilograms (kg) and body mass index (BMI) within the range 19 - 31
             kg/meter square (m^2) (inclusive).

             pulmonary, metabolic, renal, hepatic or gastrointestinal conditions or history of such
             conditions that, in the opinion of the investigator may place the subject at an
             unacceptable risk as a participant in this trial or may interfere with the absorption,
             distribution, metabolism or excretion of drugs.

          -  History of photosensitivity to quinolones.

          -  Use of systemic antibiotic within 30 days of screening

             average weekly intake of &gt;14 drinks for males or &gt;7 drinks for females. One drink is
             equivalent to 12 grams of alcohol: 12 ounces (360 mL) of beer, 5 ounces (150 mL) of
             wine or 1.5 ounces (45 mL) of 80 proof distilled spirits.

          -  History of sensitivity to any of the study medications, or components thereof or a
             history of drug or other allergy that, in the opinion of the investigator or GSK
             Medical Monitor, contraindicates their participation.

          -  History of sensitivity to heparin or heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (if the clinical
             research unit uses heparin to maintain intravenous cannula patency).

        Criteria Based Upon Diagnostic Assessments

          -  A positive pre-study Hepatitis B surface antigen or positive Hepatitis C antibody

          -  Donation of blood in excess of 500 mL within 12 weeks prior to dosing or participation

             product within the following time period prior to the first dosing day in the current
             study: 30 days, 5 half-lives or twice the duration of the biological effect of the
             investigational product (whichever is longer).
