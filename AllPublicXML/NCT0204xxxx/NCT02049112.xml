    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the clinical efficacy, safety and acceptability of
      our new oral salivary equivalent in the relief of signs and symptoms related to mouth dryness
      as compared to two distinct moisturizing currently marketed oral sprays (Aequasyal® &amp;
      Biotene®) in patients with xerostomia due to chronic hyposalivation.
