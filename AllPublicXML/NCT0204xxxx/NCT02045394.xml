  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Haemoptysis is the coughing up of blood originating from the respiratory tract. It is a
      common and worrying clinical symptom which can be due to different aetiologies including lung
      cancer, tuberculosis, COPD, bronchiectasis, pneumonia, acute bronchitis or unknown origin
      (cryptogenic haemoptysis). Epidemiology and optimal diagnostic approach are largely unclear.
      Aims of this study are to define current epidemiology and to provide the best diagnostic
      approach by providing a diagnostic algorithm.

    <measure>Percentage of patients presenting with haemoptysis affected by lung cancer, tuberculosis, bronchiectasis, pneumonia, acute bronchitis, cryptogenic haemoptysis or other causes.</measure>
    <time_frame>18 months</time_frame>
    <description>To define the prevalence of diseases presenting with haemoptysis by measuring percentage of patients presenting with haemoptysis affected by lung cancer, tuberculosis, bronchiectasis, pneumonia, acute bronchitis, cryptogenic haemoptysis or other causes. Epidemiology will be analysed related to the severity of the symptom (mild haemoptysis: drops of blood or bloody sputum; moderate haemoptysis: &lt;500 ml/24 h, severe haemoptysis: 1-2 cups, as defined by Hirshberg et al. CHEST 1997).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Sensitivity and specificity of chest X-ray, chest CT scan and bronchoscopy alone and in combination in the diagnosis of different causes of haemoptysis.</measure>
    <time_frame>18 months</time_frame>
    <description>Sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values of of chest X-ray, computed tomography (CT) scan and bronchoscopy executed alone versus the combination of the exams in the diagnosis of different causes of haemoptysis (lung cancer, tuberculosis, bronchiectasis, pneumonia, acute bronchitis, cryptogenic haemoptysis and other causes).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage and severity of recurrence of haemoptysis in the follow-up period.</measure>
    <time_frame>18 months</time_frame>
    <description>Every patient will be followed with scheduled visits and phone calls for 18 months since the first episode of haemoptysis. The percentage of patient with recurrence of haemoptysis, the severity of recurrence, will be measured and analysed by descriptive statistics.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Sensitivity and specificity of bronchoscopy in localizing the bleeding side and lobe in relation to the timing of the haemoptysis.</measure>
    <time_frame>18 months</time_frame>
    <description>Accuracy of bronchoscopy in localizing the side and the lobe source of the bleeding in relation to the timing of haemoptysis. The bronchoscopic findings will be analysed in relation to the timing of the bleeding (within 24 hours, between 24 and 48, 49 and 96 or over 96 hours after the occurrence of the symptom).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>

    <measure>Patient survival in the follow-up period.</measure>
    <time_frame>18 months</time_frame>
    <description>Every patient will be followed with scheduled visits and phone calls for 18 months since the first episode of haemoptysis. Patient survival will be measured and analysed by descriptive statistics.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Prevalence of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) in patients with haemoptysis by using spirometry with the threshold of FEV1/FVC &lt;70</measure>
    <time_frame>1 month or at clinical stability</time_frame>
    <description>Prevalence of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) in patients with haemoptysis will be assessed performing spirometry as described by European Respiratory Society Guidelines (European Respiratory Journal, 2005). COPD will be diagnosed in patient with a compatible clinical history (smoking history and frequent exacerbations) and the presence of a ventilatory obstructive defect as defined by a ratio of the forced expiratory volume in the first second and forced vital capacity (FEV1/FVC) &lt;70.</description>

    <measure>Distribution of main causes of haemoptysis in the subgroup of patients undergoing medical therapies that increase the risk of bleeding.</measure>
    <time_frame>18 months</time_frame>
    <description>To define the prevalence of diseases in patients presenting with haemoptysis in relation to the use of drugs such as antiaggregants or anticoagulants.</description>

    <description>In patients with haemoptysis bronchoscopy will be performed with flexible bronchoscope. A systemic research of bleeding site and causes will be done. Microbiological or pathological sampling will be executed if clinically required. In selected patients, bronchoscopy might be performed with the rigid instrument or the flexible bronchoscope in intubated patients.</description>
