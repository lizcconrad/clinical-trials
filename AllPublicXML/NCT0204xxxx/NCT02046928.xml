  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will assess the efficacy, safety and pharmacodynamic markers of the study drug,
      A6, in patients with CLL and small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL).

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In patients diagnosed with CLL or SLL, study medication will be injected subcutaneously two
      times a day in an outpatient setting for up to 6 cycles (28 days = 1 cycle) prior to the
      primary endpoint assessment.
