    <textblock>
      An identified hormone linking bone and kidney function is Fibroblast Growth Factor-23
      (FGF23). Data on the variation of FGF23 levels for bone and mineral metabolism in children
      are scarce. Currently it is assumed that meeting mineral requirements for the skeleton serves
      the body's overall needs. However, it is not clear as to whether this is true, particularly
      with growth. The contribution of dietary factors directly linked with the bone/kidney axis
      through measurement of intake (via 24hr recall) and kidney nutrient clearance (via serum and
      urinary analysis) will be included in investigations. Findings will serve as a springboard
      for delineating more specific mechanisms by which these systems become disordered and are
      influenced by diet. It is expected that adequacy of nutrients known to have a central role in
      bone function will optimize the hormonal milieu through crosstalk with the kidney.

      This effort will allow ongoing investigation in detecting and treating disturbances in
      mineral metabolism related to kidney disease, specifically in the pediatric population and
      broaden the understanding of kidney disease itself, as well as that of chronic diseases in
      which kidney health is of importance, such as diabetes and osteoporosis. Findings of this
      research may stress the importance of achieving dietary adequacy essential for establishing
      optimal body composition trajectories, particularly puberty.
