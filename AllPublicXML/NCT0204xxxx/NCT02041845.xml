  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The majority of patients with limited disease small cell lung cancer (SCLC) experience
      recurrent disease despite receiving concurrent chemoradiotherapy. New agents and
      dose-escalation of chemotherapy have not provided a survival benefit. Local failure accounts
      for high proportion of recurrences. Improved thoracic radiotherapy (TRT) might increase local
      control and thus reduce the recurrence rate and prolong survival. Positron emission
      tomography (PET CT) is better for staging of SCLC than computer tomography (CT) and bone
      scan. More precise localization of tumors leads to more accurate definition of target volumes
      for TRT and reduce the radiation dose to normal tissue. A large proportion of patients
      relapse and die within one and two year after therapy. Few patients survive longer than three
      years. Thus, two-year survival is considered a clinically highly relevant measure of
      efficacy.

      The aim of this study is to compare two schedules of TRT with respect to local control,
      progression free survival, overall survival, toxicity and health-related quality of life. In
      addition patients who have the best outcomes and tolerate chemoradiotherapy will be
      characterized (e.g. clinical characteristics, blood biomarkers, body composition).

    <measure>progression free survival (PFS)</measure>

    <description>measured for all patients from the date of the first day of the first course of PE to the first date of objective progression (according to RECIST 1.1) of disease or of death from any cause. For each patient who has not died or has non-progression at the cut-off date for the analysis, PFS will be censored at the date of the patient's last tumor assessment prior to the cut-off date. Statistical survival analyses will be done with Kaplan Meier. Log rank test will be used for comparing groups.</description>

    <measure>health related quality of life (HRQoL)</measure>
    <time_frame>From baseline, before and after radiotherapy and then at follow-up every 3 months until 24 months after start of chemotherapy. Then every 6 months until 5 year after start of therapy</time_frame>
    <description>assessed from completed questionnaires. Patients will report HRQoL on the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) Quality of Life Questionnaire (QLQ) C30 and the lung cancer specific module LC13. The QLQ-C30 measures fundamental aspects of HRQoL and symptoms commonly reported by cancer patients in general, the LC13 measures symptoms commonly associated with lung cancer and its treatment.
All HRQoL scores will be transformed to a scale from 0 to 100 according to the EORTC scoring manual. A difference in mean scores of &gt;10 is considered clinically relevant. For group comparisons of baseline scores during and after chemotherapy, and changes in scores from baseline, the Mann-Whitney test will be used. Primary HRQoL-endpoints are dysphagia and dyspnea.</description>
