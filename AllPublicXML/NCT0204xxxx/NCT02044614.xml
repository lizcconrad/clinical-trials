  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      1. To assess the feasibility and safety of applying a 12-week course of adjuvant
           low-frequency icodextrin-based peritoneal dialysis to an ongoing regimen of
           thrice-weekly in-center hemodialysis.

           Hypothesis: Icodextrin-based peritoneal dialysis can be safely and feasibly implemented
           in the context of ongoing thrice-weekly in-center hemodialysis.

        2. To measure the effects of a 12-week course of adjuvant low-frequency icodextrin-based
           peritoneal dialysis to ongoing thrice-weekly maintenance hemodialysis on:
           inter-hemodialytic weight gain, achievable hemodialytic dry weight, total body water,
           ambulatory blood pressure, serum phosphorus, and pre-to-post hemodialysis changes in
           serum potassium and pH, and Kidney Disease Quality of Life-SF physical functioning,
           energy fatigue, and general health scores.

      Hypotheses: Addition of adjuvant icodextrin-based peritoneal dialysis will:

        1. reduce inter-hemodialytic weight gain*

        2. enable achievement of lower hemodialytic dry weight

        3. reduce total body water

        4. improve ambulatory blood pressure control

        5. reduce serum phosphorus

        6. minimize per-hemodialytic changes in serum potassium and pH

        7. have favorable effects on indices of physical function and global health

             -  Indicates co-primary outcomes.

    <description>Adverse events will be described qualitatively and tabulated by frequency. Levels of icodextrin metabolites (considered individually and in aggregate) will be examined graphically and described in terms of means, standard deviations, medians, inter-quartile ranges, minimums and maximums. In Phase I, the association between Î”pre-HD serum osmolality (ie, current pre-HD osmolality-pre-HD osmolality preceding the first icodextrin exchange) and aggregate icodextrin metabolites will be examined graphically and by simple linear regression. The association between pre-to-post-HD changes and serum osmolality and pre-to-post-HD changes in aggregate icodextrin levels will be examined analogously.</description>
