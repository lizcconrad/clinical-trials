  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Assuming greater efficacy in the prevention of acute rejection in the EVR arm with
      minimisation of TAC levels, the hypothesis of the present trial is that the introduction of
      EVR in combination with the minimisation of TAC (rTAC) may offer improved kidney function
      compared with standard therapy with TAC-MMF.

    <description>The primary efficacy endpoint will be the difference in the percentage of patients showing clinical benefit, defined as: • an improvement in 1 or 2 ranges of the eGFR, according to MDRD-4 at Week 52 post-transplant in patients with values of 30-&lt;45 or 45-&lt;60 mL/min/1.73 m2 in Week 4. or • stabilisation of eGFR in patients with values ≥60 mL/min/1.73 m2 at Week 4 and maintained at Week 52 post-transplant.</description>

    <measure>Biomarkers of immunosuppression</measure>
    <time_frame>week 1,4,5,6,8,12,18,24,36,52</time_frame>
    <description>A panel of specific biomarkers of immunosuppression will be assessed in a subgroup of patients from each treatment group. For that purpose, the effector/regulatory immune response will first be analysed by using the IFN-/IL-12p70 ratio. Secondly, an analysis will be made of the ratios between levels of various biomarkers of suppression (p70-S6 kinase, IL-12p70, IL-6, IL-10, IFN-, TGF- and IP-10) and the clinical response of the patient (acute rejection or otherwise) by using a t-test and, finally, algorithms will be defined to predict exposure to the drug (rTAC-EVR vs. TAC-MMF) and the clinical response of the patient (acute rejection or otherwise) by using a logistical regression model that fixes the group as a covariable.</description>

    <description>•EVR: Treatment will be started at a total daily dose of 2 mg within 24 hours after randomisation. The dose of EVR will be adjusted upon reaching trough levels (C-0h) in whole blood of 3-8 ng/mL. The daily dose (in two administrations) of EVR may be modified to maintain trough levels (C-0h) in whole blood of 3-8 ng/mL until Week 52 post-transplant. •TAC: Once confirmation is obtained, beginning in Week 5, that trough levels (C-0h) in whole blood of EVR are between 3-8 ng/mL, minimisation of TAC will begin, in order to reach trough levels (C-0h) of TAC in whole blood of ≤5 ng/mL no later than four weeks after randomisation (Week 8), which are levels that should be maintained until Week 52 post-transplant. •MMF will be withdrawn at the same time that EVR is introduced. •oral corticosteroids will be administered in accordance with local clinical practice, although a therapeutic strategy free of corticosteroids is permitted</description>

    <description>•Dose of TAC: Trough levels (C-0h) of TAC in whole blood should be maintained between 6-10 ng/mL until Week 52 post-transplant. •Dose of MMF: Doses of 500-1000 mg/12 hrs will be maintained until Week 52. •Corticosteroids: During the study, oral corticosteroids will be administered in accordance with local clinical practice, although a therapeutic strategy free of corticosteroids is permitted (e.g. in patients with a history of HCV). It is recommended in any case that corticosteroids not be administered beyond Week 24 post-transplant except in cases of hepatopathy of autoimmune origin. At each centre all patients should follow the same administration protocol for corticosteroids based on history of HCV.</description>
