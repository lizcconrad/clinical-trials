  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Endovenous laser ablation is a common therapy of great saphenous vein insufficiency with a
      very high success rate. It works by heating and thereby obliterating the vein. Steam ablation
      is a new therapy that also works by heating and thereby obliterating the vein. The hypothesis
      of this study is that steam ablation is as effective as laser ablation, but that it results
      in better secondary outcomes (e.g., lower pain scores).

      The study is a randomized clinical trial comparing two different therapies for endovenous
      ablation of great saphenous veins. The aim of the study is to test whether the anatomical
      success rate of Steam Ablation is not inferior to that of Endovenous laser ablation (EVLA) in
      treatment of great saphenous vein insufficiency and compare the treatment safety, patient
      reported outcomes and cost-effectiveness analyses between EVLA and Steam Ablation.
