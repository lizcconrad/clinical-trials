  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Static postures, repetitive work tasks, and work stress increase the risk for musculoskeletal
      disorders and sickness absence. Objective measurements of occupational loadings - EMG for
      muscular activity, EEG for cognitive activity, ECG for cardiovascular activity and heart rate
      variability, actigraphy for bodily movements - may provide useful early indicators of
      muscular, cognitive and cardiovascular overload.

      The aim of this study is to investigate the effect of an individually tailored
      bio-psycho-social intervention strategy versus &quot;usual care&quot; ergonomics and standard physical
      exercises (reference group) on these risk factors in lab technicians with a history of
      work-related musculoskeletal pain.

    <description>Electromyography (EMG) is measured in the neck and shoulder muscles throughout a normal workday before and after the intervention. EMG gaps is defined as periods with muscular inactivity. Actigraphs are used to measure bodily movements, and only period with sitting or standing work are included in the analysis (i.e. walking activities are excluded from the analyses)</description>
