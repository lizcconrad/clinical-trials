      The project is a clinical behavioral research project based at University of Pennsylvania.
      The goal of this research is to design a brief clinic-based, Nurse Practitioner-guided, and
      theory-based health promotion intervention to enhance cervical cancer prevention among young
      women ages 18-26 living in economically disadvantaged urban communities. The investigators
      will evaluate the intervention for feasibility, acceptability and preliminary efficacy.
