  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to test the investigational drug Gamunex-C on the growth of blood
      vessels over the cornea. This study is being conducted by Dr. Balamurali Ambati at the Moran
      Eye Center at the University of Utah.

      The cornea is the clear outer front part of the eye. In corneal neovascularization, blood
      vessels grow over the cornea. Corneal neovascularization and ocular anterior segment
      inflammations are sight-threatening conditions. Lipid deposition and edema with subsequent
      scar formation can compromise corneal clarity irreversibly. Corneal neovascularization is
      also a well recognized risk factor for corneal graft failure. In its natural state, the
      cornea is a site of immune privilege well suited to tissue transplantation. Once
      vascularized, there is direct exposure of corneal antigens to circulating host immune
      mechanisms greatly increasing the chance of rejection [Collaborative Corneal Transplantation
      Study].

      Melting or inflammation in the anterior chamber, cornea, or ocular surface can cause
      irreversible scarring or destruction of the optical elements of the eye, which can compromise
      vision.

      Current standard of care for such conditions includes use of topical steroids and sometimes
      immunosuppressants (e.g., cyclosporine). These do not address a common underlying corneal
      neovascularization or melting.

      This is a Phase 1 clinical trial of subconjunctival IVIg (Gamunex-C) injection for treatment
      of corneal neovascularization in the setting of corneal transplantation with
      neovascularization. Candidates for corneal transplantation with corneal neovascularization in
      one or more quadrants crossing more than 0.5mm over the limbus will be identified for
      inclusion in our study.
