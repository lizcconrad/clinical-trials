    <textblock>
      Knee osteoarthritis is a common condition characterized by pain and functional disability in
      older people. Prevalence increases with age and is more frequent in older women. The aim of
      this study was to assess the effects of an 8-weeks hydrotherapy training with elastic bands
      on pain and functional disability in old people with knee osteoarthritis.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The main symptoms of knee osteoarthritis are pain and functional disability. These symptoms
      are caused by a progressive loss and deterioration of articular cartilage with reactive new
      bone formation at the joint's surface and margins involving articular cartilage, soft tissues
      and bone damage. Many treatment programs have been developed, including medication with
      nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, physical modalities, and therapeutic exercises. It is
      hypothesized that a hydrotherapy treatment during 8 weeks would benefit patients with knee
      osteoarthritis.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in pain pressure threshold</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The pain pressure threshold is defined as the minimum amount of pressure necessary to induce pain or tenderness . It was measured using a pressure algometer (Somedic AB, Sweden), which is a device with a 1 cm diameter rubber disc at the end on quadriceps muscle.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in lower extremity strength</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Changes in the strength of lower limbs is going to be assessed using the Stairs Climbing Test. This test assesses the ability to ascend and descend a flight of stairs, as well as lower extremity strength, power, and balance.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Dual task</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Dual task is going to be measured using the Timed Up &amp; Go. It assesses basic mobility skill as well as strength, balance, and agility.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Functional ability</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Functional ability was assessed by the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index. Higher scores on the this questionnaire represent greater limitations in function.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in balance</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The in balance after the treatment is going to be assessed using the single leg stance. This is a clinical tool that is often used to assess balance and postural steadiness. Subjects are asked to lift one leg off the floor based on their preference and keep the leg raised as long as possible without touching the other leg or the floor</description>

    <measure>Quality of sleep</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Quality of sleep was assessed by Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, a self-reported questionnaire.</description>
