  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to compare the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of the
      Easyhaler® (EH) device and other DPI devices commonly used in the UK in a UK primary care
      asthma population of patients aged 6 to 80 years.

      A recent observational study by Price et al carried out using the UK's General Practice
      Research Database (CPRD) to compare asthma-related outcomes for different inhaled
      corticosteroid (ICS) inhaler devices, using Easyhaler and dry powder inhalers (DPIs).

    <description>The Medication Possession Ratio (MPR) for ICS is defined using the following formula.
Medication Possession Ratio = (no. of days supply of ICS/365)x 100% The numerator is truncated at 365 if greater than 365. The MPR is a measure of adherence to therapy and a cut-off of 80% has previously been used in categorising asthma patients as adherent or non-adherent; the MPR has therefore been categorised as a dichotomous variable: &lt; 80% and ≥ 80% for this analysis.</description>

        This will be a retrospective, observational study consisting of a one-year baseline period
        immediately prior to an index prescription date (IPD), and a one-year outcome period
        immediately following the index date.

        At the IPD, patients either:

          -  Initiation cohort: receive their first prescription for ICS therapy as one of the
             study drugs

          -  Step-up cohort: receive a prescription for one of the study drugs at a dose ≥50% that
             of their prescribed ICS dose during baseline.

          -  Switch cohort: switch from BUD DPI (other) to BUD EH or continue on BUD DPI (other)
             with no change in ICS dose

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients must also meet the following inclusion criteria:

          -  (1) Aged: 6-80 years - stratified 6-11 years; 12-60 years; ≥61 years to allow
             paediatrics and adolescent / adult sub analyses; and to allow for the exclusion of
             elderly (aged 61+) smokers and ex-smokers if required.

          -  (2) On-going asthma therapy: ≥2 prescriptions for asthma during the outcome period
             (i.e. ≥1 prescription (for any asthma therapy) in addition to the prescription for ICS
             at IPD (initiation / step-up/ switch).

          -  (3) Evidence of active asthma:

               1. Initiation - a diagnostic code for asthma

               2. Step-up / Switch - ≥2 prescriptions for asthma (at least one of which is for ICS)
                  at different points in time during the baseline year PLUS a diagnostic code for
                  asthma.

          -  (4) Have at least one year of up-to-standard (UTS) baseline data and at least one year
             of UTS outcome data (following the IPD).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients will be excluded from the analysis if they have:

          -  (1) Had a COPD read code at any time; and/or

          -  (2) Had any chronic respiratory disease, except asthma, at any time; and/or

          -  (3) Patients on maintenance oral steroids during baseline year; and/or

          -  (4) Multiple ICS prescriptions at IPD.
