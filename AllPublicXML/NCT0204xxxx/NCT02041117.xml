      1. It is a multicenter, open-label, sing arm study to evaluate the effects of treatment of
           Rosuvastatin 10-20mg in volume and morphology of atherosclerotic plague by reducing
           LDL-C level to or less than 70mg/dl.

        2. Ischemic stroke patients will be enrolled within 1 month after stroke onset.

        3. Patients will be visited at 0m, 1m, 3m, 6m, 9m, 12m, 18m and 24m.
