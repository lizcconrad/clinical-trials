  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The people being asked to participate in this study have type 2 diabetes and abnormal levels
      of protein in their urine. This indicates that they are starting to develop diabetic kidney
      disease. The standard treatment for this is the use of one of two blood pressure medicines,
      either an angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker
      (ARB). However, these medicines are not always completely effective in stopping/reversing the
      kidney disease. Some studies have previously suggested that another type of medicine, called
      sitagliptin, normal used to treat diabetes may also help prevent diabetic kidney disease from
      getting worse.

      This study is being performed to test the effectiveness of sitagliptin as compared to a
      placebo, along with a stable dose of an ACE inhibitor or ARB, to determine whether or not it
      will reduce protein levels in their urine. Protein levels in the urine are a marker of the
      severity of kidney disease.
