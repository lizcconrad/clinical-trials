  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators will explore the chemopreventive role of metformin. The purpose of this
      study is to determine whether, among patients with endometrial cancer, treatment with the
      currently approved insulin sensitizing drug metformin increases or decreases pathway
      activation distal to the insulin receptor in endometrial cancer tissue. This is a phase IIa
      study of metformin to be used to the pre-operative period of women diagnosed with endometrial
      cancer by comparing their endometrial biopsy specimens taken at their initial visit and after
      4-6 weeks of treatment of metformin on the day of their surgical staging.

      Aim 1 To determine whether, among patients with endometrial cancer, treatment with the
      currently approved insulin sensitizing drug metformin increases or decreases pathway
      activation distal to the insulin receptor in endometrial cancer tissue.

      Aim II To compare specified biomarkers in each endometrial cancer patient before and after
      receiving metformin. Our goal is to compare the following biomarkers in each patient before
      and after metformin administration: Ki-67, TUNEL assay for apoptosis level, phosphor-AMPK,
      phosphor-IGF-1R, phosphor-IRS1, phospho-Akt, phospho-S6, phosphor-mTOR, pACC.

      All patients diagnosed with endometrial cancer presenting to the Jewish General Hospital for
      surgical treatment will be invited to participate.
