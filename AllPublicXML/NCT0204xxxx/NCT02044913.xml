  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to test in a randomized controlled trial if
      aftercare-coordination by phone subsequent to inpatient treatment is an effective aftercare
      approach in the treatment of depression and anxiety.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Depression and anxiety are among the most prevalent mental health problems and are associated
      with a high risk of chronification. Despite the large capacities in the German health care
      system only a small percentage of these patients receive treatment. Relevant barriers on the
      pathways of patients are communication und coordination difficulties between different
      services and providers.The aftercare subsequent to an inpatient treatment represents one of
      these interfaces. Here the aim is to consolidate the treatment outcomes and to minimize the
      so called rebound-effect, the reduction of the positive treatment effects after the inpatient
      treatment. Although evidence-based treatments for depression and anxiety disorders exist,
      treatment effects often decrease after treatment due to the lack of an integration of
      different steps in care. The method of a case management-based aftercare coordination by
      phone could be a promising approach to overcome the interface between inpatient treatment and
      aftercare: case management is a patient-centered and situation-based approach which comprises
      systematic tracking and support of patients by a case-manager. Primary goal is to coordinate
      and integrate services across treatment settings. This approach can help to maintain and even
      improve longterm treatment outcomes.
