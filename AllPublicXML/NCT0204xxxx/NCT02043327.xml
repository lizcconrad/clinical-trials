  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to create simulation-based tests with credible pass/fail-standards
      for two different fidelities of colonoscopy models

        1. virtual reality simulator

        2. physical model simulator To create pass/ fail standards for certification

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Twenty-five physicians (10 consultants with endoscopic experience and 15 fellows in the first
      year of fellowship without endoscopic experience) will be tested twice on each of the two
      different simulator models.

      Metrics with discriminatory ability will be identified for both modalities. Reliability will
      be determined A pass/ fail standard will be determined and the concequences explored.
