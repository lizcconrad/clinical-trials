      This pilot study is focused on what assistance an external prosthetic device, the
      BalanceBeltTM can provide in the: 1) assessment and 2) treatment for patients with Chronic
      Subjective Dizziness (CSD). The BalanceBelt has sensitive detectors for movement in the
      anterior/posterior and medial/lateral planes and provides the person wearing the device
      vibro-tactile feedback as to the persons orientation with respect to gravity. The device is a
      full self contained device that is comfortably worn around the waist over a light weight
      shirt. The device is non-FDA approved and is in its final stages of beta testing. Patients
      with CSD do not have permanent vestibular deficits, but underutilize vestibular signals
      because they develop visual or somatosensory dependence. The investigators expect the
      BalanceBeltTM to reset this error by providing patients with reliable motion stimuli.

      Purpose:

      Hypothesis: #1The use of the BalanceBelt™ will provide differential information about body
      sway movements during specific clinical balance and gait tasks in patients with CSD that is
      not currently available through routine measures.

      Hypothesis: #2 The use of the BalanceBelt™ will provide for a more rapid rate of reduction in
      patient symptoms compared to the historical data from the traditional habituation therapy
      method.

      Aims, purpose, or objectives: #1 Motion detectors contained in the BalanceBeltTM will be used
      to record information about the subtle changes in posture and gait that are thought to occur
      in patients with CSD with the tactors turned off. The goal of this portion of the study will
      be to improve diagnostic strategies for CSD.

      Aims, purpose, or objectives: #2 In this second portion of the study the investigators will
      test the benefits of a one week intensive rehabilitation program using the BalanceBeltTM with
      tactors activated in 10 patients with CSD. The goal of this study will be to develop a
      treatment that is quicker and more effective than current therapies.

      Background:

      Chronic subjective dizziness (CSD) is the second most common condition identified in patients
      referred to Mayo Clinic for persistent dizziness. The investigators manage nearly 500
      patients with CSD each year. CSD is a syndrome of persistent non-vertiginous dizziness and
      unsteadiness that may be worsened by patients' own motion, exposure challenging visual
      stimuli such as busy shopping areas, or performance of precision visual tasks such as
      reading. CSD develops in about 25% of patients following medical events that acutely disrupt
      balance. Once established, CSD may last for many years, even if the problems that triggered
      it resolves. As a result, CSD causes considerable distress and functional impairment, even to
      the extent of work disability and disruption of family and social life.

      Over the last decade, the Mayo Clinic Integrated Neurotology team, and other investigators
      around the world have developed two treatment strategies for CSD. One uses serotonergic
      medications such as sertraline (Zoloft) and venlafaxine (Effexor). The other is a variation
      of vestibular and balance exercises known as vestibular habituation. These therapies reduce
      symptoms for 60-80% of patients when administered by experts in the field. However, they have
      important shortcomings. They are time-consuming, taking a minimum of 2-3 months of diligent
      treatment to achieve best results. They usually achieve a partial reduction in symptoms,
      which improves patients' functioning, but falls short of a cure. They can make patients
      worse, rather than better, when used by clinicians who are unfamiliar with them.

      A new theory about altered postural control mechanisms in CSD suggests that it could be
      diagnosed more accurately and treated more quickly by using an external vestibular prosthesis
      to enhance sensory feedback during vestibular exercises. A suitable prosthesis is the
      BalanceBeltTM, which is currently in final beta testing by BalanceTek, the company that
      developed it. This device has been shown to have efficacy in reducing sway behavior in
      patients that have bilateral vestibular hypofunction. For those patients with deficient
      vestibular systems the belt provides information that is missing from the lack of vestibular
      system cues for detecting sway or leaning behavior, hence drawing attention to the
      information that is missing. The BalanceBeltTM is a comfortable, self-contained unit worn
      over a light weight shirt around the waist. It has sensitive motion detectors and small
      tactors that vibrate against the skin at four locations to provide information about posture
      and motion. Patients with CSD do not have permanent vestibular deficits, but underutilize
      vestibular signals because they develop visual or somatosensory dependence. The investigators
      expect the BalanceBeltTM to reset this error by providing patients with reliable motion
      stimuli.

      The investigators propose two preliminary studies using the BalanceBeltTM in patients with
      CSD. In the first study, the investigators will use the motion detectors contained in the
      BalanceBeltTM to record information about the subtle changes in posture and gait that are
      thought to occur in patients with CSD. This goal of this study will be to improve diagnostic
      strategies for CSD. The investigators will compare postural movements recorded with
      BalanceBeltTM with tactors turned off during quiet stance, normal walking (Dynamic Gait
      Index), functional reach test, and the Sensory Organization Test in 10 patients with CSD and
      10 age and gender matched normal individuals. In the second study, the investigators will
      test the benefits of a one week of intensive rehabilitation program using the BalanceBeltTM
      with tactors activated in 10 patients with CSD. The goal of this study will be to develop a
      treatment that is quicker and more effective than current therapies.

      Study Design:

      For Hypothesis and aim #1: Ten consecutive patients, ages 25-70 years, diagnosed with CSD
      after completion of their routine evaluation in the Dizziness and Balance disorders
      laboratory and their evaluation by the Behavioral Medicine program for dizziness, would then
      be recruited for participation in the study. If patients agree to participate patients will
      individually be placed through the following evaluations while the wearing the BalanceBelt™
      with the tactors turned off but the recording elements turned on. Each of these tests is a
      standard evaluation tool used in the Vestibular and Balance Laboratory on a routine basis:

        1. Dynamic Gait Index - evaluates gait under normal walking and under conditions of head
           turns, walking around two objects on the floor, stepping over a shoe box, walking at
           different speeds, walking with a stop and 180 degree turn, walking up and down 3
           standard steps with hand rails. During the evaluation the physical therapist or the
           audiologist guards the subjects at all times walking with the subject and the subject
           wears the harness used for the test in #3 that has a hand grab to prevent falls.

        2. Functional Reach Test - the subject stands in a stationary position and reaches out with
           a single arm as far as they can without taking a step. Here again the physical therapist
           or the audiologist is guarding the patient during the performance of the test, again
           with the subject in the harness used in #3 with the hand grab to prevent falls.

        3. Sensory Organization Test - this is a 6 condition standard evaluation of balance control
           performed on a dynamic platform that can record sway movement in the A/P dimension while
           the sensory inputs from proprioception and vision are varied through the platform and
           visual surround movements. The subject wears a full chest harness that is fastened to a
           roll bar above the subject to prevent any falls.

      For each of the patients an age and gender matched normal (± 5 years) volunteer will go
      through the same evaluations. The time for testing will take 45 minutes. Normal subjects will
      be recruited through written advertisements from visitors and / or accompanying persons for
      patients to Mayo Clinic. Each of the normal subjects will go through an office vestibular
      examination that will consist of direct monitoring for nystagmus in all positions of gaze
      with and without visual fixation present. Patients will also undergo the head thrust test
      with visual fixation present and headshake test with visual fixation absent. Pursuit and
      saccade office examination will be performed with a hearing screening by pure tones only. If
      any abnormalities are revealed with the screening the normal volunteer will be advised as to
      formal testing that should be performed via their primary care physician also being notified.

      For Hypothesis and aim #2: Ten consecutive patients, ages 25-70 years, diagnosed with CSD who
      live within a 30 minute drive time of the Rochester Mayo campus will be asked to participate
      in the habituation therapy activities typically used as treatment of CSD but with an
      intensive treatment program using the exercises at home for the first week. The patients will
      be using the BalanceBelt™ with the tactors activated. The typical therapy evaluations
      pre-therapy will be taken in addition to Visual Analog Scales related to the intensity of
      symptoms provoked by visual motion, head movements and walking in visually complex
      environments. These same measures will be taken at the end of the first week of intensive
      therapy at a return visit to check their exercise activities prior to continuing their
      progressive home treatment. The one week of intensive therapy will be performed prior to
      starting any recommended medications or medication changes for the CSD. The therapy will be
      conducted by one of the Physical Therapists certified in Vestibular and Balance therapy.

      Following the intensive therapy the patient will continue with the therapy activities and
      medication trials as is standard currently for the CSD patients.

      Data Analysis:

      Statistical Considerations

      Power Statement: Power analyses not used as this is a pilot study.

      Data Analysis Plan:

      For Hypothesis and aim #1: The outcome parameters from the BalanceBelt™ that represent the
      total amount of sway and sway activity in the A/P and M/L directions will be compare between
      the CSD patients and the normal age matched volunteers via the Wilcoxon rank-sum test for
      mean comparisons.

      For Hypothesis and aim #2: The visual analog scale scores pre &amp; post the the one week of
      intensive therapy will be compared for the 10 subjects using also the Wilcoxon test for mean
      comparisons.

      Endpoints As this is a pilot study no fixed endpoints will be used.
