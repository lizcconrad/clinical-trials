      -  To compare the efficacy of Iodine-125 radioactive seeds implantation versus IMRT to
           treat inoperable salivary gland carcinoma.

        -  To compare the safety of Iodine-125 radioactive seeds implantation versus IMRT to treat
           inoperable salivary gland carcinoma.

      The target population are those patients with inoperable salivary gland derived primary or
      recurrent cancer, including local advanced primary salivary gland cancer which could not be
      resected completely; recurrent salivary gland cancer which could not be resected completely;
      T3/T4 tumor which could not tolerate surgery due to severe combined disease. The subjects
      would be divided into Iodine-125 radioactive seeds permanent interstitial implantation
      brachytherapy and intensity-modulated radiation therapy randomly. During the follow-up
      period, the efficacy and the safety index would be monitored.

    <description>progression-free survival is definite as the time of death of tumor progression event emerges from the patient was randomize. According to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1 standard, tumor progressing during the treatment and follow up period means local control failure, which include the sum of diameters of local and region target focus increases ≥20% or ≥5mm; new focus emerges at local or region area; metastases or secondary primary tumor would not be concluded.
