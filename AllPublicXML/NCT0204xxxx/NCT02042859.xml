  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether the use of an FDA approved endoscopic
      bipolar catheter (EndoHPB) will ablate tissue in malignant tumors within the pancreatic
      ducts.

    <textblock>
      Only a small proportion of patients with biliary obstruction caused by cholangiocarcinoma or
      pancreatic cancer are suitable for surgical resection. Therefore most patients with malignant
      biliary obstruction will need palliation of their jaundice to relieve the symptoms of
      pruritus, malabsorption, sepsis and to minimize potential hepatorenal complications.
      Restoring biliary flow with relief of jaundice is the primary goal in the palliation of
      obstructive biliary malignancy. Drainage at endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography
      (ECRP) is established as a safer approach than at percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography
      (PTC) because it has a lower risk of bile leak, infection and hemorrhage. ECRP is the first
      approach to relieve malignant biliary obstruction but sometimes it is not technically
      possible to stent the patient by this approach, then a PTC needs to be undertaken. Self
      expanding mesh metal stents (SEMS) were introduced back in the 1990s. Problems can still
      arise with the use of covered stents such as cholecystitis, pancreatitis or tumor overgrowth
      at the end of the stent, and not all studies have shown that covered stents actually reduce
      the problems of tumor ingrowth and consequent stent occlusion. EndoHPB can be deployed via an
      ERCP or PTC route. By using radiofrequency (RF) energy to heat the tissue in the duct prior
      to insertion of the stent, the surrounding tissue becomes coagulated and this may may delay
      tumor growth and the time before the stent lumen becomes blocked. Thereby this allows
      increased periods between the need for intervention and further stent deployment. If EndoHPB
      use of luminal RF is demonstrated to be effective in luminal tumor ablation, it may have an
      additional role as a form of neoadjuvant therapy in cholangiocarcinoma and pancreatic cancer.
