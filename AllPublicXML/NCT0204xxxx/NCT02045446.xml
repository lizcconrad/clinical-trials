  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The core hypothesis to be tested is that the use of consolidative SBRT followed by
      maintenance chemotherapy in patients with less than or equal to 6 metastatic sites (primary +
      5) will improve progression free survival (PFS) compared to maintenance chemotherapy alone.

      This protocol is a randomized phase II trial of maintenance chemotherapy versus consolidative
      Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy (SBRT) plus maintenance chemotherapy for patients with
      Stage IV non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).

      Prior to accrual on the trial, patients with Stage IV NSCLC will be treated with standard
      first-line chemotherapy. Patients who achieve a partial response or stable disease by imaging
      criteria with fewer than or equal to six sites of oligometastatic disease will be randomized
      to maintenance chemotherapy or consolidative SBRT to all sites of disease (followed by
      maintenance chemotherapy at the medical oncologist's discretion). Choices of first line and
      maintenance chemotherapy will be determined by the medical oncologist based on clinical
      appropriateness.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients must have biopsy proven metastatic NSCLC (Stage IV).

          2. Patients must have received first line chemotherapy, from 4-6 cycles, and achieved
             stable disease or a partial response.

          3. Patients receiving first-line erlotinib, gefitinib, or crizotinib for EGFR
             mutant-positive or EML4-ALK positive NSCLC will be excluded.

          4. Age ≥ 18 years

          5. Patients must have measurable disease at baseline.

          6. Patients can have up to only 6 discrete active extracranial lesions (≤3 in the liver
             and ≤3 in the lung) identified by PET scan and also seen on correlative plain film, CT
             scan, or MRI within 8 weeks prior to the initiation of SBRT.

               1. For patients who have received prior radiotherapy to the primary site in the
                  lung, residual PET activity is difficult to interpret and will not be considered
                  a site of active disease if the CT appearance is stable or improved over an
                  interval of at least three months

               2. Patients who previously received radiotherapy to the primary site will be
                  ineligible if there is CT evidence of disease progression within the past 3
                  months.

               3. Patients with previously un-irradiated primary sites will be potentially
                  eligible, but special considerations apply.

               4. Up to 2 contiguous vertebral metastases will be considered a single site of
                  disease.

          7. Patients must have a KPS &gt;60

          8. AST, ALT &amp; Alkaline phosphates must be ≤ 2.5X the upper limit of normal. Total
             bilirubin must be within the limit of normal.

          9. Patients should have adequate bone marrow function as defined by peripheral
             granulocyte count of ≥1500/mm³.

         10. Patients should have adequate renal function (serum creatinine ≤1.5 times the ULN).

         11. Females of childbearing potential should have a negative pregnancy test.

         12. Patients who would be receiving SBRT for lung tumors who are known or suspected by the
             treating radiation oncologist to have compromised lung function must have a documented
             forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) ≥ 1L.

         13. Patients must provide verbal and written informed consent to participate in the study.

         14. Total bilirubin: within normal institutional limits

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients who previously received radiotherapy to the primary site with CT evidence of
             disease progression at the primary site within 3 months following the initial
             radiotherapy.

          2. Patients with either untreated brain metastases or brain metastases treated within the
             past three months are ineligible

          3. Patients with serious, uncontrolled, concurrent infection(s).

          4. Significant weight loss (&gt;10%) in the prior 3 months.

          5. Because the tolerance dose of SBRT to the gastrointestinal tract is not established,
             patients with metastatic disease invading the esophagus, stomach, intestines, or
             mesenteric lymph nodes will not be eligible.

          6. Patients with cutaneous metastasis of NSCLC.

          7. Treatment for other carcinomas within the last five years, except cured non-melanoma
             skin and treated in-situ cancers.

          8. Patients with more than 6 discrete extra-cranial lesions.

          9. Participation in any investigational drug study within 4 weeks preceding the start of
             study treatment.

         10. Unwillingness to participate or inability to comply with the protocol for the duration
             of the study.

         11. Patients who are pregnant. Patients with reproductive capability will need to use
             adequate contraception during the time of participation in the study
