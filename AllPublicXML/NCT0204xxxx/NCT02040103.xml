  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients admitted to the intensive care unit are at high risk of developing clots in the
      veins of the lower extremities. The objective of this study is to examine whether the use of
      a device that provides intermittent compression to the legs in addition to the use of
      low-dose blood thinners, provides an additional protection when compared to the use of blood
      thinners alone. Patients who are admitted to the intensive care unit are receiving low-dose
      blood thinners to prevent clots are candidates for this study. Patients who are enrolled will
      continue to receive blood thinners but some will additionally receive the leg compression.
      The additional use of leg compression may provide protection from clots. The main side effect
      is possible skin abrasions but this is usually mild. The study is sponsored by King Abdullah
      International Medical Research Center(KAIMRC) and King Abdulaziz City for Science and
      Technology(KACST) and will be conducted in several hospitals in Saudi Arabia, Canada,
      Australia, Brazil and possibly other countries. The study started July 2014 and is to
      continue for 4 years.

      There is no randomized controlled trial examining effect of the adjunct use of IPC with
      pharmacologic prophylaxis compared to pharmacologic prophylaxis (UFH, LMWH) alone in
      critically ill patients for VTE prevention.
