      This is a physician sponsored multi-center, non-randomized, prospectively enrolling data
      collection study of patients with early stage breast cancer treated with electronic
      brachytherapy at the time of surgical resection of the cancer in the operating room. The
      radiation therapy treatments will be administered with electronic brachytherapy using the FDA
      cleared Xoft Axxent System.

      Breast Conserving Therapy (BCT) is a standard treatment option for patients with stage I or
      II breast cancer. Breast conserving therapy consists of surgical removal of the tumor with
      negative margins, axillary lymph node dissection or sentinel node biopsy and radiation
      therapy. Several studies have shown BCT to be comparable to mastectomy in terms of overall
      and disease free survival for patients. The major advantage to BCT over mastectomy is breast
      preservation and reduced psychological trauma to the patient. The major disadvantage to BCT
      is prolonged time of treatment. The whole breast radiation portion of BCT can add 7 weeks to
      the treatment time. This additional treatment time can be a detriment to women who
      logistically may not be able to meet the demands of daily irradiation for 6-7 weeks. A new
      form of treatment, breast brachytherapy, was developed to decrease the treatment time
      required for breast irradiation. This treatment uses the Xoft Axxent system to administer
      intra-operative breast brachytherapy in one treatment, at the time of lumpectomy in the
      operating room.

      This study has been designed to assess local recurrence, serious adverse events, adverse
      events and their severity, and cosmesis following intra-operative radiation therapy (IORT)
      using the Xoft Axxent System and balloon applicators. The study device is FDA cleared. The
      purpose of this clinical study is to compile data on the treatment of patients using the Xoft
      Axxent System for the delivery of radiation therapy in the intra-operative setting as part of
      breast conserving therapy in women with resected, early stage breast cancer.
