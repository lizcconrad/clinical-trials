      Title:

      Inter-rater reliability of the reflux finding score based on endoscopic laryngeal findings in
      the diagnosis of laryngopharyngeal reflux disease

      Participants:

      Voluntary participants after invitation among members (a total of about 40
      gastroenterologists) of Gangwon Branch of Korean Society of Gastrointestinal Endoscopy and an
      otorhinolaryngologist

      Primary endpoint:

      Interrater reliability (Kappa coefficient) on the sum of reflux finding score more than 7
      points between an otorhinolaryngologist and gastroenterologists (7 points means the cut-off
      value for the diagnosis of laryngopharyngeal reflux disease)

      Secondary endpoint:

      Agreement (%) on 8 items of reflux finding score for laryngopharygeal reflux among
      gastroenterologists

      Study Design

        1. Recruitment of doctor participants: introduction by e-mail

        2. Education on reflux finding score - standardized materials (instructional video)

        3. PRETEST (15 pictures) / feedback (at-a-glance assessment format)

        4. TEST 1 (50 pictures) - Acess format including 8 items at each pictures

        5. Feedback education (individualized intruction of an otorhinolaryngologist)

        6. TEST 2 (50 pictures) - Acess format including 8 items at each pictures

        7. Test-Retest reliability - repeat Test 2 with 1 week interval (Participants should take
           retest of TEST 2 with the concealment of the answer)

        8. Analysis
