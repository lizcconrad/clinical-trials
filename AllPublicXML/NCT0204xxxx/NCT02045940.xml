  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is the first administration of GSK2881078 to humans. The intention of this study
      is to provide sufficient confidence in the safety of the molecule to inform progression to
      further repeat dose and proof of concept studies. This study will include approximately 52
      subjects and consist of 2 parts. Part A will consist of two cohorts of 8 subjects to assess
      the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetic (PK) of ascending single oral doses of
      GSK2881078. Cohorts 1 and 2 will include healthy male subjects. Part B (Cohorts 3, 4 and 5)
      will include three cohorts of 12 healthy male subjects to examine the safety, tolerability,
      PK, and pharmacodynamic (PD) of repeated doses of GSK2881078 over 14 days. The total duration
      of the study including screening and follow-up, is not expected to exceed 70 days.
