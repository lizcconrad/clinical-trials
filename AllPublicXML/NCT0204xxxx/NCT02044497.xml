  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Oxycodone is an oral opioid analgesic that is most commonly prescribed for the management of
      pain in post-operative patients at Boston Children's Hospital. Oxycodone has been widely used
      in adults and children to relieve post-operative pain. However, its pharmacokinetics (what it
      does in the body) and pharmacodynamics (how it works) have not been well established in
      children. Some children, because of their specific genetic make-up, may metabolize the drug
      more quickly and therefore may be at risk for more side effects in the commonly prescribed
      dose. We would like to find out more about how this drug is absorbed, metabolized and
      excreted in children. In order to study these aspects, we would like to give oxycodone to
      surgical patients at Boston Children's Hospital then measure its metabolic activity and also
      perform a genetic analysis. The genetic testing is specifically to analyze the following
      genotypes only: cytochrome P450 2D6 (CYP2D6) and cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4), which
      represent the differences in cytochrome P450 metabolism of oxycodone.

      Oxycodone is the most commonly used analgesic for the management of moderate and severe
      postoperative pain. The efficacy of Oxycodone as a potent opioid has been confirmed in
      children.

      The principal metabolic pathway of oxycodone in humans is N-demethylation via enzyme CYP3A4
      to generate inactive noroxycodone. [6] A smaller amount (approximately 11%) is O-demethylated
      by cytochrome P450 enzyme CYP2D6 to become oxymorphone, the active and potent metabolite
      which exhibits about 40 times the affinity and 8 times the potency on μ-opioid receptors
      compared to the mother substance. Approximate frequencies of cytochrome P450 enzyme CYP2D6
      phenotypes for the Caucasian population are: poor metabolizers 5 - 10%,
      extensive/intermediate metabolizers 65-90%, and ultra-rapid metabolizers 5 - 10%. Kirchheiner
      and colleagues noticed more codeine-related sedative side-effects in ultra-rapid
      metabolizers. In studies investigating extensive and poor metabolizers, codeine side-effects
      do not seem to be related to CYP2D6 genotype. However, clinical investigations of CYP2D6
      genotype in the postoperative pain setting have shown conflicting results, and well-designed
      prospective studies are lacking. Taken together, these results demonstrate the need for
      careful pharmacokinetic studies in children who received a pharmacologic agent, such as
      oxycodone, which is metabolized by the enzyme CYP2D6.

      The population PK of oxycodone and its metabolites has not been fully established for oral
      oxycodone in pediatric patients. In addition, there is a group of ultra-rapid metabolizers
      (approximately 4.5% of the population, but as high as 20% in some particular ethnic groups;
      East African and Saudi Arabian populations) which may be at risk for serious side effects in
      the commonly prescribed dose (which is extrapolated from adult recommendations). Given that
      BCH has switched (from codeine) to oxycodone as the most common opioid prescribed for all
      postoperative patients and the recent concerns of serious side effects from codeine. It is
      important to further investigate oral oxycodone to optimize dosing recommendations.
