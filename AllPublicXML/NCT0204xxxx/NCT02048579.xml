      Broadly, the purpose of the proposed study is to test the efficacy of a parent-coordinated,
      parent-teen-teacher collaborative intervention for middle school students with ADHD and
      academic impairment (STAND; Supporting Teens' Academic Needs Daily). [This model was chosen
      because of its potential ability to promote treatment maintenance and generalizability across
      school years, because parents will be taught to implement, monitor, and adjust intervention
      components as needed. Key innovative components in the STAND intervention address previously
      reported treatment barriers: 1) a parent-delivered academic intervention to promote
      maintenance and generalization across school years, and to relieve some of the burden of
      intervention delivery from teachers, 2) motivational interviewing to address parent
      disengagement from and adolescent resistance to the treatment process, 3) multiple tailored
      options for home-school communication, including a web-based support system, to facilitate
      home-school communication, and 4) empowering parents by coaching them to effectively and
      tactfully involve teachers in the treatment planning and monitoring process in order to
      increase teachers' willingness to support the child's academic needs. To study the
      feasibility and preliminary efficacy of the STAND treatment model,] two cohorts of 42 middle
      school students with ADHD will be recruited (total N=84) and randomly assigned to participate
      in STAND or a treatment-as-usual monitoring group. All participants will complete intake,
      mid-treatment, post-treatment, [and follow-up] assessments designed to monitor academic
      functioning, [intervention feasibility, compliance, and satisfaction].

      Aim 1: The proposed study will evaluate the efficacy, [maintenance, and cross-school year
      generalization] of a parent-teen-teacher collaborative intervention (Supporting Teens'
      Academic Needs Daily; STAND) vs. treatment as usual to increase the academic functioning of
      middle school students with ADHD. Intervention effects on ADHD symptomatology and impairment,
      grade-point-average (GPA), [organization, daily planner use], homework completion, teacher
      ratings of academic functioning and classroom behavior, and the parent-teen relationship will
      be examined.

      Aim 2: The proposed study will examine the acceptability and feasibility of the STAND
      program. Parents and teens will report on [satisfaction, barriers to treatment participation,
      therapeutic alliance, and treatment credibility] throughout the intervention and follow-up
      period. [Therapists will also complete ratings of parent and adolescent engagement and
      compliance with treatment procedures] will be collected from participants in the program.
      Parent, teen, and teacher compliance with intervention procedures will also be measured in
      order to assess feasibility. Treatment fidelity measures will also be collected in order to
      measure clinician adherence to the manualized STAND procedures.

      Aim 3: The proposed study will also explore ways to improve home-school communication during
      the middle school years. To this end, families will be given options regarding the modality
      of communication with teachers, and parent, teen, and teacher preferences for medium of
      intervention delivery will be examined (i.e., web-based, email, paper/pencil).
