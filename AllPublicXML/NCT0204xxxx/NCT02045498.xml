      This study has done at Mashhad Ghaem Educational center. Two nurses and an anesthesia
      resident selected and trained according to the latest guidelines of CPR . In the control
      sample, with the declare of code 99 and attend the team on the patient's bedside, CPR begins
      and then every two minutes, return of the patient checks in the usual way. quality
      performance of rescuers ,Recovery or death of the patient and the result is recording. In the
      second phase , group members were educated how to use capnography (Comdek's MD-660P
      Oxi-Capnography) in CPR and guiding restoration efforts by it. with the code 99 and attend
      the team on the patient's bedside capnography uses and its waveforms will appear on the
      monitor device which is visible to all rescuers and the quality of performance is renewed
      based on the its guidance. The two groups patients for age, sex, initial rhythm of arrest,
      time of arrest until the first action, the time of arrest until the first shocks are
      comparing to control these factors influence on the outcome. quality performance of rescuers
      , resuscitation outcomes and CPR duration and relative factors in each of the groups were
      recorded and compared.
