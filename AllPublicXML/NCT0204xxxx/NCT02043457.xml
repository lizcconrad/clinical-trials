    <textblock>
      The Investigational Weight Management Clinic at the University of Michigan was created to
      identify strategies that will result in cost-effective, long term weight management for
      overweight and obese individuals. The driving hypothesis of the clinic is that the 'one size
      fits all' philosophy is untenable with a complex disease such as obesity. The clinic will
      serve as a portal for patients to choose standard clinical care or to explore alternatives
      from a variety of clinical studies offered through the clinic. These studies will include
      further investigations into nutrition, the biological basis of weight and weight management
      and protocols using approved and experimental pharmaceuticals.

        1800 obese and 200 lean controls participating in a 2 year clinical weight loss and weight
        maintenance program may opt-in to participate in a number of evaluations including
        depression inventory and HRQOL questionnaires, assessing hunger and appetite, work
        performance (including presenteeism and absenteeism), oral glucose tolerance testing, mixed
        meal tolerance testing with metabolomics, DNA, RNA, with or without muscle and adipose
        tissue biopsies, body composition by DEXA or BodPod, measurements of posture allocation and
        physical activity by Sensewear Body Media, measurements of REE and V02 max before at
        baseline, after 10-15% weight loss and after the 2 year clinical program.
