  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Compromised tissue oxygenation during surgery may negatively influence patient outcome.
      Primary cause of insufficient tissue oxygenation is reduced cardiac output due to hypovolemia
      and/or reduced cardiac contractility. In cardiac surgery patients especially, postoperative
      pericardia effusion and/or tamponade may further compromise cardiac function. Today,
      hemodynamically instable patients are often monitored by means of pulmonal artery catheters
      or transpulmonary thermodilution. However, these methods only allow quantification of
      functional limitations. Underlying causes may be investigated by relatively recent technology
      through hemodynamically focussed transesophageal echocardiography (ClariTEE(R) ImaCor) that
      also provide the possibility of continuous monitoring. It has been reported that a training
      program consisting of six hours may enable physicians who are unexperienced in the field of
      echocardiography to apply this new method. Up to now, there is no evidence whether this
      methods is associated with improved postoperative outcome.

      Therefore we hypothesize that continuous hemodynamically focussed transesophageal
      echocardiography positively influences patient outcome (primary hypothesis). Furthermore, its
      application may decrease hospital expenses (secondary hypothesis).
