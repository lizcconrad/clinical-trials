    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to test a newly developed individual psychotherapy treatment for
      binge eating disorder in adults. This treatment is a type of individual psychotherapy called
      Integrative Cognitive-Affective Therapy (ICAT) that focuses on helping people change their
      behaviors, feelings, thoughts about themselves, and relationships. This new treatment is
      being compared to an existing treatment called Cognitive-Behavior Therapy-Guided Self Help
      (CBTgsh), which focuses on changing behavior patterns through the use of reading and homework
      assignments along with sessions with a therapist. The primary hypothesis of this
      investigation is that ICAT will be associated with greater reductions in binge eating at end
      of treatment and follow-up compared to CBTgsh.
