  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This pilot study will obtain preliminary evidence on which to base sample size calculations
      for a future trial of whether spironolactone (an aldosterone blocker) reduces knee pain in
      older people with symptomatic OA knee when given in addition to usual analgesia. Aldosterone
      is known to be pro-inflammatory, and spironolactone suppresses cytokine production in chronic
      arthritis. This application builds on previous work by the applicants showing that
      spironolactone significantly improved quality of life (particularly pain) in frail older
      people. The investigators will recruit 86 people (aged 70 years or over) with well-defined OA
      knee to 25mg spironolactone daily or to matching placebo for 12 weeks. The primary outcome is
      the between group difference in change in WOMAC pain sub-score at 12 weeks. Secondary
      outcomes are the WOMAC stiffness and physical function subscales and health related quality
      of life (EQ-5D). Morning cortisol levels will be measured to assess the effect of
      mineralocorticoid receptor blockade on glucocorticoid levels, which may mediate the
      anti-inflammatory effect of spironolactone; and urinary CTX-II, and serum matrix
      metalloproteinase-3 (MMP-3) will be measured as biomarkers as both are sensitive to the
      effects of pharmacological interventions for osteoarthritis.

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Participant is willing and able to give informed consent

          2. Community dwelling

          3. Aged 70 years and over

          4. Symptomatic idiopathic OA knee according to American College of Rheumatology clinical
             and radiographic criteria (ie Knee pain - with or without crepitus and presence of
             osteophytes on x ray)

          5. To avoid floor effects, participants will require to have moderate (or more severe)
             pain at screening in at least 2 out of 5 WOMAC pain score items

          6. To have been in receipt (prescription or/and over the counter) of one or more
             analgesic agents at a therapeutic dose for at least 2 months

          7. Willing to have knee x-ray if one has not been taken in preceding 12 months

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Clinical diagnosis of symptomatic heart failure

          2. History of inflammatory arthritis

          3. Already taking spironolactone

          4. Previous intolerance to spironolactone

          5. Known allergies to spironolactone or lactose

          6. Objection to taking capsules made from animal sourced gelatine

          7. Taking oral NSAIDs (because of the increased risk of renal impairment when combined
             with spironolactone)

          8. Taking ACE inhibitors or ARBs (angiotensin II receptor antagonists). ARBs have many
             properties similar to those of ACE inhibitors. Both will be exclusion because of the
             increased risk of acute kidney injury and hyperkalaemia, and because our previous
             study also excluded those on ACE inhibitors (and ARBs) and treatment was safe and well
             tolerated.

          9. Supine hypotension (supine systolic blood pressure &lt;100mmHg at screening)

         10. Significant chronic kidney disease (eGFR&lt;40ml/min)

         11. Serum sodium&lt;130mmol/l

         12. Serum potassium&gt;5.0mmol/l

         13. Symptomatic orthostatic hypotension (measured at screening)

         14. Nursing home resident

         15. Wheelchair bound

         16. Participating in another clinical trial (other than observational trials and
             registries) concurrently or within 30 days prior to screening for entry into this
             study

         17. Known contraindication to spironolactone therapy

         18. Participant who is terminally ill, defined as less than 3 months expected survival
