      The purpose of this study is to compare the incidence of nausea and vomiting following short
      intermittent versus prolonged intermittent infusion of meropenem.

      1. To assess the number of episodes of emesis following both short and prolonged
           intermittent infusion of meropenem.

        2. To assess the number of episodes of emesis corresponding to the peak serum concentration
           of meropenem.

        3. To assess the number of episodes of emesis corresponding to the area under the meropenem
           serum concentration time curve.

        4. To assess reported nausea, measured through administered dosages of anti-nausea
           medication, following both short and prolonged intermittent infusion of meropenem.

        5. To assess reported nausea, measured through administered doses of anti-nausea
           medication, corresponding to peak concentrations of meropenem.

        6. To assess reported nausea, measured through administered dosages of anti-nausea
           medication, corresponding to the area under the serum concentration time curve

        7. To assess reported nausea, measured through patient-reported nausea measured using
           pictorial scales of severity of nausea in pediatric patients, following both short and
           prolonged intermittent infusion of meropenem.

        8. To assess reported nausea, measured through patient-reported nausea measured using
           pictorial scales of severity corresponding to the peak serum concentrations of
           meropenem.

        9. To assess reported nausea, measured through patient-reported nausea measured using
           pictorial scales of severity corresponding to the area under the meropenem serum
           concentration time curve.

    <time_frame>Nausea will be assessed while patient is receiving 4 days of prolonged intermittent infusion and 4 days of short intermittent infusion.</time_frame>
    <description>Nausea indices will be measured for each treatment arm by averaging the doses of granisetron requested by each patient, the number of episodes of emesis, and the nausea faces scale scores recorded by patients.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Compare pharmacokinetic data to indices of nausea.</measure>
    <time_frame>Pharmacokinetic data will be obtained following the third, fourth, or fifth dose of meropenem administered during of each arm of the study. Peak serum concentration and area under the serum concentration time curve will be compared to nausea indices.</time_frame>
    <description>Blood samples will be obtained at 0.5, 1.0 and 1.5 hours after the third, fourth or fifth meropenem dose on each arm of the study. Area under the serum concentration time curve and peak serum concentrations will be compared to each of the nausea indices.</description>
