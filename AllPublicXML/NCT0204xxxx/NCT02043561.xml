      The aim of this study will be to investigate the effect of rectal distension, controlled by
      electronic barostat, on cognitive control ability in healthy subjects. We will use the Stroop
      task and an intertemporal choice task as standard instruments. Like bladder control and
      rectal control, both Stroop task performance and intertemporal choices - though very
      different tasks at the surface - are dependent on the conflict monitoring function of the
      anterior cingulate cortex. The Stroop task requires the naming of the print color of a series
      of visually presented color words, and reaction time and error rates are typically used as
      performance indicators. When word color and word meaning do not match, performance of the
      task (color naming) requires the inhibition of a (near) automatic response (word reading).
      The intertemporal choice task consists of a series of choices between a sooner smaller
      monetary reward and a larger but later reward. The choices are constructed such that they
      allow the estimation of a discount parameter, which is an index for the level of
      impulsiveness manifested by the participant at the time the choices are made.

      The hypothesis is that the inhibition induced by the urge generated during rectal distension
      will improve cognitive inhibitory performance, as has previously been shown for bladder
      filling.
