  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label phase 1, safety, PK, and preliminary efficacy study of oral Gefitinib
      and IV Tremelimumab in previously treated NSCLC patients who have documented evidence of an
      activating mutation in the EGFR gene and have failed treatment with an EGFR inhibitor such as
      Erlotinib or Gefitinib. The primary objective of this phase I, is to determine the safety and
      tolerability of oral Gefitinib in combination with escalating doses of Tremelimumab and to
      establish a recommended phase 2 dose. Secondary objectives include evaluation of,
      pharmacokinetics, immunogenicity, antitumor activity of Gefitinib and Tremelimumab
      combination. The exploratory objectives are to evaluate biomarkers that may correlate with
      activity or prospectively identify patients likely to respond to Tremelimumab and Gefitinib.

      The biological rationale for such a study is that even though the disease is progressing it
      is likely that EGFR sensitive clones, although diminished under the pressure from the EGFR
      TKI, are still present. Therefore, withdrawing the inhibitory pressure of the EGFR TKI can
      potentially allow regrowth of the EGFR sensitive cells. On the other hand, the proliferation
      of EGFR resistant clones needs to be suppressed by another therapeutic approach. Until today
      no association of chemotherapy and TKI EGFR has demonstrated clinical benefit. Moreover,
      patients may have received chemotherapy and the likelihood of chemosensitivity is very low.
      So, the association of Gefitinib with immune checkpoint blockade is very attractive and may
      result in clinical benefit in NSCLC with EGFRmut.

         13. Negative screening test results for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis A, B
             and C. If positive results are not indicative of true active or chronic infection, the

             subjects must fulfill the following additional criterion:

         15. Provide signed, written, and dated informed consent for genetic research. If a subject
             declines to participate in the genetic component of the study, there will be no

             aspects of the study described in this Clinical Study Protocol, so long as they
             consent.
