  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist are new treatment of type 2 diabetes, they
      lower blood glucose level (by enhancement of glucose-dependent insulin secretion and
      suppression of excess glucagon secretion) and reduce weight by inducing satiety and slowing
      of gastric emptying. Beneficial effects of GLP-1 and GLP-1 receptor (GLP-1R) agonists on
      cardiovascular function have been suggested. They improve biomarkers of CV risk, decrease
      systolic blood pressure, improve endothelial function and have beneficial effects on
      myocardium. Nevertheless, few studies have analysed the effect of GLP1 treatment on
      myocardial function in type 2 obese diabetic.

      Myocardial steatosis is an independent predictor of diastolic dysfunction in type 2 diabetes
      mellitus. It was recently shown that 16 weeks of caloric restriction in obese patients with
      diabetes decrease myocardial triglyceride content and improve myocardial function (cardiac
      output, normalized stroke volume, LV mass and normalized end diastolic volume), and diastolic
      function. However, no study has evaluated the impact of Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1)
      receptor agonist in obese diabetics on myocardial TG content.

      Recent studies have suggested that increased epicardial adipose tissue (EAT) could be an
      important risk factor for cardiac diseases. We and others have already evidenced a
      correlation between the volume of epicardial adipose tissue and the presence or the severity
      of coronaropathy. The impact of weight loss on the volume of EAT or the characteristics of
      EAT is mostly unknown.
