    <textblock>
      Taxotere is the current standard first-line chemotherapy for mCRPC and may be used as
      second-line therapy in good responders in first-line (Taxotere rechallenge). Jevtana has
      demonstrated a survival benefit versus mitoxantrone in patients progressing during or after
      Taxotere and is now the standard second-line chemotherapy. Taxotere and Jevtana have
      different toxicity profiles.

      Many patients who are receiving Jevtana for second-line treatment indicate they prefer this
      agent over Taxotere with regards to the general tolerance (namely peripheral neuropathy, nail
      changes, asthenia). This was not expected since Jevtana in post-Taxotere setting was
      associated with more grade 3-4 adverse events such as febrile neutropenia and diarrhea than
      Taxotere in first-line setting.

      The study design of CABA-DOC is similar to that of the PISCES trial which evaluated the
      patient preference between two standard treatments for first-line metastatic kidney cancer.
      Despite similar PFS improvements over placebo in phase III trials, results clearly showed
      that patients preferred pazopanib over sunitinib.

      A randomized phase III study is currently comparing the efficacy of Taxotere and Jevtana in
      first-line setting with overall survival as a primary end-point. Assessing patient preference
      between Jevtana and Taxotere would contribute to further identify differences between these
      two taxanes and clarify which one of these two taxanes should be used for second-line
      chemotherapy and perhaps for first-line chemotherapy in the future.

      Assessing patient preference between the two taxanes might be less biased in the first-line
      setting where patients have no previous experience with a taxane.

    <description>Patient preference (Taxotere versus Jevtana) assessed by a single question after completion of the second period of chemotherapy.
Primary outcome measure will be assessed in the intent-to-treat population as defined by all patients having completed the first 4 cycles without progression and having received at least 1 cycle of the second treatment period. Patients having progressed during the first period will discontinue the trial.</description>
