  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Thoracic surgery correlates with significant pain in postoperative period. In order to
      alleviate the pain various combinations of pharmaceuticals and administration methods are
      employed. So as to reduce the extent of surgical trauma and, consequently, correlated pain
      various operation techniques are used. In traditional thoracotomy epidural anesthesia remains
      a golden standard. Epidural anesthesia however demands high skills to be performed correctly
      and presents an increased risk of grave complications. In videothoracoscopic (VATS)
      operations paravertebral blockade can be employed, yet there is no certainty if its efficacy
      after lung lobectomy. We therefore designed a prospective, randomized, parallel group, single
      site study to test the hypothesis, that continuous paravertebral blockade is as efficient in
      postoperative pain reduction as continuous epidural blockade and possesses a higher safety
      profile.

    <description>Before anesthesia, continuous thoracic epidural block of T5/T6 is performed (Portex Epidural Minipack set). Identification of paravertebral space by loss of resistance technique (air). A catheter is advanced ca. 3-5 cm, and test dose with 2 ml of lidocaine 2% i injected. At the end of surgery syringe with 0,25% bupivacaine with epinephrine 1:200.000 is connected to catheter and 6 ml bolus is injected, followed by an infusion of the same mixture at 0,06 ml/kg/h for postoperative pain management.</description>

    <description>Before anesthesia, continuous thoracic paravertebral block of T5/T6 is performed (Portex Epidural Minipack set). Identification of paravertebral space by loss of resistance technique (normal saline). After injection of 5-10 ml of normal saline a catheter is advanced medially ca. 5 cm. At the end of surgery syringe with 0,25% bupivacaine with epinephrine 1:200.000 is connected to catheter and 20 ml bolus is injected, followed by an infusion of the same mixture at 0,08 ml/kg/h for postoperative pain management</description>
