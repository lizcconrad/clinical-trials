  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This non-drug, single center, 24-week, longitudinal study in ambulant spinal muscular atrophy
      (SMA) patients and in age- and gender-matched healthy volunteers will assess the detection of
      disease progression by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and the Muscle Function Measure (MFM)
      test.

      Each participant will be evaluated in three testing sessions: at baseline, at Week 12 and at
      Week 24. Both patients and volunteers will undergo MRI scans. Patients will additionally
      undergo testing of motor function and have blood samples taken for Survival of the Motor
      Neuron (SMN) genes, proteins and mRNA analysis.
