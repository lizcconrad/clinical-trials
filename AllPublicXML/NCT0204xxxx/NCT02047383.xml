    <textblock>
      The acute respiratory infection is the fourth most common cause of hospital stay between
      elderly people. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the repercussion of hospital stay in
      hospitalized patients with a respiratory infection.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Acute respiratory infection is a serious infection that prevents normal breathing function.
      It refers to any of a number of infectious diseases involving the respiratory tract. Health
      conditions that increase the risk of a respiratory infection include: another lung condition,
      a heart condition, a kidney or liver condition and a lowered immune system. The hospital stay
      of this patients is approximately 7-10 days and it is important to study the effects of this
      stay in the physical and psycho-emotional characteristics of patients.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Strength in upper and lower limbs</measure>
    <time_frame>Participants will be followed for the duration of hospital stay, an expected average of 8 days</time_frame>
    <description>The quadriceps and the hand-grip strength is assessed using a dynamometer with a standard protocol allowing three attempts on each side. During each measurement, patients were sitting with their shoulder adducted and elbow flexed to 90°. The maximum value achieved was used in the analyses. This is important in order to quantify the increase of strength Kg/cm2 The test 2-minute step in place is also going to be used for this purpose, counting the times the patients go up the right knees in two minutes.</description>

    <measure>Quality of life</measure>
    <time_frame>Participants will be followed for the duration of hospital stay, an expected average of 8 days</time_frame>
    <description>The quality of life associated with health is going to be measure with t the EuroQol-5 questionnaire.</description>

    <measure>Lung function</measure>
    <time_frame>Participants will be followed for the duration of hospital stay, an expected average of 8 days</time_frame>
    <description>Lung function is going to be evaluated using a spirometer.</description>

    <measure>Activity monitoring</measure>
    <time_frame>Participants will be followed for the duration of hospital stay, an expected average of 8 days</time_frame>
    <description>The accelerometer Armband is going to be used for activity monitoring. It measures the intensity of the activity during 12 hours.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Quality of sleep</measure>
    <time_frame>Participants will be followed for the duration of hospital stay, an expected average of 8 days</time_frame>
    <description>Changes in quality of sleep. For this purpose, the participants are going to complete the Pittsburgh Quality of Sleep Index. This is a self-rating questionnaire with seven subscores that result in a global score between 0 and 21.</description>

    <measure>Mood</measure>
