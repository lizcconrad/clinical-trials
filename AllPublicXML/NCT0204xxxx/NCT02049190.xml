  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, randomized, parallel group two-stage phase 1-2 study with an
      escalation and an expansion component. This study will evaluate an extended-release (ER)
      formulation of onapristone in patients with prostate cancer in which Progesterone Receptor
      (PR) may be contributing to tumor progression. A companion diagnostic to select patients
      whose prostate cancer expresses the activated form of the PR (APR) is under development and
      will be implemented in this study; it may be used to further enrich the selection of the
      population based upon ongoing review of the results. Patients will be treated until
      occurrence of an intolerable safety issue, treatment failure, if patient elects to withdraw,
      or for non-compliance with either protocol-specified evaluations or onapristone treatment. An
      additional cohort of patients will be included at the recommended phase 2 dose to gain
      additional understanding of the onapristone safety profile and potential anti-cancer
      activity.

          3. In Stage 2, a mandatory biopsy is required with confirmed PR or APR in ≥1% tumor
             cells. For patients recruited to the abiraterone-onapristone combination arm, the
             biopsy must be performed on abiraterone administered as the most recent treatment and
             after a minimum of 2 weeks continuous treatment. For other patients, the biopsy must
             be taken at progression on or after abiraterone or enzalutamide or before screening
             with no anti-cancer treatment taken in the intervening period and a maximum of six (6)
             months prior to study start. If archival tissue is also available this should be
             provided for comparison purposes; a paired biopsy at day 8-28 is optional;

             allowed;

          6. Disease that has progressed by PSA or radiologically, on abiraterone or enzalutamide.

               -  PSA progression defined by a minimum of two rising PSA levels with an interval of
                  ≥1 week between each determination.

               -  Radiological progression per RECIST 1.1;

          7. For patients recruited to the abiraterone-onapristone combination arm, progression on
             abiraterone as their last line of treatment is required after a prior response to
             abiraterone;
