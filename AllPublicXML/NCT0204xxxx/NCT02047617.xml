  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Critically ill patients frequently develop muscle weakness due to critical illness-related
      acute neuropathy and/or myopathy. This disorder is associated with difficulties in weaning
      from mechanical ventilation, prolonged intensive care unit and hospital stay, and increased
      mortality rates. In addition, many patients continue to suffer from decreased exercise
      capacity and quality of life for months to years after the acute event.

      Besides controlling risk factors, no specific prevention or treatment exists. Recommendations
      advice to start early with active and passive exercise in critically ill patients (1). Having
      critically ill patients alert and engaged in progressive rehabilitation leading to
      mobilization, despite the use of life support therapies may reduce muscle atrophy and lead to
      improved strength and physical function (2).

      This randomized controlled trial was designed to investigate whether a daily training session
      using a tilt table, started early in stable critically ill patients with an expected
      prolonged ICU stay, could induce a beneficial effect on exercise performance, quadriceps
      force and functional autonomy at ICU and hospital discharge compared to a standard
      physiotherapy program.

    <description>The same program as standard physiotherapy group is applied, with daily sessions of standing table in supplement. Standing table was performed on a motorized tilt table (ref: table de verticalisation, Franco&amp;fils).
