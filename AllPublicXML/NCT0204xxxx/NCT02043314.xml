  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The recommended treatment for latent tuberculosis infection for adults is a daily dose of
      isoniazid 300mg during 6 months. In Brazil, isoniazid was formulated as 100 mg tables. The
      treatment duration and the high pill burden compromised patient adherence to the treatment.
      The Brazilian National Programme for Tuberculosis requested the development of a new 300mg
      isoniazid formulation. The aim of the study is to compare the bioavailability of the
      isoniazid 300mg new formulation and three 100mg tablets of the reference formulation.

      The study is a randomized, single dose, open label, fasting, two-phase crossover
      bioequivalence study with a wash out period of 7 days (&gt;7 half-life) in 28 healthy human
      volunteers. For the determination of isoniazid in human plasma, the investigators developed
      and validated a sensitive, simple and rapid HPLC-MS/MS method.

      This will support the strategy adopted by the Brazilian National Program for Tuberculosis for
      the treatment of latent tuberculosis. The new formulation will increase patients' adherence
      to the treatment and quality of life. Medical doctors in Brazil should become aware of the
      new formulation and the new treatment strategy in order to prescribe the right medication and
      avoid errors that could result in a high frequency of adverse events. Future research studies
      should evaluate pharmacovigilance, acceptability of the new tablet formulation and its impact
      on the cure rate.
