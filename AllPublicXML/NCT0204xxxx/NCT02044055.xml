  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      HBV can be transmitted from mother-to-child, with a risk increasing according to maternal HBV
      DNA during pregnancy. HDV is a defective virus using HBs Ag for its own replication.
      Nucleosides analogues have only a minor impact on quantitative HBs Ag level. Data about
      vertical HDV transmission are old, justifying a new study.

    <textblock>
      Hepatitis B Virus (HBV) can be transmitted from mother-to-child, with a risk increasing
      according to maternal HBV DNA viral load during the last trimester of pregnancy. Nucleosides
      analogues, lamivudine, telbivudine, or nucleotides analogues, tenofovir DF decrease HBV
      mother-to-child transmission risk, and are recommended in Guidelines (EASL 2012) for pregnant
      women with HBV DNA above 1,000 000 I.U/mL. HDV is a defective virus using HBs Ag for its own
      replication. HDV-HBV co-infection is a re-emerging infectious disease in western countries,
      due to immigration of people coming from endemic areas. Nucleosides analogues have only a
      minor impact on quantitative HBs Ag level (Boyd A et al. AIDS Research and Human Retroviruses
      2013). Data about vertical HDV transmission are old (Rizzetto, et al. J Med Virol 1982),
      before a large use of nucleosides/nucleotides analogues in HBV infected pregnant women,
      justifying a new study.
