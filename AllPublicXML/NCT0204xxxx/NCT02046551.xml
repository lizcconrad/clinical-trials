  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate atomoxetine's effects on the rewarding and
      reinforcing effects of nicotine in a controlled human laboratory study with 24 otherwise
      healthy nicotine dependent subjects. It is hypothesized that atomoxetine will attenuate the
      negative effects of nicotine.

    <measure>Nicotine Effects Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 5</time_frame>
    <description>Subjects will rate 6 items that are related to nicotine effect on a 100 mm scale, &quot;not at all&quot; to &quot;extremely.&quot; The items are feeling the drug strength, feel &quot;good&quot; drug effects, feel &quot;bad&quot; drug effects, feel jittery, feel stimulated, and head rush. This instrument is an abbreviated version of a visual analog scale (VAS) and allows rapid detection of nicotine effects.</description>

    <measure>Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression (CES-D) scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 5</time_frame>
    <description>The Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression (CES-D) scale is a 20-item self-report measure of depressive symptoms. The range of scores is from 0 to 60, with higher scores reflecting increased depressive symptoms 41. The CES-D does not heavily depend on pathological items compared with other scales such as the Beck Depression Inventory and does not define clinical depression.</description>

    <measure>Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS )</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 5</time_frame>
    <description>Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS ) is a 20-item scale that assesses both negative and positive affective states. Subjects rate adjectives describing affective states on a scale of 1 to 5 using a specified time period (e.g., now, today, past week etc.). Scores are then added up to generate negative and positive scale scores.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The Profile of Mood States (POMS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 5</time_frame>
    <description>The Profile of Mood States (POMS) is a 72-item questionnaire which consists of adjectives commonly used to describe momentary mood states. It has been found to be sensitive to the mood-altering effects of drugs including nicotine. POMS has a 5-point objective rating scale (0=not at all to 5=extremely). There are eight mood states that this scale measures: (1) Anger, (2) Anxiety, (3) Confusion, (4) Depression, (5) Elation, (6) Fatigue, (7) Friendliness and (8) Vigor. POMS will be used during each session to measure effects of atomoxetine or nicotine on mood.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  female and male smokers, not treatment seeking, aged 18 to 55 years;

          -  history of smoking daily for the past 12 months, at least 5 cigarettes daily;

          -  CO level &gt; 10ppm;

          -  for women: not pregnant as determined by pregnancy screening, nor breast feeding, and
             using acceptable birth control methods.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  history of major medical illnesses including asthma or chronic obstructive lung
             disease, history or current gastrointestinal ulcer, hepatic or renal impairment,
             coronary artery disease, cardiac rhythm disturbances or other medical conditions that
             the study physician deems contraindicated for the subject to be in the study;

          -  regular use of psychotropic medication (antidepressants, antipsychotics, or
             anxiolytics)

          -  recent psychiatric diagnosis and treatment for Axis I disorders including major
             depression, bipolar affective disorder, schizophrenia and panic disorder within the
             past year. We will make an exception for the following Axis I diagnoses: nicotine
             dependence and alcohol or other drug dependence (i.e., cocaine, opioid) as long as
             they are not meeting abuse or dependence criteria within the past 3 months for alcohol
             or drug use;

          -  use of drugs that slow heart rate (eg, beta-blockers), which may increase the risk of
             bradycardia and AV block, or NSAIDs, which may increase potential for developing
             ulcers/active or occult gastrointestinal bleeding;

          -  known allergy to atomoxetine
