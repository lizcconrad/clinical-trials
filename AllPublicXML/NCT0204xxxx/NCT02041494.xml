  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hernias are often treated using a prosthetic mesh to add support to the healing wound.
      Prosthetic meshes have been used for decades to repair ventral hernias, level 1 data
      regarding which type of mesh to use is limited. The purpose of this study is to compare the
      effects, good and/or bad, of two types of prosthetic meshes: one that is made from pig skin
      (called a &quot;biologic prosthetic&quot;), and one that is made in a laboratory (called a &quot;synthetic
      prosthetic&quot;). This study will include some patients who have an infection in/near the hernia,
      and other patients who do not have an infection. We expect the synthetic mesh to be
      associated with a higher rate of early post-operative surgical site infection and fluid
      collections (seromas), while we expect the biologic mesh to be associated with a higher rate
      of recurrence.

  <detailed_description>

      This is a prospective, single-blind, randomized study comparing the clinical efficacy and
      overall costs of two prosthetic meshes in the repair of complex ventral hernias. The two
      prosthetic meshes to be studied are Ventralight (Bard, Murray Hill, NJ), a synthetic mesh
      chiefly made of polypropylene and Strattice (LifeCell, Branchburg, NJ), a biologic mesh
      derived from porcine dermis. The study population will consist of patients who are in need of
      a repair of a complex ventral hernia. Patients will be enrolled in the study for 24 months
      following their operation or until they experience a recurrence of their hernia, whichever
      occurs first. The primary outcome variable is recurrence and the secondary outcome variables
      are post-operative surgical site infections and overall costs.

      There is no universally agreed upon definition of what constitutes a &quot;complex&quot; ventral
      hernia. For our purposes, a &quot;complex&quot; ventral hernia is one that involves a compromised
      surgical field, in which gastrointestinal, biliary, or genitourinary procedures are
      performed, one in which the wound class is considered clean-contaminated, contaminated, or
      dirty due to other causes, such as infected meshes and enterocutaneous fistulas, or surgical
      procedures conducted in patients with large ventral hernia defects (&gt;10 cm in any single
      dimension).

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Clinical evidence of a midline, ventral hernia, regardless of degree of wound
             contamination, with the exception of class IV wounds due to the presence/discovery of
             fecal peritonitis. Specifically, the repair will or will not involve a compromised
             surgical field in which gastrointestinal, biliary and/or genitourinary procedures will
             be performed. The surgical wound class may be classified as clean, or it may be
             classified as clean-contaminated, contaminated, or dirty-infected, due to the repair
             of an enterocutaneous fistula, takedown of an intestinal stoma and/or removal of
             infected mesh

          -  Age &gt;21

          -  Negative pregnancy test

          -  No allergic, religious or ethical objections to either polypropylene or porcine
             prosthetics

          -  Signed, witnessed informed consent to take part in the study

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Severe malnutrition (serum albumin &lt;2.0 in the setting of a normal CRP)

          -  Use of an investigational agent within 1 month prior to study enrollment and/or
             planned during this study

          -  Presence of pre-existing parenchymal liver disease characterized by the presence of
             Child's Class C liver dysfunction (including all of the following: bilirubin ≥ 3.0
             mg/dL; albumin ≤ 3.0 mg/dL; refractory ascites; encephalopathy or coma; and poor
             nutritional status)

          -  Immunocompromised patients, as evidenced by: administration of high doses of
             corticosteroids (i.e. doses ≥ 1.5 mg/kg/day of prednisone or equivalent) within 72
             hours before study enrollment; status post solid organ transplant or bone marrow
             transplant and experiencing acute organ rejection or bone marrow failure or rejection;
             evidence of neutropenia (absolute neutrophil count ≤ 500 cells/mm3 (≤ 500 x 106
             cells/L); chemotherapy or radiation therapy within 90 days before study enrollment;
             known AIDS; any disease sufficiently advanced to suppress resistance to infection
             (including, but not limited to leukemia, lymphoma or hypogammaglobulinemia);
             administration of immunoglobulin of G-CSF within 90 days before study enrollment

          -  Ascites refractory to medical management

          -  Presence of an underlying disease/injury with life expectancy less than two years
             and/or severe underlying disease that would preclude study entry (e.g. known
             malignancy)

          -  Wound Classification IV due to the presence/discovery of fecal peritonitis. Other
             cases of wound class IV including presence of purulent inflammation, soft tissue/mesh
             infection, or visceral perforation resulting in a contained fistula (e.g.
             enterocutaneous fistula) are still considered eligible for enrollment.
