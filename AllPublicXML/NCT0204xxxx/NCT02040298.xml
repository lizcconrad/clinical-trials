  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main purpose of this study is to assess clemastine as a remyelinating agent in patients
      with relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis. The study will also evaluate the tolerability of
      clemastine, originally approved as first-generation antihistamine, in patients with multiple
      sclerosis. Study procedures will include assessments for evidence of remyelination in the
      anterior visual pathway and in the brain using electrophysiologic techniques and magnetic
      resonance imaging. The study will also assess the robustness and stability of this clinical
      effect in patients taking clemastine for up to 3 months. Patients in this study can remain on
      their standard disease modifying treatment during the course of the study. However, patients
      cannot participate in any other investigational new drug research study concurrently.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Full Field Visual Evoked Potential</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 1 month, 3 month, 5 month</time_frame>
    <description>The primary objective is to evaluate the efficacy of Clemastine relative to placebo for reducing P100 latencies on full field transient pattern reversal visual evoked potentials. VEPs are used primarily to measure the functional integrity of the visual pathways from the retina to the visual cortex of the brain.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Tolerability of Clemastine in Multiple Sclerosis Patients</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 1 month, 3 month, 5 month</time_frame>
    <description>Will demonstrate the tolerability of Clemastine in this population. This will include special focus with regards to fatigue as this is a major symptom for patients suffering from multiple sclerosis.This will be assessed by administering a fatigue questionnaire at all four visits throughout the study.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Myelin Water Volume and Magnetization Transfer Ratios</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 3 month, 5 month time points</time_frame>
    <description>To evaluate the efficacy of Clemastine relative to placebo in increasing magnetization transfer ratios derived from magnetic resonance imaging of the brain during the period of exposure to active treatment.
To evaluate the efficacy of Clemastine relative to placebo at reducing radial diffusivity derived from diffusion tensor imaging as assessed by magnetic resonance imaging during the period of exposure to active medication.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Expanded Disability Status Scale score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 3 months, 5 months</time_frame>
    <description>To evaluate the efficacy of Clemastine relative to placebo in reducing the EDSS score at 90 days compared to placebo (Group A) and at 150 days compared to day 90 (Group B).
The EDSS is an ordinal scale used for assessing neurological impairment of MS based on a neurological examination. It consists of scores in each of seven functional systems (FS) and an ambulation score that are then combined to determine the EDSS [ranging from 0 (normal) to 10 (death due to MS)]. The FSs are the Visual, Brain Stem, Pyramidal, Cerebellar, Sensory, Bowel &amp; Bladder, and Cerebral functions. The FSs and EDSS steps will be assessed in a standardized manner. EDSS is a widely used and accepted instrument to evaluate disability status at a given time and longitudinally, to assess disability progression in clinical studies in MS.</description>
