      To determine the effects of prebiotic 'snacks' on gut health and satisfaction between meals

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The role of the bacteria that reside in the human gut play in human health and disease is of
      increasing importance. Evidence gathered over recent decades' shows that certain bacteria can
      improve resistance to gut infections, reduce cholesterol levels, synthesise vitamins and
      improve the immune response. The potential to modulate the relative balance of these
      so-called 'beneficial' bacteria has been demonstrated through the use of certain fibre
      sources termed prebiotics. In addition there is interest to understand how snacks containing
      these fibre sources may affect levels of 'satisfaction' between meals. The current study will
      address these issues and lead to a greater understanding of the role that prebiotics may play
      in gut health and overall metabolism.
