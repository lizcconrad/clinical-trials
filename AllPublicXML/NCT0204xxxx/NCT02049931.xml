      The treatment outcomes in the treatment without brace would be non-inferior to those in use
      of rigid or soft brace.

    <textblock>
      Bracing has been considered as a landmark step in conservative management for osteoporotic
      compression fractures. However, no prospective, randomized, and controlled clinical trials
      are available to document for the efficacy of wearing of the rigid or soft brace for the
      management of osteoporotic compression fracture. Therefore, the current trial was therefore
      designed to compare the outcome for improvement of disability and pain in patients with
      osteoporotic compression fracture using rigid, soft, or no brace.

    <measure>Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) at 12 Weeks</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks after injury</time_frame>
    <description>The primary outcome was the score for Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) at 12 weeks after compression fracture. The ODI is a self-reported questionnaire measuring back-specific function including pain intensity, personal care, lifting, walking, sitting, standing, sleeping, sex life, social life, and traveling. The questionnaire consists of 10 items each with 6 response levels. Each item is scored from 0 to 5, and the total score is converted to a 0 to 100 scale (zero is equated with no disability and 100 is the maximum disability possible).</description>

    <measure>Visual Analog Pain Scale (VAS) for Back Pain</measure>
    <time_frame>2 weeks, 6 weeks, 12 weeks after injury</time_frame>
    <description>The VAS for back pain comprised a 10-cm line with &quot;none&quot; (0) on one end and &quot;disabled pain&quot; (10) on the other. Participants were asked to place a mark on the 10-cm line, which represented his or her perceived level of back pain, and the measured distance (cm) from the mark to the zero point was considered the score.</description>

        <title>Visual Analog Pain Scale (VAS) for Back Pain</title>
        <description>The VAS for back pain comprised a 10-cm line with “none” (0) on one end and “disabled pain” (10) on the other. Participants were asked to place a mark on the 10-cm line, which represented his or her perceived level of back pain, and the measured distance (cm) from the mark to the zero point was considered the score.</description>
