  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary hypothesis is that chemotherapy followed by donor lymphocyte infusion (DLI) from
      HLA-haploidentical donors is a safe procedure that will not cause Graft versus Host Disease
      (GVHD) or increased treatment-related mortality. The Investigator further believes that this
      will improve outcomes of elderly patients with high-risk AML or MDS compared to chemotherapy
      alone, and that that this benefit will be even greater in donor-recipient pairs that share
      maternal-fetal microchimerism or non-inherited maternal antigen (NIMA) mismatch. A large part
      of this trial will include immune function assays as well as assessments of efficacy,
      toxicity, and GVHD. Because this therapy may be a tolerable alternative to allogeneic
      hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (alloHSCT) for elderly patients, the Investigator
      will validate functional measurements (e.g. Comprehensive Geriatric Assessment (CGA)) with
      biologic correlates (cytokine and genomic profiles) and clinical outcomes.

    <description>Eligible subjects will receive induction chemotherapy with idarubicin (12 mg/m2 intravenously for 3 days) and cytarabine (100 mg/m2 intravenously for 7 days) starting Day 1 and ending Day 7. Patients 80 years or older will only receive 2 and 5 days of idarubicin and cytarabine respectively starting Day 1 and ending Day 5.
Subjects who experience no remission or partial remission will receive a second course of the identical induction chemotherapy.</description>

Subjects who achieve a complete remission (CR) will receive 2 further courses of cytarabine postremission chemotherapy (consolidation) at 1.0 g/m2 for 6 dosages followed by HLA-mismatched DLI after the second consolidation.</description>

    <description>HLA-mismatched DLI will be administered Day 9, approximately 24-48 hours following completion of chemotherapy at a dose of 1x10^8 cluster of differentiation 3 (CD3+) cells; however, due to logistics of planning infusions with staffing, donor availability, weekends/holidays, etc., it may be necessary to postpone cell infusion up to 96 hours.
Given the time constraints presented by the need to start induction chemotherapy as soon as possible, in some cases, it may not be logistically possible to administer cells with induction. In these cases, patients would just receive standard induction chemotherapy and cells would be administered after consolidation 1 in addition to consolidation 2
Subjects who achieve a CR will receive 2 further courses of cytarabine postremission chemotherapy (consolidation) at 1.0 g/m2 for 6 dosages followed by HLA-mismatched DLI after the second consolidation.</description>
