      1. Investigate the safety and effectiveness of a single dose of IV Ketamine for adolescents
           with suicidal ideation and depression. It is hypothesize that Ketamine will be well
           tolerated and significantly reduce depressive symptoms and suicidal ideation.

        2. Explore whether decision making as measured by the Iowa Gambling Task changes before and
           after Ketamine infusion. It is hypothesize that IV Ketamine infusion will significantly
           improve the decision making ability a measured by the Iowa Gambling Task in adolescents
           that are suicidal.

      This is an open prospective study of a single, low dose (0.5 mg/kg) intravenous (IV) Ketamine
      in 10 adolescent subjects admitted to Nationwide Childrens Hospital following a serious
      suicide attempt and who meet criteria for major depression or bipolar disorder I, current
      episode depressed. Subjects will be recruited via the psychiatry consult service, evaluated
      on the floor and if eligible and consent is obtained, transferred to the PACU for IV Ketamine
      infusion. Following infusion and when PACU discharge criteria are met, subjects will be
      transferred back to their floor for medical and psychiatric monitoring until they can be
      transferred to an inpatient psychiatric unit for additional care. Subjects will be
      transferred to an inpatient psychiatric unit for continued psychiatric care as part of their
      routine psychiatric care via the consult team. The research team will follow-up by telephone
      one week and four weeks after Ketamine injection to collect additional information about the
      patient's overall course and response.

          -  Voluntary admission for a suicide attempt requiring medical intervention in the
             previous 24-48 hours (Kiddie Schedule for Affective Disorders Suicide Behavior Score &gt;
             3).

          -  Meets criteria for major depression, single- or recurrent episode, non-psychotic or
             Bipolar I, current episode depressed, with a baseline Inventory for depression score
             of &gt; 16.

          -  The patient and legal guardian must understand the nature of the study and be able to
             comply with protocol requirements. The legal guardian must give written informed
             consent and the youth, written assent.

          -  English is spoken as the primary language in the home.

        Exclusion Criteria

          -  Any serious, unstable medical illness or clinically significant abnormal laboratory
             assessments that would adversely impact the scientific interpretability or unduly
             increase the risks of the protocol.

          -  Admitted to Nationwide Children's Hospital involuntarily.

          -  Unable to assent because of severe mental retardation or incapacitating psychosis.

          -  Other medications: See Table 1. The list in Table 1 is not exhaustive. The Principal
             Investigator and the Co-Investigator will review all concomitant medicines and any
             medicine that could interfere with the trial will be considered exclusionary. Subjects
             with bipolar disorder will be allowed to continue their mood stabilizers and or
             antipsychotic agents at the discretion of the investigator. Stimulants use is
             acceptable, though the child must be on a stable dose for the past 3 months and the
             dose must not be changed through the trial. A stable dose is defined as no more that
             25% change in the total daily dose of a stimulant.

          -  General medical conditions: children with major medical conditions that would
             interfere with involvement in the study or the study medication will not be enrolled.

             psychotic major depression.

          -  History of physical, sexual, or emotional abuse, which results in a clinically
             significant impact on clinical presentation, potentially driving some of the symptoms
             of major depressive disorder.

          -  Receipt of an investigational drug within 30 days prior to study entry.
