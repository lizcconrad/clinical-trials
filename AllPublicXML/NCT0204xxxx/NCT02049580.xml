      Study to test feasibility and efficacy of T-replete Bone Marrow (BM), infused after a RIC
      regimen and post-transplantation Cyclophosphamide (Cy), in patients with poor prognosis
      lymphomas.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Allogeneic stem cell transplantation (ALLO) is the treatment of choice for many hematological
      diseases. However, HLA identical donor (sibling or unrelated) is available for 50-60% of
      patients and alternative donors are needed. Haploidentical donors have been used for many
      years, mostly after extensive T-cell depletion of peripheral stem cell, to avoid Graft Versus
      Host Disease (GVHD). Recently, promising data have been reported with haploidentical
      transplantation using T-replete bone marrow (BM) and high-dose cyclophosphamide (Cy)
      post-transplantation. However, the conditioning regimen did not contain drugs active against
      hemopathies, enhancing the relapse risk.

      In this study, the investigators want to test the feasibility and efficacy of T-replete BM,
      infused after a RIC regimen and post-transplantation Cy, in patients with poor prognosis
      lymphoproliferative diseases.

      The RIC regimen consisted of modified regimen used in different studies conducted in Italy on
      behalf GITMO.

Cy will be dosed according to the recipient's ideal body weight (IBW), unless the patient weighs more than 125% of IBW, in which case the drug will be dosed according to the Adjusted IBW (AIBW)
Cyclophosphamide [50 mg/kg/day IBW] will be given on Day 3 post-transplant (between 60 and 72 hours after marrow infusion) and on Day 4 post-transplant (approximately 24 hours after Day 3 cyclophosphamide). Cyclophosphamide will be given as an IV infusion over 1-2 hours (depending on volume).</description>
