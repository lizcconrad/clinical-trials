  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sedentary older adults are more likely to develop physical function impairments than active
      older adults. Physical function measured by slow usual gait speed predicts the risk of future
      falls, disability, institutionalization and mortality. Behavioral physical activity
      interventions have improved physical activity and physical function, but have not generally
      been implemented where they may have the most impact -- primary care settings. In part, this
      is due to the limited time and training for clinical staff to screen for physical function
      impairment and to treat with physical activity counseling. The proposed scientific goal is to
      overcome these barriers by adapting an evidence-based screening tool and telephone-based
      physical activity intervention into primary care settings.

      Aim1: Among older adults who screen positive for physical function impairment, to determine
      the estimated intervention effect size of a 12-week behavioral intervention on physical
      activity and physical function.

      Hypothesis 1a: Physical activity levels will increase more in the intervention vs. usual care
      group.

      Hypothesis 1b: Physical function will increase more in the intervention vs. usual care group.

      Aim 2: Among Aim 1 participants and clinical staff who deliver the functional screening and
      Aim 1 intervention, to evaluate standard implementation science process metrics of reach,
      acceptability, and implementation

             the past 3 months; or a reported fear of falling)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Inability to walk ≥30 feet without human assistance7

          -  Dementia, as assessed by either a Folstein Mini-Mental Status Examination &lt;24 or by
             patient's primary care provider's assessment
