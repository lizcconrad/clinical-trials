      The primary objective is to demonstrate the non-inferiority of treatment with ASA to
      anti-coagulant treatment with vitamin K antagonists in patients after a cervical artery
      dissection (CAD).

      This is a randomized controlled, open labeled multicenter, non-inferiority trial with blinded
      assessment of outcome events. Implementation of this study is planned at Swiss Stroke Centers
      or Units.

      Identical investigations will be performed in all patients eligible to participate in this
      study.

      Imaging: For verification of CAD diagnosis, all study participants will undergo a
      standardized routine MRI scan of brain and neck before study entry. 14 +/- 7 days after
      treatment onset a second MRI of brain and neck will be performed. The following MRI sequences
      will be performed on a 3 Tesla scanner (1) spin echo (SE) T1w, turbo spin-echo (TSE) T2w,
      FLAIR to detect chronic ischemic brain lesions. (2) Diffusion weighted imaging (DWI)
      including apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) maps to detect acute ischemic brain lesions.
      (3) susceptibility-weighted imaging (SWI) sequences or T2*w gradient echo (GRE) to detect
      hemorrhagic brain lesions (4) contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance angiography (CE-MRA) to
      improve delineation of the wall hematoma against the perfused vessel lumen, and to assess the
      degree of obstruction of the affected artery. MRI scans will be centrally analysed at the
      University Hospital Basel, and independently assessed by two observers who are blinded to the
      type of treatment and clinical outcome.

      Clinical examination: Patients will be examined clinically by a neurologist at the screening
      visit, at the randomization visit, 14 +/- 7 days after randomization, at 3 months and at 6
      months after randomization. At each visit, clinical outcome events will be assessed, focal
      neurological deficit measured using the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Stroke Scale,12
      and functional level of independence using the modified Rankin Scale13. Clinical outcome
      events will be independently adjudicated in the coordinating center Basel, blinded to the
      type of treatment.

      Blood sampling for biomarkers analyses will be done at two times; the first as soon as
      possible after verification of CAD-diagnosis and the second 14 +/- 7 days after treatment
      onset. Measured biomarkers include: MMP9 and TIMP2. The biomarkers will be analysed with
      multiplex electrochemiluminescent immunosorbent assays .

      Treatment allocation: Patients will be randomized to receive either Aspirin (ASA) or
      anticoagulants (ratio 1:1). ASA means Aspirin™ 300 mg q.d. given orally. In patients who
      cannot swallow safely, ASA will be given intravenously (e.g. Aspegic™ 250 mg q.d.) until
      swallowing function has recovered. Anticoagulants mean the use of vitamin K antagonists
      (i.e., phenprocoumon [Marcoumar™] or acenocoumarol [Sintrom™]) with a target international
      normalized ratio (INR) of 2.0 - 3.0. Until the target INR has been reached, patients will
      receive anticoagulation with i.v. heparin or low molecular weight heparin). The choice of the
      distinct agent (e.g. phenprocoumon or acenocoumarol) can be chosen by the treating physician
      and the patient, taking into account the experience with these agents (phenprocoumon is more
      commonly used in the German speaking part, acenocoumarol is usually used in the French
      speaking part of Switzerland). Treatment should start as soon as diagnosis has been
      established, informed consent by patients or next-to-kin was obtained and baseline magnetic
      resonance (MR)-images have been performed (maximum time window maximum 24 hours). Treatment
      duration will be 90 days +/-14 days (i.e., until the follow-visit 2).

      Miscellaneous: The patients will be asked to allow the usage of anonymous study data for
      possible individual patient data meta-analyses in the future in case of other randomized
      clinical trials (RCT) studying the same subject will become available.
