  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Numerous treatment modalities have been proposed to treat pain in alcoholic and non-alcoholic
      chronic pancreatitis such as analgesic medication, inhibition of gastric acid production,
      enzyme substitution, somatostatin analogues, nerve blockade,reduction of oxidative stress and
      endoscopic pancreatic duct stenting, but none of these concepts have shown long lasting
      benefits as surgery in clinical studies.Comparison of surgical outcome in non-alcoholic
      chronic pancreatitis and alcoholic chronic pancreatitis has limited data and differences on
      the basis of outcome in between alcoholic and non-alcoholic chronic pancreatitis are not
      available in literature.

      Although it is well known that pain is the main symptom of chronic pancreatitis, it has until
      now been assessed in very common and varying categories. Pain, however, is only one aspect of
      the large variety of sensitive facets of daily life. In addition to an improvement in pain
      symptoms and the preservation of pancreatic exocrine and endocrine function and other
      parameters, occupational rehabilitation of these mostly young patients and quality of life
      also should be considered in the evaluation of surgical outcome in alcoholic and
      non-alcoholic chronic pancreatitis.

      In this prospective study, we intend to find out if there are any differences in the surgical
      outcome on the above mentioned parameters in alcoholic and non-alcoholic chronic
      pancreatitis.We also plan to see if there are differences in the histopathology in these two
      disease settings.
