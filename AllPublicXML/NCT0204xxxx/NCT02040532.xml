  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The broad goal of this study is to obtain pilot data to determine the tolerability and
      preliminary efficacy of the non-hormonal agent gabapentin for insomnia symptoms and nighttime
      vasomotor Symptoms (VMS) when open-label gabapentin is administered at low dose and only at
      night in peri- and postmenopausal women. We hypothesize that the majority of participants
      will be able to increase and tolerate treatment, and insomnia symptoms and the frequency of
      nighttime VMS will improve on low-dose gabapentin dosed at bedtime.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Thirty-two peri- and postmenopausal women at the Boston sites (MGH and BWH) were enrolled
      into this open-label pilot study. The study was a 7-week intervention study using open-label
      gabapentin at bedtime with a scheduled dose titration from 100-mg for one week, followed by
      300-mg for 3 weeks, and then 600-mg for 3 weeks. The intervention study followed a 3-week
      screening period to establish a stable baseline for insomnia symptoms and VMS and to
      determine the safety of administering gabapentin in study participants. Tolerability and
      treatment response (insomnia symptoms, nighttime VMS) were assessed systematically at each
      study visit. The dose titration schedule was followed in all participants unless there are
      dose-limiting toxicities.

    <description>Tolerability of gabapentin was assessed by self-report at the week 1, week 4 and week 7 contacts by asking participants to complete the SAFTEE-SI and CPFQ questionnaires and prompting subjects to report any adverse events at each study visit. Tolerability of gabapentin is defined as the proportion of participants that is able to increase the dose from 300-mg to 600-mg and to remain on the higher dose for the duration of the trial.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline, study completion at 7 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Vasomotor symptoms (VMS) were tracked and quantified prospectively using a daily hot flash diary. The hot flash diary was adapted from a 7-day self-report tool for vasomotor symptoms originally developed by the North Central Cancer Treatment Group (NCCTG). The diary asks for the subject to log number of hot flashes during the day and night, severity of hot flashes during day and night, and how bothersome the hot flashes were during day and night. Vasomotor symptoms were also systematically assessed at baseline, week 4, and week 7 using the Hot Flash-Related Daily Interference Scale (HFRDIS), a 10-item self-report questionnaire to determine perceived hot flash interference with quality of life and daily activities.</description>

    <measure>Severity of Insomnia</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, study completion at 7 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Severity of insomnia was measured throughout the study using the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) .The ISI is a 7-item scale that evaluates the severity of insomnia retrospectively over the past week. The scale is more specific to insomnia symptoms than the Pittsburgh scale (PSQI), which focuses more broadly on overall sleep quality.
The ISI score ranges from a minimum of 0 to 28. A score of 0-7=no clinically significant insomnia, 8-14=subthreshold insomnia, 5-21=clinical insomnia (moderate severity), 22-28=clinical insomnia (severe), with higher values indicating more severe insomnia.</description>

    <measure>Sleep Quality and Disturbances Over Past Month</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, study completion at 7 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Sleep quality and disturbances during the past month were assessed with the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). The PSQI also incorporates daytime functioning into the total score.
In scoring the PSQI, seven component scores are derived, each scored 0 (no difficulty) to 3 (severe difficulty). The component scores are summed to produce a global score (range 0 to 21). Higher scores indicate worse sleep quality.</description>

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Quality of Life-Overall</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, study completion at 7 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Quality of life-Overall was assessed with the Quality of Life Enjoyment and Satisfaction Questionnaire (Q-LES-Q). The Q-LES-Q is a 16-item self-report questionnaire that assesses enjoyment of and satisfaction with life. The scoring of the Q-LES-Q-SF involves summing only the first 14 items to yield a raw total score. The last two items are not included in the total score but are standalone items. The raw total score ranges from 14 to 70 with higher scores indicating higher quality of life enjoyment and satisfaction.</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Quality of Life-Menopause Specific</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, study completion at 7 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Quality of life-Menopause specific is assessed by the Menopause Specific Quality of Life (MENQOL).
The MENQOL is self-administered and consists of a total of 29 items in a Likert-scale format. Each item assesses the impact of one of four domains of menopausal symptoms, as experienced over the last month: vasomotor (items 1-3), psychosocial (items 4-10), physical (items 11-26), and sexual (items 27-29). Items pertaining to a specific symptom are rated as present or not present, and if present, how bothersome on a zero (not bothersome) to six (extremely bothersome) scale. Means are computed for each subscale by dividing the sum of the domain's items by the number of items within that domain. Non-endorsement of an item is scored a &quot;1&quot; and endorsement a &quot;2,&quot; plus the number of the particular rating, so that the possible score on any item ranges from 1-8. Total score also ranges from 1-8.</description>

        <title>Tolerability of Gabapentin</title>
        <description>Tolerability of gabapentin was assessed by self-report at the week 1, week 4 and week 7 contacts by asking participants to complete the SAFTEE-SI and CPFQ questionnaires and prompting subjects to report any adverse events at each study visit. Tolerability of gabapentin is defined as the proportion of participants that is able to increase the dose from 300-mg to 600-mg and to remain on the higher dose for the duration of the trial.</description>

        <title>Vasomotor Symptoms (VMS) Frequency, Severity, and Bothersomeness During Daytime</title>
        <description>Vasomotor symptoms (VMS) were tracked and quantified prospectively using a daily hot flash diary. The hot flash diary was adapted from a 7-day self-report tool for vasomotor symptoms originally developed by the North Central Cancer Treatment Group (NCCTG). The diary asks for the subject to log number of hot flashes during the day and night, severity of hot flashes during day and night, and how bothersome the hot flashes were during day and night. Vasomotor symptoms were also systematically assessed at baseline, week 4, and week 7 using the Hot Flash-Related Daily Interference Scale (HFRDIS), a 10-item self-report questionnaire to determine perceived hot flash interference with quality of life and daily activities.</description>

        <title>Quality of Life-Overall</title>
        <description>Quality of life-Overall was assessed with the Quality of Life Enjoyment and Satisfaction Questionnaire (Q-LES-Q). The Q-LES-Q is a 16-item self-report questionnaire that assesses enjoyment of and satisfaction with life. The scoring of the Q-LES-Q-SF involves summing only the first 14 items to yield a raw total score. The last two items are not included in the total score but are standalone items. The raw total score ranges from 14 to 70 with higher scores indicating higher quality of life enjoyment and satisfaction.</description>

        <title>Quality of Life-Menopause Specific</title>
        <description>The Quality of life-Menopause specific is assessed by the Menopause Specific Quality of Life (MENQOL).
The MENQOL is self-administered and consists of a total of 29 items in a Likert-scale format. Each item assesses the impact of one of four domains of menopausal symptoms, as experienced over the last month: vasomotor (items 1–3), psychosocial (items 4–10), physical (items 11–26), and sexual (items 27–29). Items pertaining to a specific symptom are rated as present or not present, and if present, how bothersome on a zero (not bothersome) to six (extremely bothersome) scale. Means are computed for each subscale by dividing the sum of the domain’s items by the number of items within that domain. Non-endorsement of an item is scored a “1” and endorsement a “2,” plus the number of the particular rating, so that the possible score on any item ranges from 1-8. Total score also ranges from 1-8.</description>
