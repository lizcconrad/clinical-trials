    <textblock>
      This is a single institution, phase I dose escalation study of weekly romiplostim post
      umbilical cord blood transplantation in patients who fail to achieve platelet engraftment by
      day +30. Engraftment is defined as a platelet count ≥ 20 x 109/L on 3 consecutive
      measurements without transfusion for 7 days. Romiplostim is administered at the assigned dose
      as 6 weekly injections beginning by day +42 post transplant. Up to 4 dose levels (4, 6, 8,
      and 10 mcg/kg/dose) will be evaluated with the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of romiplostim
      determined by using the Continual Reassessment Method (CRM). The goal of this CRM will be to
      identify 1 of the 4 dose levels which corresponds to the desired maximum toxicity rate of 20%
      or less.

    <description>Romiplostim at the assigned dose will be administered subcutaneously (SQ) once a week for 6 weeks. The dose will be assigned at the time of subject registration. This is a dose escalation to determine the maximum tolerated dose. The doses include 4 mcg/kg/dose, 6 mcg/kg/dose, 8 mcg/kg/dose, and 10 mcg/kg/dose.</description>

          -  Between day +28 and day +42 status post myeloablative or nonmyeloablative UCBT (single
             or double cord blood transplant)

          -  Age ≥ 18 years
