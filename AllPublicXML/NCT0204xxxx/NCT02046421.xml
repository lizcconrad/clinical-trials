      This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of gemcitabine hydrochloride and
      mifepristone when given together with carboplatin in treating patients with breast cancer
      that is metastatic or cannot be removed by surgery or recurrent or persistent ovarian
      epithelial, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as
      carboplatin and gemcitabine hydrochloride, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor
      cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Steroid hormones can
      cause the growth of cancer cells. Hormone therapy using mifepristone may fight breast and
      ovarian cancer by lowering the amount of steroid hormone the body makes. Giving carboplatin
      and gemcitabine hydrochloride together with mifepristone may be an effective treatment for
      breast, ovarian epithelial, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and recommended phase II dose (RP2D) of
      mifepristone when given in combination with carboplatin and gemcitabine (gemcitabine
      hydrochloride).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the safety and tolerability of mifepristone in combination with carboplatin
      and gemcitabine.

      II. To describe the toxicities seen with carboplatin, gemcitabine, and mifepristone
      combination therapy.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To correlate expression of biomarkers (e.g. glucocorticoid receptor [GR], androgen
      receptor [AR], estrogen receptor [ER], and progesterone receptor [PR]) with treatment
      outcomes.

      II. To correlate serum and intratumoral mifepristone concentrations after two doses of
      mifepristone (in patients with easily accessible tumor who consent to an optional research
      biopsy).

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of mifepristone.

      Patients receive mifepristone orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 0, 1, 7, and 8, and
      carboplatin intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes and gemcitabine hydrochloride IV over 30-60
      minutes on days 1 and 8. Courses repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression
      or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 18 months.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients who have not recovered from toxicities of prior therapy to the point that
             they would be appropriate for re-dosing will be ineligible for study treatment. All
             patients must have a two week washout period from prior chemotherapy.

          -  Patients must be at least two weeks from prior radiation therapy (RT)

          -  Mifepristone inhibits cytochrome P450, family 3, subfamily A, polypeptide 4 (CYP3A4)
             and induces CYP3A4; addition of mifepristone to a pre-existing drug regimen may cause
             a mild and temporary increase in plasma drug concentration of drugs with significant
             CYP3A4 metabolism; medications that are strong inducers of CYP3A4 such as

             rifampin, rifapentine, St. John's Wort may decrease plasma mifepristone levels; strong
             CYP3A4 inhibitor medications are expected to cause the largest increases in plasma
             mifepristone concentrations; mifepristone may increase the plasma drug concentration
             of concomitant medications with metabolism mediated by cytochrome P450, family 2,
             subfamily C, polypeptide 9 (CYP2C9)/cytochrome P450, family 2, subfamily C,
             polypeptide 8 (2C8)

             infection, poorly controlled hypertension, symptomatic congestive heart failure,
             unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations
             that would limit compliance with study requirements

             patient wishes to participate in study

             therapy are ineligible

          -  History of long-term use of corticosteroids or concurrent short-term use of
             corticosteroids is not allowed; short-term corticosteroid use must be discontinued at
             least 2 weeks prior to study treatment

          -  Prior mifepristone use for anticancer therapy is not allowed

          -  Patients with advanced breast cancer who have received platinum therapy (e.g.
             carboplatin or cisplatin) and/or gemcitabine therapy for metastatic disease are
             excluded (platinum-based therapy and/or gemcitabine in the adjuvant or neoadjuvant
             setting is allowed)

          -  Ovarian cancer patients who have received prior gemcitabine therapy are ineligible;
             (prior carboplatin therapy is allowed)

          -  Patients with known grade 2 or greater allergic reactions attributed to compounds of
             similar chemical or biologic composition to mifepristone, carboplatin, or gemcitabine
