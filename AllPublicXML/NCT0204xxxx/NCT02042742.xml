  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A crossover trial was carried out in healthy volunteers aged 45-70 years and BMI &lt;30 kg/m2.
      Subjects consumed a Antioxidant Supplement (AS) containing 65 mg of punicalagin mixed with
      3.3 mg of hydroxytyrosol 3 times daily or a Control Supplement (CS) with maltodextrin for an
      8 wk each phase with 4-wk rest period. Supplementation order was randomly assigned and the
      consumption of derivative products of punicalagin and/or hydroxytyrosol restricted. The
      endothelial function parameters (brachial artery flow-mediated dilation (FMD), biochemical
      markers), inflammatory markers and nutritional status were evaluated before and after each
      phase. Previously a pilot study was completed with no placebo (n=30) to determinate the
      effective dose of Functional Supplement.
