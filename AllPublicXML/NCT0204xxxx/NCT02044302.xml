  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators hypothesize that in mastectomy patients with breast reconstruction, the
      addition of bupivacaine and botulinum toxin (BT) will result in better pain control in the
      acute and chronic setting, compared to traditional pain management techniques which rely
      almost exclusively on opioid analgesics and sedatives like diazepam (valium). This
      expectation is based on the fact that bupivacaine produces pre-emptive analgesia and BT will
      produce muscle relaxation, the combination of which will target different sites of pain
      generation, thus producing better analgesia. We also hypothesize that additional benefits may
      accrue from this regimen including decreased nausea and vomiting, sedation and constipation
      as a result of diminished opioid use1.

    <description>Current standard post-operative care for expander-implant breast reconstruction surgery consists of conventional pain medications including narcotics (like morphine, etc.) and sedatives (like valium). Placebo application during surgery will be made to establish perfection in the study design in terms of randomization and blinding. Injections will be done intramuscularly to the main chest muscle (pectoralis major) by the surgeon.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Women undergoing immediate unilateral or bilateral tissue expander breast
             reconstruction following therapeutic skin-sparing or nipple-sparing mastectomy
             requiring postoperative expansions

          -  Women undergoing immediate bilateral tissue expanders breast reconstruction following
             risk-reduction (prophylactic) skin-sparing or nipple-sparing mastectomy requiring
             postoperative tissue expansions.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects who are unable to read or speak English;

          -  Breast reconstruction using the latissimus dorsi flap combined with a tissue expander;

          -  Documented diagnosis of chronic pain, chronic migraine, upper limb spasticity,
             cervical dystonia, axillary hyperhidrosis, strabismus or blepharospasm;

          -  Hypersensitivity to any botulinum toxin (BT) preparation or to any of the components
             in the formulation;
