  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate CD8 + T-cell receptor (TCR) repertoire
      differences between patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus and type 2 diabetes or healthy
      controls.

      Using a systems biology approach by combining high-throughput sequencing, cytometry, gene
      expression, transcriptome profiling, HLA typing, single cell analysis, and TCR affinity
      assays, the investigators will define a set of immune metrics for the prediction or early
      diagnosis of disease that is superior to the current examination of auto-antibodies, which is
      a fairly late stage in the disease development. This can also be used to guide therapy in
      advanced disease.
