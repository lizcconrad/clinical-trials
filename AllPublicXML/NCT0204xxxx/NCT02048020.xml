    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well paclitaxel and carboplatin before radiation therapy with
      paclitaxel works in treating human papillomavirus (HPV)-positive patients with stage III-IV
      oropharynx, hypopharynx, or larynx cancer. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as paclitaxel and
      carboplatin, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the
      cells or by stopping them from dividing. Radiation therapy uses high energy x rays to kill
      tumor cells. Giving paclitaxel and carboplatin before radiation therapy with paclitaxel may
      kill more tumor cells.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the progression-free survival at 2 years in patients with HPV-positive head
      and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) who receive induction chemotherapy followed by dose
      de-intensified chemoradiotherapy.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the overall survival and local-regional control for patients with
      HPV-positive HNSCC who receive induction chemotherapy and dose de-intensified
      chemoradiotherapy.

      II. To determine the incidence of acute grade 3+ mucosal and esophageal toxicity associated
      with attenuated concurrent chemoradiotherapy in patients with HPV-positive HNSCC.

      III. To determine the incidence of late toxicity in patients with HPV-positive HNSCC who
      receive the dose de-intensified chemoradiotherapy.

      IV. To estimate the incidence of all toxicity (hematologic and non-hematologic) associated
      with protocol treatment for all patients on trial.

      V. To estimate the response rate of HPV-positive to induction chemotherapy using carboplatin
      and paclitaxel.

      VI. To determine the effect of reduced radiation dose on short-term and long-term quality of
      life among patients treated by chemoradiotherapy.

      OUTLINE:

      INDUCTION: Patients receive paclitaxel intravenously (IV) over 3 hours and carboplatin IV
      over 30 minutes. Treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 2 courses in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      CHEMORADIOTHERAPY: At least 2 weeks after completion of induction chemotherapy, patients
      receive paclitaxel IV over 1 hour weekly and undergo intensity-modulated radiation therapy
      (IMRT) daily 5 days a week for 5.5 weeks in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 6, 9, and 12 months, every 3
      months for 1 year, and then every 6 months for 2 years.

    <description>The true 2-year progression-free survival rate will be estimated by the proportion of efficacy-evaluable patients on study without documentation of disease progression or death 2 years from registration. A 95% confidence interval (CI) for the true progression-free survival rate will be constructed using the Duffy-Santner approach. However, Kaplan-Meier methodology will be used to estimate the final 2-year progression-free survival rate and its 95% CI in case there are censored patients.</description>
