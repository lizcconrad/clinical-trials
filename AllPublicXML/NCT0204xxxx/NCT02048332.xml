  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this research study, we want to learn more about the use of donor-derived cytotoxic
      T-cells (CTLs) to treat viral infections that occur after allogeneic stem cell transplant. A
      cytotoxic T cell is a T lymphocyte (a type of white blood cell) that kills cells that are
      infected (particularly with viruses). Allogeneic means the stem cells come from another
      person. These CTLs are cells specially designed to fight the virus infections that can happen
      after a bone marrow transplant.

      We are asking people who have undergone or will undergo an allogeneic stem cell transplant to
      enroll in this research study, because viral infections are a common problem after allogeneic
      stem cell transplant and can cause significant complications including death.

      Stem cell transplant reduces a person's ability to fight infections. There is an increased
      risk of getting new viral infections or reactivation of viral infections that the patient has
      had in the past, such as cytomegalovirus (CMV), Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), adenovirus (ADV),
      and BK virus (BKV). There are anti-viral medicines available to treat CMV, EBV, ADV, and BK
      infections, though not all patients will respond to the standard treatments. Moreover,
      treatment of viral infections is expensive and time consuming, with families often
      administering prolonged treatments with intravenous anti-viral medications, or patients
      requiring prolonged admissions to the hospital. The medicines can also have side effects like
      damage to the kidneys or reduction in the blood counts, so in this study we are trying to
      find an easier way to treat these infections.

      The stem cell matched donor will be asked to give us a blood donation for the CTLs
      generation. In the laboratory, we will treat this blood sample to select out the cells that
      will help fight viruses. The cells will be grown with peptides (protein fragments that
      represent parts of the virus that will encourage the donor immune cells to grow). We will
      then grow the cells in the laboratory so that we will have a stock of virus fighting cells
      for the patient to use in the future. We will freeze the cells and store them in a freezer in
      the laboratory.

      If the patient has signs of virus in their blood after the transplant we will give the cells
      to help fight the infection. If there are signs that the cells are helping fight the
      infection, we may give more cells. The patient may get the cells up to 5 times, with one
      month between each treatment. If the patient does not show signs of a virus, the cells will
      stay in the freezer.

      Following CTL infusion, (s)he will be monitored with physical exams daily while inpatient and
      weekly while outpatient as well as blood tests weekly until 30 days after the last infusion
      of cells. The patient will have 3 teaspoons (15 mL) of blood drawn before each cell infusion
      and then once a week after each infusion for 4 weeks and then once a month if possible for 1
      year after the last infusion, all to monitor for the viral response.

    <time_frame>Patients will be monitored weekly for new onset grades 2-4 GVHD within 30 days of CTL infusion.</time_frame>
    <description>The primary endpoint of the study is successful production of viral specific T-cells from donors, and infusion into stem cell transplant recipients without toxicity. Patients will be monitored for infusional toxicities around the time of the infusion and then weekly for 30 days following the infusion for development of new onset GVHD.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Efficacy</measure>
    <time_frame>Patients will receive physical examinations daily while inpatient. Following discharge, physical examination will be performed at least weekly until 30 days after last CTL infusion.</time_frame>
    <description>The secondary endpoint of the study is clinical efficacy of the infused viral specific T-cells. Efficacy will be assessed by clinical response to the infusion, and by the appearance of viral-specific T-cells in the recipients' peripheral blood, assessed by Elispot assay.</description>
