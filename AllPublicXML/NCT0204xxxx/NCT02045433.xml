  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether SABR boost therapy is effective in women
      with locally advanced cervical cancer without increased risk of acute gastrointestinal (GI)
      or genitourinary (GU) toxicity.

      Patients enrolled in this study will receive 45 Gray (Gy) in 25 fractions of intensity
      modulated external beam radiation therapy + weekly cisplatinum . Following the completion of
      Intensity Modulated Radiation Therapy (IMRT), patients will receive 28 Gy in 4 fractions
      using stereotactic body radiation therapy techniques.
