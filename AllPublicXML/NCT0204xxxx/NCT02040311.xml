      The purpose of this study is to determine the efficacy and safety of topiramate (96 mg or 192
      mg daily) as compared to placebo in maintaining weight loss in obese subjects who
      participated in an eight week intensive non-pharmacologic weight loss program.

      The primary efficacy endpoint will be the percent change in body weight from enrollment visit
      to week 60.

      The study was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, multicenter
      trial. It was originally designed to last a total of 74 weeks: an 8 week non.pharmacologic
      low-calorie (800 to 1000 kcl/d) weight loss run-in phase, an 8 week titration phase, 52 week
      maintenance phase, and 6 week drug taper and follow up phase.
