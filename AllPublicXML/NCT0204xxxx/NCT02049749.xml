  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to learn whether or not a brief parenting program
      called Child Adult Relationship Enhancement (CARE) offered at a primary care office can help
      improve behavior problems in children who are 2-6 years old.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will be a randomized controlled trial (RCT) of the CARE intervention. The study
      will include 2-6 year old children who receive their primary care at the Children's Hospital
      of Philadelphia, South Philadelphia Primary Care clinic and whose caregiver and/or doctor has
      concern about a behavior problem in the child. The caregivers will also be subjects in the
      study.

      Child-caregiver pairs who agree to be in the study will be randomly assigned to receive the
      CARE training immediately or in 3-4 months.

      The CARE intervention will last 6 weeks and child behavior and parenting will be measured at
      baseline, 6-8 weeks, and 14-18 weeks. Investigators will also measure parent satisfaction
      with the CARE intervention.

        -  Child Adult Relationship Enhancement (CARE) is a group parent training program.

        -  The goals of the program are to teach parents skills that help their children
           successfully reach developmental milestones while increasing positive behaviors.

        -  The program also was designed to help parents manage and decrease negative child
           behaviors.

        -  Each training will be led by 2 therapists and 4-10 parents will attend the CARE program
           together.

        -  Children do not attend the training but parents are encouraged to practice the skills
           learned at CARE between the sessions.

    <description>Behavior will be measured by the Eyberg Child Behavior Inventory (ECBI). The primary outcome is the ECBI change score (time 3-time1). The ECBI is a parent rating scale designed to measure conduct problem behaviors in children ages 2-16 years. The instrument contains 36 items that assess behavior on two scales. The problem scale provides a yes/no problem identification rating for each item, and the sum of yes responses yields a problem score with a potential range from 0 to 36 with a clinical cutoff of 15. The intensity scale provides a frequency-of-occurrence rating for each item, ranging from never (1) to always (7) and the ratings are summed to yield an intensity score with a potential range from 36 to 252 with a clinical cutoff of 131. The ECBI has demonstrated strong internal consistency, test-retest reliability, and discriminant validity and has been shown to be a sensitive indicator of intervention efficacy for child behavior problems.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline, 6-8 weeks and 14-18 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Investigators want to determine the effect of the CARE intervention on diminishing harsh parenting as measured by the Conflict Tactics Scales, Parent-Child version (CTSPC). Investigators will look at the CTSPC change score (time 3-time 1). The three core scales of the CTSPC measure non-violent discipline, psychological aggression, and physical assault. The supplemental scales measure weekly discipline, neglect, and sexual abuse. Reliability measures demonstrate strong internal consistency and test-retest reliability of the CTSPC.</description>

    <time_frame>6-8 weeks and 14-18 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Investigators would also like to determine whether there is an association between parent perception of CARE training efficacy on improving child behavior (measured by the Therapy Attitude Inventory, TAI) and the change in ECBI score for subjects randomized to the intervention. The TAI is a brief satisfaction measure of parent training and parent-child treatments. Psychometric evaluation of the TAI has demonstrated excellent internal consistency and test-retest reliability, and moderate correlation between TAI scores and pre to post treatment difference scores on the ECBI.</description>

    <description>40 child-caregiver pairs will be randomized to usual treatment plus delayed CARE (control). Under usual treatment, patients will be referred to a behavioral health specialist at the discretion of their pediatrician and the office social worker for additional diagnosis and treatment and/or provided with a 1-2 page informational handout on child behavior problems from the CHOP patient care manual. Following the final interview (3-4 months after enrollment for each subject) all participants randomized to the control arm (usual treatment plus delayed CARE) will receive the CARE training, if desired.</description>

    <description>40 child-caregiver pairs will be randomized to usual treatment plus immediate CARE. The trainings are administered to groups of 4-10 caregivers at a time and are led by two mental health providers trained in the CARE curriculum. The children do not attend the training; however, caregivers are expected to practice the skills that they learn in CARE with their child between sessions. The curriculum involves 6 sessions over 6-8 weeks. Each session will be 1-2 hours.</description>

    <description>CARE is a group parent training informed by the principles of Parent Child Interaction Therapy and was developed by Trauma Treatment Training Center and CHOP Policy Lab. CARE has been used in many populations including residential treatment center/domestic violence shelter staff, daycare providers, graduate students, biological parents, and foster parents/caseworkers. Goals are to decrease stress for caregivers, improve child behavior, and enhance the caregiver-child relationship, family stability, and wellness. The training teaches parents to follow a child's lead thus building a connection and promoting positive behaviors. The focus is on giving attention to child's pro-social behavior and ignoring minor misbehavior. The second phase teaches techniques for giving effective commands.</description>
