  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators study is designed to test the hypothesis that correction of vitamin D in CF
      patients can increase their lung function and decrease the number of their pulmonary
      exacerbations.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Vitamin D deficiency is a known problem in CF patients. The CF Foundation Committee published
      in April 2012 new guidelines for administering vitamin D in CF patients. The investigators'
      study is designed to look for association between normal serum vitamin D levels and lung
      function. ~100 CF patients from The Center of Chronic Diseases in Hadassah Medical
      Organization will be treated according to the new guidelines, and their lung function will be
      tested once a month during the trial, which will be held for at least one year. In this
      study, the investigators' goal is to test the efficiency of the new guidelines in correcting
      serum vitamin D levels, and to follow other related factors such as growth indices (height,
      weight, BMI), bone mineral density, number of pulmonary exacerbations and number of hospital
      admissions.
