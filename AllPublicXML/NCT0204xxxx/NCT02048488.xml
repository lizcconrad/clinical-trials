  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      TSR-011 is a potent small molecule inhibitor of tyrosine kinases involved in cancer,
      including:

        1. Anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK)

        2. The tropomyosin-related kinases TRKA, TRKB, and TRKC

      This is a sequential, open-label, non-randomized study with dose escalation in Phase 1,
      followed by expansion at a recommended phase 2 dose.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  To be considered eligible to participate in this study, all of the following
             requirements must be met:

               1. Patients in Phase 1 must have metastatic or locally advanced solid tumors who
                  have failed to respond to standard therapy

               2. All patients must have confirmation of either ALK positive or TRK positive
                  status.

               3. Patients in Phase 1 will not be required to have measurable disease. All patients
                  in Phase 2a will be required to have measurable disease by RECIST.

               4. All patients enrolled in this study must have tumor tissue available.

               5. Patient (male or female) must be ≥ 18 years of age (except where age of majority
                  is 16 years in a particular country, such as the United Kingdom).

               6. Patient must have performance status ≤2 on the ECOG Performance Scale.

               7. Patient must have an estimated life expectancy of at least 3 months.

               8. Patients must have adequate organ function.

               9. For patients previously treated with myelosuppressive therapy, at least 3 weeks
                  must have elapsed and toxicity must have recovered to grade 1 or baseline.
                  Non-myelosuppressive therapy patients must have recovered from all
                  treatment-related toxicities. Fourteen days must have elapsed since palliative
                  radiation for bone metastasis.

              10. Female patients of childbearing potential must have a negative serum pregnancy
                  test and use adequate birth control for the duration of study participation and
                  for 3 months after the last dose of study drug.

              11. The patient or his or her legal representative must be able to read, understand,
                  and provide signed informed consent.

              12. Patient is able to understand the study procedures and agrees to participate in

               4. Ongoing cardiac dysrhythmias of NCI CTCAE Grade ≥2, atrial fibrillation of any
                  grade, or QTc interval &gt;450 msec.

               5. Patients with risk factors for Torsade de point and patients receiving
                  concomitant medication with QT-prolonging medicines.

               6. Patient has an uncontrolled concurrent medical condition or disease.

               7. Patient has undergone bone marrow or stem cell transplantation in the past 6
                  months.

               8. Patient has a known hypersensitivity to the components of TSR-011 or the
                  excipients.

               9. Patient has active or uncontrolled infection.

              10. Patient has a known psychiatric or substance abuse disorder.

              11. Patient has active second primary malignancy.

              12. Patient is observed to have a clinically active central nervous system (CNS)
                  metastases or carcinomatous meningitis.

              13. Patient has any other severe concurrent disease which, in the judgment of the
                  Investigator, would preclude study participation.

              14. Patient is known to be HIV positive or who has an AIDS-related illness.

              15. Patient has a known history of or active (treated or not) Hepatitis B or C.
