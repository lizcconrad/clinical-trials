    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to estimate left atrial volume reduction surgery concomitant
      with the maze procedure and mitral valve repair/replacement in patients with atrial
      fibrillation with an enlarged left atria.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The Cox-Maze procedure has been a gold standard for the treatment of atrial fibrillation.
      Success of the modified maze procedure after valvular operation with an enlarged left atria
      and persistent and longstanding persistent atrial fibrillation remains suboptimal. The
      question addressed was: In adults undergoing a maze procedure for atrial fibrillation does
      left atrial size reduction compared to maze surgery alone improve maze surgery success?

    <description>Procedure: Maze procedure, mitral valve surgery
The scheme of lesion pattern: &quot;box&quot; lesion + line to mitral valve + line from &quot;box&quot; to left atrial appendage. The ablation procedure was performed by using a dry bipolar radiofrequency ablation clamp.
The left atrial appendage was excluded in all cases. For mitral regurgitation or stenosis, the procedures will be a valve repair in the majority of cases. For valves that are not amenable to repair, a valve replacement will be performed.</description>

             minimally invasive procedure.

          -  a) Persistent atrial fibrillation (AF) within 6 months prior to randomization, defined
             as non self-terminating AF lasting greater than 7 days but no more than one year, or
             lasting less than 7 days but necessitating pharmacologic or electrical cardioversion.

        Duration of AF must be documented by medical history and Presence of AF must be documented
        by a direct electrocardiographic assessment within 6 months prior to randomization.

        b) Longstanding persistent AF is defined as continuous AF of greater than one year
        duration.

        Duration of AF must be documented by medical history and Presence of AF must be documented
        by a direct electrocardiographic assessment upon arrival in the OR.

          -  AF without indication for mitral valve surgery

          -  Concomitant coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), aortic arch or aortic valve
             procedure

          -  Previous catheter ablation for AF
