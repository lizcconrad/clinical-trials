    <textblock>
      This phase I dose escalation study will evaluate IGF-Methotrexate conjugate (765IGF-MTX) in
      patients with advanced, previously treated tumors. 765IGF-MTX is administered as an IV
      infusion over 1 hour on days 1, 8 and 15 of a 28 day cycle. Treatment continues until disease
      progression, unacceptable toxicity, or patient refusal. Assessment of response will be
      confirmed with imaging studies performed at the end of cycle 2 +/- 7 days, and every 2 weeks
      thereafter.

             not pregnant must be established by a negative serum beta-human chorionic gonadotropin
             (beta-hCG) pregnancy test result obtained during screening. Pregnancy testing is not
             required for post-menopausal or surgically sterilized women.

          9. Other severe acute or chronic medical or psychiatric conditions, or laboratory
             abnormality that may increase the risk associated with study participation or
             investigational product administration or may interfere with the interpretation of
             study results and, in the judgment of the investigator, would make the patient
             inappropriate for enrollment in this study.

         10. Recent (within 6 months) arterial thromboembolic events, including transient ischemic
             attack (TIA), cerebrovascular accident (CVA), unstable angina, or myocardial

         13. History of cerebrovascular accident, pulmonary embolism or untreated deep venous
             thrombosis (DVT) within the past 6 months. Note: Subjects with recent DVT who have
             been treated with therapeutic anticoagulants for at least 6 weeks are eligible.

         14. Presence of any non-healing wound, fracture, or ulcer within 28 days prior to the
