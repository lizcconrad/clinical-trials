  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Preterm birth and perinatal events related can interrupt microscopic maturation of the
      developing white matter leading to diffuse injury and subsequent neurocognitive impairments.
      Brain maturation can be studied using diffusion tensor imaging but is difficult to assess
      early after birth, repeatedly and at the bedside. Supersonic Shear wave Imaging (SSI) could
      be of interest in this clinical setting. This technique, already investigated in adults
      (breast, thyroid or liver fibrosis staging), has not been yet evaluated in neonates.

      Objective:

      To describe the feasibility and reproducibility of quantitative elasticity mapping in preterm
      infants and to correlate to gestational age.

      Methods:

      SSI is a quantitative stiffness imaging technique based on the combination of a remote
      palpation induced into tissues by the radiation force a focused ultrasonic beam and an
      ultrafast ultrasound imaging sequence. Such ultrafast frame rates permit to track in real
      time the displacements induced by the propagation of the resulting shear waves. For each
      pixel, the shear wave speed can be estimated locally and enables quantitative mapping of the
      local shear elasticity (characterizing the stiffness in kPa). In this study, we will use a
      new generation of ultrafast ultrasound scanners (Aixplorer®, Supersonic Imagine, Aix en
      Provence, France) with a linear L10-2 probe (256 elements, 6 MHz) in neonates born between 25
      and 40 weeks' gestation (n=100). Three separate acquisitions will be obtained for each area
      of interest both on right and left sides and stiffness was measured using a unique ROI of 2.5
      cm².

      White matter damage occurs in 20% of preterm infants in industrialized countries. These
      lesions are difficult to evaluate by standard ultrasound. The quantitative elastography is a
      new medical imaging technique and potentially a diagnostic tool in brain lesions in preterm
      infants. Shear wave Imaging (SSI) could be of interest in this clinical setting. This
      technique, already investigated in adults (breast, thyroid or liver fibrosis staging), has
      not been yet evaluated in neonates.
