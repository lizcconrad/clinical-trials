  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The 3rd governmental plan of fighting against the pain favored the development and the
      evaluation of the efficiency of the non pharmacological methods. Its results always showes a
      lack of knowledge of these methods and the utility to pursue the researches.

      In the department of pediatric surgery of the university hospital of Limoges, the
      relaxing-touch is one of these methods which is more and more used. The healthcare staff
      noticed the beneficial effects of such an empirical method in terms of comfort and quality of
      life for the children.

      In 2011, a pilot study led in this department showed that, in spite of the usual treatment,
      the removal of the Redon's drain remains painful for 25 % of the children (score on the pain
      scale &gt; or = 4). This result convinced the medical team to write a protocol of research from
      the following hypothesis: the implementation of a protocol of the Redon's drain removal
      associated to the relaxing touch and usual treatment could lead to a decrease of the acute
      pain for a 7 to 17 years old child.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Children &gt; or = 7 and &lt; 18 years old

          -  Hospitalization for surgery having required the settle of a Redon's drain during
             surgery.

          -  The presence of at least one of the legal representatives with the child during the
             care.

          -  The consent of at least one of the legal representatives and agreement of the child
             for the relaxing-touch method.

          -  The affiliation of one of the legal guardian to the social security.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Children with an intellectual deficiency preventing the use of the scale EVA from the
             pain.

          -  Children having already had one or several removal of the Redon's drain: the negative
             memory of the pain for a similar act could falsify the score of pain

          -  Children refusing the usual care of the pain in the department by the MEOPA.
