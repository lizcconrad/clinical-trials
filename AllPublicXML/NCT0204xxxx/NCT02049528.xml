  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is being conducted to compare how long 2 oral formulations (a reference and a test
      formulation) of CC-122 stays in the body, and whether taking the test formulations with a
      high-fat meal affects the absorption of that formulation. There will be 3 dosing periods in
      the study, one for each formulation and one for the test formulation + meal. The subjects
      will be asked to fast for at least 10 hours before taking the capsule formulations. During
      one of the periods, the subject will be asked to eat a high-fat meal 30 minutes before being
      given the capsule to swallow. Subjects will be randomly (by chance) assigned to a treatment
      sequence which will determine the order in which the subject will receive the reference
      formulation, the test formulation, and the test formulation + high-fat meal. Blood samples
      will be taken at intervals during the study to assess the amount of drug at those time
      points. Blood samples will also be collected at certain time points to determine the levels
      of special proteins that may help explain how CC-122 work.

                  Statistical Manual [DSM]) within 2 years before dosing, or positive drug
                  screening test reflecting consumption of illicit drugs).

               9. History of alcohol abuse (as defined by the current version of the DSM) within 2
                  years before dosing, or positive alcohol screen.

              11. Exposed to an investigational drug (new chemical entity) within 30 days preceding
                  the first dose administration, or 5 half-lives of that investigational drug, if
                  known (whichever is longer).

              12. Smoke more than 10 cigarettes per day, or the equivalent in other tobacco

              14. Subject has any clinical significant allergic disease (excluding non-active hay
                  fever), excluding non-active seasonal allergies and childhood asthma cleared for
                  at least 3 years prior to screening.
