  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Health effects of fish consumption have been demonstrated in epidemiological studies and in
      controlled intervention studies in a number of different population groups, however,
      randomized controlled studies on the effect of fish consumption in elderly are sparse. Many
      studies have focused on n-3 fatty acids instead of fish as a food and therefore, many health
      effects have only been related to the effect of n- 3 fatty acids. The elderly are a
      heterogeneous population group and therefore difficult to study. In order to reduce
      heterogeneity, it is advisable to focus on elderly with specific needs. Elderly who
      experienced a hip fracture can serve as a model for an advanced ageing process, as these
      patients typically experience a huge inflammatory response, immobilisation and a reduction in
      muscle mass. Increased fish intake is believed to have effects towards inflammation and a
      reduction in muscle mass. Therefore, we want to test whether increased fish intake can have
      positive health effects in elderly who experienced a hip fracture.

      Main hypothesis:

      Increased fish intake (salmon, cod, pelagic fish), in comparison to meat, will increase
      mobility, muscle strength and mobility in frail elderly.

      Objectives

        1. To evaluate the health effects of fish consumption in frail elderly The effect of a
           dietary intervention with fish on mobility, muscle mass and strength in elderly who
           experienced a hip fracture has not been shown before.

        2. To demonstrate the feasibility of dietary intervention in elderly We want to show that a
           dietary intervention with fish or control meals is feasible in elderly. The meals (4
           portions of fish per week or control portions of meat) will be delivered to their homes.

      Description of work and role of participants This is a randomized clinical trial (RCT) on the
      effect of fish consumption on mobility in elderly who experienced a hip fracture. Elderly who
      experienced a hip fracture but were able to walk without support by a person before the
      fracture, will receive, after being randomized to two groups, fish or meat to be used in cold
      or warm meals at 4 days per week for a period of 16 weeks. Measurements will be taken at
      baseline (when patients have left the rehabilitation center), after 4 weeks and after 16
      weeks. Measurements at 4 and 16 weeks after inclusion will be at their homes or in the
      outpatient clinic.

    <description>The intervention will compare fish intake with a correspondent amount of meat. The basis for the comparison will be the estimated protein intake from fish and meat and should be almost similar both from fish and from meat. To ensure compliance and to add more variety to the diet, different fish types will be included in the intervention group and different meat sources in the control group. The types of fish (and that of meat in the control diet) that will be used will be accurately documented and will be similar for all participants included.</description>
