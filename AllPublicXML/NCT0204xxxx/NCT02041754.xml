  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The individual ingredients in IQP-AK-102 have been widely used. Backed by data from several
      studies demonstrating their efficacy, we are conducting this study to look into the efficacy
      and safety of this novel combination of three fibres, in appetite regulation, aiming to
      reduce the appetite.
