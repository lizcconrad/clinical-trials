  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Peritoneal Dialysis (PD) is a commonly used treatment for end stage renal failure, and the
      most commonly used dialysate contains unphysiological amounts of glucose, a high proportion
      of which is absorbed. Recent analysis of the Global Fluid Study, has established that in
      non-diabetic prevalent patients on PD a random glucose level is dependent on dialysate
      glucose load and is a predictor of death. By utilising clinical data and additional
      biosamples collected for the NIHR funded PD-CRAFT study, the investigators aim to confirm
      this finding, define the relationship between dialysate glucose exposure according to
      prescription regimes and glycaemia, define the most useful biomarker to monitor glycaemia ,
      and establish the role that impaired insulin sensitivity plays in blood glucose levels.
      Furthermore the investigators will explore the hypothesis that insulin resistance is
      associated with disturbance of the carnitine/acetyl-carnitine equilibrium that might benefit
      from intra-peritoneal carnitine supplementation.

      PD-CRAFT is an observational cohort study of 3000 prevalent PD patients collecting detailed
      clinical data, including glucose exposure and samples of dialysate. and blood which will be
      stored in the UK BioCentre. Follow up is for up to 2 years or endpoint (death, technique
      failure).

      Multivariate regression will be used to establish determinants of the non-fasting blood
      glucose and other measures of glycaemia, in particular different dialysis regimes, (e.g.
      modality, dwell lengths, fill volumes, and dialysate type and concentration specifically
      seeking to identify prescriptions that minimise the systemic effects) combined with measures
      of insulin resistance. The investigators will establish whether blood glucose predicts
      survival in an adjusted analysis (~300 endpoints needed) using Cox regression and explore the
      relationship of other biomarkers to survival.
