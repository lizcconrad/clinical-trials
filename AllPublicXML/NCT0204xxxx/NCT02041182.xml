  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pediatricians are supposed to talk about youth violence at all heath supervision visits,
      however these types of conversations rarely occur. There have been no studies assessing tools
      to prompt these discussions. The goal of this study is to see if electronic pre-visit
      questionnaires (PVQs) prompt patient-provider discussion of youth violence (YV) in the
      primary care setting. Additionally, patient-provider characteristics are explored as
      mediators to youth violence discussions, as well as feasibility and acceptability of the PVQ
      by patients and providers.

      Adolescents ages 13 to 21 who come to the Hasbro Primary Care Clinics for annual physicals
      will be recruited. A baseline phase was conducted to look at how often providers ask about
      health-related teen behaviors, assessed by exit survey. The experimental period will involve
      adolescents completing health-related behavior PVQ, given to their doctor prior to the visit.
      Exit survey will assess topics discussed. Experimental group will differ from control group
      based on PVQ containing extra questions about youth violence.
