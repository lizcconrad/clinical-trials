      Phase II, non-randomized, open-label study to determine the efficacy of cabozantinib as a
      firstline treatment for patients with differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC). Subjects will
      receive drug at a starting dose of 60mg PO QD. Subjects can receive drug as long as they
      continue to derive clinical benefit or until they experience unacceptable drug-related
      toxicity.
