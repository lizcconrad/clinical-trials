  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Robot assisted prostatectomy reduces the patients' postoperative pain and leads to rapid
      rehabilitation. But pneumoperitoneum affects the kidney. The increase of stress hormone
      reduces the glomerular filtration and the vaso-contraction of renal vessels leads the renal
      ischemia. Remifentanil is analgesics coupled with μ opioid receptor. In high dose of
      remifentanil, it is associated with κ and δ receptors, which leads to renal protection effect
      in animal study. Also, remifentanil infusion during anesthesia showed a diuretic effect. The
      purpose of this study is to investigate the remifentanil effect on renal function during
      robot assisted prostatectomy.
