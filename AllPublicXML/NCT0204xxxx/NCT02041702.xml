      The aim of this study is to assess the safety and efficacy of the SJM MRI conditional pacing
      system in subjects undergoing Cardiac Magnetic Resonance Imaging.The study hypothesis is that
      cardiac MRI scan will not affect the performance of the SJM MRI conditional pacing system
      when special conditions are met. Comparing with the control group,freedom from MRI
      scan-related complications and the electronic performances such as pacing threshold,sensing
      amplitude should be similar.

      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of SJM MRI conditional
      pacing system during and after Cardiac Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) Scan. The SJM MRI
      conditional pacing system consists of a SJM MRI conditional pacemaker and leads. It is
      conditionally safe for use in the MRI environment.The study will be conducted in Asian
      regions/countries.

      Accent Cardiac MRI study is a prospective,randomized ,multi center study .After signing the
      consent form ,patients will be enrolled in this study. Total subjects number will be 252
      .These patients will be randomized into 2 groups: 126 patients will be randomized into the
      MRI scan group and 126 patients will be randomized into the control group. The study will
      last 2.5 years .Individual patient participation in the study will last approximately 4 to 5
      months.

      All patients who decide to participate in the study will be implanted with the Accent MRI ™
      dual chamber pacemaker and Tendril MRI™ leads or other commercially available new SJM MRI
      conditional pacing system. After implant, before the MRI visit, patients will be randomized
      to either MRI Scan Group or Control Group in a 1:1 ratio. Patients in MRI Scan Group will
      undergo an MRI scan at the MRI visit (9~12 weeks after implant) while patients in Control
      Group will not receive an MRI scan in that visit. After MRI scan ,the patient's pacing system
      will be examined with a programmer to assess whether there are any changes in electronic
      parameters such as pacing capture threshold,sensing amplitude as well as lead impedence . 1
      month after the MRI visit , all patients will come back to hospital to have another study
      follow up including physical examination and device interrogation .
