  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overarching goal of this study is to determine whether combined cognitive training and
      Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS) reduces drinking in high-risk drinkers. To
      this end, specific study purposes are: 1) replicate previous findings that cognitive
      retraining reduces drinking levels, 2) test whether cognitive retraining can be enhanced with
      tDCS, and 3) investigate the neural changes that result from cognitive retraining and tDCS.
      We hypothesize that those participants who receive alcohol avoidance cognitive training will
      have greater reductions in drinking. In turn, those participants who receive a higher level
      of applied tDCS during alcohol avoidance response training will have better avoidance
      learning, as well as, a larger reduction in drinking behavior. Finally, those participants
      receiving a higher level of applied tDCS will have more neuronal response associated with
      alcohol avoidance during the brain imaging session.
