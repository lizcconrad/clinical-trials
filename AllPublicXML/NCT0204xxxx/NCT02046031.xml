      To explore the rule of absorption, distribution, metabolism and elimination after intravenous
      administration of Ginkgolides Meglumine Injection healthy subjects. The plasma drug profiles
      will be important to assess the potential clinical drug-drug interactions.

      Ginkgolides Meglumine Injection was jointly developed by China Pharmaceutical University and
      Jiangsu Kanion Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. Its pharmacal ingredients are ginkgo lactones A ,
      ginkgo lactone B, ginkgo lactone K, etc; Excipients for meglumine, citric acid, sodium
      chloride. It is used to treat stroke (mild-to-moderate cerebral infarction) in recovery
      phlegm and Syndrome of Intermingled Phlegm and Blood Stasis.

      The aim of this study is to explore the rule of absorption, distribution, metabolism and
      elimination after intravenous administration of Ginkgolides Meglumine Injection healthy
      subjects. The plasma drug profiles will be important to assess the potential clinical
      drug-drug interactions.

      Biological sample including blood and urine for PK is collected during the study. In the
      first stage, the biological sample of two subjects will be collected at different time
      points. In the second stage, the biological sample of another two subjects will be collected
      at the time points which are adjusted according to the results of the first stage.

    <description>Intravenous drip slowly. A 1 (25 mg), will be taken slowly into the 0.9% sodium chloride injection diluted in 250 ml before use, then slow intravenous drip, once a day. The dripping speed must be strictly controlled. For the first time when using Ginkgolides Meglumine Injection, dripping speed should be controlled for 10 ~ 15 drops per minute. After 30 minutes treatment without discomfort, dripping speed can be appropriately increased, but no more than 30 drops per minute.</description>
