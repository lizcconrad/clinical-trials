      Objective. Bipolar Disorders (BD) are a major public health problem. The investigators still
      lack knowledge of the mechanisms which contribute to BD. Hence treatments are few and
      limited, and clinical decision making is less refined. Currently, the investigators are
      investigating the effects of midday bright light therapy for the treatment of bipolar
      depression (University of Pittsburgh IRB approved protocol titled Light Therapy for Bipolar
      Disorder, IRB#: PRO09020546). In this study, the investigators propose to investigate a
      possible biological mechanism which might explain response to light treatment in depressed
      bipolar patients.

      The study goal is to understand how the response to light therapy relates to changes in
      vision, brain function and improvement in bipolar symptoms. The aims are to investigate mood
      levels plus the eye and brain responses to visual contrast stimuli in healthy comparators
      (HC) and bipolar depressed patients.

      Study Design and Methods. Overview. The investigators plan to enroll 18-50 year old adults
      with BD Type I or II and a current episode of major depression on stable-dosed antimanic
      drugs, and age and sex-matched HC - without mental disorders. Depressed patients with BD will
      be assigned randomly to receive active light therapy vs inactive comparator for 6 weeks. The
      investigators will examine responses to contrast stimuli from measures of visual evoked
      potentials and electro-retinography in HC and depressed bipolar patients before and after
      6-weeks of daily midday light therapy. The investigators will assess repeated measures of
      mood symptom levels, attention and circadian rhythms.

    <description>Visual Evoked Potential (VEP). This is a test which is used to assess visual cortical responses. The VEP recordings will be assessed at different contrast levels (80%, 16% and 7%) for the patient groups (BD vs HC). To assess the change in visual cortical responses, we will compare differences in the VEP responses between Weeks 0 and 6 between the groups.</description>
