  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study's primary goal is to assess the effectiveness of behavioural activation in reducing
      depressive symptoms and re-integrate patients with depression into their personal and
      professional lives thus improving quality of life and helping in attaining and maintaining
      remission of depression. It is aimed at helping patients re-engage with several life areas
      that they may have lost in the course of depressive illness. The intervention is centred on
      behavioural activation (BA) with complementary interventions including recreation activities,
      and behavioural modifications. The study question is: in patients with depressive disorder
      attending a specialized hospital based mood disorders clinic, does the addition of
      behavioural activation program delivered in a group format improve depressive symptoms and
      quality of life compared to treatment as usual after 18 weeks of treatment? Study
      investigators hypothesize that behavioural activation is an effective treatment for
      depressive disorder in patients with depression.

      This is a pilot study, a mixed-methods design including an open label pragmatic randomized
      trial and a qualitative grounded theory approach. Participants will be randomized to
      Behavioural Activation (BA) (intervention) or support group (control) in addition to
      treatment as usual. The qualitative component will be used to gather participant's
      experiences, beliefs and opinions about two topics: 1) the experience of participating in the
      behavioural activation program and 2) their evolving perceptions of their individual
      depressive illness and quality of life. Based on the analysis of qualitative data pertaining
      to the first topic, the behavioural activation program may be modified for the main trial, to
      respond to patient needs and feedback, in the spirit of delivering truly patient centered
      care. The qualitative study will involve multiple interviews and focus groups which will take
      place before, during, and after the pilot intervention period.

    <description>EQ-5D-5L is a commonly used standardized generic measure of health and economic appraisal in a variety of clinical conditions. This will assist in the exploration of economic evaluation of the behavioral activation program in the main trial. the EQ-5D-5L consists of five dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression. The response to each dimension is a five-level severity ranging from &quot;no problem&quot; to &quot;extreme problem&quot;.</description>

    <description>In addition to usual care, the control group will be offered a support group therapy format delivered at the same place, same visit frequency and duration of program as the intervention group. This support group is intended to simulate the intervention group format to minimize risk of biased estimate of BA effectiveness by reducing the potential placebo effect which can be seen due to frequent clinic visits and having additional attention beyond usual care.</description>

    <description>Originally a component of cognitive therapy, behavioural activation is the use of strategies such as activity scheduling, master/pleasure ratings, and graded task assignments to change one's perception of specific situations. It involves the use of activities to improve life situations or depressed mood.</description>

    <description>Behavioral activation is a therapy, which has been shown to be quite effective in the treatment of depression (Kanter, Manos et al. 2010; Martell, Dimidjian et al. 2010). Although previous therapies have focused more on the cognitive element, behavioural activation on its own has also been significantly effective for depression treatment (Jacobson, Dobson et al. 1996). The treatment works by increasing behaviours that help a patient with depression interact with an environment and providing consequences to positively reinforce &quot;antidepressant behaviour&quot; (Martell, Dimidjian et al. 2010).</description>
