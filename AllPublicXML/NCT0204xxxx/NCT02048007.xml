  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The long-term goal of this study is to more precisely define the role of mass azithromycin
      treatments as an intervention for reducing childhood morbidity and increasing growth, and for
      the potential selection of antibiotic resistance. The investigators propose a set of 3
      cluster-randomized trials comparing communities randomized to oral azithromycin with those
      randomized to placebo. To assess the generalizability of the intervention, investigators will
      monitor for antibiotic resistance, which could potentially limit adoption of mass antibiotic
      treatments. The investigators will also assess several measures of infectious diseases. The
      investigators hypothesize that mass azithromycin treatments will reduce childhood morbidity
      and will be accompanied by an acceptable level of antibiotic resistance.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators will assess childhood infectious disease morbidity and macrolide resistance
      over two years, comparing communities where children aged 1-60 months receive biannual oral
      azithromycin to communities where the children receive biannual oral placebo.

      Randomization of Treatment Allocation. In each site, 30 communities within a contiguous area
      of 300,000 to 600,000 individuals will be randomized into the azithromycin or placebo arm.
      The investigators will use a simple random sample separately for each study site, but without
      stratification or block randomization within the site. These communities are being randomized
      from the same pool of communities eligible for a sister trial (Mortality Reduction After Oral
      Azithromycin (MORDOR) - Morbidity Study).

      Specific Aims

      Specific Aim 1: To assess whether macrolide resistance is greater in a population-based
      community sample of pre-school children, or in a clinic-based sample of ill pre-school
      children

      Specific Aim 2: To assess whether biannual mass azithromycin treatments of pre-school
      children can eliminate ocular chlamydia in a hypoendemic area

      Specific Aim 3: To assess the diversity of the microbiome of the nasopharynx, nares,
      conjunctiva, and gastrointestinal tract
