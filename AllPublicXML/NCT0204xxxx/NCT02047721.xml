  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study the Investigators are examining the effects of a 12-week exercise program
      (intervention) on measures of appetite and food intake regulation in overweight to mildly
      obese healthy adults. The Investigators hypothesize that individuals who lose a significant
      amount of weight in response to the intervention will show a reduction in the brain response
      to food cues as measured by functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) when compared to
      those who do not lose weight. These changes in neuronal activity will be associated to
      physiologic and behavioral measures.

    <description>The neuronal response will be assessed by functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in response to visual food cues
Blood oxygen dependent signal (BOLD) response in exposure to visual food cues will be measured during a fMRI scan and the difference between responses in those who lose weight vs. those who do not lose weight will be compared.</description>
