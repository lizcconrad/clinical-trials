  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The proposed study will investigate the effect of sodium bicarbonate on the prevention of
      acute kidney injury in children undergoing cardiac surgery with cardio-pulmonary bypass. The
      investigators hypothesize that the occurrence of acute kidney injury will be less in children
      treated with sodium bicarbonate in the perioperative period when compared to placebo. The
      specific aims of this proposal are as follows:

      1. To institute a prospective, randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial in
      pediatric subjects undergoing cardiac surgery to determine the efficacy of sodium bicarbonate
      on prevention of acute kidney injury as measured by pRIFLE criteria. 2. To examine whether
      treatment with sodium bicarbonate modifies the duration of acute kidney injury, fluid
      balance, hospital length of stay, need for dialysis, and progression to kidney failure. 3. To
      determine the relevance of NGAL as a biomarker to predict development of acute kidney injury.

    <description>The efficacy of sodium bicarbonate on prevention of AKI will be tested by comparing the proportion of subjects in each of the treatment arms who progress to AKI as measured by the Pediatric Risk, Failure, Loss of Function, and End-Stage Renal Disease (pRIFLE) criteria or an absolute increase in creatinine of 0.3mg/dl.</description>

    <description>At the start of the surgery, the patient will receive NaHCO3 as a continuous infusion of D5% 1/3NS + 100 meq/L NaHCO3 + 20 meq/L KCl at maintenance IVF (solution contains ~154 meq of sodium which is equivalent to normal saline). The NaHCO3 infusion will continue for the first 24 hours after the discontinuation of CPB. After 24 hours of receiving the NaHCO3 infusion, the IVF administered to the patient will be the standard solutions used in the PICU at CCMC.</description>

    <description>At the start of surgery, patients in the control arm will receive D5% Normal Saline + 20 meq/L KCl at maintenance IVF. After 24 hours, standard IVF, not containing NaHCO3 or Na acetate will be administered for the duration of the PICU stay as required, determined by the clinicians primarily caring for the patient postoperatively.</description>

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Subjects with abnormal creatinine clearance (&lt;90 ml/min/1.7m2) as measured by the
             Schwartz formula

             solitary kidney, single multicystic/dysplastic kidney, hydronephrosis will not be
             excluded if renal function is preserved)

          3. Subjects with known metabolic disorder

          4. Premature infants born &lt;30 weeks gestation and &lt;30 days old due to risk of
             intraventricular hemorrhage

        Subjects in severe cardiogenic shock post-operative requiring extra-corporeal membrane
        oxygenation (ECMO) or left ventricular assist device (LVAD) will be withdrawn from the
