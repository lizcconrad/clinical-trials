  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effects of a new daily subcutaneous (SC)
      injectable formulation of RM-493 in healthy obese subjects on mean percent body weight loss
      and other weight loss parameters, as well as Pharmacokinetic (PK) profile. The study is
      designed to evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of RM-493 administered once or twice
      daily. The study drug (RM-493 and placebo) will be administered in a blinded fashion.
