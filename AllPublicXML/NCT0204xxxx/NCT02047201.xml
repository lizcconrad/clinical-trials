  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To evaluate the safety and efficacy of cisplatin plus intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT)
      based on FDG-PET/CT after induction chemotherapy (IC) for locally advanced head and neck
      squamous cell carcinoma.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Current guidelines define that pre-IC target volumes must be used for radiotherapy (RT)
      planning. This prospective, phase II trial assessed the results of patients with locally
      advanced squamous cell carcinoma of head and neck treatment with IC following by
      chemoradiotherapy (CRT), using post-IC PET/CT images for IMRT planning.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Progression free survival (PFS)</measure>
    <time_frame>24 months after treatment</time_frame>
    <description>PFS was defined as the time from the first day of IC first cycles to either progression or death.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Tumour metabolic response (MTV) reduction (%)</measure>
    <time_frame>2 weeks after IC</time_frame>
    <description>MTV was defined as the tumor volume with FDG uptake segmented by a gradient-based method and fixed threshold methods at &gt;40% of SUVmax. The MTV predictive value for tumor response to IC was assessed by comparing MTV`s reduction (MTV of second PET/CT difference from MTV of first PET/CT in percent) in IC responders versus non responders and correlation with PFS and OS.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Total lesion glycolysis (TLG) reduction (%)</measure>
    <time_frame>2 weeks after IC</time_frame>
    <description>The TLG was defined as (MTV) x (SUVmean). The TLG predictive value for tumor response to IC was assessed by comparing TLG reduction (TLG of second PET/CT difference from TLG of first PET/CT in percent) in IC responders versus non responders and correlation with PFS and OS.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>SUVmax reductions (%)</measure>
    <time_frame>2 weeks after IC</time_frame>
    <description>The SUVmax was defined as (tissue activity) (mcCi/ml)/(injected dose) (mCI)/(patient weight) (kg) within the voxel having the highest activity within a given region of interest (ROI). The SUVmax predictive value for tumor response to IC was assessed by comparing reductions in SUVmax (SUVmax of second PET/CT difference from SUVmax of first PET/CT in percent) in IC responders versus non responders and correlation with PFS and OS.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number (%) of participants with adverse events</measure>
    <time_frame>12 and 24 months from chemoradiotherapy</time_frame>
    <description>Treatment acute toxicity during IC and CRT (chemoradiotherapy) was weekly assessed according to the National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria (NCI CTCAE) v.4.0. Late adverse events related with radiotherapy were assessed every three months after CRT using RTOG (Radiation Therapy Oncology Group) /EORTC (European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer) toxicity criteria.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Overall survival (OS)</measure>
    <time_frame>24 months after treatment</time_frame>
    <description>OS was defined as the time from the first day of IC first cycles until death from any cause.</description>
