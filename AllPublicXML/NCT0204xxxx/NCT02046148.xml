    <textblock>
      Evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of the trivalent group B streptococcus vaccine in
      healthy pregnant women. The study will also evaluate the levels of GBS serotype-specific
      antibodies in infants, placental transfer from the pregnant women to the infant and levels of
      antibodies in the breast milk.

    <description>An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a subject or clinical investigation subject administered a pharmaceutical product at any dose that does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment. Therefore, an AE can be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding, for example), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of an investigational product, whether or not considered related to the investigational product. This definition includes inter-current illnesses or injuries and exacerbation of pre-existing conditions.</description>

        <description>Geometric Mean Ratio relative to pre-vaccination (Day 1) of serotype-specific (Ib) GBS serum IgG antibody concentrations (anti-Ib) in maternal subjects. Antibody concentrations were measured by Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), expressed as geometric mean concentrations (GMCs), in micrograms per milliliter (µg/mL). The data for serotype Ib were not available at the time of the posting (new assay currently in development and to be validated before the results release).</description>

        <description>An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a subject or clinical investigation subject administered a pharmaceutical product at any dose that does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment. Therefore, an AE can be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding, for example), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of an investigational product, whether or not considered related to the investigational product. This definition includes inter-current illnesses or injuries and exacerbation of pre-existing conditions.</description>

        <description>An SAE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose results in one or more of the following: death; life-threatening; that does not refer to an event which hypothetically might have caused death if it were more severe; required or prolonged hospitalization; persistent or significant disability/incapacity; congenital anomaly/or birth defect; any important and significant medical event that may not be immediately life-threatening or resulting in death or hospitalization but, based upon appropriate medical judgement, may jeopardize the subject or may require intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed above. An MAE is defined as an adverse event that leads to an unscheduled visit to a healthcare practitioner.</description>

          <title>Descriptive Statistics for the Score for the Long-term Developmental Outcome Assessed by Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development 3rd Edition Screening Test (PsychCorp) in Infants (Median, Minimum and Maximum)</title>
          <description>Long-term developmental outcome assessed by Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development 3rd edition Screening Test (PsychCorp). The screening test measured three domains: cognitive, language (receptive vs expressive communication), and motor (fine vs gross).
Scaled scores range from 1 to 19 with a mean of 10 and a standard deviation of 3. The scores were summarized by reporting the median, minimum and maximum.</description>
          <population>Infants born to screened subjects who signed informed consent form, provided demographic data and/or baseline screening assessments, were randomized and assigned a study subject ID and who received a study vaccination.</population>
