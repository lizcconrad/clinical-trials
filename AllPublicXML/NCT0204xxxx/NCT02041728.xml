    <textblock>
      The investigators are going to test if it is possible to detect early dementia with the
      digital game &quot;memory&quot;. The investigators are going to test 15 healthy people and 15 patients
      with early dementia.

      The test consists of playing the game &quot;memory&quot; several times. While playing, several
      parameters are stored.

      The investigators are going to test if any correlation can be found between these parameters
      and the cognitive state of the person as tested by the Mini-Mental status examination.
