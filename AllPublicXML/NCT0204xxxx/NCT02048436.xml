      The purpose of this study is to validate the accuracy of the Perminova N4 Monitoring system
      Respiration Rate technology.

      After IRB Approval, eighteen volunteer test subjects will be entered into an accuracy study
      that is designed to validate accuracy of the respiratory rate technology of the Perminova N4
      Monitoring system (Device Under Test). The subjects will be selected to represent a range of
      body types including small, average, muscular, and large with a range of BMI's.

      A range of stable respiratory rates will be elicited from each volunteer test subject. The
      rates will be approximately 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35 and 40 breaths per minute; with some
      natural variation from these exact numbers.

      Each subject will be instrumented with an open system mask that allows for measurement of the
      end tidal carbon dioxide (EtCO2) respiratory rate and tidal volume. The EtCO2 monitor will be
      used as the Accuracy Reference Device (Reference) in this study. Performance of the currently
      released ECG Impedance Respiratory Rate monitor (Acceptance Standard) will be used to
      establish the acceptance criteria in this study by comparing to Reference.
