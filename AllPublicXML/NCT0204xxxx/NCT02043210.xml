  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators are conducting a randomized clinical trial of our new web-based version of
      the CBT4CBT (Computer Based Training for Cognitive Behavioral Therapy) in Spanish. This
      program specifically designed for Spanish-speaking substance users to evaluate its
      effectiveness relative to standard outpatient counseling at the Hispanic Clinic. The
      computer-based training program (CBT4CBT) focuses on teaching basic coping skills, presenting
      examples of effective use of coping skills in a number of realistic situations in video form,
      and providing opportunities for patients to practice and review new skills while receiving
      substance use treatment.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      100 Spanish-speaking substance using individuals seeking treatment at the Hispanic Clinic of
      the Connecticut Mental Health Center will be randomized to (1) standard outpatient counseling
      at the Hispanic Clinic (typically consisting of weekly group counseling), OR (2) CBT4CBT plus
      standard outpatient counseling. Treatments will be delivered over an 8-week period with a
      six-month follow-up after termination of the study treatments. The primary outcome measures
      will be reduction in substance use (frequency of substance use by time, confirmed by urine
      toxicology screens and breathalyzers). Secondary outcomes will include treatment utilization
      and cost, several measures intended to detect whether web-based CBT4CBT retains key
      characteristics of traditional clinician-administered CBT (e.g., acquisition of coping
      skills, use of change strategies), participant characteristics which will be evaluated as
      potential moderators of outcome, as well as participant satisfaction and treatment
      credibility.
