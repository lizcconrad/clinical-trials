  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Despite large efforts trying to improve diagnostic and therapy of sepsis have been made over
      the last decade (e.g. initiation of the Surviving Sepsis Campaign, defining evidence based
      sepsis therapy bundles) the mortality of septic shock remains high and causes high
      socioeconomical burden of disease.

      The purpose of this pilot study is to evaluate the design and conduct of a projected full
      scale clinical trial.

      A functional clock is required for induction of several proinflammatory genes, not shown in
      septic patient settings, yet.

      Clock genes are involved in modulating the activity of several transcription factors that are
      important regulators of immune functions (e.g. HIF1-α, STAT1, STAT3, and NF-κB) (Bellet MM et
      al., 2013).

      Furthermore, polymorphisms such as rs7221412, a common polymorphism near period homolog 1
      (PER1), was associated with the timing of activity rhythms and also showed a suggestive
      time-dependent relationship with both cerebral cortex and monocytes PER1 expression and an
      association with time of death (Lim ASP et al., 2012).

      This explorative project is a pilot study. First data are generated for the assessment of the
      circadian system in patients with septic shock.
