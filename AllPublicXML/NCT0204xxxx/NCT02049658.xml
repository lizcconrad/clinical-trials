    <textblock>
      Previous studies have demonstrated that sniff dogs can identify cancer patients from healthy
      subjects through sniffing exhaled breath air or blood or serum or urine or feces. It is
      hypothesized that sniff dogs may be used as a tool in identifying cancer patients in the high
      risk population or suspected patients. Trained dogs will sniff serum from participants who
      are suspected to suffer from tumor by their physicians and not yet but will be diagnosed by
      pathological examination.The results will be compared with the outcome of the pathological
      examination.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>sensitivity and specificity of the sniff dogs as a tool in diagnosing tumors</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The results that obtained from the dogs will be compared with these of the pathological examinations. Sensitivity = the No. of patients identified by the dogs as cancers / the No. of patients suffering from cancer confirmed by pathological examination. Specificity = No. of subjects signaled by the dog as non-cancers / No. of subjects confirmed by pathological examination as non-cancer subjects.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>behavior patterns of the sniff dogs to different diseases</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The behavior (lying before the tank for positive, neglecting the tanks) of the dog will be recorded and compared with the results of the pathological examination.</description>

    <measure>the substances used for identifying tumors by the sniff dogs</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>GCMS etc will be used to compare the volatile compounds between the sera from cancers patients and the from non-cancer subjects, the suspected VOCs will be tested by the dog for conformation.</description>
