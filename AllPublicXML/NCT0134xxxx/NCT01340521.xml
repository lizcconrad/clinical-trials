  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of the study is to quantitatively evaluate pituitary hormone response, follicle
      stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH), to low doses of clomiphene citrate in
      normally fertile women.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Empirical use low-dose clomiphene citrate has been advocated by some practitioners to enhance
      fecundity in women with unexplained infertility. No clinical trials have examined the
      efficacy of such treatment in the patient population, although certain studies have shown
      that active ovulation induction can be effective in women with unexplained infertility, and
      that cycle fecundity is improved for normally cycling women with active ovulation management
      in a program of artificial insemination. Since clomiphene citrate can have paradoxical
      effects on fertility through its anti-estrogenic mode of action, the benefit or lack of
      benefit from treatment with clomiphene citrate in this patient group needs to be evaluated.
      We aim to establish a dose response of FSH and LH to various low doses of clomiphene citrate
      in normally cycling women of known fertility, that is women with an intact
      hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian-axis. The significance of this information is that it may help
      to elucidate the mechanism by which low-dose clomiphene citrate may improve fecundity in
      patients with unexplained infertility as it is currently being used empirically.
