      Watchful waiting is non-inferior to surgical repair of asymptomatic and oligosymptomatic
      incisional hernias in terms of pain and discomfort during normal activities.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Incisional hernias are one of the most frequent complications in abdominal surgery. In
      Germany, 44.000 incisional hernia repairs per year are performed. Incisional hernia repair is
      not a low risk operation associated with high recurrence rate and high percentage of
      postoperative pain. Treatment of incisional hernias represents a significant surgical and
      socioeconomic problem. Until now, surgical treatment is recommended for patients with
      incisional hernia independent of symptoms due to the risk of an acute incarceration with
      serious complications. Studies defining the exact indications for incisional hernia repair
      and describing the natural course of an incisional hernia including the risk of an acute
      incarceration are not available to date. Randomized controlled trials having been performed
      in the past few years show that observation is a reasonable option in mildly symptomatic
      inguinal hernias. In this study, watchful waiting vs. surgical repair of oligosymptomatic
      incisional hernias are compared in a prospective-randomized setting for the first time. The
      aim is to determine pain and discomfort, quality of life, patient satisfaction, and the
      frequency of incarceration. The investigators hypothesize that pain intensity during everyday
      activities is not different in the compared groups and that incarceration frequency is low.
      If this was the case, a watchful waiting strategy could be applied in oligosymptomatic
      incisional hernias and risks and costs for surgery could be saved.

    <description>After informed consent and randomization into the watchful waiting group patients will receive standardized verbal information and written instructions on symptoms of acute incarceration. In case of acute symptoms they will be told to visit a physician immediately. On follow-up visits at 1 month, 12 months and 24 months the hernia size will be determined by physical examination, and the pain/ discomfort and the functional status will be monitored.
Control intervention/ reference test:
Open or laparoscopic hernia repair with mesh (non-absorbable or partly-absorbable alloplastic material) or with direct suture repair. For hernias measuring ≥ 3 cm mesh repair is recommended. A wide overlap of the mesh over the fascia margin on each side has to be provided. Divergent types of repair are permitted but have to be documented.</description>
