      with ascites and exploring the dosage-effect relations of the drug.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Tolvaptan is able to exert hydragogue diuretic effects (water diuresis) via inhibition of
      water reabsorption by renal collecting ducts without corresponding increase in electrolyte
      excretion. It has been confirmed that tolvaptan is able to increase urine volume without any
      adverse effects on renal functions.
