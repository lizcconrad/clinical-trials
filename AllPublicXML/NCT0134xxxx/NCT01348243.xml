  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Clodronic acid 100 mg/3,3 ml is used to prevent and treat postmenopausal osteoporosis.

      The intramuscular formulation, which is given at a dose of 100 mg every 7 o 14 days, is at
      least as effective as daily oral therapy and appears more effective than intermittent
      intravenous treatment. Intramuscular clodronic acid in particular has also been associated
      with improvements in back pain. The drug is well tolerated, with no deleterious effects on
      bone mineralization, and use of parenteral therapy eliminates the risk of gastrointestinal
      adverse effects that may be seen in patients receiving oral bisphosphonates therapy.

      In order to simplify the therapeutic dosing regimen, reducing the number of administrations
      per month, and therefore increase adherence to bisphosphonates therapy of the patient, a new
      formulation of disodium clodronic acid containing 200 mg/4 mL for i.m. administration has
      been developed. Lidocaine in this new formulation, as local anaesthetic, is maintained at the
      same concentration as in the 100 mg clodronic acid formulation.

      The pharmacokinetics and tolerability of the intramuscular formulation of clodronic acid 200
      mg in comparison to the marketed formulation clodronic acid 100 mg was evaluated in healthy
      post-menopausal volunteers. Two formulations were similar in terms of amount and rate of
      clodronic acid urinary excretion and in terms of safety profile.
