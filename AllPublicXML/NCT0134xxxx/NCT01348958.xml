    <description>Following surgery, subjects who have undergone knee arthroplasty will have the knee that has undergone arthroplasty (post-operative) scanned at least 8 weeks after surgery.
During one visit, each subject will have the post-operative knee scanned 1 time using Lunar orthopedic application, and 3 times with the subject repositioned between scans using the Lunar orthopedic knee application (total of 4 scans). Lunar iDXA measurement procedures will be done</description>
