      with Lotemax after undergoing cataract surgery.

      This is a single-center study to evaluate the clinical outcomes of Lotemax 0.5% for the
      treatment of Ocular inflammation associated with cataract surgery. Subjects will be screened
      from one to 21 days prior to initiation of dosing with the test article. Subjects who sign
      the informed consent document and meet all inclusion/exclusion criteria will be eligible to
      participate in this study. Subjects will instill one drop of Lotemax into the study
      (operative) eye QID for a maximum of 22 days. Dosing with test article will begin the day of
      surgery and for 21 days after surgery. Subjects will be seen for evaluation on Days 1, 7±1,
      and 21 ± 2 following surgery. Subjects will be seen for a follow-up visit on Day 42 ± 3
      following surgery, about 21 days after their last dose of test article.

      In addition to the test article regimen, subjects will receive Vigamox TID 3 days prior to
      surgery. Patients will receive one drop of Timoptic XE 0.5%, Zymaxid on the day of surgery.
      Postoperatively, patients will receive Vigamox TID for ten days and Bromday QD for 3 weeks.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Male or Female 18 years of age scheduled for unilateral cataract surgery
             (phacoemulsification or extracapsular) with posterior chamber intraocular lens
             implantation.

          2. Agree not to have any other ocular surgery in the study or fellow eye for duration of
             study.

          3. Have a BCVA of 20/200 or better in either eye.

          4. Willing/able to return for all required study visits.

          5. Willing/able to follow instructions from the study investigator and their staff.

          6. Able to self-administer test article (or have a caregiver available to instill all
             doses of test article).

          7. If woman capable of becoming pregnant, agree to have urine pregnancy test(must be
             negative) at agree to use a medically acceptable form of birth control during study
             and for at least one week prior to and after completion of the study.

          8. Have read, understood, and signed the informed consent document approved by Sterling
             Institutional Review Board.

          9. Have IOP ≥ 5mmHg and ≤ 22mmHg, (in study eye) with or without anti-glaucoma therapy at
             the pre-operative screening visit (if &gt; 22mmHg, adjust following pachymetry).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Have known hypersensitivity to Lotemax or to any component of the test article
             (including &quot;procedural&quot; medications such as anesthetic and/or fluorescein drops,
             dilating drops, etc.).

          2. Have a known hypersensitivity to non-steroidal or steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs
             (NSAIDs).

          3. Have intraocular inflammation (i.e. cells or flare in the anterior chamber as measured
             on slit lamp exam) in the study eye at the screening visit.

          4. Have a known blood dyscrasia or bone marrow suppression, a diagnosis of
             uncontrolled/unstable peptic ulcer disease, inflammatory bowel disease, or ulcerative
             colitis, or any uncontrolled/unstable pulmonary, cardiac, vascular, autoimmune,
             hepatic, renal, or central nervous system disease.

          5. Have used ocular, topical, or systemic steroids within 14 days or depot steroid 30
             days prior to initiation of dosing with the test article or throughout the duration of
             the study. Note: use of an opioid during surgery (e.g., fentanyl) is allowed.

          6. Have uncontrolled glaucoma or IOP &gt;/= 27mmHg.

          7. Have active corneal pathology noted in the study eye at the screening visit. Active
             corneal pathology is defined as corneal pathology that is non-stable, or greater than
             mild, or will compromise assessment of the safety or efficacy of treatment.

          8. Are pregnant or nursing.

          9. Have participated in any other study of an investigational drug or device within 30
