      Primary: to compare the overall survival defined as the time elapsed between the
      randomization date and death due to any cause, in both treatment groups.

      Secondary: to compare the progression-free survival, incidence of locoregional failure, site
      of the first recurrence/progression, objective response rate assessment, quality of life
      assessment and incidence of adverse events.

      This is a phase III, superiority, national, open-label, randomized, and two-arm study.

      Patients' enrollment will be performed only after approval by competent regulatory
      authorities and it will last up to 12 months.

      All patients taking part in the study must sign an informed consent. The patients will have
      stage III or IV, unresectable head and neck SCC, performance status 0 or 1.

      Randomization and treatment assignment will be performed by a company specifically contracted
      for such purpose and will be per research site and disease stage, 1:1
