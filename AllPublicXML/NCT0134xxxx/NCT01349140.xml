  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      EXPAREL™, an investigational drug product, is a new formulation of a local anesthetic
      (numbing medicine) that is designed to be longer acting than the currently-available local
      anesthetics. The purpose of this study is to determine the effect on thigh muscle strength
      and skin sensitivity of various doses of EXPAREL when placed next to the nerve that goes to
      the thigh.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Putting local anesthetic next to a nerve is a common way of decreasing the pain that patients
      feel after surgery. For knee surgery, the local anesthetic is placed next to the femoral
      nerve in the middle of the crease where the leg meets the body when bending at the hip joint.
      However, the local anesthetic takes away not only sensation—and therefore pain—but also motor
      control, leaving muscles weaker. It would greatly improve patient safety if the investigators
      could administer a very long-acting local anesthetic that decreased postoperative pain, but
      affected muscle strength only minimally. Currently, the investigators do not know if this is
      possible with EXPAREL, and the investigators therefore are conducting this study to help
      determine the dose of EXPAREL that will result in a minimal (20%) decrease in muscle
      strength.

    <description>The dominant side (left or right) will be randomized to one of two treatment groups: the higher or lower concentration of the local anesthetic EXPAREL. The non-dominant contralateral side will receive the other possible treatment. The volume of each and every single-injection femoral nerve block will be 30 mL (standard for femoral nerve blocks is 30-40 mL).3 Since volume will remain constant, we will vary the dose of EXPAREL by varying concentration (volume x concentration = dose). Of note, EXPAREL may be mixed with normal saline to vary the concentration. Randomization will be based on computer-generated codes. Randomization will be in blocks of two, and stratified by sex.</description>

    <description>Single-injection femoral nerve block. Initial doses of SKY0402 will begin at 0 mg, and 2 mg (high) for the first subject; and 1 mg (low) and 3 mg (high) for the second subject. The next doses will be between 0-80 mg per side, determined prior to randomization of each subsequent subject. The specific subsequent doses will increase, remain the same, or decrease, determined by the P.I. in consultation with the manufacturer of SKY0402. Doses will always remain within the range of 0-80 mg per side, for a total possible dose of 0-160 mg.</description>
