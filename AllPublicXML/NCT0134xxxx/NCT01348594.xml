    <textblock>
      Infertility is a common and psychologically devastating problem for 20% of Canadian couples.
      Approximately, 20% of infertile couples are diagnosed with unexplained infertility and left
      without an explanation for their inability to have a baby. Pathological uterine receptivity
      and embryo implantation are hypothesized mechanisms underlying sub-fertility in these
      couples. Embryo implantation requires a complicated sequence of events involving the
      differentiation of endometrial cells to attain uterine receptivity and the synchronized
      interaction between maternal and embryonic tissues. Vitamin D has been hypothesized to play a
      role in this poorly understood process. Vitamin D is a known regulator of signal transduction
      pathways involved in embryo implantation and its receptors are involved in calcium-regulation
      in various reproductive tissues including, the ovary, uterus, and placenta. In Canada, the
      prevalence of Vitamin D insufficiency is approximately 34-50%. The goal of the proposed study
      is to determine the prevalence of vitamin D insufficiency in an infertile population and
      whether this prevalence is higher than in average Canadian reproductive age women. More
      importantly, we will investigate whether vitamin D insufficiency in our infertile population
      translates to impaired implantation and reduced clinical pregnancy rates. Insight into
      vitamin D's role in reproduction is essential not only to provide scientific understanding of
      the mechanism underlying embryo implantation, but also because vitamin D supplementation
      could provide an easy and safe means of treating infertility.
