    <textblock>
      The investigators are trying to find new methods to treat prostate cancer. The approach the
      investigators are taking is to try to enhance patients' own immune response against the
      cancer. In this study the investigators will be testing the effectiveness of a vaccine that
      may be able to help the body fight prostate cancer.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Histologic diagnosis of adenocarcinoma of the prostate

          -  Completion of local therapy by surgery and/or ablative radiation therapy at least 3
             months prior to entry, with removal or ablation of all visible disease, including
             seminal vesical and/or local lymph node involvement

          -  Rising prostate specific antigen (PSA) levels without scan evidence of metastatic
             disease

          -  Asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic and life expectancy of at least 4 months

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Small cell or other variant prostate cancer histology

          -  Evidence of immunosuppression

          -  Prior treatment with androgen deprivation except if given neoadjuvantly or adjuvantly
             with radiation therapy or at time of prostatectomy. In this situation, no more than 24
             months of androgen deprivation must have been given and treatment must not have been
             within 12 months prior to screening for this study.

          -  Serum testosterone at screening &lt; 50 ng/dL

          -  Known bone metastases or lymph node involvement as determined by bone scan or computed
             tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen and pelvis within 4 weeks of study entry

          -  Prior vaccine therapy for prostate cancer

          -  Known allergic reactions to granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF)

          -  Severe intercurrent medical conditions or laboratory abnormalities that would impart,
             in the judgment of the Medical Monitor, excess risk associated with study
             participation or study agent administration
