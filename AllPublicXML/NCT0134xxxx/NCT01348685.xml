      To compare the effect of eating solid vs. drinking liquid forms of gelatin, sucrose and its
      component mixtures and whey protein on subjective appetite and food intake in young men.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Three randomized cross-over design experiments were used to compare the effect of solid and
      liquid forms of gelatin (6 g) in experiment 1, sucrose (75 g) and a mixture of 50% glucose/
      50% fructose (G50:F50) in experiment 2, and acid and sweet whey protein (50 g) in experiment
      3 on healthy normal weight males . The controls were water (experiment 1 and 3) and
      calorie-free sweetened water with gelatin (sweet gelatin, experiment 1) or without gelatin
      (sweet control, experiment 2). Subjective average appetite was measured by visual analogue
      scales frequently over 1 h and ad libitum food intake was measured 1 h after the treatment
      consumptions.
