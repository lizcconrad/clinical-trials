  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pre-portioned entrées are commonly consumed to help control portion size and limit energy
      intake. Few studies, however, have investigated the influence of the characteristics of
      pre-portioned entrées on energy intake. This study investigates how the characteristics of
      solid pre-portioned entrées, specifically, variations in their energy content and energy
      density influence energy intake over a day. The investigators hypothesize that reducing the
      energy content and energy density of compulsory entrées will act independently and add
      together to reduce daily energy intake.

      This experiment uses a crossover design with repeated measures within subjects. One day a
      week for four weeks, participants are provided with all of their foods and beverages for
      breakfast, lunch, and dinner meals. Across test days, the entrée at each meal is varied in
      both energy content and energy density between a standard level (100%) and a reduced level
      (64% of the standard). Following consumption of a compulsory entrée, a variety of
      unmanipulated foods will be served for ad libitum consumption. The order of experimental
      conditions is counterbalanced across the subjects.
