      The purpose of this research study is to determine whether partial irradiation of the liver
      and liver cell transplantation can provide help for patients with life-threatening
      liver-based metabolic diseases who are unlikely to survive without extensive medical therapy
      or transplant. The goal of this research study is to determine if liver cell transplants can
      be effective as an alternative to organ transplantation. At the present time, liver cell
      transplants are experimental and have been done in a limited number of human subjects.

    <textblock>
      Management of patients with hepatic failure and liver-based metabolic disorders is complex
      and expensive. Hepatic failure results in impaired coagulation, altered consciousness and
      cerebral function, a heightened risk of multiple organ system failure, and sepsis. Liver
      transplantation is often the only available treatment option for severe, even if transient,
      hepatic failure. Patients with life-threatening liver-based metabolic disorders similarly
      require organ transplantation even though their metabolic diseases are typically the result
      of a single enzyme deficiency, and the liver otherwise functions normally. More than 17,000
      patients currently await liver transplantation in the United States, a number that seriously
      underestimates the number of patients that need treatment, as it has been estimated that more
      than a million patients in the United States could benefit from transplantation.
      Unfortunately, use of whole liver transplantation to treat these disorders is limited by a
      severe shortage of donors and by the risks associated with major surgery. Hepatocyte
      transplantation holds great promise as an alternative to organ transplantation for the
      treatment of liver diseases, and numerous studies in rodents indicate that transplants
      consisting of isolated liver cells can correct various metabolic deficiencies of the liver
      and can reverse hepatic failure. The transplant procedure, which involves injection of
      isolated hepatocytes into the liver through the portal vein, is far less intrusive than
      transplantation of the whole liver and could be performed on severely ill patients with
      relatively low risk. In the presence of normal host liver architecture, the transplanted
      cells integrate into the host liver, providing considerable restorative potential. Because
      the native liver is not removed, the transplanted hepatocytes need only improve some of the
      functions of the failing liver and need not replace all hepatic functions. Although clinical
      trials of hepatocyte transplantation have demonstrated the long-term safety of the procedure,
      only partial correction of metabolic disorders has been achieved, and the degree to which
      donor hepatocytes have restored failing livers has not been adequate to circumvent the need
      for organ replacement.

    <description>Transplantation of hepatocytes into the liver will be through the portal vein. The portal vein will be accessed transhepatically, by umbilical vein, or surgically by a peripheral mesenteric vein.
The subject will be evaluated de novo and if they are a candidate for orthotopic liver transplantation they will receive the transplant. Even if the subject receives the hepatocyte transplant and it does not work, they will be evaluated for orthotopic liver transplantation as if they never received the hepatocyte transplant.
If at 6 months we see an improvement in disease, we will recommend a re-transplantation with a goal of complete correction of disease and until the subject is no longer required to be a candidate for organ transplantation. Subjects will be re-evaluated every 6 months for re-transplantation. Subjects will remain on the waiting list for organ transplantation. Further radiation therapy will not be needed prior to re-transplantation.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients will have life-threatening liver-based metabolic disorders who are candidates
             for organ transplantation where hepatocyte transplantation is considered theoretically
             curative.

          -  In addition to child subjects less than 18 years of age, for purposes of this
             protocol, adults up to age 21 years will be enrolled since this is the upper age limit
             of patients which are seen at Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with liver based metabolic disorders not theoretically treatable with organ
             transplantation.

          -  Subjects who meet any of the following criteria will be excluded from participation in

               2. Subject has allergy to immunosuppression medications that are required post
                  transplant procedure for the prevention of rejection.

               3. Subject has sepsis, pneumonia, other active infection or other secondary
                  life-threatening organ dysfunction.

               4. Significant liver fibrosis determined by biopsy (if clinically indicated).
                  Significant liver fibrosis will be defined by the Ishak Staging, Stage 5: bridges

               5. Subject is pregnant or breastfeeding.
