      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of the Spiracur SNaP® Wound Care System
      for the treatment of skin cancer excision sites and split thickness skin grafts (STSG). The
      secondary purpose will be to compare the prospective patients to retrospectively treated skin
      cancer excision sites and STSGs to further evaluate efficacy and safety.
