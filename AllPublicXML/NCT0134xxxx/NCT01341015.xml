      Objectives:

      A lot of children who injure their ankles come to the emergency department for an evaluation,
      and often an X-ray of the ankle is obtained to determine if a bone fracture is present. In
      more than 85% of cases, however, the injury is a sprain and not a bone fracture and can be
      treated with rest, ice, elevation, and pain medications. X-rays obtained in the emergency
      departments are time consuming, often uncomfortable for the patient, and expose children to
      radiation, the long-term effects of which are not yet fully understand by doctors or
      scientists. Bedside ultrasound is a non-invasive and a non-painful device that does not
      produce radiation. It was been shown to determine the presence of bone fracture in childrens'
      wrists and forearms just as well as X-rays do. In our study, the investigators would like to
      determine if a bedside ultrasound can also be used to evaluate ankle fractures in children.

      Research Procedures:

      In our study, the investigators will ask the parents and children, who are scheduled to get
      an X-ray of their ankle in the emergency department, to examine their ankles with an
      ultrasound machine as well. Since the bedside ultrasound is not significantly time-consuming,
      does not require patients to remain still, and is readily available in the department, the
      procedure will be performed while kids are waiting to get an X-ray, getting registered, or
      awaiting further treatment. On the data collection form, the investigators will document the
      patients' names, birthdates, medical record numbers so that their X-ray results can be
      compared to the ultrasound results for the purpose of the study. The information will be
      stored in a secure cabinet in a locked office. The investigators will also document which
      side is injured, where the patient feels pain and what the ankle looks like to help perform
      the ultrasound. The results of both the ultrasound and X-ray will be documented for each
      patient.
