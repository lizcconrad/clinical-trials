  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to determine if the use of a new type of barbed suture
      material for laparoscopic myomectomy (surgical removal of fibroids) versus the traditional
      approach of suturing with conventional suture material to close the uterine defect once the
      fibroid has been removed, improves surgical outcomes. Specifically, the investigators will
      investigate the effect of barbed suture on operative time, blood loss, adverse post-operative
      events and hospital stay.

    <textblock>
      Although the laparoscopic myomectomy has benefits over the abdominal approach, such as less
      blood loss, less hemoglobin drop post-operatively, decreased post-operative pain and fewer
      overall complications, it is a difficult procedure, which often requires greater operative
      time to perform. In the current climate of attempting to reduce health care expenditures,
      even though the minimally invasive approach offers the advantage of reduced hospital stay, a
      deterrent for hospital administration and surgeons may be the increased operative time it may
      require. Barbed suture is a relatively new material available in gynecologic surgery. Barbs
      are cut into the suture with the barbs facing in a direction opposite that of the needle. The
      barbs allow for anchoring of the suture in tissues, which prevents migration and allows
      suturing without knot tying. This study will be a single-centre non-blinded randomized
      controlled trial comparing laparoscopic myomectomy with barbed suture versus traditional
      suture material.

    <time_frame>Intra-operative</time_frame>
    <description>We will subtract the amount of irrigation fluid used from the total amount of fluid suctioned during the procedure to arrive at an estimated blood loss in millilitres. We will also measure the patient's hemoglobin at the routine pre-operative visit and then on the morning of the first post-operative day to determine the difference in hemoglobin. The amount of intravenous fluids administered to the patients intra- and post-operatively will be documented in order to account for any changes in hemoglobin that are spurious due to fluid administration.</description>

    <intervention_name>Laparoscopic myomectomy with unidirectional barbed suture</intervention_name>
    <description>Patients will be randomized to repair of the uterine defect during laparoscopic myomectomy using unidirectional barbed suture material (V-Loc 180TM, CovidienTM). For patients randomized to the barbed suture arm of the trial, any secondary fibroid that is greater than 5cm intra-operatively (as measured by a laparoscopic measurement instrument) will also be closed with barbed suture material. The cut-off of 5cm will be used, since it is generally above this size when uterine defects need to be closed in multiple layers, making the barbed suture potentially useful. Any other secondary fibroids less than 5cm will be closed with traditional extracorporeal suturing in both arms of the trial, since these can usually be closed in one layer.</description>
