      This is a phase I, open label, prospective, two phase pharmacokinetic study. Subjects
      currently attending for HIV care at St. Mary's Hospital, London will be eligible.

      The study will describe the steady state pharmacokinetic parameters and short term safety of
      maraviroc/darunavir/ritonavir dosed at 150/800/100 mg once daily with and without
      tenofovir/emtricitabine 245/200 mg once daily in HIV-1 infected subjects.

      Fifteen HIV-1 infected subjects will be recruited. Eligible subjects will currently be
      receiving antiretroviral therapy comprising:

        -  tenofovir/emtricitabine 245/200 mg daily plus

        -  darunavir/ritonavir 800/100 mg daily

      On day 1, subjects will modify their current antiretroviral therapy to the following:

        -  tenofovir/emtricitabine 245/200 mg daily plus

        -  darunavir/ritonavir 800/100 mg daily plus

        -  maraviroc 150 mg daily On day 10 subjects will undergo an intensive pharmacokinetic
           visit.

      On day 11, subjects will modify their current antiretroviral therapy to the following:

        -  darunavir/ritonavir 800/100 mg daily plus

        -  maraviroc 150 mg daily (i.e. tenofovir/emtricitabine will be discontinued) On day 20
           subjects will undergo an intensive pharmacokinetic visit. Following completion of this
           study phase, subjects will recommence their usual antiretroviral treatment regimen and
           attend for a study follow up visit.
