    <textblock>
      This study is a multicenter, open label, prospective, single arm trial

      Single arm group; following angiography, eligible patients with unprotected LMCA stenosis
      &gt;50% by visual estimation, which is equally treatable by the both treatment strategy (EES
      stenting or CABG), will be treated with EES
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the PRECOMBAT-2 trial is to establish the safety and effectiveness
      of coronary stenting with the everolimus-eluting Xience V stent (EES) compared with the
      historical control (PRE-COMBAT-1) of bypass surgery and sirolimus-eluting stent (SES) for the
      treatment of an unprotected LMCA stenosis. The primary alternative hypothesis is that the
      experimental starategy (coronary stenting with the everolimus-eluting stents) is not inferior
      to the standard strategy (CABG) or SES.

      All consecutive patients with unprotected LMCA diseases at participating centers, who are
      treated with Xience V stent, will be evaluated for the entry into the study.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. The patient must be at least 18 years of age.

          2. Significant de novo left main stenosis (&gt;50% by visual estimation) with or without any
             additional target lesions (&gt;70% by visual estimation)

          3. Left main lesion and lesions outside LMCA (if present) potentially equally treatable
             with coronary stenting and CABG

          4. Patients with stable (CCS class 1 to 4) or acute coronary syndromes (unstable angina
             pectoris Braunwald class IB, IC, IIB, IIC, IIIB, IIIC or NSTEMI) or patients with
             atypical chest pain or without symptoms but having documented myocardial ischemia
