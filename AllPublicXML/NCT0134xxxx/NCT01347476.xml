      Patients aged 70 years or older had a higher possibility of high risk cancer than younger
      patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients aged 70 years or older had a higher risk of advanced prostate cancer and shorter
      BCR-free survival than younger ones. Definite treatment of clinically localized prostate
      cancer should be actively considered in well-selected healthy patients older than 70 years.
