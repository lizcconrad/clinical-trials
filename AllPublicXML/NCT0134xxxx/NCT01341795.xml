  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Type 2 diabetes have become a major global health problem. Currently, metformin is used as
      first-line therapy in combination with lifestyle changes, and sitagliptin can be added to
      metformin in case of insufficient glycemic control by metformin alone, and fixed-dose
      combination of sitagliptin and metformin is available.

      In clinical practice, inter-individual variations in response to sitagliptin and metformin
      treatment are commonly found, which may reflect inter-patient differences in disposition of
      these medications.

      Sitagliptin and metformin are known as substrates of some transporters (P-gp, OAT3, OCT1 and
      OCT2) and some functional variations of these transporters were reported. This study is
      designed to clarify the effect of these transporter variants on response to sitagliptin and
      metformin in type 2 DM patients.
