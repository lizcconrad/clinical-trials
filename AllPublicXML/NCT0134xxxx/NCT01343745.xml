    <textblock>
      The aim of this exploratory investigation is to evaluate if the Forced Expiratory Volume in
      the 1st second (FEV1) measurements, fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FENO) and Provocative
      Concentration 20 (PC20) after Adenosine Monophosphate (AMP) bronchial challenge evaluated
      after administration of a fixed combination of a Long-acting Beta-2-agonist (LABA) and an
      Inhaled Corticosteroid (ICS) at increasing doses may be suitable to demonstrate a dose
      response.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Male and female patients 18-50 years of age, who have signed an informed consent form.

          2. Clinical evidence of asthma

          3. Steroid naïve asthmatic patients

          4. FEV1 at Screening Visit is &gt;70 % of the predicted value and at least 2.0 L.

          5. Body Mass Index between 18 and 35.

          6. Sensitivity to AMP at Screening Visit.

          7. FENO levels &gt;25 ppb at the Screening Visit

             or interpretation of the study.

          7. Patients with QTc &gt;450msec at the Screening Visit.

             Investigator may be of clinical significance.

         11. Patients who have undergone major surgery in the previous 3 months.

         12. Patients who have had an exacerbation of asthma, requiring treatment with oral
             steroids during the last month prior to Screening Visit.

         13. Patients treated with slow-release corticosteroids 2 months prior to Screening Visit.
