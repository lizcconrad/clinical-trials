  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The marked activity of thalidomide (thal) and dexamethasone (dex) in relapsed and refractory
      multiple myeloma (MM) provided the basis for this phase 2 clinical study aimed at
      investigating the efficacy and toxicity of thal-dex incorporated into melphalan-based double
      autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT)for patients less than 65 years old with newly
      diagnosed symptomatic MM. Thal-dex was given as primary induction therapy and was then
      continued throughout the subsequent treatment phases until the day before the second
      autotransplantation. Primary study endpoints,as evaluated on an intention to treat basis, are
      response rates to the different treatment phases (induction, first and second ASCT), best
      response whenever achieved, duration of response (DOR), time to progression (TTP),
      progression free survival (PFS)and toxicity profile of thal-dex. Secondary endpoints, as
      evaluated on an intention to treat basis, are overall survival (OS) and clinical outcomes
      (DOR, TTP, PFS and OS)according to prognostic factors, including cytogenetic abnormalities
      and imaging features, as detected by 18F-FDG PET/CT.
