  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      GSK2118436 is an orally administered, potent and selective small molecule BRAF inhibitor that
      is being developed for the treatment of BRAF mutation-positive tumors. This is a 4-part study
      (in 4 separate cohorts of subjects) designed to examine the interaction potential of
      GSK2118436, either as a perpetrator (i.e., effect of GSK2118436 on warfarin; Part A) or
      victim (i.e., effect of other drugs on GSK2118436; Part B: ketoconazole and Part C:
      gemfibrozil), as well as to evaluate the single and repeat dose pharmacokinetic parameters of
      GSK2118436 (Part D). A sufficient number of subjects will be screened to obtain approximately
      12 evaluable subjects each for Part A, Part B, Part C and Part D. Following completion of
      this study, subjects may continue dosing with GSK2118436 in the roll-over study, Protocol
      BRF114144.
