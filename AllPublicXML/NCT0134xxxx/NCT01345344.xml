  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study design has two components: 1) a cross sectional assessment of brain connectivity
      and response to pain in healthy controls and demographically matched fibromyalgia patients,
      and 2) a longitudinal assessment of the same outcomes in fibromyalgia patients randomized to
      either CBT (Cognitive Behavioral Therapy) or a Disease Education condition.

      The investigators will evaluate 90 fibromyalgia patients who will receive CBT treatment once
      a week for 8 weeks, for a total of 8 treatments. Baseline data from these patients will be
      compared to results from 30 pain-free controls and 60 education program controls.

      Participants will undergo experimental pain assessments as well as brain neuroimaging.

      Investigators propose to use fMRI (functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging) to study CNS pain
      processing during the anticipation and experience of acute pain in individuals with FM and
      healthy controls. Investigators will recruit patients who are diagnosed with FM as well as
      healthy controls. After the baseline visit, FM participants will be randomly assigned into
      the CBT or control condition (Education). Overall, FM Participants will attend 8 treatment
      visits, and 6 assessment visits (two at baseline, one at mid-treatment, two at the end of
      treatment, and one at 6 months post-treatment). These assessment visits include a total of 3
      fMRI sessions (at baseline, mid-treatment, and end of treatment). Healthy Controls will
      undergo the same baseline procedures as the FM subjects but will not attend any of the
      treatment or follow up assessment visits. Findings from this research will provide important
      information about catastrophizing's CNS (Central Nervous System) correlates.

        Inclusion Criteria for FM patients:

          1. aged 18-65

          2. female

          3. have a clinical diagnosis of fibromyalgia and meet the Wolfe et al 2011 research
             criteria for fibromyalgia

          4. on stable doses of medication prior to entering the study and agree not to change
             medications or dosages (or CAM treatments) during the trial
