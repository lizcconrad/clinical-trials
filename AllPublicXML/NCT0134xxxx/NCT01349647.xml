  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Even when small cell lung cancer responds well to treatment with chemotherapy, it has a
      tendency to grow back and to spread. The investigators are interested in testing new
      therapies aimed at decreasing this risk. This study tests a vaccine, which is a substance
      injected under the skin which can cause an immune response. The hope is that the body will
      make antibodies to the vaccine which will also react against the cancer. The vaccine is
      specific for small cell lung cancer. It combines several components (small cell lung cancer
      targets) that have been tested individually in patients with small cell lung cancer or other
      cancers (GD2, GD3, Globo H, Fucosyl GM1 and N-propionylated polysialic acid). Two other
      substances (KLH and OPT-821) are added which boost the immune system.

      This study will have two groups of patients. The first group will receive the vaccines along
      with one cycle of chemotherapy. The second group will receive the vaccines without
      chemotherapy.
