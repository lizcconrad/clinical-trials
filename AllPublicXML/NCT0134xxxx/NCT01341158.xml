  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The current clinical trial shall clarify the efficacy, safety and biologic effects of
      neoadjuvant treatment with natural interferon-α (Multiferon) in patients with locoregional
      metastases of melanoma in stage IIIB/C.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study is an open label, multicenter phase IIa clinical trial which is designed as a pilot
      project in order to establish the efficacy and tolerability of Multiferon as a neoadjuvant
      treatment of locoregional metastases. Patients will be treated subsequently in cohorts
      characterized by different doses (3 - 9 - 18 MIU) to analyze dosage dependent effects.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Histologically proven cutaneous melanoma

          2. Clinical stage IIIB or IIIC (AJCC 2010)

          3. ≥ 18 years of age

          4. Presence of at least two metastases, not more than 10 metastases, and completely
             resectable

          5. Measurable disease (at least one lesion that can be accurately measured in two
             perpendicular diameters, with both dimensions at least 10 mm x 10 mm for spiral CT and
             5 mm x 5 mm for locoregional metastases assessed by ultrasound or digital photography)

          6. ECOG performance status of 0/1

          7. Patients with previous adjuvant recombinant interferon-α treatment of any dose are
             eligible if (i) treatment was stopped at least 1 month before start of treatment and
             (ii) no progression occurred during interferon-α treatment.

          8. No childbearing potential or negative pregnancy test within 14 days before inclusion
             in women with child bearing potential Women with childbearing potential must be using
             an effective method of contraception (Pearl-Index &lt; 1, e.g. oral contraceptives, other
             hormonal contraceptives [vaginal products, skin patches, or implanted or injectable
             products], or mechanical products such as an intrauterine device or barrier methods
             [diaphragm, spermicides]) throughout the study and for up to 3 months after the last
             dose of investigational product, in such a manner that the risk of pregnancy is
