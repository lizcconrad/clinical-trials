      The purpose of this study is to determine if the Oragene.RNA kit is able to detect HIV RNA in
      saliva.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There is an important need for a rapid, non-invasive, sensitive and specific method for
      detection of HIV RNA, particularly in clinical settings in which patients at risk for HIV
      exposure are assessed and screened. A rapid and non-invasive method for quantitative testing
      of HIV RNA would be also valuable to monitor suppression of HIV RNA as a primary surrogate
      marker of combination antiretroviral therapy efficacy. An Ottawa-based biotech company (DNA
      Genotek Inc) has developed and sells to research and clinical labs world-wide a kit (Oragene�
      DNA Self-collection kit) that permits the collection, stabilization at room temperature, and
      purification of DNA present in saliva. They have recently developed a kit (Oragene��RNA) that
      is purported to stabilize RNA in saliva, a non-invasive source of a biological fluid.
