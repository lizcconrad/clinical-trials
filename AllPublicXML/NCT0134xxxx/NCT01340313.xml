    <textblock>
      Caudal block is the world-widely used technique for an effective postoperative analgesia in
      children undergoing OPD-based infra-umbilical surgery. Because the caudal block is usually
      performed with a single-shot, proper dosage is required to achieve sufficient analgesic
      levels. Several clinical researches have been performed to assess the drug spread levels
      using mathematical equation, X-ray evaluation, and ultrasonography during caudal block in
      children. In our previous study using fluoroscopy, we obtained the results that the
      established weight-based doses provided adequate block levels for each type of surgery.

      Ultrasonography is precise tool to evaluate the spinal structures and can provide estimated
      information in real time during caudal or epidural block in children.

      The aim of this study is to evaluate the drug spread level with a weight-based doses using
      ultrasonography during caudal block in children and assess the reliability of the real time
      ultrasonography to determine the drug spread levels. After general anesthesia, the patient
      will be placed in lateral decubitus position for caudal block. Total 1.5 ml/kg of 0.15%
      ropivacaine will be injected into the caudal space. The spread level will be step-wise
      evaluated using ultrasonography at the injected drug dose of 0.5 ml/kg, 1.0 ml/kg, 1.25
      ml/kg, and 1.5 ml/kg.
