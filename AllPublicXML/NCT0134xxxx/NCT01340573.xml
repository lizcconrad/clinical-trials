  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a non-interventional study designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of
      combination study drugs in the treatment of participants diagnosed with Chronic Hepatitis C
      (CHC). CHC participants with confirmed positive hepatitis-C virus (HCV) RNA in plasma, and
      who have not been previously treated with the Pegylated interferon (PegIntron) Pen, were
      enrolled into study.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Participants with positive genotype-1 HCV RNA received 48 weeks of treatment of PegIntron Pen
      plus ribavirin and 24 weeks of follow-up. Participants who were non-genotype-1 HCV RNA
      positive received 24 weeks of treatment of PegIntron Pen plus ribavirin and 24 weeks of
      follow-up. Participants were asked to complete a questionnaire to measure the satisfaction
      and the use of training materials of PegIntron pen using a 1-5 score system provided in the
      questionnaire. The questionnaire was completed once at first follow-up visit. Efficacy
      measurements for sustained viral response HCV RNA was collected at week-24 of treatment and
      at week-24 of follow-up in positive Non-genotype-1 HCV RNA participants. Efficacy
      measurements for sustained viral response HCV RNA was collected at week-24 and at week-48 of
      treatment, and at week-24 of follow-up, for positive Genotype-1 HCV RNA participants.
