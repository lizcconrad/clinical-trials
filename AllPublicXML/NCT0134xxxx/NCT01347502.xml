    <textblock>
      Using smartphone is increasing in hospital with various purpose and it has more extended
      surface than non-smart phone. Therefore investigators can consider the bacterial
      contamination rate of smartphone will be higher than that of non-smartphone.

      Hospital-acquired infections(HAI) are causing grave concern in almost all the hospitals of
      the world and causing increased morbidity and mortalities.

      The transmission of HAI occurs through hospital staff and inanimate hospital environment,
      equipment, and devices that the hospital staff use.Recently, cellphones (CP) were blamed to
      cause nosocomial infections.

      The mobile phones are used routinely all day long but not cleaned properly, as health care
      workers' may do not wash their hands as often as they should. The aim of the present study
      was to evaluate the prevalence of bacterial contamination of mobile phones in ICU health care
      providers. and especially compare the contamination rate between smartphone and
      non-smartphone.

      Using smartphone is increasing in hospital with various purpose and it has more extended
      surface than non-smart phone. therefore we can consider the bacterial contamination rate of
      smartphone will be higher than that of non-smartphone.
