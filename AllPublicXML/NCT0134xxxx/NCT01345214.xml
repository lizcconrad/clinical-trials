  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of ONO-7746
      across multiple doses in patients with solid tumors and chemotherapy induced thrombocytopenia
      (CIT) scheduled to receive at least two cycles of myelosuppressive chemotherapy on Day 1
      every 21 days at the same dosages and schedule in the study. The secondary objectives are to
      characterize the PK profiles of ONO-7746 and to explore the pharmacodynamic effect of
      ONO-7746 on CIT.
