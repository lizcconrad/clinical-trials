    <textblock>
      Permanent cardiac pacemakers have represented a contraindication to Magnetic Resonance
      Imaging (MRI). Strong static, gradient and radiofrequency fields used for MRI are thought to
      be detrimental to pacemaker function and possibly cause harm to patients undergoing MRI
      examinations. A previous study has shown that MRI is indicated in 17% of all patients with
      pacemakers within 12 months of device placement , which demonstrates the need of practical,
      safe approach for performing MRI on pacemaker patients. A new Reply MR-conditional pacing
      system is developed by Sorin Group for safe use in the MRI environment. The new pacing system
      is composed by the Reply pacemaker and the Filtrea bradycardia pacing leads. This study
      intends to demonstrate the safety and the efficacy in the MRI environment of the Sorin Group
      Reply MR-conditional pacing system.
