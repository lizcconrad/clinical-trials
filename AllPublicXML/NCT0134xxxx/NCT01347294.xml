      The purpose of this study is to determine the effectiveness of bleomycin, fibrovein and
      bleomycin and fibrovein in the treatment of venous malformation.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with scanty symptoms from their vascular malformation can do well with conservative
      treatment and / or with aids and adaptations in daily life. Compression therapy (elastic
      stockings), pain medication and good counseling is adequate for many. Patients with
      significant symptoms, however, may require more invasive treatment. Previously, it was common
      with surgical removal, but serious sequelae and frequent recurrence after surgery resulted in
      caution. Today it is more common with intervention radiology treatment with injection of
      sclerosing agents into existing malformation. This type of therapy almost always requires
      repeated treatment sequences, sometimes over several months. Treatment aims to seal blood
      vessels in the malformation and / or make the patient as possible symptoms. Recurrence occurs
      frequently and there are many who are not completely free from symptoms. Many patients have
      chronic problems with pain, wounds, bleeding and / or they have a cosmetically disfiguring
      condition. Predicting the performance of a specific type of treatment can be very difficult.

      Until now, there are some studies that have considered the effect of bleomycin /
      pingyangmycin (China) and ethanol in the treatment of vascular malformations. To our
      knowledge there is no prospective or retrospective studies that compare the efficacy and side
      effects of bleomycin and sodium tetradecyl sulfate (Fibrovein â„¢) in the treatment of VM.
