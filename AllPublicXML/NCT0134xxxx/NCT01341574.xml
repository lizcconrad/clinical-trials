  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      'Unilateral neglect' is a disorder that occurs regularly after stroke. It is caused by right-
      as well as left-sided brain lesions, but more often by right-sided lesions. Patients with
      this disorder neglect the contralesional side of space and/or their body. Their body axis is
      often shifted ipsilesionally. A specific disorder that can appear in neglect patients is
      'contraversive pushing': a postural deviation to the neglected side because the patient
      pushes himself away from the ipsi- to the contralesional side.

      One of the most promising neglect interventions is prism adaptation (PA): inducing an optical
      shift of the visual field by means of prism glasses. This results in a modulation of brain
      areas involved in neglect and in an improvement of the neglect symptoms and postural
      deviation.

      Research questions:

        1. Which period is best suited to maximize therapeutic effects? In this respect the effects
           of early and delayed PA will be compared, regarding neglect-, postural and cerebral
           measures.

        2. Which factors lead to a less favorable treatment outcome or to therapy resistance for
           PA?

        3. Will the impact of PA be larger if postural factors are taken into account in the prism
           therapy?

    <description>The effect of Prism Adaptation (PA) will be evaluated regarding the degree of neglect, postural control and cerebral functioning, briefly after the therapy cycle and 3 months later. Briefly after the PA sessions and three months later, in patients in the early as well as the delayed phase after stroke:
early: PA starting within 4 weeks after stroke;
delayed: PA starting 2 months after stroke;
OR divided in an early and a delayed group according to the median.</description>
