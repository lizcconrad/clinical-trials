    <textblock>
      M12-778 is a rising multiple dose, randomized, double blind, placebo controlled single center
      study. It will have 5 dose groups of 20 subjects in dose groups 1,2 and 3 and 24 subjects in
      dose groups 4 and 5; a total of 84 subjects . There will be a 7 day period between dose
      groups 1,2 and 3 to assess the safety of increasing to the next dose. Dose groups of 4 and 5
      will be run in parallel. Subjects will be confined in center for 20 days for dose groups 1,2
      and 3 and 33 days for dose groups 4 and 5.

        Inclusion Criteria

          1. Serum total testosterone &lt; 300 ng/dL based on two blood samples obtained between 6 and
             10 AM on two separate occasions at least 48 hours apart. Previously documented total
             testosterone results obtained within 6 weeks of Study Day -2 may be used during
             screening for subjects not currently on androgen replacement therapy, or following
             washout of androgen replacement therapy.

          2. Subjects na√Øve to androgen replacement or washout of 12 weeks following intramuscular
             androgen injections; 4 weeks following topical or buccal androgens; and 3 weeks
             following oral androgens. Washout should be completed by Study Day -2.

          3. Subject is judged to be in good general health as determined by the principal
             investigator based upon the results of a medical history, physical examination, vital
             signs, laboratory profile and a 12 lead electrocardiogram (ECG) performed at
             Screening.

          4. Must voluntarily sign and date each informed consent, approved by an Institutional
             Review Board (IRB), prior to the initiation of any screening or study-specific
             procedures.

        Exclusion Criteria

          1. History of significant sensitivity or allergy to any drug, including androgens, castor
             oil or product excipients.

          2. Previous history or current or suspected prostate or breast cancer, and/or previous
             history of cancer (except basal cell carcinoma of the skin).

          3. Subjects not on a stable medication regimen for at least three months for the
             treatment of a chronic condition such as hypertension, hyperlipidemia or diabetes
             mellitus.

          4. Use of known inhibitors (e.g., ketoconazole) or inducers (e.g., dexamethasone,
             phenytoin, rifampin, carbamazepine) of cytochrome P450 3A (CYP3A) within 30 days prior
             to study drug administration and through the end of the study.

          5. Use of any drug within 5 half-lives of the last dose in the past 6 months prior to
             Study Day -2 without principal investigator and/or sponsor approval.

          6. Receipt of any drug by injection within 30 days or 10 half-lives (which ever is
             longer) prior to study drug administration without principal investigator and/or
             sponsor approval.
