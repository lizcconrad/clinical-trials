      The objective of the study is to evaluate the effect of LipoCol Forte® Capsules on the
      pharmacokinetics of nifedipine after administering single-dose combination to healthy
      subjects using a 2x2 crossover design.

      Healthy subjects were randomly allocated to receive a single dose of either one 5 milgram
      (mg) nifedipine capsule or one 5 milgram (mg) nifedipine capsule plus one 600 milgram (mg)
      red yeast rice capsule; after 7-day washout period, they received a single dose of the
      alternative drug. The subjects were fasted at least 10 hour before dosing. The
      investigational products were administered with 240 milliliter (mL) of water with the subject
      in an upright position. The blood samples were collected at prior to the drug administration
      (T0), and 0.167, 0.333, 0.500, 0.750, 1, 1.25, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 14, 16 and 24
      hours after dosing.
