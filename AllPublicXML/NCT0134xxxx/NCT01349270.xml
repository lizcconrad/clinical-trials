  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Treatment of Chronic Inflammatory Demyelinating Polyneuropathy (CIDP) is a challenge because
      disease may generate important disability in patients including young adults. Randomized
      trials showed that corticosteroids, plasma exchanges and intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg)
      can reduce impairment on a short term period but the treatment of a chronic disease doesn't
      agree with it. Corticosteroids and IVIg are the first line CIDP treatments. No study permits
      to demonstrate the superiority of one treatment to the other. Long term adverse effects of
      corticosteroids and IVIg cost are the respective limitation of their use. The investigators
      scheduled to recruit 40 CIDP patients in 23 French centres to receive either 0,8mg/kg/day of
      prednisone progressively tapered over 6 months or a monthly 2g/kg cure of IVIg during 6
      months. Patients will be followed during 6 months after the treatment.
