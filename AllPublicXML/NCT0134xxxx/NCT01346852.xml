    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the predictive ability of three asthma risk markers:
      the ratio of controller medication to total asthma medication, an albuterol only marker, and
      an oral corticosteroid use marker, as well as to compare the precision of these tools between
      adult and pediatric patient populations. This retrospective longitudinal analysis will use 2
      different databases: a large managed care database and a large fee for service Medicaid
      database.

    <description>The ratio of controller medication (CM) to total asthma medication (AM), which is well established in predicting future asthma events in adults, was calculated as the ratio of the units of CMs used during the defined period divided by the sum of the units of CMs plus the units of inhaled short-acting beta-agonists used during the same period. A CM is defined as any inhaled corticosteroid containing medication, methylxanthines, leukotriene receptor antagonists, or cromolyn sodium. The ratio is calculated using all CM. Asthma controllers are medications used to treat asthma on a regular basis.</description>
