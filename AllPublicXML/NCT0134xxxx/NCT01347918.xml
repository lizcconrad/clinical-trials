    <textblock>
      The aim of this project is to demonstrate and validate the ionizing radiation free and non
      invasive assessment of small intestinal anatomy, content and function in healthy and disease
      by a newly developed combined proton (1H) and fluorine (19F) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
      framework. Meal induced and pathology related alterations in small intestinal motor activity,
      gas distribution and anatomy of healthy volunteers and patients with irritable bowel syndrome
      (IBS) will be analyzed with this non invasive MRI approach.

      The multinuclear imaging framework consists of a 1H and 19F capable clinical 3T MRI system
      with standard 1H abdominal surface coils, a dual-channel transmit-receive abdominal 19F
      surface coil, fluorine labelled impermeable and biocompatible capsules for oral
      administration (19F capsule) and a 19F projection imaging sequence allowing for the
      non-invasive detection of the gastrointestinal positions of single and multiple ingested
      capsules in real time. Dedicated post-processing algorithms are applied to extract parameters
      of intestinal motor activity from the detected intraluminal capsule movements.

      The proposed unique imaging modality allows for the concurrent, non invasive and repeated
      analysis of important physiologic parameters of intestinal function together with detailed
      anatomical information and thus presents an ideal tool for the evaluation of the analyzed
      parameters as potential biomarkers in IBS.

        The healthy controls will be selected from among students and volunteers that have
        responded to advertisments in local notice boards of the Zurich University Hospital and the
        University of Zurich, as well as in an email newsletter (&quot;Mediflash&quot;) of the Medical
        Student Organisation.

        The IBS patients are selected from the patient population seen in the Klinik and Polyklink
        f√ºr Innere Medizin at the University Hopsital Zurich.
