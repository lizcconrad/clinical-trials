      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of intranasally administered
      civamide nasal solution in the prevention of cluster headaches during an episodic cluster
      headache period.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a double-blind, randomized, vehicle-controlled, parallel-group, multi-center, phase
      III efficacy and safety study of civamide nasal solution 0.01% in the prevention of cluster
      headaches during an episodic cluster headache period. Approximately 180 subjects (about 90
      per treatment group),will be enrolled and randomized to double-blind treatment with either
      civamide nasal solution 0.01% or vehicle solution at approximately 50 study sites with about
      2-5 subjects randomized per enrolling site.

      This study consists of four periods beginning with a Screening Period, lasting for a minimum
      of 1 day to a maximum of 12 months, during which a subject previously diagnosed with episodic
      cluster headaches is not experiencing cluster headaches and is awaiting the onset of their
      next episodic cluster headache period and subsequent enrollment. The Screening Period is
      followed by a 31-day study, consisting of a 3-day Baseline Period which may begin with the
      onset of an episodic cluster headache period and ends on the day prior to initiating
      treatment (Day -1). Subjects return for Visit 2 (Day 1, Pre-Dose) and the Treatment Period
      begins, consisting of seven (7) days of double-blind treatment. The Treatment Period is
      immediately followed by a twenty-one (21) day Post-Treatment Observation Period.
