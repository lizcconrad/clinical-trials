  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Adhesive bridges are becoming popular in patients with congenitally missing teeth and these
      are type of bridges that can be done with only minimal or with no preparation to replace the
      missing tooth/teeth. The best clinical gain is the minimal tooth preparation or no need for
      the removal of tooth substance. Treatment for this type of bridges does not usually require
      anaesthesia. In addition, adhesive bridges can provide reasonable aesthetical outcome with
      minimal cost and reduced chair time.

      The biggest issue is that high failure rate in the long term, and gray colour shining through
      the metal wing cemented onto the abutment tooth. This can compromise the aesthetical outcome.
      The aesthetical problem can be solved by the use of zirconia all ceramic material to
      construct the bridge.

    <time_frame>5 Years</time_frame>
    <description>Evaluation of clinical survival: participants will be evaluated according to the modified USPHS criteria. The evaluation criteria will include: retention, framework fracture, veneering fracture, marginal adaptation, recurrent caries and colour match. The examination will be after one to two weeks, after 3, 6, 9, 12 and 18 months, 2, 3, 4 and 5 years. The evaluation will also include the biological complication. Plaque, gingival index, periodontal probing depth and gingival recession will be evaluated around the abutments and compared to a control tooth</description>
