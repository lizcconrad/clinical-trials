  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This retrospective study will analyse all PCR-proven H1N1 cases from the influenza season
      2009/2010 treated within the styrian &quot;LKH hospital network&quot;. For this purpose all
      PCR-positive case files are reviewed in Medocs (electronic patients database) and data
      regarding clinical presentation, laboratory and radiological findings, treatment, outcome and
      preexisting underlying chronic illnesses will be systematically collected. In a second step
      the same data collection will be performed in a group of PCR-negative patients, which were
      tested during the influenza season 2009/2010 for influenza-like illness. The data from the
      PCR-positive group will be compared to the data from the PCR-negative group. We expect
      significant differences between the proven and unproven group regarding the primary
      presentation at hospital. Based on these results a clinical score will be developed. This
      score should improve H1N1 case identification in emergency departments, even if specific
      diagnostic test are negative (rapid antigen testing) or still pending (PCR), reduce the
      number of missed hospitalized H1N1 infection and optimize the decision making process in
      emergency departments regarding which patient has to be admitted with infection control
      measures and which not, and as infection control measures are expensive (face masks, gloves)
      and limited (isolation room), such a score should also reduce unnecessary expense. To
      evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of the score a prospective study will follow in the
      influenza season 2010/2011.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Inclusion criteria:

               1. All patients tested for influenza illness by PCR of respiratory tract specimens
                  at the Institute of Hygiene, Karl-Franzens-University Graz, and at the Institute
                  for Hospital Hygiene and Microbiology, KAGES Graz.

               2. Stratification according to the following definition:

          -  PCR-negative influenza-like illness (ILI) is defined as febrile illness tested by PCR
             for the presence of influenza infection but finally not proved as influenza infection.

          -  Influenza illness is defined as febrile illness confirmed by positive PCR as true
             influenza infection.
