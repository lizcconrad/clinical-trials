  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Prospective studies concerning diet and male fertility are lacking. Observational studies
      suggest that a diet rich in fruits, vegetables and meats may be associated with higher sperm
      counts. The investigators wanted to see if a &quot;paleolithic diet&quot; consisting of meat, fish,
      fruits vegetables and nuts and lacking grains, legumes and dairy products can improve sperm
      counts.
