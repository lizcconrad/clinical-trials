      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety of study drug PLX3397 at 3 dose levels
      (800 mg/day, 1000 mg/day, and 1200 mg/day) and explore the efficacy in patients with relapsed
      or refractory acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Additional dose levels beyond 1200 mg/day may be
      considered based on safety and efficacy observations.

      Protocol PLX108-05 is a Phase 1/2 open-label, sequential dose escalation (Part 1) followed by
      cohort expansion (Part 2) design at the recommended phase 2 dose established in Part 1 (i.e.
      3,000 mg/day). Treatment with PLX3397 will consist of continuous oral administration in
      28-day cycles until unacceptable or dose-limiting toxicity, disease progression or relapse,
      patient death, Investigator decision, or voluntary withdrawal.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Male or female patients ≥18 years old.

          -  Morphologically documented primary AML, prior-chemotherapy-related AML or AML
             secondary to an antecedent hematologic disorder (e.g., Myelodysplastic Syndrome) as
             defined by WHO criteria, confirmed by pathology review. For Cohort Expansion Phase
             (Part 2) only: Bone marrow involvement is required.

          -  Have either relapsed or refractory AML, or who have newly diagnosed Flt3-ITD positive
             AML but either refuse or are considered by the Investigator not to be an appropriate
             candidate for standard chemotherapy.

               1. Relapsed disease is defined as the reappearance of leukemia cells in the bone
                  marrow or peripheral blood or elsewhere in the body (other tissues/organs) after
                  the attainment of a CR.

               2. Refractory disease is defined by the failure to obtain a complete remission (CR)
                  with a HDAC-containing or a standard induction regimen. Patients who require two
                  cycles of induction therapy to attain a first CR are not considered to have
                  refractory disease.

          -  Positive for Flt3-ITD activating mutations during Screening. Local laboratory results
             must be received prior to enrollment. Patients with a history of Flt3-ITD positive
             disease may be considered after discussion with the Medical Monitor.

          -  ECOG performance status of 0, 1, or 2.

          -  Adequate recovery (to at least Grade 1) from toxicity of prior therapy as follows:

               1. ≥2 weeks for cytotoxic therapy (except hydroxyurea, which is permitted at doses
                  of ≤5g/day during the first 2 weeks of Cycle 1) prior to C1D1.

               2. ≥4 half-lives for non-cytotoxic therapy prior to C1D1. Patients must have a
                  wash-out period from their last chemotherapy of either ≥2 weeks OR at least 4
                  half-lives prior to C1D1. For patients whose most recent anti-tumor treatment
                  regimen consisted of a multi-agent cocktail, the patient must have a wash-out
                  period of at least 4 half-lives of the agent with the longest half-life.

          -  Adequate hepatic and renal function

               1. Adequate renal function, defined as Creatinine Clearance &gt;60 mL/min or serum
                  creatinine of ≤ 1.3 mg/dL (115 μM).

               2. Adequate hepatic function, defined as AST and ALT ≤3.0X ULN and serum direct
                  bilirubin ≤1.5X ULN. Exceptions may be made for patients with elevated liver
                  transaminases secondary to AML after discussion with the Medical Monitor

          -  Life expectancy of at least 1 month

          -  Willing and able to provide written informed consent prior to any study related
             procedures and to comply with all study requirements and for 3 months after last dose.

          -  Women of child-bearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test within 7 days of
             initiation of dosing and must agree to use two acceptable methods of birth control
             while on study drug and for 3 months after the last dose. Women of non-childbearing
             potential may be included if they meet at least one of the following criteria:

               1. Surgically sterile

               2. Have been postmenopausal for ≥1 year

               3. Have FSH levels indicative of postmenopausal state (i.e., 30-120 IU/L) documented
                  within 21 days of C1D1.

        Sexually active men must also agree to use an acceptable method of birth control while on
        study drug and for at least 3 months after the last dose

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Diagnosis of acute promyelocytic leukemia

          -  Diagnosis of chronic myelogenous leukemia in blast crisis

          -  Presence of CNS involvement of leukemia. Patients with a history of CNS involvement
             may be considered after discussion with the Medical Monitor

          -  Patients eligible for HSCT at the time of screening. However, patients who meet one or
             both of the following criteria may be eligible for study participation:

               1. Patients who are eligible for HSCT but with non-optimal AML disease control
                  (i.e., blasts &gt; 5%) may be enrolled into this study as a bridge-to-transplant.

               2. Patients with relapsed disease following a prior HSCT may be enrolled into this
                  study as an alternative to a second HSCT or as a bridge-to-transplant regimen.

          -  For both Parts 1 and 2, receipt of HSCT within 60 days of the first dose of PLX3397 is
             an exclusion criterion. Patients on immunosuppressive therapy post HSCT, or with
             clinically significant graft-versus-host disease are excluded from Part 1. (Use of
             topical steroids for ongoing skin GVHD is permitted). Patients for Part 1 must have a
             wash-out period of ≥2 weeks or at least 4 half-lives from their last systemic
             immunosuppressive treatment for GVHD. Patients for Part 2 may be receiving systemic
             immunosuppressive treatment for management of GVHD at the time of screening and
             enrollment

          -  Investigational drug use within 28 days of the first dose of PLX3397

          -  For Cohort Expansion Phase (Part 2) only: Patients who are positive for the D835
             mutation at Screening are excluded.

          -  A concurrent active cancer that requires non-surgical therapy (e.g., chemotherapy,
             radiation, adjuvant therapy). Prior history of other cancer is allowed, as long as
             there is no active disease within 1 year of the first dose of PLX3397.

          -  Refractory nausea and vomiting, malabsorption, biliary shunt significant bowel
             resection, GVHD affecting the gut, or any other condition that would preclude adequate
             absorption

          -  Patients with serious illnesses, uncontrolled infection, medical conditions, or other
             medical history including abnormal laboratory results, which in the investigator's
             opinion would be likely to interfere with a patient's participation in the study, or
             with the interpretation of the results

          -  Women of child-bearing potential who are pregnant or breast feeding

          -  At Screening, QTcF &gt;450 msec for males; QTcF &gt;470 msec for females

          -  Patients with a history of D835 mutations
