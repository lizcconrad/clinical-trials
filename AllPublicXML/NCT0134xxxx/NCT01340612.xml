  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The STAT trial aims at comparing coiling versus coiling plus stenting in patients with
      aneurysms prone to recurrence, that is large aneurysms or recurring aneurysms after previous
      coiling or wide-necked aneurysms. The primary hypothesis is that the use of stenting in
      addition to coiling decreases the recurrence rate from 33% to 20% at 12 months as compared to
      coiling alone.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  All patients presenting at least one aneurysm candidate for coiling, with large
             (≥10mm), wide-necked (&gt;4mm), or recurrent lesions after coiling (but not stenting) and
             judged by the neurovascular team to require elective treatment provided that this
             single lesion, and no other aneurysm, will be treated during the endovascular session
             to be the object of the trial

          -  The anatomy of the lesion is such that endovascular treatment is judged possible with
             or without stenting

          -  The endovascular physician is a priori content to use either type of technique

          -  The patient has not previously been randomized into the trial

          -  Treatment is elective

          -  Patient is 18 or older

          -  Life expectancy is more than 2 years

          -  Patient has given fully informed consent and has signed consent form

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Other aneurysms requiring treatment during the same session

          -  Patients with associated cerebral arteriovenous malformations

          -  Patients with recently ruptured aneurysms

          -  When parent vessel occlusion is the primary intent of the procedure

          -  Any absolute contraindication to endovascular treatment, angiography, or anesthesia
             such as severe allergies to contrast or medications, including ASA and Clopidogrel

          -  Patients with recurring, previously stented aneurysms
