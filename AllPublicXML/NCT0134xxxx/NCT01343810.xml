  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to better understand the potential value of reducing stress to
      ameliorate a cluster of biological and behavioral factors implicated in cardiovascular
      disease (CVD) risk. These factors include psychological distress, poor sleep quality, and
      exaggerated physiological responses to emotional stress. Results will be used to develop an
      innovative brief intervention to reduce risk for CVD by improving sleep quality, ameliorating
      psychological distress, and attenuating stress physiology.

      This study will be conducted among 200 men and women participating in 8-week
      Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) classes at Duke Integrative Medicine in Durham,
      North Carolina. The central hypothesis of this NIH-funded clinical trial (R00 AT004945, PI:
      Greeson) is that mindfulness meditation training is associated with increased levels of
      mindfulness and improved cognitive-emotional functioning that, together, are associated with
      reduced psychological distress, improved sleep quality, and less exaggerated physiological
      responses to emotional stress, including blood pressure and inflammation. This study is
      designed to examine psychological and biological mechanisms that may explain individual
      differences in MBSR outcomes. This knowledge is important because it will help us better
      understand who is most likely to benefit from mindfulness meditation training, and why. The
      results from this study are expected to elucidate mechanisms underlying the mental and
      physical health benefits of stress reduction, which can help guide clinicians in referring
      the most suitable patients to local MBSR programs.

    <description>The MBSR program consists of 8 weekly classes that last for 2.5 hours each and a commitment to daily meditation practice for the duration of the course. Classes include didactic instruction on mindfulness and its relationship to stress and health, guided meditation practices, and group discussion. Mindfulness meditation practices include awareness of breathing, awareness of emotions, body scan, mindful hatha yoga, mindful walking, mindful eating, mindful listening, and lovingkindness (metta). Participants are expected to practice formal meditation outside of class for 20-45 min per day, 6 days per week. In addition, participants are encouraged apply mindfulness to everyday activities like eating, communicating with others, and hobbies. Written materials and audio CDs with guided meditations and yoga are provided. The course also includes one full day (7-hours) of meditation on a Saturday following the 6th week of class.</description>
