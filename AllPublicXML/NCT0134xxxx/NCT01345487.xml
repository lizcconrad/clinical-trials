  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      New Nordic diet guidelines advocate a reduction in consumption of protein from animal sources
      such as beef and pork, due to environmental concerns. Instead, intake of protein from
      vegetable sources such as legumes and pulses should be increased. However, little is known
      about the effect of protein from (Nordic grown) beans and peas on body weight and appetite
      regulation.

      The objective of this study is to examine if protein from vegetable sources (beans and peas)
      is comparable to protein from animal sources regarding acute meal-induced satiety.

      Design:

      Single-blind randomized 3-way crossover meal study

      Subjects:

        -  48 young healthy men (Age: 18-50 years; BMI: 19-30 kg/m2).

        -  Expected completers: n=42.

      End points:

        -  Subjective appetite (VAS) (every 30 min for 3 hours)

        -  Ad libitum energy intake (3 hours after test meal)

      Experimental diets:

      Iso-caloric breakfast meals (3.5 MJ) with same energy density:

      A. Fava beans + Split peas (20 protein E%) B. Fava beans + Split peas + potato (10 protein
      E%) C. Pork/beef + potato (20 protein E%)
