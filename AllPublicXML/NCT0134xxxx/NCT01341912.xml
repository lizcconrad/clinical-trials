    <time_frame>up to 3 years</time_frame>
    <description>The efficacy of human-cl rhFVIII will be determined using a 4 point efficacy assessment scale.
After each infusion of IMP and at the end of a BE, the following efficacy assessment is made by the subject (together with the Investigator in case of on-site treatment):
Excellent: Abrupt pain relief and/or unequivocal improvement in objective signs of bleeding within approximately 8 hours after a single infusion.
Good: Definite pain relief and/or improvement in signs of bleeding within approximately 8 - 12 hours after an infusion requiring up to 2 infusions for complete resolution.
Moderate: Probable or slight beneficial effect within approximately 12 hours after the first infusion requiring more than two infusions for complete resolution.
None: No improvement within 12 hours, or worsening of symptoms, requiring more than 2 infusions for complete resolution.
The assessment was made at the end of a BE in case more than one infusion was needed.</description>

      <pi_employee>Principal Investigators are NOT employed by the organization sponsoring the study.</pi_employee>
      <restrictive_agreement>Octapharma agreements may vary with individual investigators, but will not prohibit any investigator from publishing. Octapharma supports the publication of results from all centers of a multi-center trial but requests that reports based on single-site data not precede the primary publication of the entire clinical trial. Octapharma also reserves the right to review data prior to publishing and provide comments/changes within a certain time period</restrictive_agreement>
    </certain_agreements>
    <limitations_and_caveats>Only 3 patients participated in the study and all 3 patients withdrew consent prematurely. Therefore the results are summarized descriptively only.</limitations_and_caveats>
