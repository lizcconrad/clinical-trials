  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The prevalence of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) in patients admitted to the hospital is
      likely significantly higher than the general population as hospitalized patients carry a high
      prevalence of co-morbid conditions, such as diabetes and cardiovascular diseases, that are
      commonly associated with OSA. The true prevalence of OSA in hospitalized patients is not
      known, though there is limited data suggesting that the rate of OSA in hospitalized patients
      is indeed high. Two studies have reported on the rate of polysomnographic (PSG) diagnosis of
      OSA in patients referred for OSA evaluation while in-hospital. These studies reported
      frequencies of 77% (in a retrospective study of 100 patients) and 88-100% (in an
      observational study of 250 patients). Similarly, 2 studies evaluated the prevalence of sleep
      disordered breathing in patients admitted with acutely decompensated heart failure, finding
      frequencies of sleep apnea in 97% (prospective study of 29 patients studied with PSG) and 75%
      (prospective study of 395 consecutive patients studied with portable monitors). However, all
      of these studies are limited by either study design (retrospective), small numbers, limited
      channel portable monitoring, or evaluations of highly select patient populations.
      Furthermore, none of these studies examined screening tools that may help to identify which
      patients are at risk for OSA and thus might require the more extensive and expensive
      objective testing.

      This study will test the following hypotheses:

        1. The prevalence of OSA in unselected hospitalized medical patients will be more than 50%
           of the study population.

           Specific Aim 1: To determine the prevalence of OSA in a group of unselected hospitalized
           medical patients by a combination of sleep symptoms and PSG performed while in-hospital.

        2. Screening tools will be able to accurately identify OSA in hospitalized medical
           patients.

      Specific Aim 2: To determine the accuracy of different screening questionnaires for the
      diagnosis of OSA in hospitalized medical patients by comparing the questionnaire results to
      that of a PSG performed while in-hospital.
