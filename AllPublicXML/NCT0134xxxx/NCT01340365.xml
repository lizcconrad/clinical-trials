  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To evaluate the effects of Tai Chi—a mind-body exercise--on age-related loss of physiological
      complexity (using fractal and entropy based measures), and to understand the relationship
      between complexity, function and adaptability, we will conduct a two-arm prospective
      randomized clinical trial. Our overarching goal is to evaluate if six months of Tai Chi
      training, compared to a waitlist control receiving standard medical care, can enhance
      physiological complexity and adaptability in older Tai Chi-naïve adults. Secondary goals of
      the study are to characterize the relationship between complexity biomarkers, measures of
      function, and resilience. This pilot study will inform a future more definitive trial by
      providing information on recruitment and retention, compliance, dose-dependent effects,
      preliminary estimates of effect size, and the optimal biomarkers of complexity, function, and
      adaptive capacity.

      Specific Aim #1: To determine if 6 months of Tai Chi training can increase complexity,
      function, and adaptive capacity of multiple physiological systems in older healthy adults.
      Specific Aim #2: To determine the relationships between biomarkers of physiological
      complexity, conventional measures of function and adaptive capacity. Statistical regression
      models will be used to determine relationships, both at baseline and overtime, between a)
      complexity biomarkers and measures of physical and cognitive function, and b) complexity
      biomarkers and adaptive capacity. Elucidating these relationships will further inform the
      interpretation of complexity biomarkers and provide insights into underlying component
      mechanisms contributing to complex physiological dynamics.
