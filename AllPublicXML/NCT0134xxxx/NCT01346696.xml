  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the clinical efficacy of Osseospeed™ TX 6 mm
      implants in a Chinese population by evaluation of marginal bone level alteration, implant
      stability and implant survival in the posterior mandible and maxilla up to 3 years after
      loading. The hypothesis is that one stage surgery using 6 mm OsseoSpeed™ TX implant in the
      posterior region is safe and predictable.

    <description>Marginal Bone Level will be determined from radiographs and expressed as the difference from a reference point on the implant to the most coronal bone-to-implant contact on the mesial and distal aspect of the implant. Marginal Bone Level expressed in millimeters at the 12 months follow-up visit will be compared to values obtained at delivery of permanent restoration i.e. loading (baseline).</description>

    <time_frame>At implant placement, loading, 6, 12, 24 and 36 months follow-up.</time_frame>
    <description>Implant stability will be evaluated clinically/manually (recorded as stable yes/no).</description>
