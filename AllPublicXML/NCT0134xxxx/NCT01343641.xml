  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This year-long investigator-initiated study is designed to determine effects of MK-0677, a GH
      secretagogue, in renal patients. It is a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial employing the
      following procedures: Informed consent process, followed by evaluation and screening tests to
      confirm patients' eligibility. Patients whose screening laboratory results for glycated
      hemoglobin level, thyroid function, or liver function exceed protocol eligibility criteria
      will not be randomized. Other exclusions are Congestive Heart Failure Class III or IV by the
      New York Heart Assocation's (NYHA) Guidelines and specified cardiovascular disorders within
      six months of baseline visit and muscle weakness associated with neuromuscular or
      neurological disorders. Before the subject begins taking the experimental drug MK-0677 or
      placebo, baseline assessments of subjects' hormone and cytokine levels, physical condition,
      body mass (determined by a DEXA scan), strength and functionality, and appetite will be
      obtained. In addition, quality of life assessments (SF-36) will be administered. This study's
      primary outcome is an increase in lean body weight. Secondary outcomes are cytokine and
      hormone levels, including, leptin, insulin, ghrelin, TNF- alpha, CRPs, IL-1, IL-6, and IL-10,
      ghrelin associated esterase and adiponectin, nutritional status, quality of life (QoL), food
      appreciation, physical function and economic impact. 70 subjects will be the enrollment
      target. This number was determined to offset projected screen failure and early withdrawal
      rates, and to ensure that 42 subjects complete the study.

             within the correct range.)
