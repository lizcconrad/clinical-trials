      1. Objectives : To evaluate superiority in the Hemoglobin A1C -lowering effect of Smart
           Care Service compared to the conventional treatment in patients with type 2 diabetes.

        2. Test and control group

             -  Control group : The subject group who is receiving any conventional treatment
                (hospital visit).

             -  Test groups

                  -  Conventional treatment + remote monitoring group: The subject group who is
                     receiving the health care services using conventional treatment (hospital
                     visit) and remote monitoring.

                  -  Remote visit + remote monitoring group: The subject group who is receiving
                     remote visit and remote monitoring using videotelephony

        3. Target Subject: Type II diabetes patients
