  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Transanal Endoscopic Rectosigmoid Resection with Laparoscopic Assistance was developed at
      Massachusetts General Hospital and performed successfully to remove cancer of the lower
      rectum. Based on the outcomes, the research doctors believe that this investigational surgery
      may be as safe and effective as standard laparoscopic or open surgery performed to remove
      rectal cancer, may facilitate the operation and reduce the size of the abdominal incisions.
      In this research study, the investigators are looking to see if this investigational
      procedure is a safe and effective approach to remove rectal cancer of the mid and lower
      rectum.

    <textblock>
      Subjects will have their rectal cancer removed using a technique combining surgery through
      the anus and standard laparoscopy. At the end of the procedure, the rectum will be removed
      though the anus, the bowel will be re-connected to the anus, and a temporary diverting stoma
      will be created, which is standard of care following surgery for this type of cancer.
