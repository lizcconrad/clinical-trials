      The purpose of this study is to determine if the use of supplemental oxygen at 80% FIO2 can
      reduce the incidence of surgical site infection after emergency cesarean section.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Surgical site infection (SSI) is one of the most important complications that can develop
      after a cesarean section. SSI can be mild or it can develop into septic shock and death,
      being cesarean section the most important cause of puerperal infections. Supplemental oxygen
      at high doses has been advocated as a protective factor for SSI. The purpose of this study is
      to determine if the use of oxygen at high doses (80% FIO2)can reduce the incidence of SSI
      after emergency cesarean section.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of participants with surgical site infection (SSI).</measure>
    <time_frame>2 months</time_frame>
    <description>The patients will be evaluated for evidence of surgical site infection before leaving the hospital, at 15 and 30 days post surgery. The presence of fever, supurative secretion through the wound or cutaneous changes compatible witn infection will be considered a surgical site infection (SSI). This outcome will be evaluated with a qualitative variable (presence of SSI). The patients will be clasiffied in accordance as &quot;With SSI&quot; or &quot;Without SSI&quot;. This will allow us to determine if the use of oxygen at 80% FIO2 can reduce the incidence of SSI.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of participants with respiratory complications trans or post surgery.</measure>
    <time_frame>2 months</time_frame>
    <description>Every patient will be evaluated during surgery and before leaving the hospital for signs of a respiratory complication (persistent cough, fever, dyspnea, atelectatic rales, wheezing). The presence of any of these signs will be used to classify the patients with a qualitative variable (&quot;With Respiratory Complications&quot; or &quot;Without Respiratory Complications&quot;) and allow us to determine if the use of oxygen at 80% FIO2 is associated with more respiratory complications.</description>
