    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to determine if off-pump CABG surgery is associated with better
      cerebral tissue oxygenation when compared with on-pump CABG. In addition, the investigators
      would like to compare the results of two different monitors of brain tissue oxygenation with
      each other, and assess the correlation between brain tissue oxygenation and oxygenation
      measurements in renal and muscular tissue, as well as with conventional hemodynamic and
      metabolic variables, such as central venous oxygen saturation (ScvO2). Finally, the
      investigators aim to determine if duration and extent of cerebral oxygen desaturation predict
      outcome variables such as postoperative cognitive performance.
