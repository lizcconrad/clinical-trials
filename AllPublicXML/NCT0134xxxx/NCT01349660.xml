  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this phase I/II study,investigators are evaluating the feasibility and efficacy of the
      combination of BKM120, an oral inhibitor of PI3 kinase, and bevacizumab in the treatment of
      patients with relapsed/refractory GBM. In the Phase I part of the trial, the optimal BKM120
      dose to be administered with a standard dose of bevacizumab will be determined in patients
      with refractory solid tumors. Although it is unlikely that the concurrent administration of
      bevacizumab will alter the pharmacokinetics of BKM120, limited pharmacokinetic sampling will
      be performed on all patients treated during the Phase II portion of the study. Assuming this
      combination is feasible, the Phase II portion of the study will proceed, using the doses
      determined in the Phase I portion. In the phase II portion, eligible patients will be limited
      to those with recurrent/progressive GBM following 1st line combined modality therapy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, non-randomized Phase I study of patients with advanced refractory
      solid tumors followed by a Phase II study for the second-line treatment of patients with
      relapsed/refractory glioblastoma multiforme.

      In the phase I part of the study the optimal dose of BKM120 when combined with bevacizumab
      was determined. In the Phase II part of this study, patients with relapsed/refractory GBM
      following first line therapy are being treated with the BKM120/bevacizumab combination.
      Limited BKM120 pharmacokinetic evaluation will be performed on all patients treated during
      this part of the study. Patients will be reevaluated for response to treatment after 2 cycles
      (8 weeks). Patients with objective response or stable disease will continue treatment, with
      subsequent reevaluations every 8 weeks, until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity
      occurs.

      Two populations of patients with relapsed/refractory GBM will be treated in the Phase II
      trial: 1) patients with no previous exposure to bevacizumab (N= 55) and 2) patients who
      received bevacizumab as part of first-line combined modality treatment (N= 20).

    <time_frame>Collected from day of first dose to the end of the first treatment cycle, up to 28 days</time_frame>
    <description>The optimal dose of BKM120 to administer in combination with standard dose bevacizumab determined as the dose at which ≤1 of 6 patients experiences a DLT assessed using NCI CTCAE v4.03 during Cycle 1 (28 days). The optimal dose of BKM120 was determined to be 60 mg by mouth (PO), once a day for each 28 day cycle along with bevacizumab, administered 10 mg/kg intravenously (IV) on Day 1 and Day 15 of each 28 day cycle.</description>

    <measure>Median Progression-Free Survival (PFS) in Phase II Participants - Prior Bevacizumab and Bevacizumab Naive</measure>
    <time_frame>every 8 weeks for up to 33 months</time_frame>
    <description>Two groups of patients in the Phase II trial will be considered separately, 1) participants who have not received previous bevacizumab and 2) participants who have received bevacizumab as part of first-line treatment. PFS is measured from the date of first protocol treatment until date of disease progression or death occurs, or date of last adequate tumor assessment using RANO or McDonald criteria. McDonald disease progression criteria: a 25% or greater increase in sum of the diameters of lesions, new lesions, or clinical deterioration (McDonald et al, 1990). RANO disease progression criteria: a 25% or greater increase in the enhancing lesions sum compared with smallest tumor measurement, significant increase in T2/FLAIR nonenhancing lesion on stable or increasing corticosteroids, new lesions, or clinical deterioration (Wen et al 2010)</description>

    <description>Two groups of participants in the Phase II trial will be considered separately, 1) those who have not received previous bevacizumab and 2) those who have received bevacizumab as part of first-line treatment. Overall Response (OR) = number of patients with complete or partial responses (CR or PR) per McDonald or RANO criteria. McDonald: CR as disappearance of all disease for at least four weeks, no new lesions, no steroids; PR as 50% or greater decrease in the sum of all lesions compared with baseline for at least four weeks, no new lesions, stable or reduced steroids (McDonald 1990). RANO: CR as disappearance of all disease for at least 4 weeks, no new lesions, stable or improved nonenhancing lesions, and no steroid usage; and PR as a 50% or greater decrease in the sum of all lesions compared with baseline measurement for at least four weeks, no new lesions, stable or improved nonenhancing lesions on same or lower steroid dose compared to baseline (Wen 2010).</description>

        <description>Two groups of patients in the Phase II trial will be considered separately, 1) participants who have not received previous bevacizumab and 2) participants who have received bevacizumab as part of first-line treatment. PFS is measured from the date of first protocol treatment until date of disease progression or death occurs, or date of last adequate tumor assessment using RANO or McDonald criteria. McDonald disease progression criteria: a 25% or greater increase in sum of the diameters of lesions, new lesions, or clinical deterioration (McDonald et al, 1990). RANO disease progression criteria: a 25% or greater increase in the enhancing lesions sum compared with smallest tumor measurement, significant increase in T2/FLAIR nonenhancing lesion on stable or increasing corticosteroids, new lesions, or clinical deterioration (Wen et al 2010)</description>
