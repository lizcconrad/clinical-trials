    <textblock>
      This study aims to characterize clonal evolution in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) using
      different approaches and to identify a possible association with disease progression, i.e.
      therapy initiation.

        1. Samples This monocentric study is carried out using representative bioarchived leukemic
           samples with a diagnosis of CLL, either at diagnosis or at evolution. These bioarchived
           samples were collected locally at our center during years of diagnostic activity, and
           were accurately pathologically, cytogenetically and molecularly characterized.

        2. Clinical data The clinical data were retrospectively collected through collaboration
           with the referring physicians.

        3. Methods Samples will be investigated by means of (1) conventional cytogenetics, (2)
           fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and (3) SNP-arrays. After analysis of the
           array data sets, significant results will be validated and in addition, results will be
           correlated with clinical data.
