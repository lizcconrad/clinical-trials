      The purpose of this study is to verify the effectiveness and safety of medical ozone therapy
      system in treatment of chronic hepatitis B.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Total of 189 patients with compensated chronic hepatitis B will be divided equally and
      randomly into three arms. Patients in arm I and II treated with medical ozone therapy with
      different medical ozone generators, one was made in Tianyi medical instruments limited
      company and the other in Germany. Sixty-three patients of arm III treated with Diammonium
      glycyrrhizinate Capsules, common used liver protective herb drug. The term of therapy is 12
      weeks. Virology response, biochemistry response and hepatitis B viral serological response
      will be studied at the end of 12 weeks treatment.
