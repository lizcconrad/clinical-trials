  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a pilot study evaluating the use of tumor derived exosomes as a marker for response
      to therapy in women receiving neoadjuvant chemotherapy for newly diagnosed breast cancer.
      Tumor derived exosome analysis may be a novel diagnostic and prognostic biosignature in
      breast cancer, which could prove to be a tool for earlier diagnosis, more effective
      treatments, and improved markers of response in order to increase survival rates.

    <description>Compare tumor derived exosomes at baseline, monthly during chemotherapy, at the completion of chemotherapy treatment, and after surgery to determine residual cancer burden. Tumor derived exosome expression will be correlated with both clinical and pathologic response.</description>

      Serum will be centrifuged to plasma which will be transferred to alliquots, and frozen prior
      to shipping. Exosomes will be extracted from the frozen plasma with half of the sample used
      for antibody testing and the remaining sample will be used for RNA analysis.
