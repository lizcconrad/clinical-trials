  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research is being done to learn more about nonmyeloablative bone marrow transplantation
      (BMT), also known as a &quot;mini&quot; transplant for patients with blood cancers, using bone marrow
      from a relative.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The main goal is to learn whether a drug called tacrolimus, which is an immune-lowering drug
      (an immunosuppressant) given after transplant to help prevent certain complications, can be
      given safely for a shorter period of time than it has been in the past.

      At the present time there are few or no cures for your type of disease outside of a bone
      marrow transplant. The bone marrow for this transplant comes from a relative who is a
      half-match or &quot;haplo&quot; match to you. Possible donors include parents, siblings, and children.
      In order to help the bone marrow grow, or &quot;take&quot;, inside your body, you will receive
      chemotherapy and radiation before the transplant. After the transplant you will receive high
      doses of cyclophosphamide (CytoxanÂ®) along with other medications to lower the immune system,
      tacrolimus. These medications may lower the risk of graft versus host disease (GVHD) and of
      your body rejecting the bone marrow graft.

    <description>Tacrolimus levels will be monitored. Patients who develop a prohibitive toxicity to tacrolimus (resulting in earlier than scheduled discontinuation of tacrolimus) will be considered unevaluable for the primary endpoint. The duration of tacrolimus will be evaluated at Day 90. If tacrolimus at Day 90 appears feasible, then it will be continued until Day 120 with analogous monitoring rules.</description>
