  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Full conditioning of the peritoneal cavity during laparoscopic surgery will decrease
      post-operative pain, inflammation and adhesion formation.

      Full conditioning will decrease an inflammatory response of the peritoneum and decrease pain
      and adhesion formation.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Randomized controlled trial (RCT) comparing carbon dioxide to full conditioning (addition of
      oxygen, nitrous oxide, humidification and temperature control, dexamethasone and Hyalobarrier
      gel) Women undergoing laparoscopy for endometriosis, myomectomy or adhesiolysis will be
      randomized to either group and will be compared for pain (VAS scores); inflammation (White
      blood cells, CRP) and adhesions scored by second look laparoscopy.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  women undergoing laparoscopic excision of deep endometriosis (stratum 1), excision of
             endometrioma's (stratum 2) or excision of uterine myoma's (stratum 3) since this is
             severe surgery, associated with severe postoperative adhesions and since for most of
             these women fertility is important and hence the second look laparoscopy can be
             beneficial.

          -  Signed informed consent

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  women with a pre-existing condition increasing the risk of surgery such as clotting
             disorders, heart or lung impairment etc.-Any condition that might interfere with
             inflammatory parameters such as immunodeficiency, chronic inflammatory disease as
             Crohn's disease.

          -  Pregnancy

          -  Conditions associated with chronic pain as peripheral neuropathy, pathology of the
             vertebral column and osteo-articular disease. Conditions causing acute pain e.g.
             abdominal trauma

          -  a known allergic reaction to Hyalobarrier Gel Endo®

          -  A bowel lesion requiring a single or double layer suture. (given that for none of the
             anti-adhesion barriers safety has been proven following bowel lesions and suture)
