  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study objective is to establish that there is no statistical difference in marginal bone
      level change comparing a Standard drilling protocol with a Soft bone drilling protocol when
      using OsseoSpeed TX and immediate loading.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Provision of informed consent

          2. Female/male aged 18 years and over

          3. History of edentulism in the study area of at least 3 months

          4. At least 4 months healing after last grafting procedure in the study area

          5. In need for implant treatment replacing one to four missing single tooth in positions
             14-17, 24-27, 34-37 and 44-47

          6. The study implant position must be surrounded by natural tooth roots, unless the
             implant will constitute the most distal dentition.

          7. Deemed by the investigator to be suitable for one stage surgery

          8. Deemed by the investigator to be suitable for immediate loading

          9. Deemed by the investigator as likely to present an initially stable implant situation.

         10. Deemed by the investigator to have a &quot;functional&quot; opposing dentition at the time of
             loading the implants.

        Exclusion Criteria

          1. Unlikely to be able to comply with study procedures, as judged by the investigator

          2. Uncontrolled pathological processes in the oral cavity

          3. Known or suspected current malignancy

          4. History of radiation therapy in the head and neck region

          5. History of chemotherapy within 5 years prior to surgery

          6. Systemic or local disease or condition that would compromise post-operative healing
             and/or osseointegration

          7. Uncontrolled diabetes mellitus

          8. Corticosteroids or any other medication that would compromise post-operative healing
             and/or osseointegration

          9. Present alcohol and/or drug abuse

         10. Current need for bone grafting and/or augmentation in the planned implant area

         11. Involvement in the planning and conduct of the study (applies to both Astra Tech staff
             and staff at the study site)

         12. Previous enrolment in the present study.

         13. Simultaneous participation in another clinical study, or participation in a clinical
             study during the last 6 months.
