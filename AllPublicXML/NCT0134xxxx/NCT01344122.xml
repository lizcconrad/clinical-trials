  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to see whether or not a strategic planning process is able to
      introduce and sustain improvements in the working relationship between probation/parole
      departments and community-based addiction treatment agencies that provide medication assisted
      therapy (MAT) for individuals with opioid or alcohol dependence. In addition, this study
      seeks to improve probation/parole agency personnel's knowledge and perceptions about MAT, and
      increase the number of appropriate referrals to community treatment agencies that provide
      MAT. There are three phases to this study. Phase 1 includes a pilot study to determine the
      quality and availability of client level records and the collection of baseline data (the
      pilot study protocol was previously submitted to TMH IRB). Phase 2 will consist of a
      Knowledge, Perceptions and Information (KPI) intervention during which probation/parole
      agencies will undergo training to increase knowledge about the effectiveness of MAT, and
      complete a post training assessment to evaluate the effectiveness of the KPI intervention.
      During Phase 3, probation/parole agencies will be randomly assigned to a 12-month
      Organizational Linkage Intervention (OLI) condition or to control (no further intervention).
      Agencies assigned to the OLI will establish a Pharmacotherapy Exchange Council (PEC) that
      consists of staff from both the probation/parole and community treatment agencies. The PEC
      will undergo a strategic planning process to increase the availability of MAT for opiate
      and/or alcohol dependent individuals who are on probation/parole.
