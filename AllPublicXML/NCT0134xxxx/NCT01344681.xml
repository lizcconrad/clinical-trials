    <textblock>
      This study of chemotherapy occurred during the neutropenic fever in patients with antibiotic
      refractory fever. The investigators evaluate efficacy and safety of micafungin sodium
      (mycamine ® Injection) 100mg dose compare to itraconazole (Sporanox ® Injection) 200mg as a
      control and this study is prospective, randomized, non-inferiority trials.

      Therefore, this study was planned for review of the safety and efficacy in korean patients.
