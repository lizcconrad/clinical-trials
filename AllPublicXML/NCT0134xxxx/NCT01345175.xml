  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The most common long-term problems after rectal surgery are bowel problems. These problems
      can include needing to pass bowel movements a lot, loose or mushy stools, inability to fully
      clear your bowels, and/or poor control of gas and stool. The investigators believe that a
      major cause of these problems is too much bacteria in the bowel and treatment with antibiotic
      tablets will hopefully help improve these bowel problems. In order to test this idea, the
      Colorectal Surgery Service of Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center is sponsoring a clinical
      trial. This trial will compare the antibiotic rifaximin and a placebo (a harmless tablet that
      has no effect) in the treatment of these bowel problems. Following this we will attempt to
      see if another antibiotic metronidazole also helps to treat these bowel problems. Both
      Metronidazole and rifaximin are well established drugs that have minimal side effects.

    <description>This group will receive rifaximin 400mg bid for 4 weeks. At 1 - 24 months after completion of the phase III portion of the trial, patients will be contacted by phone and given the option of receiving metronidazole in a followup, single arm study in which all patients receive the antibiotic. Patients who wish to participate will be mailed a drug prescription for a 3 week course of metronidazole 500mgs tid as well as the BFI forms and stool diary. Pretreatment and post treatment BFI scores will be collected and analyzed for change in bowel function as was done in the initial Phase III study.</description>

    <description>Pt will receive rifaximin 400mg bid for 4 weeks. Patients will at this stage on a volunteer basis be asked to submit stool samples and undertake a breath test. Patients will receive the respective treatment for four weeks. Following cessation of treatment all patients will be assessed using the BFI and respective patients will have repeat stool sampling and breath testing. Patients will then have these tests repeated 4 weeks later. This corresponds to 8 weeks after the start of the trial. For those patients not undertaking stool and breath testing, they will be reminded by phone, mail or email to fill out the BFI. Before and during the trial patients will be asked to fill out a weekly stool diary to evaluate trends on bowel function.</description>
