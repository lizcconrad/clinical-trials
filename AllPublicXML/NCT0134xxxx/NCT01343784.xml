  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the incidence of catheterization from discharge to 6
      weeks postoperatively when using two methods of post-operative voiding evaluation after a
      mid-urethral sling procedure. The investigators' results may lead to a decreased use of
      indwelling catheters and their associated morbidity after outpatient sling surgery.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Minimally invasive slings have demonstrated similar efficacy to earlier abdominal
      anti-incontinence procedures, but offer the benefit of shorter operating times, less voiding
      dysfunction, lower morbidity and are usually done as an outpatient procedure. Despite the
      advantages, about 35% of patients are discharged home with indwelling catheters. Indwelling
      catheters are bothersome for patients, costly to the healthcare system and are a source of
      significant morbidity. The challenge for pelvic surgeons performing anti-incontinence
      procedures is avoiding postoperative urinary retention while minimizing the use of catheters
      and their associated risks. A commonly described backfill-assisted voiding trial is used as a
      means of evaluating bladder function postoperatively. This method uses a low post-void
      residual as a specific criterion for discharge without a catheter. However, the validity of
      this method has never been critically evaluated. Our recent observational study suggests that
      patients may be safely discharged without a catheter after a midurethral sling procedure
      based on their subjective assessment of the force of stream. Our proposed study expands on
      this pilot data using a randomized trial to evaluate two methods of post-operative voiding
      evaluation. The results may lead to a decreased use of indwelling catheters and their
      associated morbidity after outpatient sling surgery.

The incidence of being discharged with an indwelling catheter will be gathered from PACU records. The information regarding catheterization after that point will be captured via the electronic medical records or patient questionnaires (at 2 days, 1 week, and 6 week follow-up).</description>

    <description>Subjects in this group will undergo backfill-assisted voiding trial that involves infusing 300ml of fluid in the bladder, removing the catheter and allowing the patient to void. All subjects will be asked to use visual analog scale (VAS) to assess their force of stream (FOS) and the voided amount as well as post-void residual (PVR) (measured by the bladder ultrasound) will be measured and recorded. Subjects will be discharged without a catheter if the voided amount is more than 200ml, or 2/3rds of the infused volume (300ml).</description>
