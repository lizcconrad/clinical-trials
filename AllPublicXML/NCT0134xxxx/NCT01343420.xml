    <textblock>
      Liquid allergen extracts contain proteins, such as (but not limited to) tree, weed, cat,
      cockroach, and nuts, and are used to identify allergies by observing the body's reaction to
      the introduction of extract underneath the skin. There are a few dog allergen extracts
      commercially available in the US for allergy testing; however, none of these products are
      standardized, meaning they are not required to be the same strength. Because some extracts
      are not as potent (strong) as others, it's possible that some patients' allergies are
      misdiagnosed. Typically, the most potent (strong), but safe extract should be used so that
      allergic patients are correctly diagnosed.

      The purpose of this study is to compare the safety and potency of an investigational (not
      approved for use by the United States Food and Drug Administration [FDA]) dog allergen
      extract with two commercially available dog extracts, which are of differing potencies.

      This study is designed to assess the potency of a modified dog hair and dander extract in
      comparison with the two commercially available dog hair and dander extracts. This is a pilot
      study to estimate a target strength of dog extract in order to proceed to further studies.
