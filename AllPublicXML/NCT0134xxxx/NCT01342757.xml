    <textblock>
      This clinical trial is studying magnetic resonance spectroscopy imaging in predicting
      response in patients to vorinostat and temozolomide in patients with recurrent, progressive,
      or newly diagnosed glioblastoma. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as temozolomide, work in
      different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping
      them from dividing. Vorinostat may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the
      enzymes needed for cell growth. Vorinostat may also help temozolomide work better by making
      tumor cells more sensitive to the drug. Imaging procedures, such as magnetic resonance
      spectroscopy imaging, may help measure the patient's response to vorinostat and temozolomide
      and allow doctors to plan better treatment.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the strength of the association between magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS)
      imaging measurable biomarkers and response to vorinostat plus temozolomide.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate MRS-detected inositol and N-acetylaspartate (NAA) levels (at 3 tesla) as
      indicators of mood alterations as measured by a self-report depression survey (IDS-SR).

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive vorinostat orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days -7 to -1 (course 1 only) and
      days 8-14 and 22-28 and temozolomide PO QD on days 1-5. Courses repeat every 28 days in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients previously treated with
      standard radiotherapy and temozolomide receive maintenance temozolomide PO on days 1-5.

      Treatment repeats every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicities. Patients undergo magnetic resonance spectroscopy imaging at baseline and at
      approximately 1 and 8 weeks on treatment. Patients also undergo an Inventory of Depression
      Symptomatology Self-Reported (IDS-SR) assessment at baseline and periodically during study.

    <time_frame>9 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Changes in magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging signal and semiquantitative analysis of inositol, choline, lactate, and N-acetylaspartate signal are measured. The values for each of these metabolites are normalized to baseline at one and nine weeks. The values of all the metabolites at one week are added and this is the magnetic resonance spectroscopic index for one week. This is done again at nine weeks. The number is unitless and there is no range limit. Positive values represent normalization of tumor metabolism and negative values suggest no improvement or worsening of metabolic character.</description>

    <measure>Proportion of Patients Who Experience Metabolic Restoration Between the Responders and Non-responder Groups by MRS Scans</measure>
    <time_frame>After 1 week</time_frame>
    <description>Baseline MRS was performed 1-3 days before initiation of treatment. Follow-up MRS studies were performed at day 7. A standard quadrature head coil was used to collect MR data. A responder was defined as stable disease: determined in glioblastoma to be between a 25% volume increase and 50% volume decrease compared to baseline imaging at the therapy initiation at the 2 month follow-up visit. The spectroscopic restoration index was calculated (ΔN-acetyl aspartate + Δcreatine + Δmyo-inositol − Δcholine − Δ(lactate / lipids)).</description>

    <description>Baseline MRS was performed 1-3 days before initiation of treatment. Follow-up MRS studies were performed at day 7. A standard quadrature head coil was used to collect MR data. The change of metabolite level in choline (Cho) and N-acetyl aspartate (NAA) were calculated in ratio by (metabolite after treatment / metabolite before treatment − 1). The reported ratios represent the Cho-to-NAA ratio at day 7 compared with day 0.</description>

        <title>Proportion of Patients With Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy (MRS) Response to Initial Vorinostat by MRI and MRS Scans as Determined by Spectroscopic Index</title>
        <description>Changes in magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging signal and semiquantitative analysis of inositol, choline, lactate, and N-acetylaspartate signal are measured. The values for each of these metabolites are normalized to baseline at one and nine weeks. The values of all the metabolites at one week are added and this is the magnetic resonance spectroscopic index for one week. This is done again at nine weeks. The number is unitless and there is no range limit. Positive values represent normalization of tumor metabolism and negative values suggest no improvement or worsening of metabolic character.</description>

        <description>Baseline MRS was performed 1–3 days before initiation of treatment. Follow-up MRS studies were performed at day 7. A standard quadrature head coil was used to collect MR data. A responder was defined as stable disease: determined in glioblastoma to be between a 25% volume increase and 50% volume decrease compared to baseline imaging at the therapy initiation at the 2 month follow-up visit. The spectroscopic restoration index was calculated (ΔN-acetyl aspartate + Δcreatine + Δmyo-inositol − Δcholine − Δ(lactate / lipids)).</description>
        <time_frame>After 1 week</time_frame>
        <population>In five of the twelve cases spectroscopic indices could not be calculated because the tumor volume was outside of reliably measured voxels. These were primarily accounted for by tumor closeness to the skull or the small size of residual tumor.</population>

    <limitations_and_caveats>In five of the twelve cases spectroscopic indices could not be calculated because the tumor volume was outside of reliably measured voxels. These were primarily accounted for by tumor closeness to the skull or the small size of residual tumor.</limitations_and_caveats>
