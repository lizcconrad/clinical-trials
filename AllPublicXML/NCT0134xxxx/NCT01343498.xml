      This is a dose escalation trial to evaluate twice daily dosing of the sachet formulation of
      BEZ235. This trial will find the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of the sachet formulation given
      twice daily, as well as evaluate pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD) of the twice
      daily dosing. Patients will initially be given once daily dosing to determine the PK and PD
      of the single daily dose. On Day 9, they will begin twice daily dosing, with half of the
      single daily dose divided twice daily, and PK and PD of the twice daily dose will be
      determined.

         22. Inability or unwillingness to comply with study and/or follow-up procedures outlined
             in the protocol.

         23. Women of child-bearing potential who are pregnant or breastfeeding or adults of
             reproductive potential not employing an effective method of birth control.

               -  Women are considered post-menopausal and not of child bearing potential if they
                  have had 12 months of natural (spontaneous) amenorrhea with an appropriate
                  clinical profile (e.g. age appropriate, history of vasomotor symptoms) or six
                  months of spontaneous amenorrhea with serum FSH levels &gt; 40 mIU/mL and estradiol
                  &lt; 20 pg/mL] or have had surgical bilateral oophorectomy (with or without
                  hysterectomy) at least six weeks ago. In the case of oophorectomy alone, only
                  when the reproductive status of the woman has been confirmed by follow up hormone
                  level assessment is she considered not of child bearing potential.

               -  Women of child-bearing potential, defined as all women physiologically capable of
                  becoming pregnant, must use highly effective contraception during the study and
                  for 5 T1/2 (8 days) after stopping treatment. The highly effective contraception
                  is defined as either:

        1. True abstinence: When this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of the
        subject. Periodic abstinence (e.g. calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, post-ovulation
        methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception.

        2. Sterilization: have had surgical bilateral oophorectomy (with or without hysterectomy)
        or tubal ligation at least six weeks ago. In case of oophorectomy alone, only when the
        reproductive status of the woman has been confirmed by follow up hormone level assessment.

        3. Male partner sterilization: (with the appropriate post-vasectomy documentation of the
        absence of sperm in the ejaculate). For female subjects on the study, the vasectomised male
        partner should be the sole partner for that patient.

        4. Use of a combination of any two of the following (a+b):

          1. Placement of an intrauterine device (IUD) or intrauterine system (IUS).

          2. Barrier methods of contraception: Condom or Occlusive cap (diaphragm or cervical/vault
             caps) with spermicidal foam/gel/film/cream/vaginal suppository.

        Oral contraception, injected or implanted hormonal methods are not allowed as BEZ235
        potentially decreases the effectiveness of hormonal contraceptives.

          -  Women of child-bearing potential must have a negative serum or urine pregnancy test ≤
             72 hours prior to initiating treatment.

          -  Fertile males, defined as all males physiologically capable of conceiving offspring
             must use condom during treatment, for 5 T1/2 (8 days) after stopping treatment and for
             additional 12 weeks (3 months in total after study drug discontinuation) and should
             not father a child in this period.
