  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The External Synchronized Vein Valve (ESVV), is intended for the treatment of Chronic Venous
      Insufficiency (CVI), incorporates an external apparatus that is aimed to replace the one-way
      venous valve and a sensor that identifies the movement of the calf muscles pump. The external
      device is located above the failed deep vein and exerts synchronized intermittent regulated
      pressure on it. Alteration in the vein structure is occurred and the blood flows in the
      cephalad direction, preventing the return toward the feet. The device is synchronized with
      the calf muscles pump to function as a one-way venous valve. This study was design in order
      to assess safety and efficacy of using the ESVV for treatment of consequences of deep chronic
      venous insufficiency.
