  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a research study to determine whether bacterial vaginosis (BV) changes the
      cervico-vaginal tissue (skin covering the cervix and vagina) and makes women at higher risk
      for getting HIV (Human Immunodeficiency Virus). Vaginal and cervical tissue biopsies from
      women with BV will be obtained and infected OUTSIDE the body (ex vivo) with HIV.

      BV is a vaginal infection that develops when there is an imbalance in the normal bacteria
      found in a woman's vagina. It is the most common cause of vaginal discharge among women of
      child-bearing age. BV infections potentially harm the safety of the tissue surrounding the
      cervico-vaginal region. When the cervico-vaginal tissue is not well protected, the risk of
      acquiring HIV from an infected partner might increase significantly. Studies have shown that
      HIV is more common in women with BV than in women with normal vaginal bacteria.

      Treatment of BV typically involves the use of antibiotics. Antibiotics kill harmful bacteria
      and provide a temporary relief from the symptoms caused by the infection. Women participating
      in this study will use the generic antibiotic metronidazole, also known as Flagyl. The Center
      for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends Flagyl for the treatment of BV.

      The study will evaluate HIV infection and safety of cervico-vaginal tissue in women at 3
      different time periods:

        1. During a BV infection

        2. Approximately 1 week after completing a 7-day course of metronidazole therapy

        3. Approximately 1 month after completing the 7-day course of metronidazole therapy

      You will not come in contact with HIV during this study - only your samples (after we have
      removed them from your vagina/cervix) come in contact with HIV.

      WHY ARE YOU BEING ASKED TO TAKE PART?

      You are being asked to participate in this research project because you are a female between
      the ages of 18-50 and you think you might have a current BV infection; your menstrual cycle
      is regular and your last two periods were 21-35 days apart; you are willing comply with the
      procedures done at 3 study visits; and you are willing to take metronidazole for 7 days.

      This study includes only people who voluntarily choose to take part. Please take your time to
      make your decision and feel free to ask any questions you might have.

      WHAT ARE SOME IMPORTANT DETAILS ABOUT THIS STUDY?

      Up to approximately 80 women are expected to take part in the study at this local site. There
      are no other study sites participating in the study. You will have three scheduled visits to
      the clinic. Your participation in the study will last for approximately 2 months.

        -  Were pregnant within the past 3 months.

        -  Are currently breastfeeding.

        -  Are HIV-1 positive, or your current sexual partner(s) is.

        -  Believe you currently have a sexually transmitted infection.

        -  Used a douche or other vaginal products or put anything in your vagina in the past 48
           hours; have a current presence of vulvar, anal and or vaginal genital warts.

        -  Have had vaginal intercourse with a male partner within the last 48 hours.

During a BV infection
Approximately 1 week after completing a 7-day course of metronidazole therapy
Approximately 1 month after completing the 7-day course of metronidazole therapy
Each of the 33 participants were sampled at baseline (during BV infection), approximately 1 week after treatment and approximately 1 month after treatment. p 24 antigen data was not evaluable in this study due to the fact that the samples were frozen prior to laboratory analyses, which damaged the samples. No data were collected.</description>

        <title>p24 Antigen Production in Tissue</title>
        <description>The study will evaluate HIV infection and safety of cervico-vaginal tissue in women at 3 different time periods:
During a BV infection
Approximately 1 week after completing a 7-day course of metronidazole therapy
Approximately 1 month after completing the 7-day course of metronidazole therapy
Each of the 33 participants were sampled at baseline (during BV infection), approximately 1 week after treatment and approximately 1 month after treatment. p 24 antigen data was not evaluable in this study due to the fact that the samples were frozen prior to laboratory analyses, which damaged the samples. No data were collected.</description>
