    <textblock>
      The diagnosis of OSASH requires expensive sleep tests that generate long waiting lists, so we
      need simplified and rapid diagnostic tools. The ApneaLinkTM, is a device that allows the
      assessment of respiratory events by measuring the flow ventilation with a nasal cannula
      connected to a pressure transducer.

    <criteria>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients 18 to 75 years of both sexes.

          2. clinical suspicion of OSAH defined as subjects with breathing pauses during sleep and
             / or asphyxiated sounds, with or without excessive daytime sleepiness as measured by
             the Epworth scale and who have asked for a sleep test to rule out OSAH.

          3. Informed consent signed by the patient.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Place of residence more than 100 km from the hospital.

          2. inability to perform psychophysical study at home.

          3. cardio-vascular disease, cerebro-vascular or respiratory or acute severe unstable as
             to preclude the proper conduct of studies at home and / or PSG in the laboratory.

          4. Patients with chronic insomnia or recognize sleep less than six hours.

          5. Patients with depression (both point 4 and 5 are the potential causes of false
             negatives in a PR for lack of sufficient sleep time).

          6. nasal obstruction complete or nearly complete, which prevents obtaining a quality
             signal with MicroMESAM
