  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Subjects referred for a routine CTA (computed tomography angiography) or MRA (magnetic
      resonance angiography) will be invited to participate in the study and subjects will be
      involved in the study for between 2 and 12 days. Two to three visits to the study doctor will
      be required.

      This study will compare the diagnostic results of Gadobutrol enhanced MRA images with MRA
      images taken without contrast agent using images from a CTA as the standard of reference,
      which may have been performed up to 60 days prior to enrolment. If a CTA has not been
      performed in this prior time period, a CTA is required for the study.

      MRA and CTA images will be collected for an independent review (blinded read).

    <measure>Percentage of Assessable Vascular Segments Using Gadobutrol-Enhanced MRA and Unenhanced MRA</measure>
    <time_frame>Images were taken pre-injection and post-injection</time_frame>
    <description>Each vascular segment was visualized using unenhanced MRA and gadobutrol-enhanced MRA, characterized by the on-site investigators, three independent blinded readers (reader 1, 2 and 3) and majority readers (the outcome determined by at least two of the blinded readers). The segments were predefined to standardize the blinded reader evaluations. A segment was assessable if it was visualized along its entire length and if any region of stenosis, was measured reliably. There were 6 segments assessed per participant (3 segments in the right renal artery and 3 segments in the left renal artery) and up to 9 segments in participants with renal transplant.</description>

    <time_frame>Images were taken pre-injection and post-injection</time_frame>
    <description>Clinically significant disease was defined as 50 to 99 percent (%) stenosis of a segment, but not occluded as assessed by the SoR. For each segment, the most severe stenosis/narrowing was identified and considered for the evaluation of clinically significant disease.</description>

    <measure>Length of the Right and Left Renal Arteries Assessed by Gadobutrol-enhanced MRA and Unenhanced MRA - Blinded Reader</measure>
    <time_frame>Images were taken pre-injection and post-injection</time_frame>
    <description>The length of the left and right renal arteries were measured from the origin at the aorta to the bifurcation into the upper and lower pole arteries or the most distal point of the renal artery which could be visualized. This distal margin was the point where the diameter was still assessable. If there were more than 2 distal branches then the first large branch that was the dominant supply to a renal pole was used as the distal point.</description>

    <time_frame>Images were taken pre-injection and post-injection</time_frame>
    <description>The segment reduction in diameter (DIA) of greater than 10% was considered abnormal and measured. The diameter of each of these abnormal segments was measured using electronic calipers (perpendicular to the long axis of the vessel) at the point of most severe stenosis within each segment. Mean of vessel diameters was calculated by segment separately for CTA and MRA readers. For the ease of expression, the following abbreviations will be used: Diameter (DIA), Blinded Reader (BR).</description>

    <time_frame>Images were taken pre-injection and post-injection</time_frame>
    <description>An accessory renal artery was defined as an additional, non-dominant, renal artery typically emanating from the aorta and anastomosing distal to the proximal third, segment of that renal artery. It was recorded only as present or absent on the right and left, regardless of how many accessory renal arteries were present.</description>

    <description>Diagnostic confidence was evaluated to determine the level of certainty that the blinded readers assigned to a diagnosis for each segment. This was defined as the degree of confidence that the information on the MRA images represented the true and complete clinical picture of a particular segment. The degree of confidence was rated on a 4-point scale: 1=Not confident; 2=Somewhat confident; 3=Confident; 4=Very confident.</description>

          <description>Gadobutrol was administered to all participants receiving study drug at the standard dose of 0.1 mmol/kg body weight (bw) by single intravenous (i.v.) bolus injection. During the course of the study, non-contrast magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) images were obtained before the administration of gadobutrol, and gadobutrol-enhanced MRA images were obtained after injection.</description>

          <description>Gadobutrol was administered to all participants receiving study drug at the standard dose of 0.1 mmol/kg body weight (bw) by single intravenous (i.v.) bolus injection. During the course of the study, non-contrast magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) images were obtained before the administration of gadobutrol, and gadobutrol-enhanced MRA images were obtained after injection.</description>

        <description>Each vascular segment was visualized using unenhanced MRA and gadobutrol-enhanced MRA, characterized by the on-site investigators, three independent blinded readers (reader 1, 2 and 3) and majority readers (the outcome determined by at least two of the blinded readers). The segments were predefined to standardize the blinded reader evaluations. A segment was assessable if it was visualized along its entire length and if any region of stenosis, was measured reliably. There were 6 segments assessed per participant (3 segments in the right renal artery and 3 segments in the left renal artery) and up to 9 segments in participants with renal transplant.</description>

        <description>The length of the left and right renal arteries were measured from the origin at the aorta to the bifurcation into the upper and lower pole arteries or the most distal point of the renal artery which could be visualized. This distal margin was the point where the diameter was still assessable. If there were more than 2 distal branches then the first large branch that was the dominant supply to a renal pole was used as the distal point.</description>

        <description>The segment reduction in diameter (DIA) of greater than 10% was considered abnormal and measured. The diameter of each of these abnormal segments was measured using electronic calipers (perpendicular to the long axis of the vessel) at the point of most severe stenosis within each segment. Mean of vessel diameters was calculated by segment separately for CTA and MRA readers. For the ease of expression, the following abbreviations will be used: Diameter (DIA), Blinded Reader (BR).</description>

          <description>Any focal dilatation (aneurysmal dilatation) of a segment was recorded. The diameter at the widest point was measured with the electronic calipers if a dilatation was present in any segment. The number of participants with an aneurysmal dilatation in each segment (proximal, mid- and distal) in the right and the left renal arteries assessed by gadobutrol-enhanced MRA and unenhanced MRA were reported.</description>
