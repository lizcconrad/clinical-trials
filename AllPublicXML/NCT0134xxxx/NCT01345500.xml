  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the Take Charge Study is to determine among overweight and obese men and women
      with type 2 diabetes whether 1) participating in a commercial weight loss program promotes
      great weight loss and weight loss maintenance at one year compared to usual care conditions
      and 2) whether there is a differential weight loss response to different dietary
      macronutrient composition (lower carbohydrate/higher fat diet versus a higher
      carbohydrate/lower fat).

    <description>To test, in a randomized controlled trial, whether participation in a commercial weight loss program promotes greater weight loss and weight loss maintenance at one year in overweight or obese men and women with type 2 diabetes compared to usual care conditions.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Response to macronutrient composition</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>To examine whether there is a differential weight loss response at 3, 6 and/or 12 months to different dietary macronutrient composition (higher carbohydrate and lower fat versus lower carbohydrate and higher fat) in the weight loss intervention in these overweight or obese men and women with type 2 diabetes.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Biochemical/social outcomes</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>To describe the effect of participating in the program (vs. usual care) on markers of glycemic control, cardiovascular disease risk, cardiopulmonary fitness, plasma carotenoids, quality of life, and eating attitudes and behaviors. Also to examine whether there is a differential response to different dietary macronutrient composition in the two weight loss intervention groups in selected metabolic factors, lipids and CRP at 6 and 12 months.</description>

    <description>Study participants will receive prepackaged prepared foods as needed to achieve a meal plan, free-of-charge for a 12-month period. The lower fat, higher carbohydrate diet provides 60% energy from carbohydrate, 20% energy from fat, and 20% energy from protein. The diet falls within the range of current dietary recommendations.</description>

    <description>Study participants will receive prepackaged prepared foods as needed to achieve a meal plan, free-of-charge for a 12-month period. The lower carbohydrate, higher fat diet provides 45% energy from carbohydrate, 35% energy from fat, and 20% energy from protein. The diet falls within the range of current dietary recommendations.</description>
