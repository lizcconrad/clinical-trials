    <description>Study drugs will be administered in cycles of 21 days for up to 6 cycles. CEP-9722 treatment will be initiated at cycle 2. After cycle 3, patients may discontinue gemcitabine and/or cisplatin for reasons of tolerability, at the discretion of the investigator.</description>

    <description>CEP-9722 will be administered orally from day 2 through day 7 of each cycle beginning with cycle 2. The starting dose will be 150 mg twice daily. Following cycle 2, the dose will either be decreased to 150 mg daily or increased to 200 mg twice daily in a cohort of 3 to 4 new patients. Subsequent cycles will increase the dose by 100 mg twice daily in cohorts of 3 to 4 patients (with criteria to expand to 6 patients) to a maximum of 400 mg twice daily. Patients must receive CEP-9722 to remain in the study. Once treatment with CEP-9722 is discontinued, patients will withdraw from the study.</description>
