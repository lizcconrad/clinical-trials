    <textblock>
      BACKGROUND:

      Molluscum contagiosum is a non-serious children viral infection. Because of its natural
      history, being highly contagious and the aesthetic and psychotherapeutic effects of its
      treatment, the investigators intend to test the use of different concentrations of potassium
      hydroxide solution in the primary care setting.

      METHODS:

      A double blind, randomized clinical trial, in three groups of topic treatment is designed.
      The intended treatment consists on a daily application of potassium hydroxide in aqueous
      solution at 10% and 15% concentration, versus a placebo administered to the control group. 4
      follow-up visits (15, 30, 45 and 60 days) are planned to evaluate treatment effectiveness and
      tolerance.

      The main target of the trial is to determine the healing rate, defined as lesion
      disappearance in the affected zones after the topic application of the treatment. Secondary
      targets are the main characteristics and evolution of the affected zone (surface, number of
      lesions, size and density) description, tolerance evaluation (hyperpigmentation, itching,
      burning, pain), recurrence rate estimation and natural evolution of lesions in the control
      group.
