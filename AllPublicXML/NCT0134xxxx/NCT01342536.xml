      Primary Aim 1: Examine effectiveness of the Oh Happy Day Class (OHDC) compared to the Coping
      With Depression (CWD)in increasing retention, adherence, engagement, satisfaction, and
      treatment-seeking. The investigators hypothesize the OHDC compared to the CWD will result in
      greater increases in: 1a. retention, 1b. adherence, 1c. engagement, and 1d. satisfaction at
      the middle and end of the intervention, and 2.e. greater increase in treatment-seeking 3-,
      6-, 9-, and 12- months post-intervention. Outcome measures: logs: attendance, homework
      completion, class-participation level; Client Satisfaction Inventory; and Cornell Service
      Index. Primary Aim 2: Examine effectiveness of the OHDC in reducing symptoms of depression at
      the middle and immediate end of the intervention, and 3-, 6-, 9-, and 12- months
      post-intervention. The investigators hypothesize the OHDC will result in greater reduction in
      depressive symptoms compared to the CWD at 3-months post-intervention. Outcome measures:
      Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale and Quick Inventory of Depression Symptoms.
      Secondary Aim 3: Examine the effectiveness of the OHDC in improving self-reports of mental
      and physical health status and reducing self-reports of perceived disability. The
      investigators hypothesize the OHDC compared to the CWD will result in greater self-report of:
      3a. improved mental and physical health status, and 3b. reduced self-report of disability at
      the immediate end of the intervention and 3-,6-, 9-, 12- months post-intervention. Outcome
      measures: SF-12 Health Survey, and World Health Organization Disability Assessment Schedule.

      Public Health Impact: Based on CAI research, the OHDC has the potential to be four times more
      effective than the CWD. If our hypotheses are proven, the OHDC will be the first
      evidence-based culturally adapted depression intervention designed specifically for African
      American men and women between the ages of 30-60.

    <description>Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D). The CES-D scale is a 20-item self-report inventory developed by NIMH to assess the frequency and severity of depression symptoms in the past week. Respondents indicate how often each symptom was experienced during the past week on a four-point scale from &quot;Rarely or none of the time (0)&quot;, &quot;Some or a little of the time (1)&quot;, &quot;Occasionally or a moderate amount of the time (2)&quot;, or &quot;Most or all of the time (3)&quot;. Item scores are summed for analyses, with a possible range 0-60. A standard cutoff score of 16 indicates depressive symptoms.</description>

    <measure>Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology (QIDS)</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 4 years</time_frame>
    <description>The 16-item Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology (QIDS) using DSM-IV criteria assesses depressive symptom severity and symptom change. The QIDS has a clinician-rated and self-report format. Studies show high internal consistency for the QIDS-CR (0.85) and QIDS-SR(0.86). Scores range from 0-27 and higher scores suggest higher severity. The QIDS also has high concurrent validity with the SF-12.</description>

    <description>The OHDC is a culturally adapted, cognitive behavioral group counseling intervention. The OHDC is theoretically grounded in social learning theory and an Afrocentric paradigm (Nguzo Saba). It uses a social support group and psychoeducation format so participants learn skills to help them in coping and reducing symptoms of depression. The OHDC is offered over 13 weeks with 2-hour sessions in a clinical setting.
