    <textblock>
      This is a study of 40 individuals with Sturge-Weber Syndrome (SWS) brain and/or eye
      involvement. It will examine the test-retest reliability of the following clinical tests:

        1. Quantitative EEG

        2. Transcranial Doppler

        3. Medical Rehabilitation Scales

        4. Optical Coherence Tomography

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Sturge-Weber Syndrome (SWS) is a rare disorder presenting at birth with a facial port-wine
      birthmark and later in infancy with seizures and strokes that result in weakness on one side
      of the body, cognitive disabilities, glaucoma, and visual field deficits. Approximately
      10-50% of infants born with a facial port-wine birthmark on the upper part of the face will
      also have SWS brain and/or eye involvement. Early detection and treatment of the disease is
      necessary to improve an SWS patient's outcome, and early biological indicators need to be
      discovered to make this possible. We believe the following tests can serve as non-invasive
      biomarkers to improve early diagnosis, monitor response to treatment, and to predict outcome:

        1. Quantitative EEG

        2. Transcranial Doppler

        3. Medical Rehabilitation Scales

        4. Optical Coherence Tomography The first step of this process is to determine how much the
           results of these tests vary between individual tests.

        1. Individuals with SWS and brain involvement (Aims 1-3): for the purposes of this study
             SWS brain involvement is defined as having shown on MRI imaging evidence of the
             typical vascular malformation which includes the following: leptomeningeal angioma,
             choroid plexus glomus, and associated venous angioma/malformation.

          2. Individuals with SWS and eye involvement (Aim 4): for the purposes of this study SWS
             eye involvement is defined as individuals with a portwine birthmark in the V1
             dermatomal distribution
