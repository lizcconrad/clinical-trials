    <textblock>
      In this study of patients with moderate traumatic brain injury with frontal brain contusions
      patients will be randomized to treatment with a single dose of either D-cycloserine or
      placebo given 48-72 hours after injury.

      Patients will undergo intensive neurocognitive testing at 3 and 6 months after injury to
      assess whether treatment with a single dose of D-cycloserine improves cognitive outcome after
      moderate brain injury.

          2. Age between 18 and 55 years

          3. Frontal cerebral contusion(s) located in the frontal cortex and/or traumatic
             subarachnoid hemorrhage on initial CT scan

          4. Prior to randomization, patient is able to swallow an orally administered tablet or
             has a nasogastric tube in place per medical indication

          5. Informed consent will be obtained in those patients who have regained full cognition
             and judgment following their injury and are fully capable of understanding the study
             protocol, its risks and potential benefits, and of giving informed consent for
             participation in the study. In any patient that has not regained full cognition and
             judgment, only a temporary legal guardian (apotropos) appointed by an authorized judge
             that has been given a full explanation of the study protocol, its risks and potential
             benefits will be authorized to give informed consent for participation in the study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Penetrating brain injury

          2. Any traumatic intracranial lesion requiring neurosurgical intervention prior to time
             of randomization

          3. Other severe systemic injuries leading to severe hypotension, hemodynamic instability
             following initial resuscitation (SBP &lt; 90 mmHg), severe hypoxia.

          4. Intubation lasting &gt; 12 hours prior to randomization

          5. Suspected or confirmed pregnancy or lactating women

          6. Any spinal cord injury

          7. Known or CT scan evidence of previous major cerebral damage

          8. Any severe concomitant condition (malignancy, renal, hepatic, or major psychiatric
             disorder)

          9. Known treatment with another investigational drug within 30 days of injury

         10. Known contraindication to enteral administration of drug prior to randomization (GI
             bleed, ileus, severe abdominal injury, etc.)

         11. Known contraindication to placement of a nasogastric tube in patients unable to
             swallow an orally administered tablet
