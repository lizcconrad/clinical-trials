             phosphatase (ALP) must be within normal ranges), vital signs, full physical
             examination and Electrocardiogram (ECG),

          -  Who are within the exclusion period defined in the National Register for Healthy
             Volunteers of the French Ministry of Health,

          -  Who have a positive laboratory test for urine drug screening (opiates, cocaine,
             amphetamine, cannabis, benzodiazepines),

          -  Who have undergone surgery or have donated blood within 12 weeks prior to the start of
             the study,

          -  Who have taken any prescribed or over the counter drug (including antacid drug), with
             the exception of paracetamol (up to 3 g per day) within 2 weeks prior to the first
             dose administration,

          -  Who have any clinical condition or prior therapy which, in the opinion of the
             Investigator, made the subject unsuitable for the study,

          -  Who participated to any clinical trial with an investigational drug in the past 3
             months preceding study entry.
