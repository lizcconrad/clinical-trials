      The purpose of this study was to assess patient preference regarding ocular comfort of
      AZARGA速 compared to COSOPT速 after one week instillation of each study medication.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      At the Screening Visit, each intervention was instilled in one eye in a contralateral fashion
      to establish baseline ocular comfort prior to randomization. A 48-hour washout period
      separated the two treatment periods.

    <description>The participant completed a questionnaire on the Day 15 visit (ie, after administration of both study medications) consisting of a single preference question: &quot;Thinking about the comfort of the two medications (1st and 2nd) that you took during this study, which medication do you prefer?&quot; Preferred treatment is presented as a percentage.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Clinical diagnosis of ocular hypertension, open-angle with or without
             pseudoexfoliation or pigment dispersion glaucoma in both eyes.

          -  On a stable regimen of intraocular pressure-lowering (IOP) medication within 30 days
             of Screening Visit.

          -  IOP considered safe (in the opinion of the Investigator) in both eyes in such a way
             that assures clinical stability of vision and the optic nerve throughout the study
             period.

          -  IOP between 19 and 35 millimeters mercury (mmHg) in at least one eye (study eye).

          -  Willing to discontinue the use of all other ocular drugs (prescribed and
             over-the-counter) prior to receiving the screening dose during the Screening Visit and
             for the entire course of the study.

          -  Able to follow instructions and willing and able to attend all study visits.

          -  Read, sign, and date an Ethics Committee reviewed and approved Informed Consent Form.

          -  Other protocol-defined inclusion criteria may apply.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Known medical history of allergy, hypersensitivity or poor tolerance to any component
             of the preparations to be used in this study that is deemed clinically significant in
             the opinion of the Principal Investigator.

          -  Best corrected visual acuity worse than 20/80 Snellen in either eye.

          -  Any abnormality preventing reliable applanation tonometry in either eye.

          -  Intraocular conventional surgery or laser surgery in either eye less than 3 months
             prior to the Screening Visit.

          -  Risk of visual field or visual acuity worsening as a consequence of participation in
             the study, in the Investigator's best judgment.

          -  Progressive retinal or optic nerve disease from any cause.

          -  History of ocular herpes simplex.

          -  Severe allergic rhinitis or bronchial hypersensitivity that would preclude the safe
             administration of a topical beta-blocker.

          -  Bronchial asthma, a history of bronchial asthma, or severe chronic obstructive
             pulmonary disease that would preclude the safe administration of a topical
             beta-blocker.

          -  Women who are pregnant, lactating, or of childbearing potential and not using a
             reliable means of birth control.
