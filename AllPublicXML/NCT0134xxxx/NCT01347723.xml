      This pilot clinical trial studies scrambler therapy in treating pain and peripheral
      neuropathy in patients previously treated with chemotherapy. Scrambler therapy may help
      relieve pain from peripheral neuropathy caused by chemotherapy

      OBJECTIVES:

      I. To record the types of patients that we treat, along with the reported efficacy and
      potential toxicity associated with scrambler therapy.

      II. To get experience with patient reported outcome measurement tools that we use in this
      trial, including a report of analgesic use.

      OUTLINE: Patients undergo scrambler therapy for 30 minutes daily for up to 10 consecutive
      days. Treatment continues in the absence of unacceptable toxicity. After completion of study
      treatment, patients are followed up for 10 weeks.

      III. To explore neurologic testing changes in patients receiving scrambler therapy.

    <description>Patients will also undergo neurologic function testing. This will be done in an exploratory measure to try to correlate changes in the patient reported outcome instrument data with changes in the different measures of neurologic function. The two measures will be Neurometer Current Perception Threshold (CPT) Testing and testing with a Rydel-Seiffer graduated tuning fork.</description>

    <criteria>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Pain or symptoms of neuropathy or pain of &gt;= 1 month (30 days) duration for which the
             patient wants intervention

          -  Participants have to relate that tingling or pain was at least a four out of ten
             problem during the prior week, on a 0-10 scale where zero was no problem and ten was
             the worst possible problem and expected to have tingling or pain of at least 4/10 at
             the time of the first treatment

          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance Status (PS) = 0, 1, or 2

          -  Life expectancy &gt;= 3 months (90 days)

          -  Case review by the study chair, or designate, as a case where treatment should be
             tried.

          -  Ability to complete questionnaire(s) by themselves or with assistance - Ability to
             provide informed written consent

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Pregnant women

          -  Patients with implantable drug delivery systems, e.g. Medtronic Synchromed

          -  Patients with heart stents or metal implants such as pacemakers, automatic
             defibrillators, aneurysm clips, vena cava clips and skull plates; (metal implants for
             orthopedic repair, e.g. pins, clips, plates, cages, joint replacements are allowed as
             are central venous access devices)

          -  Patients with a history of myocardial infarction or ischemic heart disease within the
             past six months

          -  Patients with history of epilepsy, brain damage, use of anti-convulsants for seizure
             prevention, concurrently using ketamine, symptomatic brain metastases; Note:
             anti-convulsant use is allowed for neuropathy and heart failure (HF) if on a stable
             dose

          -  Skin conditions such as open sores that would prevent proper application of the
             electrodes

          -  Other medical or other condition(s) that in the opinion of the investigators might
             compromise the objectives of the study

          -  Currently on gabapentin or pregabalin Note: (because of data that support that
             patients don't do as well when on gabapentin or pregabalin, all patients on these
             medications will be weaned off of them prior to study initiation. The study team will
             provide instructions on how to do this).
