  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to compare the treatment of 2 groups in patients with Achilles
      tendinopathy: autologous tenocytes injection in combination with exercises versus saline
      injection in combination with exercises

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Overuse injury of the Achilles tendon is a common entity. When the exact origin of tendon
      pain is unclear, the term tendinopathy is preferred. Most accepted treatment at this moment
      is an eccentric exercise programme, according to the Dutch guidelines. However, a recent
      systematic review on the effectiveness of eccentric exercises to treat lower extremity
      tendinoses concluded that it is unclear whether eccentric exercises are more effective than
      other forms of treatment. Recent studies described new treatment strategies in
      tendinopathies, such as the use autologous Tenocyte Implantation (ATI). This treatment option
      can participate actively in tissue repair processes on cell level. The only published
      clinical pilot study in tendon research reported 60% improvement in all scores after 6 months
      follow-up.

    <measure>Subjective patient satisfaction</measure>
    <time_frame>24 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Patient satisfaction will be determined by asking the patient how satisfied he/she is with the effect of the treatment in 4 possible categories: excellent / good / moderate / poor. The groups &quot;excellent&quot; and &quot;good&quot; will be regarded as successful and the groups of &quot;moderate&quot; and &quot;poor&quot; as not successful.</description>

    <description>The patient will be asked whether they are able to return to their sports level. It is a subdivision in 5 groups: A. No sports; B. No return in sports; C. Returning in sports but not in desired sport; D. Returning in desired sport, but not yet old level; E. Returning to old level in desired sport.</description>
