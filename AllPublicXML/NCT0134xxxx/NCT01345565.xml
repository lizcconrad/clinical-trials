      The purpose of this research study is to determine whether liver cell transplantation can
      provide help for patients with liver failure who are unlikely to survive without some form of
      liver support. The goal of this research study is to determine if liver cell transplants can
      be effective until a liver transplant is received or until patients recover from their liver
      failure.

    <textblock>
      Orthotopic liver transplantation has become the treatment of choice for patients with acute
      liver failure with poor prognostic signs. Survival following hepatic transplantation has
      improved in the last decade for a number of reasons. These include improvement in
      immunosuppression, improved methods for preserving and transporting organs, use of donors
      which had been previously considered unacceptable, use of reduced-sized grafts , and the use
      of living-donor hepatic transplantation. Despite encouraging survival statistics, there
      continues to be significant morbidity and mortality associated with hepatic transplantation.
      In addition, the success of hepatic transplantation has broadened the indications for this
      form of therapy without a concomitant increase in the number of donors available for these
      patients.

      Since the development of a method for isolating primary hepatocytes by collagenase perfusion,
      many investigators have demonstrated the efficacy of hepatocyte transplantation in the
      treatment of liver failure and inherited metabolic disorders in experimental animals.
      Treatment of liver diseases with transplantation of isolated hepatocytes rather than the
      whole liver has several theoretical advantages. Unlike the whole liver, isolated hepatocytes
      could be cryopreserved for instant availability and could be modified genetically or
      otherwise to enhance specific functions, stimulate proliferation or abrogate allograft
      rejection. Hepatocyte transplantation should be less stressful than whole liver
      transplantation because the host organ remains intact. Since the transplanted cells integrate
      into the host liver, they could provide restorative potential and the consequences of graft
      loss would be relatively minor. In addition, hepatocyte transplantation would not interfere
      with subsequent liver transplantation, should that become necessary.

    <description>The intrahepatic site for liver cell transplantation has been associated with the best engraftment and function based on animal experiments. Several approaches for access to the portal vein will be considered. The technique used will be determined based on what is considered best for the child based on risk/benefit at the time.
We propose to attempt to infuse approximately 5-10% of the hepatic mass in order to provide improved hepatic function. Since we do not yet know from our experience so far the correct number of cells to transplant in order to improve function, we will continue to infuse hepatocytes as donors become available until the patient improves to the point where they are no longer meet the criteria for organ transplantation. The subject will be evaluated de novo and if they are a candidate for orthotopic liver transplantation they will receive the transplant.</description>

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects will include those patients with ALF who are potential conventional liver
             transplant recipient candidates based on PELD criteria as well as those who would not
             be considered candidates for orthotopic liver transplantation (e.g. patients who
             appear to be too small or too ill for solid organ transplant or those who have a
             diagnosis that is a contradiction for whole organ transplantation, for example,
             systemic mitochondrial hepatopathy).

          -  If the patient is a candidate for orthotopic liver transplantation (per standard
             clinical criteria), they will be officially listed for liver transplantation as well
             as hepatocyte transplantation.

          -  If a subject is a potential conventional liver transplant recipient candidate and a
             donor liver is available; the patient will receive a solid organ transplant.

          -  Subjects ages 0-21 years old will be included in this study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        The patient has:

          1. Severe cardiovascular or respiratory disease at baseline and at the time of hepatocyte
             transplant as defined by

               1. Central venous pressure &gt;25 mm Hg or if known, pulmonary capillary wedge pressure
                  of &gt;30 mg Hg or

               2. Oxygen saturation of &lt;90% on &gt; 60% oxygen OR a P/F ratio (Po2/FiO2) of &lt;1.

          2. Hemodynamically significant gastrointestinal bleeding causing a systolic blood
             pressure &lt;70mmHg at the time of transplantation.

          3. Uncorrectable coagulopathy despite use of plasmapheresis that would preclude any
             invasive procedures.

          4. Leukopenia at the time of cell transplant, defined as an absolute neutrophil count of
             &lt;500/ÂµL.

          5. Known allergy to immunosuppression medications that are required post transplant
             procedure for the prevention of rejection.

          6. Active malignancy except those with acute liver failure during treatment with
             estimated life expectancies of &gt;1 year if the malignancy is controlled.

          7. Sepsis or other active infection except those without evidence of hemodynamically
             significant uncontrollable systemic sepsis with positive blood or tissue cultures.

          8. Intrauterine pregnancy. All females of childbearing potential will receive a pregnancy
             test prior to enrollment.
