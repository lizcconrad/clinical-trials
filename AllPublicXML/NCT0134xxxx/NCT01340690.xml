    <textblock>
      This study will determine the nutritional efficacy of Polyunsaturated Fatty Acids (PUFAs) in
      combination with zinc and magnesium, in children and adolescents diagnosed with Attention
      Deficit/ Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). The nutritional efficacy has to be proven in
      agreement with the German &quot;Verordnung über Diätetische Lebensmittel (DiätV)&quot; and the
      corresponding European Directive 1999/21/EC. This objective is reached by performing a
      placebo-controlled supplementation study with a main efficacy criterion which is also being
      used in pivotal studies of stimulant and non-stimulant drugs, i.e. the treatment differences
      between final visit and baseline in the Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder Rating
      Scale, Parent Version IV (ADHDRS-IV).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The syndrome of ADHD affects 5-6% of the children and adolescents worldwide. The hallmarks
      are inattention, impulsivity and hyperactivity. Due to parent's fear of significant adverse
      effects caused by stimulant or non-stimulant therapy a high degree of children with ADHD
      remains untreated. Recent observational studies showed that ADHD is often associated with
      decreased nutritional status of certain PUFAs, zinc and magnesium which might be due to
      metabolic disturbances in the case of fatty acids. First interventional studies revealed that
      a supplementation of these nutrients may affect ADHD-related disorders and might improve
      certain clinical parameters, such as concentration.

      Participants will be randomly assigned to receive either a nutritional supplement or placebo
      once a day for the duration of 84 days. Participants will come in for the assessment of ADHD
      symptoms, compliance and the assessment of secondary outcome variables. Side effects will be
      monitored continuously and also assessed by rating scales.
