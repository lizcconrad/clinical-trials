      This research trial studies phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate 3-kinase, catalytic subunit
      alpha (PIK3CA) mutation analysis in tissue samples from older patients with stage I breast
      cancer. Studying samples of tissue from patients with stage I breast cancer in the laboratory
      may help doctors learn more about changes that occur in deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) and
      identify biomarkers related to cancer.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      To assess the relapse free-survival difference between patients with PIK3CA mutated and
      wild-type (WT) tumors and therefore validate PIK3CA mutation status as an important biomarker
      in women 70 years or older diagnosed with breast cancer.

      OUTLINE:

      Previously collected tissue samples are analyzed via mutation analysis of PIK3CA.
