    <textblock>
      In order to improve the overall survival benefit observed with AZA in higher risk MDS, its
      combination with other active drugs in MDS must be tested.

      Among drugs that have demonstrated to be active as a single agent in MDS and have preclinical
      potential additive or synergistic activity with AZA are Histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors
      including Valproic acid, Lenalidomide and idarubicin. Phase I studies have already been
      conducted or are being conducted combining those agents to demethylating agents, showing a
      low toxicity profile and significant responses in high risk MDS. In this phase II randomized
      trial, we want to identify the most promising combination of Azacitidine and another drug
      (among 3 drugs: Valproic acid, Lenalidomide and Idarubicin) in higher risk MDS, by comparison
      to Azacitidine alone. Of note, based on efficacy and toxicity, one or several combinations
      may be stopped, and others, previously tested in phase I trials, included after protocol
      amendment.

      The main objective of this phase II randomized trial is to identify, among 3 combinations of
      Azacitidine and another drug evaluated simultaneously, the most promising combination(s) for
      the treatment of higher risk MDS (IPSS Int-2 and High) compared to Azacitidine alone. The 3
      tested drugs in combination with Azacitidine are: Valproic Acid, Lenalidomide and Idarubicin.

      The aim of this trial is to identify, in a situation where several potentially interesting
      drugs tested in combination with AZA exist, the most promising combination(s) based on
      efficacy compared to azacitidine alone, based on a two-stage design that allows a formal
      efficacy comparison between the K=3 investigational treatment groups and the control group.
