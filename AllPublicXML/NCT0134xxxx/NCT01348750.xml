  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized controlled 2 year trial at Camp Pendleton, CA to determine whether a
      complementary medicine intervention (Healing Touch with Guided Imagery, HT+GI) reduces
      Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) symptoms as compared to treatment as usual (TAU) in
      returning combat-exposed active duty military with significant PTSD symptoms. Secondary aims
      will evaluate the effect of HT and GI on measures of depression, hostility, and general
      health status in this population.

    <description>Healing Touch (HT) is an energy based approach to health and healing. It uses light touch to influence the energy field that surrounds the body, and the energy centers which control the flow of energy to the physical body.
HT complements traditional health care and is used together with other approaches to health and healing.
Guided Imagery (GI) is a form of focused relaxation used to create harmony between the mind and body. Positive mental imagery can promote relaxation, reduce stress and improve mood as well as alter heart rate, blood pressure and breathing.</description>
