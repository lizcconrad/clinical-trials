  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will examine whether 12 month treatment with entecavir(Baraclude®) has an effect
      on changes of liver stiffness measurement (LSM) and of hyaluronan measurement in patients
      with chronic hepatitis B infection.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with chronic hepatitis B infection and relevant liver fibrosis will be treated with
      entecavir during 5 years or until anti-HBs seroconversion or 6-12 months after anti-HBe
      seroconversion and HBeAg loss. There are 9 visits during treatment for each patient. At all
      visits, each patient will consent to give 20 ml blood sample for study examination and 40 ml
      blood sample for research purposes.
