    <textblock>
      TheraSphere is a medical device containing yttrium-90 (Y-90) a radioactive material that has
      been used to treat liver tumors. When Y-90 is put into very tiny glass beads (TheraSphere),
      it can be injected into the liver through a blood vessel. This allows a large local dose of
      radiation to be delivered to the tumor with less risk of toxic effects from radiation to
      other parts of the body or to healthy liver tissue.

    <textblock>
      Surgical resection of the affected portion of the liver offers the best chance for
      disease-free survival in patients with hepatoma (HCC). Unfortunately, most hepatoma patients
      present with disease that is not amenable to resection (multifocal disease) or have other
      medical contraindications to surgery (limited hepatic reserve related to advanced cirrhosis
      or chronic hepatitis). Fewer than 15%1 of hepatoma patients are suitable surgical candidates.

      The objective of treatment with TheraSphere is to selectively administer a potentially lethal
      dose of radioactive material to neoplastic tissue in the liver of patients with HCC. Regional
      therapies for HCC may have several advantages over systemically administered treatments.
      Irradiating a cancer prior to treatment with regional chemotherapy may be more effective than
      either therapeutic modality alone. TheraSphere may also be of value as a 'bridging' treatment
      for HCC patients awaiting a donor organ for liver transplantation.

    <description>Diagnostic imaging studies for assessment of tumor response will be performed according to usual standard of care as established by the referring oncologist. The principal clinician will be able to get a preliminary evaluation of tumor response in patients who return for subsequent treatment, as part of the imaging studies required for repeat safety screening of patients.</description>

The disease status, survival and safety status of all patients who receive TheraSphere treatment will be evaluated annually until death or 2 years post-treatment. In general, follow-up will be performed by the principal clinician. In the event of patient death, the date and cause of death will be recorded in the medical record (if possible).</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients over 18 years of age, of any race or sex, who have hepatocellular carcinoma
             of the liver

          -  Patients who are able to give informed consent, will be eligible.

          -  Patients must have an ECOG Performance Status score of &lt; or = 2

          -  Must have a life expectancy of &gt; 3 months

          -  Non-pregnant with an acceptable contraception in premenopausal women

          -  Patients must be &gt; 4 weeks since prior radiation or prior surgery and at least 1 month
             post chemotherapy

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Contraindications to angiography and selective visceral catheterization

          -  Evidence of potential delivery of greater than 16.5 mCi (30 Gy absorbed dose) per
             treatment of radiation to the lungs

          -  Evidence of any detectable Tc-99m MAA flow to the stomach or duodenum, after
             application of established angiographic techniques to stop or mitigate such flow (ex.
             placing catheter distal to gastric vessels)

          -  Significant extrahepatic disease representing an imminent life-threatening outcome

          -  Severe liver dysfunction or pulmonary insufficiency

          -  Active uncontrolled infection

          -  Significant underlying medical or psychiatric illness

          -  Pregnancy

          -  Patients will be excluded if they have pre-existing diarrhea/illness, or if they have
             a co-morbid disease or condition that would preclude safe delivery of TheraSphere
             treatment and place the patient at undue risk.
