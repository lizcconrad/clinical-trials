  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It has been recognized for many decades that high thyrotrophin (TSH) levels in pregnant women
      are associated with poor obstetric outcome. Also, there is evidence that high TSH is related
      to fetal position at term, including breech which in turn is associated with obstetric
      complications.

      However, the mechanism behind remains to be elucidated.

      The current project is of basic-fundamental nature. It is used to better understand basis
      physiological processes. As in many other studies of similar basic nature, few numbers are
      always included.

      If a TSH receptor will be detected, future randomized controlled trials (RCT) might be
      worthwhile with large numbers of women who will be treated with thyroxine to possibly prevent
      abnormal fetal position during normal pregnancy.

      The aim of the current study is to evaluate whether a TSH receptor can be demonstrated in
      human myometrium. If so, the pathophysiology of high TSH in relation to obstetric outcome
      will become more clear. Furthermore, the aim is to test the myometrium in vitro for its
      relaxation and contractility and for the conductance of electropotentials.

      It has been recognized for many decades that high thyrotrophin (TSH) levels in pregnant women
      are associated with poor obstetric outcome. Also, there is evidence that high TSH is related
      to fetal position at term, including breech which in turn is associated with obstetric
      complications.

      However, the mechanism behind remains to be elucidated. It has been shown that high TSH
      affects relaxation and contraction of the smooth muscle in large blood vessels in human. In
      animals, there is some evidence that TSH interferes with uterine contractility. Although a
      TSH receptor has been demonstrated outside the thyroid in bone, brain and heart, so far no
      research on a possible TSH receptor in human uterine tissue has been published.

      The current study is a pilot study in which in a limited number of participants (pregnant
      women, n=10) during elective Caesarean section a uterine specimen will be collected for
      analysis in a immune-laboratory.

      Another part of the specimen will be analysed in a technical laboratory(Technical University
      of Eindhoven)for analysing the relaxation and contractility of the myometrium and for
      studying the conductance of electropotentials.
