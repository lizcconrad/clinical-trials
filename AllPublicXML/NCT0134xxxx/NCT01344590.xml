    <textblock>
      Vascular access via central venous lines (CVL) is essential to the care of many patients in
      the intensive care setting. While the value of these lines for the management of critically
      ill patients is generally accepted, the potential for line-associated blood stream infection
      is a known complication of the use of this intervention.

      Ethanol is an effective antimicrobial agent with activity against a broad spectrum of human
      pathogens.

      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of daily treatment of the catheter
      lumen with ethanol to prevent central line associated blood stream infections (CLABSI). The
      hypothesis is that this treatment will reduce the incidence of CLABSI compared to maintenance
      of the lines with normal saline alone.

    <textblock>
      Blood stream infections are an important complication of the use of central venous lines
      (CVLs) and result in increased morbidity, mortality, and cost. Blood stream infections
      related to CVLs may be the result of migration of skin organisms along the catheter tract or
      introduction of organisms into the lumen of the catheter. The extraluminal route of infection
      appears to be most common early after catheter insertion while the frequency of infection
      acquired by the intraluminal route appears to increase the longer the catheter is in place.
      Meticulous attention to best practices for insertion and the subsequent care of the insertion
      site reduces infection by the extraluminal route. Adherence to good technique for entering
      the line may similarly reduce infection by the intraluminal route.

      Ethanol is an effective antimicrobial agent with activity against a broad spectrum of human
      pathogens; including the bacteria and fungi which most commonly infect CVLs. The mechanism of
      the antimicrobial activity of ethanol is attributed to the ability to denature proteins and
      induced resistance to the effect of ethanol has not been reported. These features suggest
      that ethanol-lock is a promising approach to the prevention of acquisition of central line
      associated blood stream infections by the intraluminal route.

    <description>The primary endpoint of the study will be the effectiveness of ethanol for prevention of CLABSI compared to routine care. This will be assessed at the end of the study (12 months)by comparing the number of beds being maintained by each regimine to determine if the distribution of line maintenance regimines is non-random in favor of either ethanol lock or saline maintenance.</description>

        Although this study is done in the patient-care setting, patients are not the subject of
        the study. The outcome of interest involves the development of CLABSI in patients but the
        intervention is directed at the patient's central lines rather than the patient. There are
        no inclusion or exclusion criteria; the determination of the line care regimen will be
        determined by the bed assignment rather than any characteristics of the patient occupying
        the bed.

        All central line will be included in this study. Use of ethanol will be suspended whenever
        the usage of the line precludes instillation of ethanol with a dwell time of al least one
        hour.
