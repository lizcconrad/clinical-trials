      Obtain phenotypic data and a DNA/blood sample from mood disorder patients undergoing
      pioglitazone or quetiapine XR treatment as a part of an IRB approved clinical trial conducted
      at the Mood Disorders Program. Pioglitazone treatment is examined in metabolic syndrome
      comorbid with bipolar depression (IRB # 07-08-24) and unipolar depression (IRB # 07-07-20).
      Quetiapine XR treatment is examined in generalized anxiety disorder comorbid with bipolar
      depression (IRB # 10-06-19) and unipolar depression (IRB # 12-01-29). Please refer to the
      respective IRB protocols for more information.

        A total of 310 subjects between the ages of 18 and 70 will be targeted for enrollment. We
        anticipate a low enrollment rate of 200 from the targeted 310 participants. Eligible
        participants will be diagnosed with DSM-IV bipolar disorder (type I, II, or not otherwise
        specified) or DSM-IV major depressive disorder, as determined by extensive clinical
        interview and the Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview-Plus (MINI-Plus).
        Participants will be approached for enrollment if they are currently enrolled in one of
        four studies: IRB protocol numbers 10-06-19, 12-07-29, 07-07-20, and 07-08-24. Please see
        these protocols for additional study specific information.
