      The objective of the study is to evaluate the relative bioavailability of lovastatin and its
      ß-hydroxy acid of 600 mg LipoCol Forte® Capsules compared to that of one 20 mg Mevacor®
      Tablet after single oral administration in healthy subjects using a 2x2 crossover design.

      Healthy subjects were randomly allocated to receive a single dose of either four 600 mg red
      yeast rice capsules or one 20 mg lovastatin tablet; after 7-day washout period, they received
      a single dose of the alternative drug. The subjects were fasted at least 10 hour before
      dosing. The investigational products were administered with 240 mL of water with the subject
      in an upright position. The blood samples were collected at prior to the drug administration
      (T0), and 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 4, 6, 8 and 12 hours after dosing.

    <description>Plasma concentration of lovastatin and lovastatin acid were detected at following time: (Pre-dose (T0) and at 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 4, 6, 8 and 12 hours after oral administration of red yeast rice capsules (LipoCol) and lovastatin tablet.) All pharmacokinetic parameters were determined with lovastatin and lovastatin acid concentrations by non-compartment methods.</description>
