  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to examine the relevance of biochemical markers (specific
      pulmonary and cardiac markers and markers of endogenous stress) in the process of weaning in
      patients with artificial ventilation.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Artificially ventilated patients on our intensive care unit will be monitored if specific
      biomarkers have a relevance in risk stratification, optimizing therapy, outcome and success
      in the process of weaning. Therefore, consecutively, specific blood parameters will be taken
      at time of intubation,day 1 of weaning and extubation.
