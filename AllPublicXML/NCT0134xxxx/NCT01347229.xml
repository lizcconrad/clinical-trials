      The purpose of the study is to evaluate changes in intraocular pressure (IOP) between sitting
      and supine body positions and correlate the values obtained with conventional tonometers to
      the output provided by the investigational device.

      20 subjects will be enrolled in the investigation. Eligible subjects will receive one session
      of 22-hour continuous IOP monitoring with SENSIMED Triggerfish® in ambulatory mode, with body
      position transitions carried out in-hospital. SENSIMED Triggerfish® will be installed
      randomly on right or left eyes and the IOP recording will be initiated as soon as the
      adaptation of the device on the subject's eye is satisfying. Subjects will then go home. The
      next morning, subjects will return to the hospital and during SENSIMED Triggerfish®
      monitoring on one eye, IOP measurements will be taken in the fellow eye in sitting position
      using Goldmann, tonopen and pneuma-tonometers. Then subjects will lie down on a flat bed.
      After 15 ± 5 minutes and again after 45 ± 5 minutes IOP will be measured in supine position,
      using Goldmann, tonopen, pneuma-tonometer and Perkins tonometers. Then subjects will sit up
      again. After 30 ± 5 minutes IOP will be measured with the Goldmann tonometer.
