      The main goal of this study is to examine the comparative effectiveness of diabetes
      prevention strategies in women with Gestational Diabetes Mellitus (GDM) on the control of the
      following conditions: obesity, hyperglycemia, hypertension and depression. This randomized
      lifestyle intervention study will be conducted at Kaiser Permanente Northern California.
      Women in the intervention will receive a letter on gestational weight gain during pregnancy
      and in the postpartum period, a curriculum of individualized lifestyle counseling via
      telephone, augmented with e-mail and an interactive Web site. Patients randomized to the
      usual care arm will receive the standard-care telephone calls from the Perinatal Center
      during pregnancy and the Center's printed educational materials postpartum. Outcomes will be
      assessed through the electronic medical record and patient surveys conducted during pregnancy
      and at 6-weeks, 6- months and 1-year postpartum.

    <description>Will be the proportion of women who reach their postpartum weight goal (based on their pre-pregnancy weight) and the total amount of weight change (in kilograms).
Weight goals:
a) reaching pre-pregnancy weight if women had a normal pre-pregnancy weight; or b) achieving a 5% reduction from pre-pregnancy weight if overweight or obese prior to pregnancy.</description>
