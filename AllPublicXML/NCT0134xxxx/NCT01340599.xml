  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This randomized pilot phase II trial studies the side effects and how well defined green tea
      catechin extract works in treating patients with localized prostate cancer undergoing
      surgery. Defined green tea catechin extract contains ingredients that may prevent or slow the
      growth of certain cancers.

      OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the short-term effects of daily Polyphenon E (defined green tea catechin
      extract) administration (800 mg epigallocatechin-3-gallate [EGCG] once daily [QD]) during the
      interval between prostate biopsy and radical prostatectomy (approximately 6 weeks) in men
      with localized prostate cancer.

      II. Compare the change in levels of intermediate biomarkers (Ki-67, B-cell lymphoma 2 [Bcl2],
      cyclin D, KiP1/P27, vascular endothelial growth factor [VEGF], and cluster of differentiation
      [CD]31) in biopsy (pre-treatment) and prostatectomy (post-treatment) specimens collected from
      subjects treated with Polyphenon E or placebo during the period between biopsy and
      prostatectomy.

      III. Compare the change in pre- and post-treatment serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA)
      level in subjects treated with Polyphenon E or placebo during the period between biopsy and
      prostatectomy.

      IV. Evaluate bioavailability of catechins from Polyphenon E (plasma and tissue catechin
      levels, catechin metabolites in urine).

      V. Evaluate the safety and tolerability of Polyphenon E in this subject population.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

      ARM I: Patients receive defined green tea catechin extract orally (PO) QD for 4-10 weeks in
      the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients undergo radical
      prostatectomy between days 28-70.

      ARM II: Patients receive placebo PO QD for 4-10 weeks in the absence of disease progression
      or unacceptable toxicity. Patients undergo radical prostatectomy between days 28-70.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up periodically.

    <measure>Change in levels of intermediate biomarkers in prostate tissue (Ki-67, Bcl2, cyclin D, KiP1/P27, VEGF, and CD31) during treatment with defined green tea catechin extract or placebo during the period between biopsy and prostatectomy</measure>

    <description>PSA exists in the serum in different molecular forms and that the proportion of &quot;complexed&quot; PSA (PSA-ACT) to &quot;free&quot; PSA(F-PSA) is higher in prostate cancer patients [16]. F-PSA-to-PSA ratio remains constant in men without prostate cancer while total PSA increases. This F-PSA to-PSA ratio is useful diagnostic tool with borderline total PSA values (4.0 to 10.0 ng/mL); additionally values of 20% to 25% F-PSA eliminates 1/3 of biopsies in some studies; and F-PSA of 15.6% and PSA-ACT of 26.7% yielded 95% sensitivity [17]. The F-PSA-to-PSA ratio does not correlate to grade or stage of cancer.</description>

Liver function tests including the Hepatic Function Panel [Alanine Aminotransferase (ALT), Albumin, Alkaline Phosphatase (ALP), Aspartate Aminotransferace (AST), total and direct Bilirubin], as well as amylase and lipase tests will be monitored at baseline and every four (4) weeks for the duration of the study.</description>
