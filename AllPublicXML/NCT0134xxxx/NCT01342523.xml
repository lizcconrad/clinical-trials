    <textblock>
      This is an evaluative study of three National Cancer Institute (NCI) smoking cessation
      resources: specifically, the smokefree.gov and women smokefree.gov websites, and the CIS
      counseling phone calls. The following are the identified critical questions: (1). How
      effective is each of the tobacco interventions (websites [smokefree.gov &amp; women
      smokefree.gov], NCI's Cessation Quitline counseling services operated by the Cancer
      Information Service (CIS) (2). How do they compare with alternative intervention strategies?
      (3). Which types of interventions appear to work best together (due to additive or
      interactive effects)? (4). How do these interventions work? (5). How much are these
      interventions used, and what are their relative use rates? (6). Are there important
      differences in effectiveness or use rates as a function of gender, SES, or other important
      person factors? We believe that the research study will address all of these questions, as
      well as some less central ones.

      This an evaluative study of three National Cancer Institute (NCI) smoking cessation
      resources: specifically, the smokefree.gov and women smokefree.gov websites, and the CIS
      counseling phone calls. The following are the identified critical questions: (1). How
      effective is each of the tobacco interventions (websites [smokefree.gov &amp; women
      smokefree.gov], NCI's Cessation Quitline counseling services operated by the Cancer
      Information Service (CIS) (2). How do they compare with alternative intervention strategies?
      (3). Which types of interventions appear to work best together (due to additive or
      interactive effects)? (4). How do these interventions work? (5). How much are these
      interventions used, and what are their relative use rates? (6). Are there important
      differences in effectiveness or use rates as a function of gender, SES, or other important
      person factors? We believe that the research study will address all of these questions, as
      well as some less central ones.

      The primary goal of this research is to obtain experimental data on the effectiveness of the
      major eHealth and communication smoking cessation interventions (smokefree.gov, women
      smokefree.gov, and NCI's Quitline counseling services). The primary bases for comparison
      would be quit attempts and cessation success, and each intervention would be compared with a
      control condition not receiving the intervention. In addition to the targeted interventions,
      participants may also be assigned to several different comparison interventions: i.e., email
      prompts, mailings/brochures, and OTC nicotine medication. The resulting data would allow us
      to determine effect sizes for each type of intervention relative to a control condition,
      which would allow us to determine the relative effectiveness of each intervention: i.e., how
      well the interventions stack-up against one another in terms of effect sizes.

      Secondary goals of this research are to:

        1. . Determine how much the participants use the interventions;

        2. . Determine the mechanisms of benefit (perform meditational analyses);

        3. . Compare benefits for important smoker populations;

        4. . Determine whether any of the interventions produce subtractive or synergistic effects;
           and

        5. . Obtain basic health economic estimates such as cost/quitter.

      The project will also include a substudy directed toward pregnant women and women who are
      interested in participating but are unwilling to agree to utilize approved contraceptive
      methods for the duration of the study. This substudy will utilize all of the treatment
      conditions except the medication condition, since medication is not recommended for women who
      are pregnant in the US. Department of Health and Human Services treatment guideline for
      tobacco dependence

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

        (1). Interest in quitting smoking within the next 30 days, but not already actively engaged
        in quitting (e.g., subject should not be currently participating in other cessation
        counseling or taking cessation medication treatment for the purpose of a quit attempt);
        (2). The person has a phone and has home internet access; (3). The person has an email
        address that can be used to send assessments, and deliver email prompts; (4). The person
        expresses willingness to provide assessment information and have his/her computer use of
        the assigned website tracked; (5). There are contraindications to over the counter nicotine
        replacement therapy (NRT) use (e.g., pregnancy); (6). The person smokes ≥ 5 cpd; (7). The
        person is ≥ 18 years;(8). The person accesses the internet with no more than 3
        computers/devices (including devices such as iPads and smartphones); and (9). No other
        members of the person's household are participating in the NCI website evaluation. (The age
        restriction is due to the possible assignment to medication, which is not recommended for
        adolescents.) Subjects will not have to express an interest in using NRT. They may be sent
        NRT depending upon experimental assignment, but a commitment to use medication is not a
        requirement of participation. Also, pregnant smokers, or those who believe they may become
        pregnant, can participate, but they will be randomly assigned to only the non-medication
        treatments and participate only in the substudy. [They will not be included in the regular
        data analyses, and power will be too small to permit meaningful inferential tests. However,
        effect sizes in this small group of smokers will be determined for comparison with the
        effect sizes obtained in the main study.] Due to limitations in the volume of new calls
        that can be handled in the phone counseling component, recruitment will not exceed 300 per
        month. When monthly recruitment goal has been met, the recruitment invitation will be
        turned off until the following month. At the point where it is necessary to achieve the
        desired (50/50) gender balance, the invitation to participate in the study will be
        restricted by sex until full enrollment is achieved.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        (1). If the person has no interest in quitting smoking within the next 30 days or if the
        person is actively engaged in quitting (e.g., subject is currently participating in other
        cessation counseling or taking cessation medication treatment for the purpose of a quit
        attempt); (2). Person does not have a phone or home internet access; (3). The person does
        not have an email address that can be used to send assessments, and deliver email prompts;
        (4). The person is not willing to provide assessment information and have his/her computer
        use of the assigned website tracked; (5). There are contraindications to over the counter
        nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) use (e.g., pregnancy); (6). The person smokes &lt; 5 cpd;
        (7). The person is &lt;18 years;(8). The person accesses the internet with more than 4
        computers (including devices such as iPads and smartphones); and (9). One or more members
        of the person's household are already participating in the NCI website evaluation. (The age
        restriction is due to the possible assignment to medication, which is not recommended for
        adolescents.)

      <pre_assignment_details>Prior to randomization, potential participants were asked to make a &quot;confirmation&quot; call to an automated answering system to confirm willingness to perform study procedures. The call was intended to increase the likelihood that individuals would take treatment and follow-up calls. Randomization occurred immediately after the confirmation call.</pre_assignment_details>

These proactive calls initiated by CIS included an initial call (30 min), occurring within 3 days of enrollment, plus 4 additional counseling calls (up to 15 min each) scheduled to occur on the quit day or the day after, and then weekly for the next 3 weeks. The content of the counseling calls focused initially on motivating quitting and then setting a quit date, providing support, building self-efficacy, and skill training. The CIS intervention group will be compared to a &quot;No CIS&quot; group. The original randomization plan called for approximately half of the total sample of 1034 participants to be randomized to this intervention group (CIS) and the other half to the No CIS intervention group. However, due to a problem in the electronic transfer of data from the research coordinating site to CIS, 453 participants were randomized to CIS and 581 to the &quot;No CIS&quot; group.</description>

In addition, the active website offered encouragement and support, motivational information, and interactive features and referral links. The active website did not include direct interaction with users (e.g. live help) or interactive audio or video content. User-engagement features included task charts for behavior change, self-monitoring tools (e.g. for cravings and self-assessment), creation of a personal calendar, links to a quitline or to a counselor via text message for live help and social support through social media. No tailoring, feedback or outbound reminders were in use. Approximately half of the total sample of 1034 participants was randomized to receive the Full Smoke</description>
