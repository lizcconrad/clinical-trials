  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research is being done because the investigators are trying to examine the safety and
      effectiveness of this wound cleaning liquid, CACD (chlorine dioxide). The investigators are
      trying to see if this liquid has the ability to decrease infection rates and decrease the
      scarring effects from the healing process. In animal studies, CACD has been shown to decrease
      scar formation and decrease the risk of wound infections. CACD is also used for the treatment
      of burns to decrease infection rates and improve wound healing. CACD is not FDA approved for
      this specific use, but it is FDA and USDA approved for reducing bacterial contamination on
      meat and food products for human consumption. In addition, an investigational drug (IND)
      application has been submitted to the FDA for this study. The FDA has approved the use of
      this solution for this study.

    <time_frame>72 hrs post-ED visit</time_frame>
    <description>Cosmesis will be assessed by taking pictures of the wound at presentation, upon receiving sutures, 48-72 hrs later, and 3-4 mths later. At 3-4 mths the patient will rate how well they think the wound healed, via a visual analog scale. At that time, two blinded ER physicians will do this as well. They will also designate a wound evaulation score, based on criteria that will be provided to them. Two blinded plastic surgeons will assess all photographs, visual analog scores. and wound evaluation scores, and provide their own visual analog scale assessment of how well each wound healed.</description>
