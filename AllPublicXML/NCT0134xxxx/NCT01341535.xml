    <textblock>
      The investigators hypothesize that treatment adaptation to biological and anatomical changes,
      occurring during treatment, can increase the chance of cure at minimized or equal
      radiation-induced toxicity in head and neck cancer patients. This trial compares standard
      intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT), using only pre-treatment planning
      18F-2-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose positron emission tomography to adaptive
      18F-2-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose positron emission tomography voxel intensity based IMRT or
      volumetric-modulated arc therapy (VMAT) using repetitive per-treatment planning
      18F-2-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose positron emission tomography for head and neck cancer.
