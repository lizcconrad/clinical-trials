    <textblock>
      This open-label phase I dose escalation trial, 1230.15, is the first trial with Volasertib in
      Japanese advanced cancer patients. The trial will investigate the maximum tolerated dose
      (MTD), safety, tolerability, and preliminary efficacy of this specific polo-like kinase 1
      (Plk1) inhibitor in advanced cancer patients.
