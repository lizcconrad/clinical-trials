  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Recent dysvascular and diabetic amputees as well as older, long-term traumatic amputees are
      at risk of functional decline, joint degeneration, skin breakdown and further limb loss due
      to the forces placed on the contralateral limb through prosthetic ambulation. If specialized
      prosthetic gait training and proper use of the appropriate prosthetic foot can decrease
      forces on the intact limb, the long term health and quality of life of veterans with
      amputations could be substantially improved. We will address two key questions:

      Key Question 1: After receiving specialized gait training and a new prosthetic socket, will
      subjects demonstrate differences in gait symmetry and external mechanical work between the
      bionic and conventional prosthetic feet, while performing various functional activities.

      Key Question 2: Can external mechanical work be used as a clinically friendly measure to
      differentiate between prosthetic feet?

      The study examined the application of outcome measures to determine changes in function of
      unilateral transtibial amputees (TTAs) caused by specialized functional prosthetic training
      (training) and the use of four different prosthetic feet. Two self-report measures i.e. the
      Prosthetic Evaluation Questionnaire (PEQ-13) and Locomotor Capability Index (LCI-5), and
      three performance-based measures i.e. the Amputee Mobility Predictor (AMPPRO), Six-minute
      Walk Test (6MWT), and Step Activity Monitor (SAM) were utilized. Healthy unilateral
      Transtibial Amputees between the age of 40-65 will participate in the study. Subjects were
      tested at baseline, after receiving training with their existing prosthesis, and with the
      study socket and four prosthetic feet i.e. SACH, SAFE, Talux and PROPRIO FOOT over an 8-10
      week period. Training was administered between testing sessions.
