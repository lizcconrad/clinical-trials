      This open label, two period, crossover study will evaluate the safety and the effect of food
      on the pharmacokinetics of RO5428029 in healthy volunteers. In a crossover design, healthy
      subjects will be randomized to receive a single oral dose of RO5428029 with or without food,
      with a washout period of at least 7 days between dosing and a follow-up of 7 to 10 days after
      last dose. Anticipated time on study will be up to 21 days.
