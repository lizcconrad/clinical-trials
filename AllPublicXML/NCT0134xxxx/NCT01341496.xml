  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:

      - A tumor cell vaccine is an experimental cancer treatment. Cancer cells are collected from a
      patient and then used to develop a vaccine. The vaccine will produce an immune system
      response to help destroy other cancer cells in the body. Researchers are studying ways to
      improve these tumor cell vaccines. One way is to add an adjuvant. An adjuvant is a substance
      that brings about a stronger immune system response. ISCOMATRIX is an adjuvant that has been
      used safely in other clinical studies. But it has not been studied with certain tumor cell
      vaccines. Researchers want to find out whether a tumor cell vaccine with ISCOMATRIX, given
      along with cancer drug treatment, is a safe and effective way to slow or prevent tumor growth
      after tumor removal surgery.

      Objectives:

      - To assess the safety and effectiveness of tumor cell vaccines given with ISCOMATRIX and
      drug therapy after tumor removal surgery.

      Eligibility:

      - People at least 18 years of age who have had tumor cell vaccines developed from cells taken
      from surgically removed tumors.

      Design:

        -  Patients will be screened with a physical examination, medical history, blood and urine
           tests, and imaging studies.

        -  Patients will be treated with cyclophosphamide (once daily) and celecoxib (twice daily)
           for 7 days before the first vaccine dose.

        -  Patients will receive the tumor cell vaccine once a month for 6 months. They will
           continue to receive drug therapy throughout the vaccine treatment. Patients will be
           monitored with regular blood tests and imaging studies.

        -  After the first 6 months, patients who have an immune response to the vaccine will
           continue treatment with the vaccine and chemotherapy. They will also have regular blood
           tests and imaging studies. They will have this treatment for up to 24 months from the
           first vaccination or until they no longer have an immune response.

        -  Participants will have followup visits for up to 5 years after the first vaccination, or
           until the tumor returns.

      Background:

      Cancer-testis (CT) antigens (CTAs) have emerged as attractive targets for cancer
      immunotherapy. Whereas cancers of various histologies exhibit CTA expression, primary or
      vaccine-induced immune responses to these antigens appear uncommon in patients with these
      malignancies, possibly due to low-level, heterogeneous antigen expression, and inadequate
      vaccination strategies. Because numerous CT antigens can be induced in tumor cells by DNA
      demethylating agents and HDAC inhibitors, it is conceivable that vaccination of cancer
      patients with autologous tumor cells exposed to chromatin remodeling agents will enhance
      anti-tumor immunity in these individuals. In order to examine this issue, patients undergoing
      complete resection of sarcomas, melanomas, germ cell tumors and epithelial malignancies
      metastatic to the lungs, pleura or mediastinum will be vaccinated with autologous tumor cells
      exposed ex-vivo to decitabine and radiation following completion of appropriate combined
      modality therapy. Vaccines will be administered in conjunction with ISCOMATRIX adjuvant as
      well as metronomic oral cyclophosphamide (50 mg PO BID x 7d q 14d), and celecoxib (400 mg PO
      BID). Serologic responses to a variety of recombinant CTAs as well as delayed type
      hypersensitivity to autologous epigenetically modified tumor cells will be assessed before
      and after vaccination.

      Primary Objective:

      -To assess the safety of an epigenetically modified autologous tumor cell vaccine
      administered with ISCOMATRIX adjuvant in combination with metronomic oral cyclophosphamide
      and celecoxib in patients undergoing thoracic metastasectomy.

      Eligibility:

        -  Patients with histologically or cytologically proven or clinically evident sarcoma,
           melanoma, or epithelial malignancies metastatic to lungs, pleura or mediastinum who can
           be rendered no evidence of disease (NED) by metastasectomy.

        -  Patients must be 18 years or older with an ECOG performance status of 0 2, without
           evidence of unstable or decompensated myocardial disease. Patients must have adequate
           pulmonary reserve evidenced by FEV1 and DLCO equal to or greater than 30% predicted;
           pCO2 less than 50 mm Hg and pO2 greater than 60 mm Hg on room air ABG; and be on no
           immunosuppressive medications except inhaled corticosteroids at the time vaccination
           commences.

        -  Patients must have a platelet count greater than 100,000, an ANC equal to or greater
           than 1500 without transfusion or cytokine support, a normal PT, and adequate hepatic
           function as evidenced by a total bilirubin of &lt;1.5 x upper limits of normal. Serum
           creatinine less than or equal to 1.6 mg/ml or the creatinine clearance must be greater
           than 70 ml/min/1.73m(2) at the time vaccination commences.

      Design:

        -  Patients will undergo thoracic metastasectomy using standard of practice guidelines.

        -  Portions of the resected tumors will be transferred to the Thoracic Oncology Laboratory.
           Cells will be processed to establish a cancer cell line.

        -  Following recovery from surgery and appropriate adjuvant chemotherapy and/or radiation,
           patients will be vaccinated with epigenetically-modified autologous tumor cells
           periodically over 6 months in conjunction with metronomic oral cyclophosphamide and
           celecoxib.

        -  Systemic toxicities and delayed type hypersensitivity responses to autologous tumor
           cells and serologic responses to a variety of CT antigens will be assessed before and
           after vaccination.

        -  Patients will be followed with routine staging scans until disease recurrence.

        -  As the exact set of comparisons and analyses to be performed will be determined
           following completion of the trial, and will be based on limited numbers of patients, the
           analyses will be considered exploratory and hypothesis generating rather than
           definitive.

        -  Approximately 80 patients will be accrued to this trial in order to obtain up to 20
           evaluable patients.

        INCLUSION CRITERIA PRIOR TO SURGERY (SCREENING CONSENT):

          1. Patients with clinically evident or histologically proven sarcomas, melanomas, germ
             cell tumors, or epithelial malignancies metastatic to the lungs, mediastinum, or
             pleura who can be rendered no evidence of active disease (NED) following standard
             surgical therapy. Note: Patients with active disease outside the thorax may be
             eligible for the study once the extrathoracic disease is definitively treated by local
             modalities such as radiation, surgery, or radiofrequency ablation.

          2. Patients must have received or refused first line standard systemic therapy for their
             metastases.

          3. Patients with no more than 3 intracranial metastases, which have been definitively
             treated by surgery or radiation therapy may be eligible for study provided there is no
             evidence of active disease for at least 2 months.

          4. Patients must have an ECOG performance status of 0 2.

          5. Patients must be 18 years of age or older due to the unknown effects of immunologic
             responses to germ cell-restricted gene products during childhood and adolescent
             development.

          6. Seronegative for HIV antibody. Note: The experimental treatment being evaluated in
             this protocol depends on an intact immune system. Patients who are HIV seropositive
             can have decreased immune competence and thus may be less responsive to the
             experimental treatment.

          7. Seronegative for active hepatitis B, and seronegative for hepatitis C antibody. If
             hepatitis C antibody test is positive, then patient must be tested for the presence of
             antigen by RT-PCR and be HCV RNA negative.

          8. Patients must be aware of the neoplastic nature of their illnesses, the experimental
             nature of the therapy, alternative treatments, potential benefits, and risks.

          9. Patients must be willing to sign an informed consent and undergo resection of their
             malignancies at the NCI, to ensure vaccine development.

        INCLUSION CRITERIA FOR TREATMENT PHASE OF PROTOCOL (Standard Consent):

          1. Patients must have signed the Screening Consent.

          2. NCI Laboratory of Pathology confirmation of diagnosis of sarcomas, melanomas, germ
             cell tumors, or epithelial malignancies metastatic to the lungs, mediastinum, or
             pleura must have been obtained

          3. Patients who were initially rendered NED by surgical resection must remain NED at the

             treated by surgery or radiation therapy may be eligible for the study, provided there
             is no evidence of active disease for at least 2 months and no requirement for
             anticonvulsant therapy or steroids following treatment.

          5. Patients must have an ECOG performance status of 0 2.

          6. Patients must have evidence of adequate bone marrow reserve, hepatic and renal

          7. Seronegative for HIV antibody. Note: The experimental treatment being evaluated in
             this protocol depends on an intact immune system.

             Patients who are HIV seropositive can have decreased immune competence and thus may be
             less responsive to the experimental treatment.

          8. Seronegative for active hepatitis B, and seronegative for hepatitis C antibody. If
             hepatitis C antibody test is positive, then patient must be tested for the presence of
