      The objectives of this study are:

        -  To investigate if the endogenous cholesterol metabolite, 4beta-OHcholesterol could be
           used as a marker for induction of cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4.

        -  To compare 4beta-OHcholesterol with midazolam as a marker for induction of CYP3A4.

    <description>The primary objective of the study is to investigate whether the endogenous cholesterol metabolite 4β-hydroxycholesterol could be used as a marker for induction of CYP3A4. For this purpose the induction of 4β-hydroxycholesterol formation will be compared to the induction of quinine and midazolam metabolism.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Ratio between midazolam AUC induced and midazolam AUC uninduced</measure>
    <time_frame>Before treatment with rifampicin and after 14 days of treatment with rifampicin</time_frame>
    <description>Secondary aim of the study is to compare 4β-hydroxycholesterol as a biomarker for CYP3A4 compared to 6β-hydroxycortisol/cortisol ratio, which sometimes is used as a marker for CYP3A4 induction.
Another secondary aim is to relate our estimations of CYP3A4-expression to measured levels of 25-OH-vitamin D.</description>
