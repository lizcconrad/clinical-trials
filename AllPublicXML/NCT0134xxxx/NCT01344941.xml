      The primary objectives of this study is to

        -  Define the envelope-specific B-cell and T-cell responses in humans who have received a
           St. Jude HIV-1 vaccine.

        -  Describe mechanisms of HIV-1 envelope processing and consequent B-cell and T-cell
           activities.

      The goal of this protocol is to understand how human lymphocytes respond to HIV-1 antigens in
      the context of vaccination or infection. This protocol will support understanding of the
      immune response by providing a source of lymphocytes and serum from selected individuals to
      study in laboratory based investigations. Blood samples from individuals who have received an
      HIV-1 vaccine, individuals who are HIV-1-infected, and individuals who are HIV-1-uninfected
      are requested to: (1) test previously vaccinated volunteers for HIV-1 envelope-specific
      B-cell and T-cell immune activities, and (2) increase understanding of how the human immune
      system processes and responds to HIV-1 envelope proteins.

    <measure>Specific B cell and T cell responses in humans who received St Jude HIV-1 Vaccine</measure>
    <time_frame>5 years</time_frame>
    <description>The outcome measures will be assessed in such a way that individuals will be sampled longitudinally (every 6months) until the immune response is no longer detectable by HIV ELISA or until the 5 year study period is complete, whichever comes first. A volume of 120 ml will be collected at each visit for immune response assays (both B-cell and T-cell) and 2 ml of blood will be collected for the HIV ELISA.</description>

    <measure>Mechanism of HIV-1 envelope processing B cell and T cell activities</measure>
    <time_frame>5 years</time_frame>
    <description>The outcome measures will be assessed by new developments in the field that may ultimately yield improved methods for the testing of antigen processing and B-cell and T-cell functions, in which case new assays will be adopted for use in this study. Lymphocyte samples will also support HLA testing. Samples will be used for continued B-cell and T-cell studies supportive of the 2 study objectives. The volume of blood drawn will be closely monitored and will remain below the defined criteria for minimal risk research.</description>

      Maximally, there will be up to 30 draws per study participant with no more than 120 ml of
      blood collected at any one time and no more than 2.5 L collected for the entire study.
      Samples will be used for continued B-cell and T-cell studies supportive of the 2 study
      objectives. The volume of blood drawn will be closely monitored and will remain below the

        Group 1: Previous St. Jude HIV-1 vaccine study participants will be contacted by phone by
        study investigators or their designees to assess interest in participation in this
        protocol.

        Group 2: Participants will be recruited from those receiving care for their HIV infection
        in the Translational Trials Unit at St. Jude.

        Group 3: Participants will be recruited from the Memphis community. Recruitment will occur
        on College and University campuses, from community groups, through word-of-mouth, and
        through the use of a study brochure.
