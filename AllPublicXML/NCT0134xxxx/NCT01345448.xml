  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and effectiveness in lowering intraocular
      pressure (IOP) utilizing an experimental lotion containing 0.1% Brimonidine that is applied
      to the outside of one eyelid.

      Glaucoma is the leading cause of irreversible blindness worldwide, with primary open-angle
      glaucoma the most common form of glaucoma. Vision loss is caused by damage to the optic
      nerve. The modern goals of glaucoma management are to avoid glaucomatous damage, nerve
      damage, preserve visual field and total quality of life for patients with minimal side
      effects.

      Although intraocular pressure is only one of the major risk factors for glaucoma, lowering it
      via various pharmaceuticals and/or surgical techniques is currently the mainstay of glaucoma
      treatment. Intraocular pressure can be lowered with medication, usually eye drops. There are
      several different classes of medications to treat glaucoma with several different medications
      in each class. In order to prevent blindness from glaucoma, it is critical that patients take
      their glaucoma eye drops accurately and faithfully for the rest of their lives. Poor
      compliance with medications and follow-up visits is a major reason for vision loss in
      glaucoma patients. In addition, coordination involved in placing an eye drop in the eye is
      considerably more difficult and unpleasant to patients than many other therapies. Thus,
      localized transdermal eyelid lotion would create a leap in safety of drug delivery while at
      the same time rendering ocular drugs easy and non traumatic to use.
