      When babies are premature, or born before they are fully developed, they face many different
      medical problems, some of which are quite devastating, such as cerebral palsy, mental
      retardation, blindness, deafness, severe intestinal problems, and developmental delays.
      Unfortunately, in more than half the cases of premature births, there is no procedure or test
      that an obstetrician can employ to predict if a fetus is at risk for premature birth,
      especially when the mother is healthy. This study seeks to determine if certain factors found
      in the urine undergo specific changes that can be used to detect premature births of this
      type before they happen.

      In this study, the investigators will identify women with a history of preterm delivery
      between 24-32 weeks, 32-34, and 34-36 weeks gestation based on diagnosis codes in the medical
      record who are currently pregnant. The investigators will ask these women when they are in
      the 16-20 week into their pregnancy to fill out a questionaire to determine study
      eligibility. If chosen to participate, the investigators will ask them to collect their first
      morning urine samples before each of their remaining prenatal care appointments for our
      studies. The investigators will also ask them if the investigators can check their medical
      records to determine if they later had a premature baby. If these women in either group give
      birth prematurely, then the investigators will analyze the glycoproteins in their urine
      samples using known values from women who did not have a premature birth as controls. If the
      investigators can see any changes in glycosylation in the women who gave birth prematurely,
      then this information will be used to apply for a larger study that will determine if such
      changes apply to all women. If it can then be shown to apply to all women, then the
      investigators may use it to predict preterm delivery. This information would allow physicians
      to design treatments to help these women and their babies, and spare them these disabilities.
      Some women go into labor prematurely, well before they should give birth. Physicians can
      intervene in some cases to stop labor, and allow the fetus to develop further in the mother's
      womb. However, in more than half the cases the physician cannot stop this process, and the
      baby is born prematurely.
