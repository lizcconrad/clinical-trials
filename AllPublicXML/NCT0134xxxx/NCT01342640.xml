  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This single arm, open label, multicenter study will evaluate the safety and change in
      hemoglobin levels of Mircera (C.E.R.A.; methoxy polyethylene glycol-epoetin beta) in patients
      with chronic renal anemia who are not on dialysis. Patients will receive as a recommended
      starting dose 1.2 micrograms of Mircera subcutaneously every 4 weeks. The starting dose is
      dependent on the patient's weight. Dose adjustment may be required due to inadequate or
      excessive treatment response. The anticipated time on study treatment is 28 weeks.
