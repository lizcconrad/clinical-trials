    <textblock>
      Sick or premature neonates are exposed to frequent painful and stressful procedures during
      their stay in neonatal intensive care units. Although neonates do feel pain and may have long
      term effects induced by painful experiences, prevention and treatment of neonatal pain is far
      from optimal in many units. An epidemiological study (EPIPPAIN) conducted in neonatal and
      pediatric intensive care units in France in 2005 showed that painful procedures were
      extremely frequent and that analgesics treatments varied a lot among units. Since many
      guidelines have been issued by international scientific societies to manage neonatal pain,
      one may expect that the prevention and treatment of neonatal pain has improved over the last
      6 years.

      Although awake endotracheal intubations are extremely difficult or impossible in older
      children or adults, such intubations are still frequently performed without
      sedation/analgesia in neonates. Recent studies have shown that premedications facilitate
      intubation conditions and greatly improve neonates tolerance of the procedure. Studies aimed
      at assessing the risks and benefits of different sedations/analgesia strategies are urgently
      needed in neonates. We also need a tool to assess at the same time the technical conditions
      of intubations and the tolerance of the neonate to the procedure so that data from different
      studies can be compared.

      The objectives of the present study are:

        1. To describe the incidence of painful and stressful procedures performed in the neonate
           in intensive care units as well as in neonates transported by the medical emergency
           system (SMUR) of the Ile-de-France region 6 years after the first EPPIPAIN study
           conducted in the same region and same type of population in order to assess the
           evolution of practices. The description of painful and stressful procedures will be
           completed with a real-time around-the-clock assessment of the pain induced by procedures
           using a validated behavioral pain scale.

        2. To link this study with The Epipage study 2 in order to look for associations between
           the number of painful and stressful procedures and/or analgesic treatments of the
           neonatal period and the neurological outcome of children that will be followed in the
           Epipage cohort. The Epipage study is a separate study that will follow for 13 years a
           cohort of premature neonates recruited in 2011.

        3. To describe the incidence of painful or stressful procedures and analgesic treatments in
           neonates transported by the pediatric emergency system (SMUR) of the Ile-de-France
           region in France.

        4. To obtain initial validity of a tool permitting to assess intubations in neonates. An
           observational detailed description of endotracheal intubations conditions will be
           conducted in neonates transported and intubated by SMUR and in neonates intubated in
           intensive care units

        5. To describe continuous sedation and analgesia practices in ventilated neonates in
           intensive care units. For these neonates, data from medical records will be recovered up
           to 2 months of admission in intensive care units

        6. To describe the frequency of heel sticks for glycemia measurement and blood gazes
           practices among centers. Relate heel stick practices to the normality or abnormality of
           glycemia results

      STUDY HYPOTHESIS

      Principal hypothesis

      - The number of painful and stressful procedures performed in the neonate admitted to
      intensive care units is still very high but it is lower than in 2005 Pain scores are lower
      when procedures are performed with a specific analgesia prior to procedure.

      Secondary hypothesis

        -  The frequency of pre-procedural analgesia is higher than in 2005

        -  Certain common procedures such as heel sticks and endotracheal intubations are carried
           out with a more frequent analgesia than in 2005

        -  The use of a continuous sedation and analgesia does not induce a reduction in specific
           pre-procedural analgesia

        -  A real-time pain assessment of painful procedures can be carried out in more than 80% of
           procedures performed in neonates in intensive care units Pain scores show that certain
           procedures which are apparently not very painful may elicit high pain scores in very
           sick neonates

        -  Certain procedures such as nursing care or weighing may induce high pain scores in
           neonates who have invasive tubes (endotracheal tubes, thoracic drainage)

        -  A continuous sedation and analgesia is given to more than 50% of ventilated neonates.

        -  Certain characteristics of neonates may influence the use of analgesics for painful
           procedures. Ex: gender, age, respiratory support

        -  Certain contextual characteristics or center may influence the use of analgesics for
           painful procedures. Ex: day or night, pain referent in the unit, night head nurse,
           written pain management guidelines.

        -  More than 80% of semi-urgent or non-urgent intubations are carried out with the use of
           premedication.

        -  Opioids are the most commonly drugs used for premedication during endotracheal
           intubations in neonates

        -  The assessment of intubating conditions and neonate tolerance show lower scores when
           intubations are performed with a premedication considered as &quot;recommended&quot; by the
           American Academy of Pediatrics

        -  The detailed observation of intubations in SMUR and intensive care units will enable
           initial validation of a tool assessment

        -  Too many capillary blood samples by heel sticks are carried out in neonates even in
           neonates that have normal values throughout repeated sticks.

        -  The frequency of blood gas assessments is widely variable among centers

        -  The frequency of capillary blood glycemia is widely variable among centers

      LONG-TERM EFFECTS OF PAIN AND ANALGESIC TREATMENTS

      This objective will be assessed by matching the data of the current Epippain study and
      another parallel study (Epipage 2)

      Principal hypothesis

      - After adjusting for the disease severity, neonates that undergo more painful procedures
      have a poorer neurological outcome later in infancy.

      Secondary hypothesis

        -  Higher pain scores are associated with a poorer neurological outcome later in infancy

        -  The use of central analgesics like opioid does not have a negative effect on
           neurological outcome later in infancy.

        -  The potential negative effect of numerous painful procedures during the neonatal period
           can be counteracted by the use of analgesics.

      METHODOLOGY

      This study will be carried out in neonates cared for in two settings: (i) neonatal or
      pediatric intensive care units and (ii) the medical regional pediatric transport system
      (SMUR) In the intensive care units, this study is designed as a prospective observational
      study to collect around-the-clock bedside data on all painful or stressful procedures
      performed in neonates admitted to the participating units. All 16 tertiary care centers,
      Neonatal Intensive Care Units (NICUs) and Pediatric Intensive Care Units (PICUs) in the Paris
      Region will participate. Since this is an observational study no changes in the standard of
      care will be carried out. During the first 14 days of admission to the participating units,
      prospective data will be collected on all neonatal procedures causing pain, stress, or
      discomfort with the corresponding analgesic therapy. A real-time assessment of pain induced
      by each procedure will be carried out by unit staff using the DAN scale. A detailed record of
      conditions of endotracheal intubations will also be carried out.

      Demographic data, type and duration of respiratory support, sedative and analgesic drugs
      administered concomitantly or pre-procedure, and conditions related to each procedure (type,
      hour of the day, operator, parental presence) will be collected. We'll also record repeat
      procedure attempts for procedures requiring more than one attempt before successful
      completion. The use of specific pre-procedural analgesia will be noted for each procedure. If
      neonates are discharged from the units before 14 days, data collection on painful procedures
      will be stopped on the day of discharge.

      In the medical regional pediatric transport system (SMUR), neonates transported during the
      2-months study period, will have all their procedures recorded in a specific data collection
      form. Demographic data, type of respiratory support, sedative and analgesic drugs
      administered concomitantly or pre-procedure, and conditions related to each procedure (type,
      hour of the day, operator, parental presence) will be collected. We'll also record repeat
      procedure attempts for procedures requiring more than one attempt before successful
      completion. The use of specific pre-procedural analgesia will be noted for each procedure. A
      real-time assessment of pain induced by each procedure will be carried out by unit staff
      using the DAN scale. A detailed record of conditions and neonate tolerance of endotracheal
      intubations will also be carried out.

        Two settings: neonatal or pediatric intensive care units and regional pediatric transport
        system (SMUR).

        In intensive care units, during the first 14 days of admission prospective data will be
        collected on all neonatal procedures causing pain, stress, or discomfort with the
        corresponding analgesic therapy and pain assessment. A detailed record of conditions of
        endotracheal intubations will also be carried out.

        In the SMUR, neonates transported during the 2-months study period by all of 5 SMUR will
        have all their procedures recorded in a specific data collection form. A real-time
        assessment of pain induced by each procedure will be carried out by staff using the DAN
        scale. A detailed record of conditions and neonate tolerance of endotracheal intubations
        will also be carried out.
