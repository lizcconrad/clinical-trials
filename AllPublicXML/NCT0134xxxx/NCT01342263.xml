  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In 2005, more then one-third of Canadians were burdened with one or more chronic diseases.
      Patients with one chronic disease often have, or are at risk for, another chronic disease.
      This group of complex patients represents a substantial challenge to healthcare resources.
      For patients in rural communities, the opportunity to attend ambulatory care clinics is not
      always an option. Additionally, the opportunity for rural patients to receive quality care
      close to, or within their homes, is of great benefit as it reduces the need for extensive
      travel and the potential burden of clinical visits. The use of telehealth has been identified
      as an effective modality for chronic disease management and is actively promoted by national
      organizations as having great promise for health service delivery in rural areas. The
      Internet as a mode for healthcare delivery has numerous advantages: 1. it is ubiquitous with
      increasing access in all age groups, 2. it is inexpensive, 3. it facilitates both patient
      data transfer and patient feedback, thereby supporting patient self-management, 4. it is
      scalable to large patient volumes, 5. it delivers health care directly to the patient and 6.
      it requires minimal set-up for patients with current Internet access.

      The investigators propose to develop and evaluate a multi-chronic disease management program
      delivered through the Internet (with telephone supports) focused on high-impact chronic
      diseases targeted to patients in rural communities.

      This study will consist of a single-blinded randomized controlled trial to investigate the
      efficacy of the iCDM in 318 patients with two or more of the target chronic diseases living
      in rural areas. Within this Aim, the investigators will be able to address the following
      research questions:

      Q1. What is the effect of iCDM on healthcare utilization and patient self-management
      outcomes? Q2. What is the long-term compliance to the iCDM? Q3. What is the level of patient
      and provider satisfaction?

      A study population of men and women over 19 years will be identified through nurse
      practitioners, primary care networks, and other practicing primary care physicians located
      within the Northern Health, Fraser Health, Interior Health, Vancouver Island Health and
      Vancouver Coastal Health Authorities. Patients will be eligible if they have two or more of
      the five targeted chronic diseases; daily Internet access (home, work or other environment)
      by and means; and able to read, write and understand English without difficulty. A total of
      318 patients (159 per group) will be recruited and randomized to either usual care, or a
      24-month interactive chronic disease management program delivered via the Internet.

      Usual Care Group Patients randomized to usual care will be given educational information
      regarding general chronic disease management and a list of Internet-based resources, and will
      return to the care of their primary care physician. Patients will be contacted after 24
      months for an outcome assessment. There will be no contact between the study personnel and
      usual care patients for the duration of the study, nor will there be any attempt to control
      the level of patient care.

      iCDM Experimental Group The iCDM is a 24-month interactive website that has been designed for
      patients with two or more of the following chronic diseases: ischemic heart disease, heart
      failure, diabetes, chronic kidney disease and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. The iCDM
      is managed by a nurse with experience in chronic disease management who will review patient
      data, communicate with patients, implement treatment and interact with the patients' primary
      care physician. Patients will also be able to interact with a dietician and exercise
      specialist to support their disease management.

      The main premise of the iCDM is that users will log-on on a regular basis and enter data
      related to how they are feeling and some physical measures (such as body weight, blood sugar,
      blood pressure, as relevant). Based on answers to these questions, the website may show a
      message either saying everything is fine or give a warning, informing the patient of their
      answers and that a nurse will be contacting them on the next business day. If the nurse
      receives an alert in his/her email inbox, he/she will telephone the patient within
      approximately 24 hours to discuss the entered data. The nurse may also direct the patient to
      discuss with the dietician or exercise specialist, or tell them that it is probably best for
      them to visit their physician for their symptoms.

      Patients will have access to the iCDM for a 24 month period. Their family physician will
      receive a letter indicating their participation in the program and the conditions under which
      they may be contacted. At 24 months patients will be contacted for an outcome assessment.

    <description>The iCDM will support patient self-management through collaborative planning and goal setting, education and skill development, support for behaviour change, and regular patient monitoring with follow-up. For each chronic condition, we have outlined sample patient signs and symptoms to be monitored, frequency of patient provider contact and frequency of patient prompt questions on their condition. The main premise of the iCDM is that only those patients who generate 'alerts' will be contacted by the iCDM nurse allowing for the potential to manage more patients than through traditional means of required patient follow-up regardless of patient condition . Across these five diseases are the following cross-cutting features: nutrition therapy, exercise therapy, psychological support, medication adherence and smoking cessation.</description>

These personnel will have formal training in principles of the Transtheoretical Model of Change and Social Cognitive Theory.</description>
