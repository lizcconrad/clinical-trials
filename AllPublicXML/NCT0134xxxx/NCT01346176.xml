  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators aim to assess the influence of default options in advance directives on
      older patients selections of life- extending therapies and to determine whether alerting
      patients to the spectrum of possible default options in advance directives influences their
      selections of life-extending therapies by manipulating the default options of advance
      directives given to patients in with severe respiratory disease
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The project is designed to document that default options influence terminally ill patients
      end-of-life decisions (in this case, adults with advance forms of lung disease) and that our
      team can recruit and retain patients in a study of advance care planning. In addition,
      because a larger-scale randomized clinical trial will require that the investigators alert
      participants to the range of possible default options, the investigators must also determine
      the effects that this alerting will have on their selections of life-extending therapies.
      Therefore, the investigators seek to achieve three aims: (1) assess the influence of default
      options in advance directives on patients selections of life-extending therapies; (2)
      determine whether alerting patients to the spectrum of possible default options in advance
      directives influences their selections of life extending therapies; and (3) document the
      feasibility of recruiting and retaining patients with advanced lung diseases from
      university-based clinical settings into a randomized trial of default options in advance
      directives.

    <measure>Proportion of Subjects Who Select Palliative Care Options</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The primary outcome variable will be the proportion of subjects that select palliative care options compared to the those who request aggressive treatment in each study arm. We will analyze the effects of manipulating default options and delays in alerting subjects to the presence of multiple default options on each selection in the ADs in order to see how default options influence decisions on general treatment goals and instructions for specific procedures.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Patient Satisfaction With Advance Care Planning.</measure>
    <time_frame>Two months after AD completion</time_frame>
    <description>Patients' satisfaction with their advance care planning was assessed two months after they completed their ADs. One of two authors blinded to patients' group assignments contacted patients by phone and administered a satisfaction survey based on the Canadian Healthcare Evaluation Project (CANHELP) questionnaire. This thirteen-item questionnaire has been validated for assessing satisfaction with end-of-life care planning. Patients were asked to indicate satisfaction with various parts of advance care planning (e.g. decisions about the use of life sustaining technologies including CPR or cardiopulmonary resuscitation, breathing machines, and dialysis) on a scale from 1 to 5, where 1 means not at all satisfied and 5 means completely satisfied. The overall average across the 13 item scale in each group is presented in the results below.</description>

    <description>Consenting subjects will be randomly assigned to one of 3 study arms. Subjects will receive a different AD form based on which arm they have been randomly assigned. Once a completed AD form is received, a debriefing session will be held to alert patients to exactly how the 3 ADs used in the study differ. Once patients are fully informed about the variations in the ADs, they will have an opportunity to change their AD selections prior to finalizing them as a part of their medical record. A final satisfaction interview will take place with a research associate who will contact patients via telephone to administer a satisfaction questionnaire.</description>

        <title>Patient Satisfaction With Advance Care Planning.</title>
        <description>Patients’ satisfaction with their advance care planning was assessed two months after they completed their ADs. One of two authors blinded to patients’ group assignments contacted patients by phone and administered a satisfaction survey based on the Canadian Healthcare Evaluation Project (CANHELP) questionnaire. This thirteen-item questionnaire has been validated for assessing satisfaction with end-of-life care planning. Patients were asked to indicate satisfaction with various parts of advance care planning (e.g. decisions about the use of life sustaining technologies including CPR or cardiopulmonary resuscitation, breathing machines, and dialysis) on a scale from 1 to 5, where 1 means not at all satisfied and 5 means completely satisfied. The overall average across the 13 item scale in each group is presented in the results below.</description>
