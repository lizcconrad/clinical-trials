    <textblock>
      This clinical trial studies image-guided hypofractionated radiation therapy (RT) when given
      together with hypofractionated RT boost and combination chemotherapy in treating patients
      with stage II-III non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) that cannot be removed by surgery. RT
      uses high energy x-rays to kill tumor cells. Hypofractionated RT may be able to send x-rays
      directly to the tumor and cause less damage to normal tissue. Drugs used in chemotherapy,
      such as carboplatin and paclitaxel, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells,
      either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Giving RT together with
      combination chemotherapy may kill more tumor cells and allow doctors to save the part of the
      body where the cancer started

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) using hypofractionated RT in patients with
      stage II-III NSCLC.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the dose-limiting toxicity, if the MTD is reached.

      II. To determine the tumor local control (LC).

      III. To determine the lung cancer disease specific survival (DSS).

      IV. To determine the overall survival (OS).

      V. To assess the transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-B), interleukin (IL)-1, and IL-6 levels
      as predictive biomarkers for treatment induced tissue injury.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of image-guided hypofractionated RT.

      Patients undergo image-guided hypofractionated RT over 35 minutes 5 days a week for 2 weeks
      followed by 5 fractions of hypofractionated RT boost. Patients also receive standard
      carboplatin and paclitaxel for 3 weeks.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 4-6 weeks, every 3 months
      for the first 2 years, and then periodically thereafter.
