  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study the investigators propose to evaluate a COX-2 inhibitor(meloxicam) to assess
      its effect on follicular development and find out if this regimen delays or blocks ovulation
      while maintaining ovarian cyclicity. The investigators intend to administer 15 mg or 30 mg of
      meloxicam per day for 18 days starting on day 5 after onset of menses during 3 continuous
      cycles. The 3 treatment cycles will be preceded and followed by control cycles with no
      treatment. Ovulation or lack there of will be monitored by transvaginal ultrasound
      examinations (TVUs), estradiol, luteinizing hormone (LH), and progesterone levels in multiple
      blood samples in each cycle. The investigators will recruit a total of 56 women. Each woman
      will be randomly assigned to 1 of the 2 dose regimens of meloxicam, with 28 women assigned to
      each of the 2 dose regimens. Participating women will demonstrate an ovulatory cycle before
      starting meloxicam treatment and will be protected from pregnancy by prior sterilization.

      In a recent study, following follicular development by daily ultrasound examinations in 22
      women, meloxicam was administered when the dominant follicle reached a diameter of 18 mm
      (Jesam, Salvatierra et al. 2010). Results from this study indicate that meloxicam 30 mg given
      for five days in late follicular phase was more effective at delaying follicular rupture than
      15 mg. Follicular rupture was delayed more than 48 hours in 11/22 (50%) volunteers in the
      group treated with 15 mg/day and in 20/22 (91%) volunteers in the group treated with 30
      mg/day.
