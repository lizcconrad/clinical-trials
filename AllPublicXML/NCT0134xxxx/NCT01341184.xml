    <textblock>
      32 (16 per treatment group) healthy male or female subjects, 18 - 45 years old will be
      enrolled.Subjects will receive two single oral doses of 400mg TMC207, first on Study Day 1
      followed by a 28-day wash-out, the second on Study Day 29. On Study Day 28, any abnormal
      safety labs will be reviewed by study physician and be determined not to meet the exclusion
      criteria before administration of the second dose of TMC207. Rifabutin 300mg (Group 1) or
      rifampin 600mg (Group 2) will be administered once daily during Period 2 from Study Day 20
      through Study Day 41. The primary endpoint for the study (pharmacokinetics, safety and
      tolerability of TMC207 (and its M2 metabolite) will be determined on the final study visit,
      Day 57 (28 days after the last TMC207 dose in Period 2).

        Inclusion Criteria:

        -Aged between 18 and 45 years, extremes included. -Non tobacco/nicotine using (at least 3
        months prior to screening). -Body Mass Index (BMI, weight in kg divided by the square of
        height in meters) of 18.0 to &lt;35.0 kg/m^2 -Informed Consent Form (ICF) signed voluntarily
        before the first trial-related activity. -Able to comply with protocol requirements.
        -Healthy on the basis of a medical evaluation or history that reveals the absence of any
        clinically relevant abnormality and includes a physical examination, medical history,
        electrocardiogram (ECG), vital signs, ophthalmologic exam, the results of blood
        biochemistry, and hematology tests, and a urinalysis carried out at screening (See Section
        7.2). -Subjects will be enrolled in this study only if they have undergone
        vasectomy/complete hysterectomy, tubal ligation, or other sterilizing procedure, or the

        diaphragm with spermicide gel, hormonal or non-hormonal intrauterine device, oral
        contraceptive pills, and depot progesterone injections. If a subject is usually not
        sexually active but becomes active, the subject and his or her partner must use two of the

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Medical History -History or evidence of current use of alcohol, barbiturate, amphetamine,

        immunologic, dermatologic, neurologic, psychological, or psychiatric disease. -Currently
        significant diarrhea, gastric stasis, or constipation that in the investigator's opinion
        could influence drug absorption or bioavailability. -Any history of significant skin
        disease such as, but not limited to, rash or eruptions, drug allergies, food allergy,
        dermatitis, eczema, psoriasis, or urticaria. Subjects with a history of skin disease may be
        enrolled into the study after consultation with the Sponsor Medical Monitor. -Previously
        demonstrated clinically significant allergy or hypersensitivity to any of the excipients of
        the investigational medication administered in this trial (i.e., rifabutin, rifampin, and
        TMC207). -Subjects with QTcB [Bazett correction] interval &gt; 450ms at screening -Subjects
        with any other clinically significant Electrocardiogram (ECG) abnormality at screening,
        such as arrhythmia, ischemia, or evidence of heart failure or with a family history of Long
        QT Syndrome. -History or evidence of ophthalmologic diseases except for routine corrected
        hyperopia, myopia, and presbyopia. -Recent history (within past 30 days) of vertigo/nausea.

        exception of medications that affect p450 and 3a metabolic pathways (refer to the MOP for a
        list of acceptable medications). During outpatient time periods, subjects will be required
        to discuss with the study staff and receive approval before self-administering any
        medication. After gaining approval, subjects will also be asked to record any medication
        taken during outpatient time periods in a provided log. -Participation in an
        investigational drug trial within 60 days prior to the first intake of trial medication and
        during the duration of the study. -Donation of blood or significant loss of blood within 56
        days or plasma donation within 7 days preceding the first intake of trial medication.
        -Having received TMC207 in a previous trial. Based on Laboratory Abnormalities -Positive
        HIV-1 or HIV-2 test by Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) at screening. -Hepatitis

        greater (&gt; 1.0 x ULN), c.Hemoglobin grade 1 or greater (&lt;/= 10.5 g/dL), d.Platelet count
        grade 1 or greater (&lt;/= 99000/mm^3), e.Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) or alanine
        aminotransferase (ALT) grade 1 or greater (&gt; 1.0 x ULN), f.Total bilirubin grade 1 or
        greater (&gt; 1.0 x ULN), g.Creatine kinase grade 1 or greater (&gt;1.0 x ULN), h.Troponin grade
        1 or greater (1.0 x UNL), or i.Any other toxicity grade 2 or above, including: proteinuria
        (spot urine) &gt; 1+ and gross hematuria. For the second dose of TMC207, any other toxicity
        grade 3 or above, including: proteinuria (spot urine) &gt; 1+ and gross hematuria
