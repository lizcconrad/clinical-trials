      The purpose of the ABSORB BTK Clinical Investigation is to evaluate the safety and efficacy
      of the Everolimus Eluting Bioresorbable Vascular Scaffold System (BVS) in subjects with
      critical limb ischemia (CLI) following percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) of the
      tibial arteries.

    <description>Major adverse limb events are defined as major amputations or major reinterventions. Major reinterventions include new bypass graft, jump/interposition graft revision, or thrombectomy /thrombolysis related to the target lesion, but do not include percutaneous endovascular reinterventions.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Subject must be at least 18 and ≤ 80 years of age.

          2. History of symptomatic critical limb ischemia (CLI) (Rutherford Becker Clinical
             Category 4 or 5).

          3. Subject is able to take at least one type of thienopyridine (e.g. clopidogrel) and
             acetylsalicylic acid (eg. Aspirin/ASA).

          4. The subject must have a life-expectancy of more than 1 year.

          5. Female subjects of childbearing potential must have had a negative pregnancy test
             within 14 days before treatment, must not be nursing at the time of treatment, and
             must also agree at time of consent to use birth control during participation in this
             study up to and including the angiographic follow-up at 1 year.

          6. Subject has been informed of the nature of the study, agrees to its provisions, and
             has signed the informed consent form prior to any study related procedure.

          7. Subject must agree to undergo all protocol-required follow-up examinations and
             requirements at the investigational site.

          8. Subject must agree not to participate in any other clinical investigation for a period
             of one year following the index procedure. This includes clinical trials of
             medications and invasive procedures. Questionnaire-based studies, or other studies
             that are non-invasive and do not require medication are allowed.

        Anatomic Inclusion Criteria

          1. Up to two de novo lesions, each located in a separate native infrapopliteal vessel,
             with angiographically visible above-the-ankle reconstitution (proximal to the inferior
             cortical margin of the talus bone), only one of which can be designated as the target
             lesion and is suitable to be treated with a single BVS.
