  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Preclinical studies showed the Nitric Oxide (NO) gel significantly promoted hair follicle
      formation and growth in both rat and mouse models. The NO gel induced major physiological,
      developmental, and structural changes in the skin of mammals to increase the number of hair
      follicles, follicle stem cell development and regeneration as well as hair shaft elongation,
      and accelerated hair growth rate. Based on our animal model findings, the investigators
      hypothesize that the nitric oxide releasing gel could be used as a medical treatment for hair
      growth in humans. The objective of this trial is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of this
      NO gel (XN-001), in comparison with a placebo gel in subjects in a 24-week treatment
      schedule.

    <description>Nitric Oxide (NO) Gel is created by premixing of contents from 2 separate gel bottles. The first bottle, NO gel, is a solution of sodium nitrite (14.6mM) in distilled water with hydroxyethylcellulose (molecular weight 50,000-1,250,000) added for gel formation. The second bottle, Releasing-stimulator gel, is a solution of maleic acid (14.6mM) and ascorbic acid (14.6mM) in distilled water with hydroxyethylcellulose added for gel formation.</description>
