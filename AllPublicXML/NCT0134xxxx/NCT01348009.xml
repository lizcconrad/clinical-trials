  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cisplatin, an intravenously administered platinum agent, in combination with an intravenously
      administered taxane and capecitabine has been shown to improve time to disease progression
      and overall survival in previously untreated patients with gastric cancer.

      This study is being performed to evaluate an orally administered taxane (tesetaxel) in
      combination with cisplatin and capecitabine in previously untreated patients with gastric
      cancer.

    <description>Phase 1: Tesetaxel orally on Day 1 of each cycle at dose of 18, 21, 24, or 27 mg/m2. If no dose-limiting toxicity, at least 3 subjects will be treated at each dose level until the maximum tolerated dose or the maximum dose of 27 mg/m2 is reached. At each tesetaxel dose level, capecitabine orally at a dose of 2000 mg/m2/day (administered in 2 equally divided doses) on Day 1-Day 14 and cisplatin intravenously at a dose of 60 mg/m2 on Day 1.
Phase 2: Tesetaxel orally on Day 1 of each cycle at dose determined in Phase 1. Capecitabine orally at a dose of 2000 mg/m2/day (administered in 2 equally divided doses) on Day 1-Day 14 and cisplatin intravenously at a dose of 60 mg/m2 on Day 1.</description>
