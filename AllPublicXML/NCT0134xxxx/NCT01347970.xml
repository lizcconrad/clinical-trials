  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This randomized phase II trial studies the side effects and how well low-dose carvedilol
      works in preventing congestive heart failure (CHF) in younger cancer survivors exposed to
      high dose anthracyclines for management of childhood cancer. Carvedilol may help lower the
      risk of cardiovascular complications

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the impact of a two-year course of low-dose carvedilol on surrogate
      echocardiographic indices of CHF risk, including: left ventricular (LV) posterior wall
      thickness-dimension ratio (LV T-D); LV systolic and diastolic function, and afterload;
      natriuretic peptides, troponins, and galactin-3.

      II. To establish safety and tolerability of this two-year course of low-dose carvedilol,
      assessing both objective measures (hepatic function) and patients reported outcomes.

      III. To examine the modifying effect of demographic, clinical, and molecular characteristics
      on the risk: benefit ratio from this two-year carvedilol intervention.

      IV. As an exploratory goal, to examine the relationship between carvedilol and clinical
      measures of efficacy such as prevention of CHF.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Evaluate the long-term efficacy of carvedilol in preventing cardiomyopathy and/or heart
      failure in high-risk childhood cancer survivors.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study. Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

      ARM I: Patients receive low-dose carvedilol orally (PO) once (QD) or twice daily (BID) for 24
      months.

      ARM II: Patients receive placebo PO QD or BID for 24 months.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 5 years.

    <measure>LV thickness-dimension ratio (LV T-D), reported in terms of LV posterior wall dimension in systole and LV dimension based on the internal diameter in diastole</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 24 months</time_frame>
    <description>Z-scores appropriately transformed to normality as necessary. The analysis will be conducted using the linear mixed-effects model approach for normally distributed data, to account for correlation among repeated measurements within individuals. This may be done using the generalized estimating equation (GEE) approach without the random effects or by the restricted maximum likelihood estimation (REML) approach with random effects. Various covariance structures will be assumed, including the unstructured, compound symmetry, and autoregressive lag-1 correlation. Implemented using GENMOD &amp; MIXED.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Echocardiographic efficacy measures, including afterload and systolic and diastolic measurements</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 24 months</time_frame>
    <description>Evaluated in the manner described for primary outcome based on testing the significance of the interaction of time by group indicator variables. The distribution of continuous variables will be examined graphically and appropriate transformations made before applying analytical methods based on normal assumption.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Blood biomarkers of myocardial remodeling and CHF risk, including cardiac troponins (cTn), blood natriuretic peptide (BNP), and galectin-3</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 24 months</time_frame>
    <description>Treated as continuous measures. The linear mixed effects model for between group comparisons of measures from the 5 time points will be applied. The unstructured mean model and linear in time model will be employed.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Grade 2-4 toxicities, assessed using the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.0</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 24 months</time_frame>
    <description>The number of grade 2-4 toxicities observed will be tabulated by treatment arm. Differences by treatment arm will be evaluated using Fisher exact tests.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Frequency of individuals with elevated liver function measurements (bilirubin, AST, ALT)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 24 months</time_frame>
    <description>Compared between treatment groups using an exact test on 2 x 2 tables, stratified on CYP2D6. Logistic regression analysis will also be used to compare the trends in liver function levels between the treatment groups. Procs MIXED and GLIMMIX will be used for longitudinal analysis of normally and non-normally distributed data, respectively. Proc GENMOD will also be used for normally and non-normally distributed data.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Subjective safety and tolerability measures, including treatment adherence as measured by pill counts and patient reported symptoms</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 24 months</time_frame>
    <description>Voluntary withdrawals will be examined at the end of the study by comparing the percent of withdrawals between the treatment groups using a chi-square test or Fisher's exact test. Patient reported symptoms will be scored as a 5-point Likert-type scale in response to questions on how much patients are bothered by certain symptoms. The responses will be treated as normally distributed, as ordinal or dichotomized variable, and the linear mixed effects model or generalized linear mixed effects model will be applied to compare changes between treatment groups.</description>
