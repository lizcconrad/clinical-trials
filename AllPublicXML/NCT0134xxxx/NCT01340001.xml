  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Deep brain stimulation has been developed as a substitute for the classical lesioning methods
      previously used in stereotactic and functional neurosurgery. Recent, anecdotal cases reports
      suggested that electrical stimulation of the cholinergic output of the Nucleus Basalis of
      Meynert (NBM) may improve cognitive performances, especially the memory tasks.

      The present study aims to assess the effect of bilateral electrical stimulation of the NBM on
      the mnesic performance [assessed by the sum of the three free recalls of the Free and Cued
      Selective Recall Reminding Test (FCSRT)] in patients diagnosed with probable, moderate,
      Dementia with Lewy Bodies.

          -  Outpatients, male or female, aged between 18 to 75 years

          -  Moderate dementia defined by a mini-mental state examination (MMSE) score between 16
             and 26

          -  Stable dose of cholinesterase inhibitors (maximal dose tolerated) for a minimum of 1
             months

          -  Patients receiving antiparkinsonian treatment unmodified for 3 months, if treated

          -  French as native language

             anticholinergics, cholinomimetics.

          -  Patients receiving neuroleptics

          -  Patients with a history of alcohol or drug abuse

          -  Pre-existing structural brain abnormalities (such as tumor, infarction, or
             intracranial hematoma)

          -  Previous neurosurgical intervention

             degeneration, cataract)

          -  Fertile women not using adequate contraceptive methods

          -  Women who are pregnant or breast feeding
