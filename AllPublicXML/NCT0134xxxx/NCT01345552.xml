      The purpose of this study is to evaluate feasibility of stereotactic body radiation (SRS) in
      patients with recurrent oligometastatic disease.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with limited disease recurrence, known as oligometastatic or oligorecurrent disease
      (defined here as 5 or fewer sites of metastatic disease) will benefit in terms of overall
      survival and disease progression from reduced tumor burden and improved local control via
      radiation to oligometastatic sites.

    <description>Dose and fractionation will be dependent on the lesion location and lesion size and is up to the exact fractionation and dose is at the discretion of the treating physician. A minimum of 48 hours must be used in between SRS treatments at each site. Note that patients can have SRS everyday or multiple SRS sessions in one day as long as the minimum time for each treatment site is met. For example, if two lung lesions, brain, adrenal, and liver sites were being treated both lung sites could be treated Monday, Wednesday, and Friday and the adrenal, liver and brain lesions treated Tuesday, Thursday</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

        3.1 Conditions for Patient Eligibility

        3.1.1 Pathologically (histologically or cytologically) proven diagnosis of solid malignancy
        3.1.2 Eligible disease sites include the following

          -  Breast

          -  Prostate

          -  GI (including colorectal, anal, esophagus, pancreas, gastric with the exception of
             patients with colon cancer and liver-only metastatic disease )

          -  Head and neck

          -  Skin (melanoma and squamous cell carcinoma)

          -  Lung (both small cell and non-small cell)

          -  Sarcoma (both soft tissue and bone)

          -  Gynecologic (endometrial, cervical, ovarian, vaginal, vulvar)

        3.1.3 Patients are stage IV (M1) or recurrent with any combination of T and N with
        oligometastatic disease as defined by 5 or fewer total sites of metastatic disease 3.1.4
        Can have recurrent disease from the primary disease (this is definition of oligorecurrent
        disease) but cannot have any other primary cancer diagnosed or treated within the last 3
        years other than cutaneous skin cancer.

        3.1.5 Prior systemic chemotherapy is allowable 3.1.4 Zubrod Performance Status 0-1 3.1.5
        Age ≥ 18 3.1.6 CBC/differential obtained within 4 weeks prior to registration on study,
        with adequate bone marrow function defined as follows: 3.1.6.1 Absolute neutrophil count
        (ANC) ≥ 1,800 cells/mm3; 3.1.6.2 Platelets ≥ 100,000 cells/mm3; 3.1.6.3 Hemoglobin ≥ 8.0
        g/dl (Note: The use of transfusion or other intervention to achieve Hgb ≥ 8.0 g/dl is
        acceptable.); 3.1.7 Women of childbearing potential and male participants must practice
        adequate contraception 3.1.8 Patient must provide study specific informed consent prior to
        study entry

        Exclusion Criteria:

        3.2.1 Ineligible disease sites include the following

          -  Lymphoma

          -  Leukemia

          -  Multiple myeloma

          -  Primary CNS

          -  Peritoneal carcinomatosis

             resection 3.2.2 Other

          -  Diffuse metastatic spread confined to one organ system is ineligible; examples of this
             include leptomeningeal spread in the CNS and peritoneal carcinomatosis.

          -  Metastatic disease sites must be treatable with stereotactic radiosurgery (at
             discretion of treating physician). Patients with oligometastatic sites not amenable to
             SRS treatment, either through size or locations, are ineligible for this trial.

        3.2.4 Severe, active co-morbidity, defined as follows: 3.2.4.1 Unstable angina and/or
        congestive heart failure requiring hospitalization within the last 6 months; 3.2.4.2
        Transmural myocardial infarction within the last 6 months; 3.2.4.3 Acute bacterial or
        fungal infection requiring intravenous antibiotics at the time of registration; 3.2.4.4
        Hepatic insufficiency resulting in clinical jaundice and/or coagulation defects; note,
        however, that laboratory tests for liver function and coagulation parameters are not
        required for entry into this protocol.

        3.2.5 Pregnancy or women of childbearing potential and men who are sexually active and not
        willing/able to use medically acceptable forms of contraception; this exclusion is
        necessary because the treatment involved in this study may be significantly teratogenic.

        3.2.6 Patients unable to have an FDG-PET scan, either through insurance coverage, patient
        decision or other reason are not eligible for this study.

        3.2.7 Oligometastatic disease sites not eligible based on concern for toxicity:

          -  trachea involvement (direct invasion, tumors close to or abutting trachea are
             eligible)

          -  heart (direct invasion or involvement, pericardial lymph nodes can be treated) 3.2.8
             Patients unable to have SRS through insurance coverage or ability to pay for SRS
