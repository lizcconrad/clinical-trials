      This study hypothesizes that renal transplantation candidates are diagnosed with significant
      Coronary Artery Disease (CAD) equal with non-invasive modalities as with invasive modalities.
      Therefore the investigators are investigating the ability of coronary computed tomographic
      angiography (cCTA), myocardial perfusion scintigraphy (MPS), acoustic CAD Patch and
      combination hereof to detect CAD as defined by invasive Coronary angiography (CAG).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Chronic kidney disease is a known risk factor for cardiovascular disease and cardiovascular
      disease is the leading cause of mortality in end-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients. After
      renal transplantation one-half of all deaths are cardiac, usually in the first 5 years in the
      presence of a functional graft. Because of this renal transplantation candidates are
      undergoing cardiac pre-transplant risk stratification.

      There is no consensus regarding which modality should be use for detection of CAD in this
      cardiac pre-transplant risk stratification. CAG is known as gold standard but is a invasive
      procedure with risk of complication.

      The investigators wish to investigate the ability of detecting CAD as defined by invasive
      Coronary angiography (CAG) by clinical examination, blood test and non-invasive test (cCTA,
      MPS and acoustic CAD Patch). The investigators hypothesize that a single modality or
      combination of these with high sensitivity and specificity could diagnose significant CAD
      without the need of further invasive procedures.

      This study will include 150 renal transplantations candidate.
