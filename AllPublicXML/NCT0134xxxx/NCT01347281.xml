      The aim of this study is to (i) Determine if tumor hypoxia can be accurately visualised with
      [18F] HX4 PET imaging in head and neck tumors (ii) correlate the [18F] HX4 PET images with
      blood and tissue markers and (iii) investigate the quality and optimal timing of [18F] HX4
      PET imaging (iv) compare [18F] HX4 PET uptake with [18F] FDG PET uptake before and after
      treatment.

    <textblock>
      Tumor hypoxia is the situation where tumor cells are or have been deprived of oxygen. Hypoxic
      tumor cells are usually more resistant to radiotherapy and chemotherapy and more likely to
      develop metastasis. In head and neck cancer, tumor hypoxia is known to be an important
      prognostic factor for long term survival. [18F]HX4 is being developed as a diagnostic
      radiopharmaceutical for PET imaging to find a marker for hypoxia that can be used in standard
      clinical practice. Current hypoxia tracers lack reliable image quality and kinetics. Because
      of the short half life and clearance, we expect that [18F]HX4 will have a higher tumor to
      background ratio than current nitro-imidazole hypoxia markers such as [18F]-misonidazole. The
      clinical use of a reliable, non-invasive and easy to use hypoxia imaging agent could allow
      selection of patients most likely to benefit from hypoxia modifying therapies.

      Included are eligible patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (T2, T3, T4, any N,
      M0) with tumor diameter ≥ 2,5 cm of the oral cavity, oropharynx, hypopharynx or larynx,
      planned to be treated with curative primary radiation treatment (+/- concurrent
      chemotherapy). Before treatment a standard planning [18F]FDG PET-CT will be performed, a
      blood sample is drawn and baseline [18F]HX4 PET scans will be performed. 18F-HX4 scans will
      be repeated after radiotherapy treatment with 20 +/- 4 Gy (approximately two weeks). Three
      months after the end of treatment a [18F]FDG PET scan will be performed.
