  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main purpose of the study is to see how safe SRT3025 (study drug) is when given at
      different doses. The study will also investigate how the study drug is taken up, metabolised
      (chemically broken down), distributed through the body and excreted. A further aim is to look
      at how taking the study drug after eating might change this process.

    <textblock>
      SRT3025 is being developed for the treatment of metabolic diseases. This study is the first
      administration of SRT3025 in humans and seeks to establish the initial safety, tolerability,
      and pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of SRT3025 (and any metabolites, if analyzed) before
      proceeding to future Phase 1 studies or Phase 2 patient studies.

      This protocol details a Phase 1, randomized, placebo-controlled, single-blind, dose
      escalation study to determine the safety, tolerability, and PK profile of SRT3025 in healthy
      male subjects. The study will be conducted in two parts. In Part 1A, 6 Cohorts of subjects
      will receive single escalating doses of SRT3025. In Part 1B, an additional one to two cohorts
      may be enrolled to investigate the effect of a moderate fat/calorie meal on single dose PK
      endpoints. In Part 2A, up to three cohorts may be enrolled to receive 14-day repeat doses of
      SRT3025 chosen from the Part 1A safety, tolerability, and PK data. In Part 2B, one to two
      additional cohorts may receive 14-day repeat doses of SRT3025 in combination with a moderate
      fat/calorie meal.

    <description>Approximately 48 healthy male subjects will be enrolled into 6 separate cohorts (8 subjects per cohort). Each Cohort of subjects will be dosed sequentially, approximately one week apart, at escalating doses. Within each cohort, 6 subjects will be randomized to receive a single dose of SRT3025, and 2 will be randomized to receive a single dose of placebo.
The following are the planned doses for Cohorts 1-6, with Cohort 1 being the lowest dose and Cohort 6 being the highest dose: 50, 150, 500, 1000, 2000, and 3000mg of SRT3025. Dose level may be altered as appropriate during the study based on real time analysis of the safety, tolerability, and /or PK data. Dose adjustment may involve an increase or decrease in dose or dividing the total daily dose allowing for twice-daily dosing. Total daily dosing will not exceed 3000mg.</description>

    <description>One to two of the doses administered in Part 1A may be selected for administration with food, based on expected changes in SRT3025 exposures with food, as well as safety, tolerability, and PK data from Part 1A. If initiated, the effect of a single dose of SRT3025 with a moderate fat/calorie meal may be initiated concurrently with a cohort in Part 2 of the study. Approximately 6 subjects would be enrolled into each cohort in Part 1B.</description>

Within each cohort, 6 subjects will be randomized to receive multiple doses of SRT3025, and 2 will be randomized to receive multiple doses of placebo. The repeat dosing component of the study will be initiated, and doses selected, based on the evaluation of safety, tolerability, and PK data from Part 1A. Subjects in Part 2A will be randomized to receive 14 consecutive days of dosing with SRT3025 or matched-placebo. Subjects in these Cohorts will be dosed sequentially (in the fasted state) approximately two weeks apart.</description>
