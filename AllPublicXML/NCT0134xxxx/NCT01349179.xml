  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The couple of friction metal-polyethylene is regarded as the couple of reference in spite of
      the osteolysis induced by the wear of the polyethylene which remains the independent factor
      of long-term failure. This is all the more true as the patients are young, thus justifying
      the recourse to alternate couples of friction. The Metasul® couple was introduced on the
      French market under its current form in 1995 (year of its marking EC). The use of a couple of
      friction metal-metal (MM) is justified because it would be likely to improve longevity of the
      total arthroplasties of the active subjects by the reduction in osteolysis related to the
      wear of polyethylene. Various studies highlight evolutions different according to the types
      of fixing acetabular; favourable results of the not cemented cups contrasting with unsealings
      and the evolutionary edgings of the Metasul® cups cemented of or the cups &quot;of cemented Weber
      type&quot;.

      Radiographies standards allow the follow-up of the total prostheses of hip but those
      underestimate the incidence and the extension of osteolyses perished-acetabular which are
      generally asymptomatic initially. The lack of international consensus on the definition of
      the parameters of interpretation of the radiological follow-up of the PTH makes difficult the
      comparison of the various results. The purpose of the study is to evaluate the presence of
      geodes acetabular and femoral with scan examination.
