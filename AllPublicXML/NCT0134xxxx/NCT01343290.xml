  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the effect of food on the absorption of canagliflozin
      in the body when canagliflozin is taken with and without food by healthy volunteers
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-center, single-dose, open-label (volunteers will know the identity of
      assigned treatment), randomized (one of 2 study drug sequences assigned by chance) study to
      evaluate the oral bioavailability (the degree to which the drug is absorbed in the body when
      taken orally by mouth) of canagliflozin when taken with and without food in healthy
      volunteers. Healthy Volunteers will take 1 canagliflozin tablet orally for 1 day in 2
      treatment periods (canagliflozin will be taken with food in 1 treatment period and
      canagliflozin will be taken without food in 1 treatment period); the 2 treatment periods will
      be separated by a 10- to 14-day washout period.
