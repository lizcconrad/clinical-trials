    <measure>Change From Baseline in Young Mania Rating Scale (Y-MRS) Total Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Day 182 and Day 350</time_frame>
    <description>The Y-MRS assesses the severity of manic episodes by assigning a severity rating to each of 11 items (Elevated mood, Increased motor activity-energy, Sexual interest, Sleep, Irritability, Speech, Language-thought disorder, Thought content, Disruptive-aggressive behavior, Appearance, Insight). Seven of the 11 items are rated on a scale of 0-4, and 4 of the items are rated on a scale of 0-8. The Y-MRS total score, observed cases (OC), the assessment closest to the scheduled assessment day within the allowed window, is the sum of the ratings for the 11 individual items, and can range from 0-60, with higher scores indicating greater severity of symptoms. Improvement in symptoms is represented by change from baseline values that are negative.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Young Mania Rating Scale (Y-MRS) Total Score</title>
        <description>The Y-MRS assesses the severity of manic episodes by assigning a severity rating to each of 11 items (Elevated mood, Increased motor activity-energy, Sexual interest, Sleep, Irritability, Speech, Language-thought disorder, Thought content, Disruptive-aggressive behavior, Appearance, Insight). Seven of the 11 items are rated on a scale of 0-4, and 4 of the items are rated on a scale of 0-8. The Y-MRS total score, observed cases (OC), the assessment closest to the scheduled assessment day within the allowed window, is the sum of the ratings for the 11 individual items, and can range from 0-60, with higher scores indicating greater severity of symptoms. Improvement in symptoms is represented by change from baseline values that are negative.</description>

        <description>The Y-MRS is an 11-item clinician-rated instrument for assessing the severity of manic episodes. The Y-MRS total score, OC for each participant is the sum of the ratings for the 11 individual items, ranging from 0-60, with higher scores indicating more severe symptoms. The time to 50% response is the number of days on treatment to achieve a 50% decrease from baseline in Y-MRS total score.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Children's Depression Rating Scale, Revised (CDRS-R) Total Score</title>
        <description>The CDRS-R is a 17-item clinician-rated instrument for assessing the presence and severity of depressive symptoms in children. Fourteen of the 17 items are rated on a scale of 1-7, and 3 of the items are rated on a scale of 1-5, with higher scores indicating greater severity of symptoms. The CDRS-R total score, OC for each participant is the sum of the ratings for the 17 individual items, and can range from 17-113, with higher scores indicating greater severity of symptoms. Improvement in symptoms is represented by change from baseline values that are negative.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Pediatric Quality of Life Enjoyment and Satisfaction Questionnaires (PQ-LES-Q) Total Score</title>
        <description>PQ-LES-Q is a questionnaire to assess quality of life enjoyment and satisfaction in children and adolescents. The participant rates 15 items reflecting quality of life from the previous week on a scale of 1=very poor to 5=very good. Items 1-14 assess specific areas (e.g., health, mood or feelings); item 15 is a global assessment of overall quality of life. The PQ-LES-Q total score for each participant, OC is the sum of the rating assigned to each of the first 14 items, and ranges from 14 to 70, with a higher score indicating better quality of life. An improvement in quality of life is represented by change from baseline values that are positive.</description>
