  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Dowling Meara type of epidermolysis bullosa simplex (EBS-DM) is a rare genodermatosis due to
      keratin 5 and 14 mutation, characterized by skin fragility and spontaneous or post traumatic
      blisters. Neonatal period and infancy are critical since this autonomic dominant affection
      usually improves with age. Cyclins seem to be efficient in some cases of EBS but are
      prohibited in children younger than 8 years old. Erythromycin can be a good alternative in
      this population due to its antibacterial and anti-inflammatory potential.

      The aim of this study is the evaluation of the efficiency of oral erythromycin to decrease
      the number of cutaneous blisters in severe EBS-DM patients from 6 months to 8 years old after
      3 months of treatment.

      Primary end point is the number of patients with decrease of blisters' number of at least 20%
      after 3 months of treatment by oral erythromycin.

      It is a preliminary study on 8 patients. Treatment is oral erythromycin twice a day during 3
      months. Follow up for each patient is 5 months. The duration of the study is 1 year.
