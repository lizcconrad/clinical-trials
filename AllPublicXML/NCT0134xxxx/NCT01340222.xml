  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The threat of preterm labour (PTL) is the first cause of hospitalization in the course of
      pregnancy. Its diagnostic is based on clinical examination with a positive predictive value
      of about 40 %. The role of the Monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1) in delivery has been
      suggested by its secretion in the amniotic fluid during labour and by the increase in the
      expression of its RNA messengers in the peripheral maternal blood. We have also shown that
      the proportion of MCP-1-expressing monocytes is higher in women with vaginal delivery
      compared with those with caesarean delivery prior the onset of labour.

      OBJECTIVES : Primary To seek link between the respective proportions of circulating maternal
      monocyte and lymphocyte subpopulations and the true onset of PTL characterised by delivery
      occurring within 7 days post admission. Secondary: to (1) compare the predictive values of
      these new markers with those currently used, e.g. quantification of fœtal fibronectin and
      assessment of cervical length and effacement, (2) Compare the respective proportions of
      monocytes and lymphocyte subpopulations in maternal blood and fœtal membranes, (3) determine
      if a correlation exists between the activation markers expressed by maternal monocyte and
      lymphocyte subpopulations and the neonatal outcomes of preterm infants.

      MATERIAL AND METHODS: 200 patients with a singleton pregnancy between 24 and 34 weeks of
      amenorrhea and complicated PTL, will be prospectively included in the maternity wards of
      Galway (Ireland) and of Dijon with the support of the perinatal network of Burgundy. A 2X5ml
      blood sample will be collected upon admission, at D1, D2, D4 and D6 for women who did not
      deliver within the first 7 days; finally, another blood sample will be drawn upon discharge.
      After delivery, foetal membranes will be collected to characterize and compare the various
      monocyte and lymphocyte subpopulations in the maternal blood. The characterization and the
      study of the level of activation of blood and foetal membrane cells will be performed using
      flow cytometry technique with suitable markers. The main judgment criteria will be the
      percentage of monocytes positively expressing MCP-1 for all three monocyte subpopulations
      (&quot;inflammatory&quot;, &quot;residents or patrollers&quot; and &quot;intermediates&quot;, according to CD14, CD16, CCR2
      and MCP-1 markers. Lymphocyte subpopulations will be assessed using the following markers:
      CD45, CD3, CD4, CD8 (T lymphocytes), HLA-DR (activated T lymphocytes), CD19 (B lymphocytes),
      CD16/CD56 (NK Cells), intracellular IFN-gamma (Th1 lymphocytes), intracellular IL-4 (Th-2
      lymphocytes), intracellular IL-17 and CCR6 (Th17 lymphocytes), CD4, CD25, Foxp3 and CD127
      (Tregs). Univariate statistical analysis of quantitative data will be performed using the
      Mann and Witney test or ANOVA, after verification of the conditions of application. The
      comparisons of percentages will be done using Chi-square Pearson tests and the Fisher's exact
      test, as appropriate. The multivariate analysis will be performed using a stepwise descending
      analysis.

      TRANSLATIONAL DIMENSION: The characterization of the various monocyte and lymphocyte
      subpopulations in the maternal blood and in the foetal membranes might constitute an &quot;
      immunological signature &quot; of the labour and therefore validate the relevance of a predictive
      marker for clinicians.

      EXPECTED RESULTS AND PERSPECTIVES: The study of the various monocyte and lymphocyte
      subpopulations in the maternal blood will allow to better characterise the immunological
      mechanisms occurring at the start of premature labour and to identity predictive markers of
      the preterm delivery, to validate prospectively in order to optimize the management of PTL

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Threat of preterm labour (PTL) occurring between 24 and 34 WOA, defined according to
             validated criteria i.e. by (1) the presence of regular uterine contractions, lasting
             at least 30 seconds at a frequency ≥ 4 contractions every 30 minutes and confirmed by
             an external tocogram, (2) a cervical dilation of 3 cm or greater, to focus on true
             preterm labour, for the nulliparous women and 1-3 cm among primiparous women or
             multiparous and (3) a cervical obliteration &gt;50%, or a cervix less than 25mm according
             to the echography, when this information is available. The first two criteria being
             mandatory, the third one optional as it is more subjective, or less likely to be
             available for every patient.
