  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to determine if it is possible to detect more pre-cancerous
      lesions in colon when using fluorescence technology.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Carcinoma of the lower GI-tract is among the leading malignancies in the western world
      causing a substantial morbidity, mortality and consequently a large burden to the health care
      system in the diagnosis, treatment and follow-up of these patients.

      The primary objectives of this study is to determine carcinoma- and adenoma lesion true
      detection rate of HAL fluorescence colonoscopy in patients with known or strong suspicion of
      neoplasia in the colon. The secondary objective and endpoints are to determine carcinoma- and
      adenoma lesion false detection rate of HAL fluorescence colonoscopy, to compare carcinoma-
      and adenoma lesion true detection rates and the false detection rates of fluorescence with
      standard colonoscopy and to characterize the safety profile of HAL fluorescence colonoscopy.

  <why_stopped>
    The study was stopped due to inadequate efficacy after 13 patients were evaluated.
