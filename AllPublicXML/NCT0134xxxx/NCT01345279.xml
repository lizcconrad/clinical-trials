      Indirect comparisons were performed using data from GOG-0179 versus GOG-0169 to permit
      comparison of topotecan in combination with cisplatin versus cisplatin plus paclitaxel via
      the common comparator of cisplatin monotherapy. Both GOG-0179 and GOG-0169 were conducted in
      patients with stage IVB, recurrent or persistent carcinoma of the cervix, but there were some
      differences between the respective study populations. Patients with prior chemotherapy were
      eligible for GOG-0179 but ineligible for GOG-0169 (except when chemotherapy was used for
      radiation sensitisation). Fewer patients had received chemotherapy as a radiosensitiser in
      GOG-0169 (27%) than in GOG-0179 (~60%) and these patients were unevenly distributed between
      treatment arms in GOG-0169. In addition, the proportion of patients receiving cisplatin as a
      radiosensitiser in GOG-0169 is unknown. For these reasons, there are limitations associated
      with the indirect meta-analysis.

        The search was designed to identify all clinical data published since the Cancer Care
        Ontario systematic review in 2006. The Cancer Care Ontario systematic review searched
        MEDLINE (1966 to February 2006), EMBASE (1980 to February 2006), the Cochrane Library
        (Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2006 Issue 1), and Cochrane Controlled Trials
        Register (2006 Issue 1)), the Canadian Medical Association Infobase, and the National
        Guidelines Clearinghouse. The conference proceedings of the American Society of Clinical
        Oncology (1995-2005) and the European Society of Medical Oncology (2002-2005) were also
        searched. The search was completed on 18 December 2008
