      The purpose of this study is to evaluate feasibility of radiosurgery for all metastatic sites
      for patients presenting with oligometastatic disease.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with oligometastatic disease (defined here as 5 or fewer sites of metastatic disease
      involving 3 or fewer organ systems) are potentially curable with stereotactic radiosurgery
      (SRS) or stereotactic radiotherapy (SRT) (collectively referred to as stereotactic body
      radiotherapy or SBRT) to the metastatic disease sites in combination with standard curative
      therapy to the primary site.

    <description>Dose and fractionation will be dependent on the lesion location and lesion size, the exact fractionation and dose is at the discretion of the treating physician. A minimum of 48 hours must be used in between SRS treatments at each site. Note that patients can have SRS everyday or multiple SRS sessions in one day as long as the minimum time for each treatment site is met. For example, if two lung lesions, adrenal, and liver sites were being treated, both lung sites could be treated Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, the liver on Tuesday, Thursday and the following Tuesday, and the adrenal on Monday, Wednesday, Friday of the second week.</description>

          3. Other

               -  Lung cancer with pleural effusion (wet IIIB) are not eligible

             treated within the last 3 years other than cutaneous skin cancers. Patient may have
             previous chemotherapy as treatment of this previous malignancy as long as the
             chemotherapy has completed more than 3 years ago.

          7. Pregnancy or women of childbearing potential and men who are sexually active and not
             willing/able to use medically acceptable forms of contraception; this exclusion is

             teratogenic.

          8. Oligometastatic disease sites not eligible based on concern for toxicity:

               -  trachea involvement (direct invasion, tumors close to or abutting trachea are
                  eligible)
