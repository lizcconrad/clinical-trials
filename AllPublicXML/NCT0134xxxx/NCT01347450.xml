      Background: Cocoa is rich in flavonoids such as (-)-epicatechin and (+)-catechin; these
      compounds have displayed both in vitro and in vivo antioxidant activity.

      Objective: This trial evaluate the regular ingestion effect of both, dark chocolate and cocoa
      powder, over plasma lipids of young males subjected to ex vivo lipid peroxidative conditions.

      Design: Single-blind, controlled and randomized clinical trial including 100 healthy men,
      divided into two groups: 50 subjects received 30 g of cocoa powder and 50 g of dark
      chocolate/d for 1 wk, and the other 50 subjects received placebo.

      Adult young males were enrolled at the Universidad Industrial de Santander by publicity at
      the university food service centre. Those who respond (n=136) were selected after the normal
      blood lipid profile was verified by laboratory testing of total cholesterol, LDL, HDL, VLDL
      and triacylglycerols, as well exclusion and inclusion criteria were applied. Within the
      exclusion criteria we included diagnosed coronary artery disease, diabetes mellitus, arterial
      hypertension, use of any prescribed medication, restrictive diets and any migraine or cocoa
      products allergic antecedents.

      Finally enlisted subjects were 120 non-smokers, normolipemic, ages were between 20 and 30
      years old, who underwent anthropometric measurements like weight, height, BMI (among 16.0 and
      27.4 kg/m2) and regular nutritional and toxicological habits using standardized surveys.
      Subjects received 3 meals a day from the Food Nutritional Service of Universidad Industrial
      de Santander, in order to ensure the same diet conditions for all subjects along the
      experimental period. An average colombian diet, based on 2287 calories as a total caloric
      value (protein 15%, fats 35% and carbohydrates 60%) was used. The study protocol and the
      informed consent were approved by the Fundación Santa Fe de Bogotá Institutional Ethical
      Committee (Santa Fe de Bogotá D.C., Colombia). We got written informed consent from all
      participants and they received money compensation for its participation in the study.

    <description>Oxidative protection of plasma lipids was set up by measuring hexanal, known as one of the main components of oxidizing n-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA). The oxidative protection index (OPI), was defined as the difference between the basal and post intervention (cocoa taking in) sample chromatographic areas as stated by the formula: OPI = (Area0 - Area1/ Area0)*100. Hexanal determination was carried out by HS-SPME in situ derivatization method using PFPH fibre saturation as derivatizing agent under the methodology</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Oxidation resistance index (ORI)</measure>
    <time_frame>7-days after the intervention started</time_frame>
    <description>ORI was expressed as a percentage and held as the difference among basal (0) and post interventions (1) lag time of each subject according to the following formula: ORI = (lag1 - lag0/ lag1)*100. Plasma was 50-fold diluted in a saline phosphate solution (PBS; 0.0027M KCl, 0.137M NaCl, pH 7.4) and then was exposed to copper (II) chloride at final concentration of 95 µM in a 2.5 ml quartz cuvette. Conjugated diene formation from lipid peroxidation was followed at 245 nm wavelength, recorded each 5 min over 4-h period at 37ºC in a Perkin Elmer Lambda Bio 10 spectrophotometer</description>
