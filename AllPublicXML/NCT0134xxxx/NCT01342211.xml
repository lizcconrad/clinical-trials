    <measure>Number of Participants With Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs)</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1 up to Day 141</time_frame>
    <description>An adverse event (AE) was any untoward medical occurrence in a participant who received study drug without regard to possibility of causal relationship. Serious adverse event (SAE) was an AE resulting in any of the following outcomes or deemed significant for any other reason: death; initial or prolonged inpatient hospitalization; life-threatening experience (immediate risk of dying); persistent or significant disability/incapacity; congenital anomaly. TEAEs are events between first dose of study drug and up to Day 141 that were absent before treatment or that worsened relative to pretreatment state. Treatment related: a TEAE deemed related to the study drug by the investigator. TEAEs included SAEs (TESAEs) as well as non-serious AEs which occurred during the study. The participants with TEAEs, SAEs and treatment-related TEAEs were reported.</description>

    <measure>Number of Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs) by Severity</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1 up to Day 141</time_frame>
    <description>An AE was any untoward medical occurrence attributed to study drug in a participant who received study drug. Investigator assessed TEAEs as mild (did not interfere with participant's usual function), moderate (interfered to some extent with participant's usual function) or severe (interfered significantly with participant's usual function). TEAEs are events between first dose of study drug and up to Day 141 that were absent before treatment or that worsened relative to pretreatment state.</description>

        <description>Lipid parameters included: high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), total cholesterol (TC), non-high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (non-HDL-C), triglyceride (TG), apolipoprotein B (ApoB) and apolipoprotein A1 (ApoA1). Baseline value was calculated as the average of Day 7 and Day 1 measurements collected prior to study drug administration.</description>

Results for percent change at Day 85 for ApoB and ApoA1 were not reported because data was not collected for ApoB and ApoA1 at Day 85 due to an inadvertent omission in the protocol.</population>

        <title>Number of Participants With Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs)</title>
        <description>An adverse event (AE) was any untoward medical occurrence in a participant who received study drug without regard to possibility of causal relationship. Serious adverse event (SAE) was an AE resulting in any of the following outcomes or deemed significant for any other reason: death; initial or prolonged inpatient hospitalization; life-threatening experience (immediate risk of dying); persistent or significant disability/incapacity; congenital anomaly. TEAEs are events between first dose of study drug and up to Day 141 that were absent before treatment or that worsened relative to pretreatment state. Treatment related: a TEAE deemed related to the study drug by the investigator. TEAEs included SAEs (TESAEs) as well as non-serious AEs which occurred during the study. The participants with TEAEs, SAEs and treatment-related TEAEs were reported.</description>

          <description>An adverse event (AE) was any untoward medical occurrence in a participant who received study drug without regard to possibility of causal relationship. Serious adverse event (SAE) was an AE resulting in any of the following outcomes or deemed significant for any other reason: death; initial or prolonged inpatient hospitalization; life-threatening experience (immediate risk of dying); persistent or significant disability/incapacity; congenital anomaly. TEAEs are events between first dose of study drug and up to Day 141 that were absent before treatment or that worsened relative to pretreatment state. Treatment related: a TEAE deemed related to the study drug by the investigator. TEAEs included SAEs (TESAEs) as well as non-serious AEs which occurred during the study. The participants with TEAEs, SAEs and treatment-related TEAEs were reported.</description>
