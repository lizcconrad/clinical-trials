      Background: It is becoming increasingly clear that individuals from all corners of the globe
      use probiotic dietary approaches to enhance health. More recently, probiotics have shown
      promise in treating a variety of disease states, due to improved strain selection, stability
      and delivery technologies.

      Objective: The purpose of this study is to determine the lipid lowering efficacy of a
      probiotic supplement capsule containing Lactobacillus reuteri Cardioviva™, taken twice per
      day over 9 weeks, in subjects with hypercholesterolemia.

      Design: The study design is a double-blinded, placebo-controlled, randomized, parallel-arm,
      multi-centre study. The study will last a total of 13 weeks, including a 2-week wash-out
      period, a 2-week run-in period and a 9 week treatment period.
