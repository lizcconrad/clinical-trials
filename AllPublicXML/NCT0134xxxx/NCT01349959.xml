      This phase II trial studies how well giving azacitidine and entinostat work in treating
      patients with advanced breast cancer. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as azacitidine, work
      in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by
      stopping them from dividing. Entinostat may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some
      of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Giving azacitidine together with entinostat may kill
      more tumor cells.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate objective response rate by Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors
      (RECIST) criteria of the combination of azacitidine (5-AZA) and entinostat in women with
      advanced breast cancer; triple-negative and hormone-refractory.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the safety and tolerability of the combination of 5-AZA and entinostat in
      women with advanced breast cancer.

      II. To determine progression-free survival, overall survival, and clinical benefit rate of
      the combination of 5-AZA and entinostat.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To collect safety and toxicity data as well as the feasibility and response rate where
      hormonal therapy is added to the combination under investigation at the time of progressive
      disease. (Exploratory) II. To determine the pharmacokinetic profile of 5-AZA (full profile)
      and entinostat (trough concentrations) in patients with advanced breast cancer. (Exploratory)
      III. To assess serum cytidine deaminase pharmacogenetics and phenotypic activity as a
      potential biomarker of response to 5-AZA. (Exploratory) IV. To evaluate baseline and change
      in candidate gene re-expression (e.g., estrogen receptor [ER] alpha, retinoic acid receptor
      [RAR] beta) in malignant tissue obtained from selected patients through fine-needle
      aspiration (FNA) and core biopsy, prior to and following combination therapy. (Exploratory)
      V. To evaluate baseline and change in gene methylation silencing in circulating
      deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) obtained prior to and following combination therapy.
      (Exploratory) VI. To evaluate baseline and change in gene methylation in malignant tissue
      obtained through FNA and core biopsy. (Exploratory)

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive azacitidine subcutaneously (SC) on days 1-5 and 8-10, and entinostat orally
      (PO) on days 3 and 10. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity. Patients with progressive disease may continue azacitidine and
      entinostat in combination with hormonal therapy, at treating physician discretion, or undergo
      event monitoring.

      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed up every 3-6 months for up to 3
      years.

                  Oncology-College of American Pathologists (ASCO-CAP) Guidelines; these guidelines
                  state that ER and PR assays be considered positive if there are at least 1%
                  positive tumor nuclei in the sample on testing in the presence of expected

                  the discretion of the Study Chair; for HER2 assessment, a negative result is an
                  immuno-histochemistry staining of 0 or 1+, a fluorescence in situ hybridization

        <title>Change in Expression of Relevant Genes (e.g., ER Alpha and RAR Beta) Evaluated by Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR)</title>
        <description>To evaluate baseline and change in candidate gene re-expression such as ER re-expression in malignant tissue, the absolute difference between prior to and following combination therapy (i.e., at 8 weeks) will be estimated and the median difference will be reported. These data will also be graphically displayed showing trend in median values across time. Nonparametric Wilcoxon signed rank tests will be used to determine whether or not the data shows evidence of changes from baseline.</description>

          <description>Patients receive azacitidine SC on days 1-5 and 8-10, and entinostat PO on days 3 and 10. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients with progressive disease may continue azacitidine and entinostat in combination with hormonal therapy, at treating physician discretion, or undergo event monitoring.
