    <textblock>
      This is a prospective 5-year study to compare the change in total kidney volume (TKV) before
      and after tolvaptan therapy, as the primary endpoint, in patients with ADPKD.

    <textblock>
      Tolvaptan was approved in Japan for the treatment of autosomal dominant polycystic kidney
      disease (ADPKD) in March 2014. This is a prospective 5-year study to compare the change in
      total kidney volume (TKV) before and after tolvaptan therapy, as the primary endpoint, in
      patients with ADPKD. Study results will be summarized, analyzed, and compiled into a research
      paper at 3 years (data cut-off, March 31, 2018) and at 5 years (data cut-off, March 31, 2020)
