  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the effects of a balance reeducation protocol and an
      evidenced based protocol on pain, function and postural control of low back pain patients.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Both groups will perform general exercises for back pain (stretch and strength of paraspinal
      and abdominal muscles, plus exercises to enhance lumbar and pelvic flexibility but the
      balance or experimental group will perform in addition five minutes of exercises that
      challenge postural stability in the sitting position. The evolution of the two groups
      concerning pain level, function and postural control will be compared.
