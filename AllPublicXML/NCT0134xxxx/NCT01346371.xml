  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the effect of Bepreve® with an artificial-tear eye
      drop on the quality of your tears.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-center, randomized, parallel group, placebo-controlled study to evaluate the
      effect of BEPREVE compared to a placebo eye drop on the measurement of tear film osmolarity
      and tear film lipid layer in patients with allergic conjunctivitis.

      Subjects will be screened for this study on day one of dosing with the test article. Subjects
      who sign the informed consent form and who meet all inclusion/exclusion criteria will be
      eligible for participation in this study. They will be assigned sequentially, according to a
      computer generated randomization list, in a ratio of 1:1 to receive either BEPREVE™
      (bepotastine besilate ophthalmic solution) 1.5% or REFRESH TEARS® Lubricant Eye Drops (1:1).
      Subjects will instill one drop of test article either BEPREVE™ or REFRESH TEARS® into the
      study eyes twice daily for a maximum of 60 days. Subjects will be seen for evaluation on Days
      0, 28±3, and 56±3 following randomization.

        Inclusion Criteria:

             conjunctivitis.

          2. Have documented positive skin prick puncture test to at least one (1) seasonal
             allergen (e.g., grasses, trees, weeds, or other allergens) within two (2) years of
             Visit 1.

          3. Agree not to have any other ocular drops in study eyes within 2 days prior to the
             initiation of dosing with the test article or throughout the duration of the study.

          4. Have a Best Corrected Visual Acuity of 20/200 or better in either eye.

          5. Are willing/able to follow instructions from the study investigator and his/her staff.

          6. Be willing/able to return for all required study visits, to follow instructions from
             the study investigator and his/her staff.

          7. Are able to self-administer test article (or have a caregiver available to instill all
             doses of test article).

          8. Have signed informed consent approved by Institutional Review Board or Independent
             Ethics Committee.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Have known hypersensitivity to either BEPREVE™ or REFRESH TEARS® or to any component
             of the test article (including &quot;procedural&quot; medications such as anesthetic and/or
             fluorescein drops, dilating drops, etc.).

          2. Have active corneal pathology noted in the study eye at the screening visit. Active
             corneal pathology is defined as corneal pathology that is non-stable, or greater than
             mild, or will compromise assessment of the safety or efficacy of treatment.

          3. Have used topical, ocular, inhaled or systemic steroids within 14 days prior to
