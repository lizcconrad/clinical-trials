  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hypothesis:

      Mesalamine is commonly used to induce and maintain remission in patients with Inflammatory
      Bowel Disease (IBD). Behavioral and psycho-social barriers to mesalamine adherence exist in
      patients with IBD. These factors can be identified using qualitative testing in order to
      develop a validated instrument to measure the &quot;adherence profile&quot; of an individual patient,
      and design appropriate behavioral interventions to reduce non-adherence.

      Objectives:

      To test a novel interview instrument that determines the medication adherence profile of
      patients with IBD prescribed mesalamine by correlating with objective measures of adherence

      Specific Aims:

        1. To test a novel interview instrument to classify patients into &quot;adherence profiles&quot;

        2. To validate this instrument with quantitative scores of mesalamine adherence and
           objective testing.

      Study Design Rationale:

      Qualitative research design and prospective validation
