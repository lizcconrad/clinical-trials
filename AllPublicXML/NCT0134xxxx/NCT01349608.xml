    <textblock>
      This study is designed to explore a new approach to help people with chronic obstructive
      pulmonary disease (COPD) become more physically active. Through weekly telephone sessions
      with a health coach utilizing motivational interviewing, participants will be empowered to
      set goals for increased physical activity (emphasis on walking). The objective of the study
      is to determine if telephone-based health coaching is a reasonable and effective way to
      increase physical activity, as measured by a gold-standard activity monitor, in people with
      COPD.

    <description>Participants will be given a pedometer and activity log to use daily to track their physical activity accomplishments. Weekly, they will participate in a health coaching telephone session to discuss physical activity and set goals. The health coach is knowledgable in COPD care and will utilize a motivational interviewing approach to support the self-efficacy of the participants to be more active.</description>
