      Primary Objective:

      To assess the safety and tolerability of two dose levels of a new insulin glargine
      formulation in a once-daily multiple dosing regimen

      Secondary Objective:

      To compare the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of two dose levels of a new
      insulin glargine formulation with 0.4 U/kg Lantus® in a once-daily multiple dosing regimen

          -  Regular use of any medication other than insulins in the last month before study start
