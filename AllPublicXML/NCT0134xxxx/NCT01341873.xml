      This randomized clinical trial studies nursing intervention in supporting family caregivers
      (FCs) of patients undergoing stem cell transplant. A nursing intervention may help prepare
      FCs support the recovery of the patients

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Test the effects of an advanced practice nursing (APN) intervention for family caregivers
      (FCs) of hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT) patients in the experimental group on FC quality
      of life, psychological distress, caregiver burden, caregiver skills preparedness as compared
      to FCs in the control group.

      II. Describe self-care behaviors for FCs of HCT patients and compare them between the
      experimental and control groups.

      III. Describe resource use by FCs comparing the experimental and control groups.

      IV. Identify subgroups of FCs who benefit most from the family caregiver intervention (FCI)
      in relation to sociodemographic characteristics, caregiver health status, and patient
      characteristics.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Describe family caregivers' satisfaction with the FCI.

      OUTLINE: FCs are randomized to 1 of 2 groups.

      GROUP I: FCs receive 4 sessions of an APN FCI beginning during the admission for transplant
      and continuing for up to 100 days after transplant.

      GROUP II: FCs receive standard supportive care.

      After completion of study, FCs are followed up at 3, 6, and 12 months.
