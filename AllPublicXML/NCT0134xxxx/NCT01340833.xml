  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      GSK2118436 is an orally administered, potent and selective small molecule BRAF inhibitor that
      is currently being developed for the treatment of BRAF mutation-positive tumors. This is an
      open-label, non-randomized study designed to determine the absolute bioavailability of an
      oral dose of 150 mg of GSK2118436 co-administered with an intravenous 50 microgram dose of
      [14C]GSK2118436 in subjects with BRAF mutant solid tumors. Pharmacokinetic samples will be
      obtained up to 72 hours post-dose. Safety assessments will be performed throughout the study.
      After completing all assessments, eligible subjects may transition to BRF114144, an
      open-label, rollover study of GSK2118436 to continue treatment.
