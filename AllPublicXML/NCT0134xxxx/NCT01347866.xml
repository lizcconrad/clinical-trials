  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      After the fourth protocol amendment two study arms are evaluated in this clinical protocol:
      PD-0325901 (oral MEK inhibitor) plus PF-05212384 (intravenous PI3K/mTOR inhibitor) and
      PF-05212384 plus irinotecan. The study will assess safety, pharmacokinetics and
      pharmacodynamics of these combinations in patients with advanced cancer. Once the maximum
      tolerated doses are identified, further assessment of these combinations will be done in
      patients with previously treated metastatic colorectal or pancreatic cancer for the
      PF-05212384 plus irinotecan arm and in patients with ovarian cancer or KRAS mutated non small
      cell lung cancer for the combination of PF-05212384 plus PD-0325901.

      The study was prematurely discontinued as a result of an internal portfolio review on April
      1, 2015. The decision to terminate was not due to any safety or efficacy data.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Histological or cytological diagnosis of advanced/metastatic solid tumor for which
             there is no currently clinically effective treatment.

          -  All tumor types for patients enrolled in Stage 1 of Arm C.

             mutated and KRAS wild type), which has progressed on irinotecan-based regimens, and

             or fresh biopsy). Patients with tumors harboring other mutations that activate the
             MAPK pathway may be enrolled upon agreement with the Sponsor.

          -  For patients enrolled in Stage 2 of Arm D, ovarian cancer which has progressed on

             entry into this study

          -  -For patients enrolling in Stage 2 prior therapy with an agent that is known or
             proposed to be active by action on PI3K and/or mTOR.

          -  -Prior high dose chemotherapy requiring hematopoietic stem cell transplantation within
             12 months of study treatment start.

          -  -Known impaired pulmonary function or demonstrated to be impaired by Pulmonary
