        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Confirmed diagnosis of LGMD 2C including:

               -  Molecular analysis proving del525T mutation on γ-sarcoglycan gene (chromosome 13)
                  at homozygous state

               -  Muscle biopsy with immunohistochemical and/or Western blot analyses showing
                  marked decrease or absence of γ-sarcoglycan staining in muscle, as well as a
                  fibrosis assessment should be available. If not, an initial muscular biopsy may
                  be performed during the pre-enrollment period

          2. Lower age limit of 15 years

          3. Males and females may be equally enrolled

          4. Adequate carpi radialis muscle bulk for muscle biopsy as assessed by examination.
             Subjects should be able to communicate with the investigation staff. They should be
             able to understand, to comply with and to perform all needed evaluations during the
             trial period, including muscle strength tests. Forearm muscle strength should be of at
             least 3+ as assessed through the British Medical Research Council (MRC) Manual Muscle
             Testing (MMT) scale.

             Subjects should also have already lost ambulation

          5. Subjects should be able and willing to return for follow up

          6. Subjects should be able and willing to give signed informed consent. For minor
             subjects, a signed informed consent will be given by legally authorized representative

          7. Eligible subjects belonging to a multiplex family should not be enrolled in the same
             cohort.

                  a pacemaker insertion.

          2. Underlying conditions, diseases or active viral infections likely to increase risk of
             complications or to interfere with the investigational treatment:

               -  contraindications for injections and muscle biopsies

               -  Platelet count &lt; 100,000 / mm3

               -  Serum creatinin &gt; 110 µmol/l

               -  Lymphocytes CD4+ &lt; 250/mm3 (&lt; 15%)

               -  History of diabetes mellitus

               -  Current infectious diseases, including known positive HIV serology, hepatitis B
                  and C

               -  Abnormal profile on protein immunoelectrophoresis

               -  Immunizations of any kind within the past month

               -  receipt of another investigational agent within 4 weeks of study enrollment

               -  History of or current steroid medication for indications other than muscular
                  dystrophy, chemotherapy, radiotherapy or other immunosuppressive therapy. Steroid
                  medication, if any, should be discontinued at least 3 months before entering the
                  protocol and not received during the study

               -  Pregnant or lactating women. Females or males of childbearing age must be willing
                  to employ adequate contraception, that is to use condoms during the 3 months
                  following the administration of the product

               -  Pre-injection neutralizing anti-AAV1 antibodies titer (on pre-enrollment / D-30
                  visit) superior or equal to 1/800.
