      The purpose of this study is to see if a new Smart Phone application can help Veterans manage
      their panic symptoms after completing a two-day treatment for panic attacks.

      The first goal is to see how helpful the Smart Phone application is in helping veterans with
      panic symptoms continue to improve after you complete treatment.

      The second goal of this study is to find out how much veterans like the Smart Phone
      application.

      The third goal is to see how practical it is to use the Smart Phone application as a form of
      follow-up care. We want to see how much time is needed to provide technical support in using
      the application.

    <description>A cognitive-behavioral therapy for PD that is highly efficacious, the standard delivery format of these sessions are typically offered once a week over a period of several months. This can pose challenges to rural Veterans who have multiple commitments and face long travel distances for mental health services.
To improve accessibility to panic treatment, one innovative approach has been to deliver PCT in an intensive, two-day format.</description>
