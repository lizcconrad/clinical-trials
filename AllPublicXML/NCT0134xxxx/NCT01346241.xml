      The purpose of this study is to examine the feasibility of delivering IPCT in three rural VA
      community based outpatient clinics (CBOCs).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      We will first need to develop a more thorough understanding of the potential barriers
      associated with implementing this novel form of treatment in these settings by conducting
      focus groups at each facility. This information will then be used to modify the treatment,
      which will then be piloted with Veterans enrolled in these clinics who have panic disorder.
