    <textblock>
      This study aims to determine the effect of intermittent normoxic cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB)
      on inflammatory response, oxidative stress and myocardial reperfusion injury in adult
      patients undergoing valve replacement. The investigators hypothesized that nuclear factor
      kappa B (NFkB) was involved in regulating gene expression of myocardial inflammatory factor.

      Methods:Patients meeting the requirement will be randomized into 2 groups: the control group
      received hyperoxic reperfusion (PaO2 180-250 mmHg) throughout CPB as routine; the treatment
      group underwent 3 cycles of 5/5 min normal/high oxygenation (PaO2 80-150/180-250 mmHg) during
      cardioplegia arrest, and maintained the same hyperoxia as the control group in the rest time
      of CPB. The clinical data of inotropes requirement, drainage, ventilation and intensive care
      time will be recorded. Venous blood samples will be taken perioperatively for detecting
      concentration of troponin I (cTnI), tumor necrosis factor-α , interleukin-6, 10, and
      malondialdehyde (MDA). Atrial biopsies will be removed before cardioplegia arrest and 30min
      after aortic de-clamping to determine the extent of neutrophil infiltration (myeloperoxidase
      activity), NFkB binding DNA activity, and gene expression of inflammatory factors (TNF-α,
      IL-6, 10).

      Statistical analysis:A sample size of at least 32 patients in each group was needed to have a
      power of 90%, significance at the two-side 5% level, on the basis that a SD of 0.2 ng/ml and
      a difference in peak serum cTnI release of about 0.15 ng/ml between control and conditioned
      patients was determined.

      Expected Results: The treatment group will have significantly lower release of cTnI,
      inflammatory factors, and MDA during CPB and afterwards. Intermittent normoxia may be related
      to less myocardial inflammation characterized by decreased myeloperoxidase activity, gene
      expression of inflammatory factors, the later may result from reduced activity of NFkB
      binding to DNA after reperfusion.
