      This study will investigate whether inspiratory muscle training in patients with end stage
      renal failure can improve strength and function.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with chronic renal failure commonly have weak respiratory muscles leading to
      problems in everyday activities and respiratory infections.

      This project aims to investigate if threshold inspiratory muscle training improves the
      strength, everyday function and participation of patients on haemodialysis. Forty eight
      patients will be recruited in a randomized controlled trial of inspiratory muscle training vs
      sham training.

      Outcome measures include the maximal inspiratory pressure and the Frenchay activities index.
      Initial data will be collected by a blinded assessor; the patients will train at 40 % of
      initial maximal inspiratory pressure for six weeks and be reassessed. If the inspiratory
      muscle training is effective, it will improve both the physical and functional components of
      the patient's lives and be recommended for all renal patients.

    <description>Inspiratory muscle training will be by a threshold trainer (Threshold at IMT device URES HS730, Respironics, New Jersey, Inc, Cedar Grove, NJ, USA), a commercially available spring-loaded inspiratory muscle training device. It will be set at 40% of the subjects baseline maximal inspiratory pressure and increased by 10% each week by an unblinded assistant. All subjects were trained with these devices for 8-10 breaths, 3 times a day, everyday for 6 weeks</description>
