    <textblock>
      The aim of this clinical study is to compare the lung exposure of the contents of the trial
      drug after administration of the fixed combination between beclomethasone and formoterol
      delivered via the new Chiesi dry powder inhaler in comparison to the beclomethasone and
      formoterol delivered via the pressurised metered dose inhaler (pMDI) using a spacer device.
      To determine lung exposure, the treatments are administered with charcoal block.

             months before the screening visit.

          4. Asthmatic patients already treated with low or medium daily dose of ICS (e.g. BDP or
             equivalent ≤ 1000 µg/die) or low dose of ICS/LABA fixed combination (e.g.
             salmeterol/fluticasone 100/500 µg/die).

          5. Patients with a pre-bronchodilator forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) ≥ 60%
             and ≤ 90% of the predicted values.

          6. Non or ex-smokers who smoked less than 5 pack-years and stopped smoking for at least 1
             year. (Pack/year: number of cigarette smoked per day multiplied by the number of years
             of smoking/20).

          7. Ability to a proper use of pMDI plus spacer and DPI devices.

          8. A cooperative attitude to be compliant with study procedures.

             excessive consumption of xanthine containing substances (daily intake in excess of 5
             cups of coffee, tea, cola, etc) or psychological or other emotional problems likely to
             invalidate informed consent, or limit the ability of the subject to comply with the
             protocol requirements;

         10. Diagnosis of restrictive lung disease.

         11. Patients treated with oral or parenteral corticosteroids in the previous 2 months

             hepatic, endocrine diseases, or any laboratory abnormality indicative of a significant
             underlying condition, that may interfere with patient's safety, compliance, or study
             evaluations, according to the investigator's opinion.
