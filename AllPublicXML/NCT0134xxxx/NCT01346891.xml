    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to detect if there are any differences in the coding region of
      SLC12A3 gene in individuals who have had hyponatremia associated to the use of thiazides, and
      those thiazides consumers without hyponatremia that have demonstrated good tolerance to the
      drug.

      This is a Case Control study to compare the coding region of SLC12A3 gene in individuals who
      have had hyponatremia associated to the use of thiazides, and those thiazides consumers
      without hyponatremia that have demonstrated good tolerance to the drug.
