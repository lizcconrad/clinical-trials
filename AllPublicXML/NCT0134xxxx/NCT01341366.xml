  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:

      Laparoscopic colorectal surgery has been shown by randomized trials to be associated with
      better short-term clinical outcomes when compared with open surgery. However, in a
      traditional perioperative care setting, the reduction in hospital stay following laparoscopic
      surgery in these trials was modest. Fast-track perioperative programs have been introduced in
      the West to optimize perioperative factors to reduce the physiological/psychological stress
      of open colorectal surgery. However, few studies have evaluated the impact of fast-track
      programs on the outcomes after laparoscopic colorectal surgery.

      Objective:

      To compare the clinical and immunological outcomes of Hong Kong Chinese patients undergoing
      laparoscopic surgery for colorectal cancer with a &quot;traditional&quot; vs. a &quot;fast-track&quot;
      perioperative program.

      Design:

      Prospective randomized trial.

      Subjects:

      One hundred and twenty-eight consecutive patients undergoing elective laparoscopic resection
      of non-metastatic colonic and upper rectal cancer will be recruited.

      Interventions:

      Patients will be randomized to a &quot;traditional&quot; or a &quot;fast-track&quot; perioperative program.

      Outcome measures:

      Primary outcome: total postoperative hospital stay, including hospital stay of patients who
      are readmitted within 30 days after surgery. Secondary outcomes: immunological parameters
      (including systemic cytokine response and cell-mediated immune function), morbidity and
      mortality, quality of life, and medical costs.
