      This study is being performed to document the outcomes of subjects using our MaxAn Anterior
      Cervical Plate and assess them for Adjacent level Disease. All subjects will be followed for
      2 years.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this Post Market Surveillance Validation is to document the performance and
      clinical outcomes of the MaxAn® Anterior Cervical Plate System. Dr. Park, et.al conducted a
      retrospective review and found a positive association between adjacent-level ossification
      following anterior cervical plate procedures and the plate-to-disc distance. 1 They concluded
      that when the anterior cervical plates were placed at least 5mm away from the adjacent disc
      spaces, there was a decrease in the likelihood of moderate-to-severe adjacent-level
      ossification. The design of the MaxAn Anterior Cervical Plate and accompanying technique
      allows this type of plate placement; therefore we will be looking at the radiographic
      outcomes of these subjects and comparing them to the retrospective chart review conducted by
      Dr. Park using the MaxAn Technique allows you to achieve plate placement of 5mm from the
      supraadjacent level which will help minimize the risk of adjacent level ossification.

    <description>Disc Degeneration, including Adjacent Level Degeneration, will be qualitatively graded in accordance with the following definitions 0. None: No disc space narrowing, no osteophytes, no endplate sclerosis
Mild: &lt; 33% disc space narrowing, mild osteophytes, no endplate sclerosis
Moderate: 33% - 66% disc space narrowing, moderate osteophytes, mild to moderate endplate sclerosis
Severe: ≥ 67% disc space narrowing, severe osteophytes or bridging, severe endplate sclerosis</description>

    <measure>Change in Disc Height</measure>
    <time_frame>24 Months</time_frame>
    <description>Change in disc height is defined as the change in distance between the anterior-inferior (posterior-inferior) corner of the superior vertebra, and the corresponding corner of the inferior vertebra. This change is measured perpendicular to the superior endplate of the inferior vertebra. Change in average disc height is calculated as the simple average of the change in anterior and posterior disc heights. Change in disc height is calculated by subtracting the measured disc height at one time point from a baseline disc height measurement. The results will be recorded in units of millimeters.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Fusion Status</measure>
    <time_frame>24 Months</time_frame>
    <description>Fusion will be assessed by an independent radiographer when data collection is complete at each site. The radiographic report (if available) and the x-rays will be sent to an independent radiologist for review at the end of the study. X-rays will be evaluated at each visit for fusion determination. The grading system is as follows:
Grade 1 - No graft incorporation
Grade 2 - Incomplete graft incorporation
Grade 3 - Graft Incorporation
Grade 4 - Solid fusion with graft incorporation</description>

        This post market surveillance study will enroll two hundred (200) subjects across 10
        clinical centers within the United States with subjects followed for 24 months
        post-surgery. All subjects enrolled in the study will be recruited from the pool of
        subjects presenting to each investigational site for an anterior cervical fusion procedure.
        The 10 surgeons chosen to participate in this study will be thoroughly knowledgeable in the
        medical, surgical and mechanical aspects of the MaxAn® Anterior Cervical Plate System. The
        following inclusion and exclusion criteria must be met for a patient to be considered
        eligible for participation in this study.
