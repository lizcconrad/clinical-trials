      Women undergoing myeloablative allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplant (MA HCT) will receive
      GnRH agonist leuprolide. Women undergoing reduced intensity allogeneic (RIC) HCT will be
      observed.

      This study is to use gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH) agonist leuprolide prior
      myeloablative hematopoietic cell transplantation to prevent ovarian dysfunction in
      post-menarchal women.

      The primary objective is to determine the effect of GnRH agonists on the incidence of ovarian
      failure.

      The secondary objectives are

        -  to determine how effective GnRH agonists are at suppressing menses during

        -  to determine the incidence and timing of resumption of menstrual cycles after HCT

        -  to determine the incidence and timing of resumption of normal FSH and LH levels after
           HCT

        -  to determine the incidence of normal AMH levels after HCT

        -  to determine the effect of GnRH agonists on immune reconstitution after HCT

        -  to assess the safety and tolerability of GnRH agonists in the context of HCT

      A total of 47 patients will be accrued in this study.

    <description>A reduced-intensity conditioning transplant is a bone marrow or cord blood transplant (also called a BMT) that uses less intense treatment to prepare for transplant than a standard transplant does. While a standard transplant uses the pre-transplant treatment to destroy most of the disease cells, a reduced-intensity transplant relies on the donor's immune cells to fight disease.</description>

reduced intensity allogeneic HCT: A reduced-intensity conditioning transplant is a bone marrow or cord blood transplant (also called a BMT) that uses less intense treatment to prepare for transplant than a standard transplant does.

reduced intensity allogeneic HCT: A reduced-intensity conditioning transplant is a bone marrow or cord blood transplant (also called a BMT) that uses less intense treatment to prepare for transplant than a standard transplant does. While a standard transplant uses the pre-transplant treatment to destroy most of the disease cells, a reduced-intensity transplant relies on the donor's immune cells to fight disease.</description>
