  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Standard treatment of metastatic colorectal cancers relies on fluoropyrimidines, irinotecan
      alone or in association with fluoropyrimidines, oxaliplatin in association with
      fluoropyrimidines, bevacizumab and anti EGFR antibodies. After failure of classical regimen
      the national reference frame on the basis of phase II study proposes an association of
      fluoropyrimidine and mitomycin. These treatments give response rates of 10-20% with
      progression free survivals from 2 to 3 months. Hepatic intra-arterial chemotherapy is logical
      in the case of isolated hepatic metastases nonaccessible to curative resection: 1) hepatic
      metastases are vascularized by hepatic arterial system in contrast to nontumoral hepatic
      parenchyma; 2) arterial perfusion of oxaliplatin leads to a strong extraction by the liver
      during the first passage, a high intra-tumoral concentration and a low systemic
      concentration. So oxaliplatin is a drug of choice for arterial treatment but combination with
      fluoropyrimidines is impossible because of need for prolonged perfusion. Floxuridin is not
      available in France. Raltitrexed, a definitive inhibitor of the thymidylate synthase, does
      not require a prolonged perfusion and could be a good substitute.In a previous pilot study we
      demonstrated the feasibility, safety and efficacy of combination of raltitrexed and
      oxaliplatin arterial perfusion. Now we propose a phase II randomized clinical trial to
      evaluate the efficacy of hepatic arterial infusion of raltitrexed and oxaliplatin association
      versus standard chemotherapy for patients with metastases of colorectal origin restricted to
      the liver after failure of conventional chemotherapy.
