    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the improvement in the severity of
      constipation (from Baseline to Day 28), determined by the constipation severity instrument
      (CSI) score [1], compared to placebo, following a total daily oral dose of 15 g TU-100
      administered for 28 consecutive days in adult subjects with functional constipation.
