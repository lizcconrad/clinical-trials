      The purpose of this study is to determine the proportion of men with known or suspected
      coronary artery disease (CAD) and/or peripheral arterial disease (PAD) that have angiographic
      identifiable erectile related artery (ERA) atherosclerotic disease defined as at least one
      ERA stenosis greater than or equal to 50% (per core lab Quantitative Vascular Analysis -
      QVA).

    <textblock>
      Vascular insufficiency is a commonly cited cause of Erectile Dysfunction (ED) and the most
      common treatments of ED target aspects of the penile vasculature. Initial pharmacotherapy
      typically focuses on the penile microvasculature; however, surgical revascularization has
      also been used to treat ED caused by lesions in the internal iliac artery (IIA) and/or
      internal pudendal artery (IPA) and penile arteries. Anatomically, surgical revascularization
      connects the inferior epigastric artery to the dorsal artery of the penis or a combination of
      the dorsal artery and vein of the penis. The pudendal artery or deep artery of the penis is
      usually not the target of surgical bypass. Recent advances in percutaneous revascularization
      have sparked interest in penile revascularization to treat ED.

      However, as this new percutaneous treatment modality evolves, several important clinical
      questions remain unanswered. Important among these are what is the normal angiographic
      anatomy of the erectile related arteries (ERA), and how do angiographic findings correlate
      with symptoms of ED? Also, how many men could possible benefit from percutaneous
      revascularization?

      The normal IPA anatomy by contrast angiography is not well defined and there are no studies
      that correlate IPA findings with erectile function. While studies have been done on
      populations of men with suspected vasculogenic and chronic ED, no study has established the
      normal angiographic anatomy of the IPA or evaluated the prevalence of angiographic IPA
      occlusive disease.

      Therefore, an angiographic prevalence study will assist in determining the population of men
      who could potentially benefit from percutaneous treatment of atherosclerotic IPA lesions.
