  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to establish the accuracy of pedicle positioning using
      continuous electrical pulse during screwing. Additionally, the investigators evaluate if this
      maneuver can prevent neurological injury during track creation and screwing in lumbar and
      thoracic spine instrumentation surgery

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Pedicle screw instrumentation as part of spine surgery is a recurrent technique used for most
      of spine surgeons. Since its description by Boucher in 1959 and its popularization later by
      Roy-Camille, has been considered a technique that demands great anatomy knowledge and some
      grade of expertise. Even in experienced hands the misplacement of pedicle screws could have
      an incidence of 10-40% (average of 20%). Medially misplacements during track creation and
      screw insertion are the most feared complications, because the anatomic relationship between
      medial pedicle wall and neural structures. The first attempt to use continuous electrical
      stimulation during pedicle track creation and screw insertion was communicated in 1997 by
      Welch WC, et al. In that study they used the bone impedance as a direct measurement of
      pedicle wall integrity; unfortunately they used inhaled anesthetics and assessed the final
      screw position with plain X-rays. They reported a sensibility and specificity of 98% and 99%
      respectively. The great limitation for this study is its assessment of screw accuracy
      performed by plain X-rays, now a days the best way to do it is with computed tomography (CT).

      After the Welch report, a couple of studies more have used similar techniques in the thoracic
      spine trying to avoid neurological injuries during pedicle screw insertion, but none
      described the use of continuous train pulses during screwing.

      The present study pretends to evaluate the final accuracy and trans-operative usefulness of
      the pulse train stimulation during track creation and screw insertion using intra venous
      anesthetic agents and CT scans to assess the integrity of pedicle walls

    <description>- Continuous electrical stimulation delivered by a wire connected to the surgical instruments only during pedicle track creation and screw placement combined with neurophysiological monitoring will let us identify any IONM alert, defined as nerve irritation or a decrease in voltage and/or amplitude response. This is a single and immediate measurement obtained at surgery during spinal screw placement.</description>

    <time_frame>On day 2 after surgery before patient discharge, a CT scan will be performed</time_frame>
    <description>On day 2 post surgery, a CT scan with sagittal, coronal and axial reconstructions will be obtained . The same day of the study, two independent observers will assess the accuracy of screws inside lumbar pedicles, recording in millimeters, any pedicle wall violation on sagittal, axial and coronal views for each screw placed. In that way we could have the accuracy of pedicle screws placed with the proposed technique, before patient discharge.</description>
