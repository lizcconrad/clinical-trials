      This is a safety and tolerability trial to evaluate the effect of subretinal injection of
      human embryonic stem cell derived retinal pigment epithelium cells in patients with dry Age
      Related Macular Degeneration (AMD) and to perform exploratory evaluation of potential
      efficacy endpoints to be used in future studies retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) cellular
      therapy.

      This study is a Phase I/II, open-label, non randomized, sequential, multi-center clinical
      trial. There will be 5 cohorts, the 4 low vision cohorts will contain 3 patients, the better
      vision cohort will contain 4 patients. The enrolled cohorts will be as follows:

      Three AMD patients- 50,000 MA09-hRPE cells transplanted Three AMD patients- 100,000 MA09-hRPE
      cells transplanted Four Better Vision AMD patients- 100,000 MA09-hRPE cells transplanted
      Three AMD patients- 150,000 MA09-hRPE cells transplanted Three AMD patients- 200,000
      MA09-hRPE cells transplanted

      Patients will be enrolled sequentially, and within each cohort of 3 patients, each patient's
      clinical course over the first 6 weeks following cell transplantation will be reviewed by an
      independent (DSMB) before enrollment is opened for the next 2 patients. A full safety
      assessment of all 3 patients in each cohort will be made by the DSMB when the 3rd patient in
      each cohort completes 4 weeks of follow-up, and before the first patient in the next cohort
      receives a cell transplant. The exception is the better vision group where all patients may
      be enrolled once DSMB approval has been received.

      Each cohort will be enrolled sequentially in turn, with the exception of the better vision
      cohort which may be enrolled in parallel with the other cohorts.

      The day of the cell implantation will be Day 0, and patients will remain in the study until
      the last visit at 12 months.
