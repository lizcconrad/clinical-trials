  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The role of surgical resection in the management of Malignant Pleural Mesothelioma (MPM) is
      still controversial. The selection criterion to perform either Extrapleural Pneumonectomy
      (EPP) or Pleurectomy/Decortication (P/D) is dependent not only on the cardio-pulmonary status
      of the patient, tumor stage and intraoperative findings but also on surgeons' decision and
      philosophy. There are no established guidelines. Radical Pleurectomy (RP) competes against
      EPP as surgical therapy modality. Both surgical approaches are cytoreductive treatment
      options. The aim is to remove all gross disease and to achieve macroscopic complete
      resection.

      Originally P/D was a palliative option for controlling pleural effusion. But lung-sparing
      surgery for MPM seems to be an alternative to patients unsuitable or unwilling to undergo EPP
      in a multimodality therapy concept. Most studies evaluating multimodality therapies for MPM
      are based on retrospective analyses and their interpretation is difficult because of
      inhomogeneous patient groups studied.

      The aim of our study was to analyze the feasibility and results of RP as surgical therapy
      modality in a standardized trimodality therapy concept.
