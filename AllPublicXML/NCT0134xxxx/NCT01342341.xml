  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall goals of this study are to (1) expand knowledge about interactions of
      chlorzoxazone with alcohol by assessing the effects of chlorzoxazone compared to placebo in
      moderate and heavy social alcohol users and (2) to compare the effects of chlorzoxazone on
      visual cue induced alcohol craving to placebo in moderate to heavy social alcohol users.

      The investigators propose a 45-day, double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover study in light
      to moderate and heavy alcohol users.

      The specific aims are to:

        1. Determine if chlorzoxazone alters daily alcohol consumption by comparing the mean drinks
           consumed per day during chlorzoxazone administration compared with the mean drinks per
           day consumed during placebo administration.

        2. To determine if polymorphisms in genes encoding for neurotransmitters or receptors
           involved in alcohol reward, abuse, dependence, craving, or relapse may predict the level
           of response to chlorzoxazone's effects on alcohol consumption or craving.

        3. To investigate any change in alcohol craving during a cue induced craving task where
           participants view and respond to a number of images.
