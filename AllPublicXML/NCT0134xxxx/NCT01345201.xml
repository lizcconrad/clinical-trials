  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label Phase 1 dose escalation study of OMP-18R5 in subjects with a solid
      tumor for which there is no remaining standard curative therapy and no therapy with a
      demonstrated survival benefit. Up to 44 subjects will be enrolled at up to 2 centers.
      Subjects will be assessed for safety, immunogenicity, pharmacokinetics, biomarkers, and
      efficacy. No formal interim analyses will be performed.

      Prior to enrollment, subjects will undergo screening to determine study eligibility. Upon
      enrollment, subjects will receive intravenous (IV) infusions of OMP-18R5 at a assigned dosing
      schedule for 56 days. After 56 days, subjects will be assessed for disease status. If there
      is no evidence of disease progression or if the tumor is smaller, then subjects may continue
      to receive IV infusions of OMP-18R5 every week until disease progression.

      Dose escalation will be conducted to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD). No dose
      escalation or reduction will be allowed within a dose cohort. The first 2 subjects enrolled
      in a cohort will not be treated on the same day. The dose may be administered at any time
      during the day. Three subjects will be treated at each dose level if no dose-limiting
      toxicities (DLTs) are observed. If 1 of 3 subjects experiences a DLT, that dose level will be
      expanded to 6 subjects. If 2 or more subjects experience a DLT, no further subjects will be
      dosed at that level and 3 additional subjects will be added to the preceding dose cohort
      unless 6 subjects have already been treated at that dose level. Subjects will be assessed for
      DLTs from the time of the first dose through 28 days. Dose escalation for newly enrolled
      subjects, if appropriate, will occur after all subjects in a cohort have completed their Day
      28 DLT assessment. Subjects with stable disease or a response at Day 56 will be allowed to
      continue to receive weekly doses of OMP-18R5 until disease progression. An additional 14
      subjects will be enrolled at the highest dose level that result in &lt; 2 of the 6 subjects
      experiencing a Grade 3 (not including a Grade 3 infusion reaction that resolves in 24 hours)
      or 4 adverse event (DLT).

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Subjects must have a histologically confirmed malignancy that is metastatic or
             unresectable for which there is no remaining standard curative therapy and no therapy
             with a demonstrated survival benefit. In addition, subjects must have a tumor that is
             at least 1 cm in a single dimension and is radiographically apparent on CT or MRI.

          2. Subjects must have received their last chemotherapy, biologic, or investigational
             therapy at least 4 weeks prior to enrollment, 6 weeks if the last regimen included
             BCNU or mitomycin C.
