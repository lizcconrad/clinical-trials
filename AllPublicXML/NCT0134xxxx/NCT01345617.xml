      The primary aim of the study is to determine if the CF Quantum Sweat Test provides sweat
      chloride results that are equivalent to the results from traditional sweat testing. The
      secondary aim of the study is to assess the quantity not sufficient rate of the CF Quantum
      Sweat Test compared to traditional sweat testing.

      All 50 states and the District of Columbia are performing newborn screening for cystic
      fibrosis (CF). Infants who have a positive newborn screen require follow-up with a sweat
      test. Gibson-Cooke Quantitative Pilocarpine Iontophoresis (GCQPIT) requires collecting sweat
      in microbore tubing or on gauze/filter paper and analyzing sweat using a chloridometer. This
      test has many difficulties including specimens that are quantity not sufficient (QNS), many
      steps of pipetting solutions in the laboratory, and the need for a chloridometer to analyze
      sweat chloride concentration. The only manufacturer of a chloridometer has ceased production
      of this instrument. The CF QuantumÂ® Sweat Test System (CFQT) overcomes all of the
      difficulties of GCQPIT. This pilot study will determine if the CFQT provides results that are
      equivalent to GCQPIT.
