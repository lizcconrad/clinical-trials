  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to compare healthcare utilization and costs in
      Medicare-eligible asthma patients (aged &gt;65) who receive fluticasone propionate/salmeterol
      xinafoate combination or inhaled corticosteroids in a typical clinical practice using a
      retrospective observational cohort study design of large managed care database. Outcomes on
      interest include asthma related severe exacerbations defined as asthma related emergency
      department visits, hospitalizations or combined emergency department/hospitalization. Other
      outcomes of interest include use of albuterol, oral corticosteroids and overall asthma
      related costs. Outcomes of interest will be compared between the two treatment cohorts
      (fluticasone propionate/salmeterol xinafoate combination or inhaled corticosteroids).
      Dichotomous outcomes (emergency visits, hospitalizations etc) will be compared using Cox
      regression hazards analysis assessing time to first event for each asthma related endpoint
      adjusting for differences in baseline demographics such as age, gender, previous asthma
      medication use, co morbidities, costs, and plan demographics. Total asthma related costs will
      also be compared using generalized linear models adjusting for baseline differences.

    <measure>Mean Number of Post-index Asthma-related Events Measured Using Medical and Pharmacy Claims</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 7 years from July 1, 2001 to June 30, 2008</time_frame>
    <description>Asthma-related events were defined as events with any primary ICD-9 code of 493.xx for hospitalizations, emergency department visits, and combined hospitalization/emergency department visits. The post-index period is defined as 3-12 months after either the first administration of fluticasone propionate and salmetrol or inhaled corticosteroids. Medical and pharmacy claims are recorded healthcare encounters in a large managed care administrative insurance database.</description>

    <measure>Mean Asthma-related Costs in the Post-index Period</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 7 years from July 1, 2001 to June 30, 2008</time_frame>
    <description>Asthma-related costs were calculated as pharmacy costs, medical costs, and total asthma (pharmacy plus medical) costs. Medical costs were made up of asthma-related visits, hospitalizations, emergency department visits, and medical office visits. Pharmacy costs were comprised of all asthma-related medications used during the follow-up period. Medical services were identified by place of service and PharMetrics-specific confinement codes. Prescriptions were counted by 30-day fills, with fills less than 30 days rounded up to indicate one fill.</description>

        <description>Asthma-related costs were calculated as pharmacy costs, medical costs, and total asthma (pharmacy plus medical) costs. Medical costs were made up of asthma-related visits, hospitalizations, emergency department visits, and medical office visits. Pharmacy costs were comprised of all asthma-related medications used during the follow-up period. Medical services were identified by place of service and PharMetrics-specific confinement codes. Prescriptions were counted by 30-day fills, with fills less than 30 days rounded up to indicate one fill.</description>
