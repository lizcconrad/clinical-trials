  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This pilot clinical trial studies robotic-assisted surgery in treating patients with spine
      tumors. Robotic-assisted surgery is a less invasive type of surgery for spine tumors and may
      have fewer side effects and improve recovery

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To perform a small pilot study that will demonstrate the feasibility of neurosurgical
      spinal procedures using the da Vinci surgical robot.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To compare complication rates, operative time and estimated blood loss with historical
      controls.

      II. To observe wound healing, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leaks, neurological injury and
      hardware failure.

      II. Routine imaging of the spinal segment.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients undergo robotic-assisted surgery using the da Vinci robot.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 100 days.

          -  Expected survival greater than 3 months

          -  Patient must be able to understand and sign a study-specific informed consent form

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Previous surgery at that specific segment

          -  Radiation at that specific spinal segment within the last 2 months

          -  Karnofsky PS &lt; 80 or ECOG PS &gt; 1

          -  Pregnancy (due to risk of anesthesia)

             procedure

          -  History of psychiatric condition or diminished capacity that could compromise the
             giving of informed consent, or interfere with study compliance
