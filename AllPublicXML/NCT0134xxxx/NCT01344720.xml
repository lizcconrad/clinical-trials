    <textblock>
      This randomized, single-blind, parallel-group study will investigate the efficacy and the
      tolerability of a combination treatment of etoricoxib (30 mg/day) plus controlled-release
      oxycodone (10 mg/day) compared with a titrated dose of etoricoxib up to 60mg/day as
      monotherapy , in patients with Chronic Low Back Pain (CLBP) who have not responded to the
      starting dose of Etoricoxib 30mg/day. A common clinical question is that is it better to
      increase the dose of the current monotherapy or to combine both treatments early on, in
      patients who do not respond to standard start doses of NSAIDs like etoricoxib.

             the assessment of the CLBP. Examples of painful conditions that could be confused like
             peripheral vascular disease (ischemic pain); neurological disorders (for example,
             phantom limb pain from amputation); skin condition in the area of the neuropathy that
             could alter sensation (for example, plantar ulcer); other painful conditions (for
             example, arthritis, neoplasm, fibromyalgia, CRPS).
