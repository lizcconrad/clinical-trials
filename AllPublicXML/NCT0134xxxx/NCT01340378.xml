  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary goal of this investigation is to describe perioperative thrombin generation in
      neonates undergoing placement of a Blalock-Taussig (BT) shunt to better understand the
      coagulation changes that precipitate postoperative shunt occlusion.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      To accomplish our goal, the investigators will measure preoperative levels of one major
      procoagulant (prothrombin) and one major anticoagulant (Antithrombin). The investigators will
      also measure preoperative and postoperative thrombelastograms (TEG) and preoperative and
      postoperative thrombin generation curves (TGC).

    <measure>Thrombin generation - peak amount</measure>
    <time_frame>2 years</time_frame>
    <description>The thrombin generating capacity of plasma is measured using a fluorogenic substrate. Coagulation is initiated by contact activation and thrombin generation is monitored by a microplate fluorometer set that displays the progression of the fluorescence reaction. The peak amount of thrombin generated is expressed by absorbancy (nM).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Thrombin Generation Curve validation in neonates</measure>
    <time_frame>2 years</time_frame>
    <description>The peak amount of thrombin generated as determined by the thrombin generation curve will be compared to the peak amount of thrombin generated as determined by the thromboelastogram. Both measure thrombin generation by absorbancy (nM).</description>
