      Study Design This is a multicenter, open label, first line phase II study in elderly (≥ 65
      years old) metastatic Renal Cell Carcinoma (mRCC) patients not suitable for any other
      currently approved treatment (bevacizumab+INF, cytokines or sunitinib) except for sorafenib.

      Each patient treated with sorafenib enrolled in the study will be trained to observe the
      management tool for skin care. A study period of 3 years was estimated as follows: an
      enrollment period of 24 months and a further follow-up period of 12 months.

      Objectives of the trial Primary objective The primary aim of this trial is the evaluation of
      the efficacy of a patient education program in the reduction of Hand-Foot Skin Reaction
      (HFSR).

      Secondary Objectives

      TO assess:

        -  The frequency of dose discontinuation, interruption and reduction

        -  The incidence of any grade diarrhoea, and other adverse events

        -  The overall Response Rate according to the RECIST criteria.

        -  Progression free survival (PFR) in study population and comparison of PFS between age
           sub groups in the current study population

      Rationale of the present study For several decades, the systemic management of metastatic
      renal cell cancer (mRCC) was confined to the use of interferon (IFN) and interleukin-2
      (IL-2). Recently, options for the medical management of mRCC have been improved through the
      introduction of agents targeting tumour angiogenesis or intracellular pathways mediating
      growth and proliferation. Among these agents are the small molecule inhibitors sorafenib
      (Nexavar), sunitinib (Sutent), temsirolimus (Torisel) and everolimus, and the monoclonal
      antibody bevacizumab (Avastin). All these targeted agents have been shown significantly to
      extend progression-free or overall survival or both when compared with placebo or IFN therapy
      in the treatment of mRCC.

      Adverse events are commonly observed in clinical practice by using these small molecule
      inhibitors in mRCC patients. Concerning the use of bevacizumab the most commonly observed
      adverse events are hypertension, proteinuria, bleeding and thrombosis. For sunitinib the most
      frequent adverse events include hand-foot syndrome, stomatitis, diarrhea, fatigue,
      hypothyroidism and hypertension.

      Most common adverse events with sorafenib are hand foot skin reaction (HFSR) rash,
      desquamation, fatigue, diarrhea, nausea, hypothyroidism and hypertension.Several studies and
      recommendations have been published in order to suggest how to manage sorafenib adverse
      reactions and in particular the HFSR.

      The aim of this study is to evaluate if patients education programs for the prevention of
      dermatological events (HFSR, rash, desquamation) can reduce the onset these adverse events
      (all grades). The reduction of dermatological adverse effects would concomitantly limit the
      frequencies of sorafenib dose reduction and interruptions in mRCC patients not suitable for
      cytokines or anti-angiogenesis (bevacizumab or sunitinib) therapy as first line treatment.

      Treatment Administration Sorafenib will be orally administered at a daily dose of 400 mg
      taken twice daily without food, at least one hour before or two hours after eating. Four
      weeks of treatments will be considered as a cycle. Each patient enrolled in the study will
      received medications for topical therapy. Dermatological medications will be provided free.

      In case of toxicities, dose reduction/interruption is permitted according to the flow
      charts/dose modifications.

      In case of disease progression, or unacceptable toxicities Sorafenib administration will be
      discontinued.

      The patient will be considered &quot;out of treatment&quot; if Sorafenib intake is stopped for more
      than 30 consecutive days and the patient will be considered for survival.

    <description>The primary aim is to determine the efficacy of the patient education program in reducing the incidence of HFSR(all grades).The efficacy is measured in terms of percentage of HFSR-free.Simon's methods will be used to calculate sample size(Simon R,1989).Considering the optimal two-stage design for phase II,considering a difference p1-p0=20% and fixing error probabilities(alfa=0.05 and beta=0.20),the number of patients for the first step is 16.The trial will be terminated if less than 7 HFSR-free patients will be seen.Otherwise the accrual will continue up to a total of 46 patients.</description>
