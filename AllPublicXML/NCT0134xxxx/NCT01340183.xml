  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of the
      drug AZD5099 after intravenous administration of single doses in healthy volunteers. The
      results from this study will form the basis for decisions regarding the future development of
      AZD5099 as a novel antibiotic for the treatment of serious infections in humans.
