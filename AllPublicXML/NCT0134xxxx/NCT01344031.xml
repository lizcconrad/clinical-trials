      This phase I trial studies the side effects and the best dose of MK 2206 (Akt inhibitor
      MK2206) when given with anastrozole, fulvestrant, or anastrozole and fulvestrant in treating
      postmenopausal women with breast cancer that has spread to other parts of the body. Estrogen
      can cause the growth of breast cancer cells. Hormone therapy using anastrozole or fulvestrant
      may fight breast cancer by lowering the amount of estrogen the body makes. Akt inhibitor
      MK2206 may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell
      growth. Giving Akt inhibitor MK2206 together with anastrozole, fulvestrant, or anastrozole
      and fulvestrant may kill more tumor cells.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of MK-2206 in combination with anastrozole
      based on toxicities observed during cycle 1 therapy. (Phase IA) II. To evaluate the
      tolerability of prolonged administration (3 months) of MK-2206 in combination with
      anastrozole at the MTD defined in Phase IA. (Phase IB) III. To determine the recommended
      phase II treatment dosing (RPTD) of MK-2206 in combination with anastrozole based on
      toxicities observed with prolonged drug administration. (Phase IB) IV. To determine the
      tolerability of fulvestrant (Arm C), or fulvestrant plus anastrozole (Arm D), respectively,
      in combination with MK-2206 (at the RPTD defined in Phase 1B). (Arms C and D) V. To determine
      the recommended phase II treatment dose (RPTD) of fulvestrant (Arm C) or fulvestrant plus
      anastrozole (Arm D), respectively, in combination with MK-2206 based on toxicities observed
      with prolonged drug administration (3 months). (Arms C and D) VI. To evaluate the toxicity
      profile of MK-2206 in combination with fulvestrant (Arm C) or fulvestrant plus anastrozole
      (Arm D), respectively, with prolonged drug administration. (Arms C and D)

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the toxicity profile of MK-2206 in combination with anastrozole, or
      fulvestrant, or anastrozole plus fulvestrant.

      II. To evaluate the clinical benefit rate (CBR: complete response [CR]+partial response
      [PR]+stable disease [SD] &gt; 6 months), response rate (CR+PR), and percent of patients
      progression free at 6 months with the treatment of MK-2206 in combination with anastrozole,
      or fulvestrant or anastrozole plus fulvestrant in patients with estrogen receptor positive
      (ER+) metastatic breast cancer.

      III. To examine serum levels of estradiol prior to and following 1 cycle of MK-2206 therapy.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To examine baseline tumor specimens for alterations in phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase
      (PI3K) and other pathway genes and to explore their relationship with treatment response.

      II. To evaluate the effect of MK-2206 on tumor cell v-akt murine thymoma viral oncogene
      homolog 1 (AKT) signaling, proliferation, and apoptosis using serially collected tumor
      samples in available cases.

      III. To examine changes in tumor cell glucose uptake by positron emission tomography (PET)
      with 2-[18F]fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (FDG) at baseline and 24 h post day 1 MK-2206. (Phase
      IA) IV. To examine the phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate 3-kinase, catalytic subunit
      alpha (PIK3CA) mutation status in circulating deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) at baseline and
      following study therapy and to correlate with tumor tissue PIK3CA status and treatment
      response.

      OUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose-escalation study of Akt inhibitor MK2206 followed by a
      recommended phase II dose (RPTD) study. Patients are assigned to the treatment arm that is
      currently open.

      ARM A: Patients receive anastrozole orally (PO) on days 1-28. Beginning in course 2, patients
      receive Akt inhibitor MK-2206 PO on days 1, 8, 15, and 22. Courses repeat every 28 days in
      the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      ARM B: The RPTD of Akt inhibitor MK2206 with anastrozole is determined after 3 courses,
      administered as in Arm A.

      ARM C: Patients receive Akt inhibitor MK2206 PO on days 1, 8, 15, and 22, fulvestrant
      intramuscularly (IM) on day 1 and day 15 of course 1 and then on day 1 of each course in each
      subsequent courses. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      ARM D: Patients receive Akt inhibitor MK2206 PO as in Arm A, anastrozole PO on days 1-28 and
      fulvestrant IM on day 1. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression
      or unacceptable toxicity.

      NOTE: As of 8/19/2015, in all Arms, patients no longer receive Akt inhibitor MK2206.

      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed up for 30 days.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients may not have had chemotherapy or radiotherapy within 4 weeks (6 weeks for
             nitrosoureas or mitomycin C) prior to entering the study; patient must have recovered
             from adverse events due to agents administered more than 4 weeks earlier

          -  Patients may not be receiving any other investigational agents

          -  Patients may not have a history of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of
             similar chemical or biologic composition to MK-2206 or other agents used in the study

          -  Patients receiving any medications or substances that are strong inhibitors or
             inducers of cytochrome P450, family 3, subfamily A, polypeptide 4 (CYP 450 3A4) are
             ineligible

               -  Note: one week washout period is required in patients who were previously taking
                  strong inhibitors or inducers of CYP450 3A4; patients who are currently taking
                  moderate inhibitors or inducers of CYP450 3A4 are encouraged to switch to other
                  medications that do not interact with CYP450 3A4

          -  Patients with diabetes or in risk for hyperglycemia should not be excluded from trials
             with MK-2206, but the hyperglycemia should be well controlled on oral agents before
             the patient enters the trial (i.e. HbA1c =&lt; 8% and fasting glucose =&lt; 120 mg/dL)

          -  Cardiovascular: baseline QT Fridericia formula (QTcF) &gt; 450 msec (male) or QTcF &gt; 470
             msec (female) will exclude patients from entry on study

          -  Patients may not have uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to,
             ongoing or active infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina
             pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would
             limit compliance with study requirements

          -  Pregnant or nursing patients are excluded from the study

          -  Patients with known human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) positive status are excluded
             from this study

          -  Patients may not have had disease progression on anastrozole (Phase IA and Phase IB),
             fulvestrant (Arm C), both anastrozole and fulvestrant (Arm D) in either the
             neoadjuvant, adjuvant (defined as disease recurrence identified within 6 months of
             adjuvant discontinuation), or metastatic setting

          -  Patients may not have had grade 3 or intolerable grade 2 adverse events during run-in
             aromatase inhibitor (AI) or fulvestrant therapy prior to starting MK-2206

          -  Patients may not have had prior therapy with an AKT inhibitor
