  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Alcohol dependence, or &quot;alcoholism&quot;, affects approximately 14 million Americans. Currently,
      only three pharmacotherapies (disulfiram, naltrexone, and acamprosate) have been approved for
      the treatment of alcohol dependence and these medications are, at best, moderately
      successful. Thus, there is a great need for the examination of other biological systems,
      which contribute/influence the drug reward/addiction pathways within the brain, such that the
      discovery of new targets and new pharmacotherapies will be possible. Other biological systems
      in addition to dopamine, such as serotonin, and norepinephrine (NE) are thought to be
      important in several aspects of addiction, including reward, craving and depression.

      This study will examine the effects of a 5 day course of atomoxetine (a selective NE
      transporter (NET) inhibitor) (80 mg/day; Strattera or placebo) on alcohol-elicited craving
      and sensitivity to alcohol. The novelty of this study is that of atomoxetine and the fact
      that it targets NET, neither of which has heretofore been examined in the context of alcohol
      dependence. It is hopeful that this study, of 64 total individuals, will provide the PI with
      sufficient preliminary data to submit a subsequent R01 application to study atomoxetine and
      the involvement of specific single nucleotide polymorphisms within the NET gene on
      alcohol-related phenotypes in alcohol dependent and non-dependent populations. The long-term
      objective of this research is to develop more efficacious treatment interventions for alcohol
      abuse and dependence.

      Design:

      NET genotype groups for rs11648486 SNP (CC 61%; CT 33%; TT 4%) (e.g., C/C and C/T) will be
      compared to one another in a 2 (NET Genotype: C/C vs. C/T &amp; T/T) x 2 (Medication: atomoxetine
      80 mg/day (~ vs. placebo) x 3 (Drink: Drink 1, 2, and 3) mixed factorial repeated measures
      design using PROC MIXED in SAS by calculating difference scores. Of interest are the possible
      interactions of the NET SNPs and atomoxetine on cue-elicited craving and the rewarding
      effects of alcohol across trials.

    <description>This questionnaire is used to assess craving. The AUQ consists of eight items related to urge drink that are rated on a 7-point Likert scale with the extremes anchored by &quot;Strongly Disagree&quot; and &quot;Strongly Agree.&quot; The AUQ has demonstrated internal consistency and reliability (Bohn et al., 1995).</description>
