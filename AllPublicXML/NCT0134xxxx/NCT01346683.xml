  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To investigate the clinical efficacy of Osseospeed™ TX implants in a Chinese population by
      evaluation of marginal bone level alteration, implant stability and implant survival in the
      posterior mandible up to 3 years after loading. Hypothesis: Early loading of the posterior
      mandible is a safe and predictable procedure.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Marginal bone level alteration</measure>
    <time_frame>At 12 months after implant loading</time_frame>
    <description>Marginal Bone Level will be determined from radiographs and expressed as the difference from a reference point on the implant to the most coronal bone-to-implant contact on the mesial and distal aspect of the implant. Marginal Bone Level expressed in millimeters at the 12 months follow-up visit will be compared to values obtained at delivery of permanent restoration i.e. loading (baseline).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Implant stability</measure>
    <time_frame>At implant placement, loading and at 6, 12, 24 and 36 months follow-up.</time_frame>
    <description>Implant stability will be evaluated clinically/manually (recorded as stable yes/no)</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Soft tissue status</measure>
    <time_frame>At loading and at 6, 12, 24 and 36 months follow-up.</time_frame>
    <description>Soft tissue status will be measured by assessment of bleeding on probing and measurement of probing pocket depth.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Plaque</measure>
    <time_frame>At 6, 12, 24 and 36 months follow-up.</time_frame>
    <description>Occurrence of plaque around the study implant will be recorded.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Implant survival</measure>
    <time_frame>From implant placement to 36 months after loading.</time_frame>
    <description>Implant survival rate will be evaluated clinically and radiographically.</description>

          4. Neighboring tooth to the planned bridge must have natural root.

          5. Presence of natural teeth, partial prosthesis and/or implants in the opposite jaw in
             contact with the planned bridge.
