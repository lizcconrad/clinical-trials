  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Canadians fear loss of vision more than any other disability. Vision loss has an enormous
      impact on quality-of-life and is extremely costly from a societal and economic perspective.
      In 2001, more than 600,000 Canadians were estimated to have severe vision loss, accounting
      for 17% of total disability in Canada. One in 9 individuals experience severe vision loss by
      65 years of age; however, this increases to 1 in 4 individuals by 75 years. The financial
      cost of vision loss in Canada is $15.8 billion per year. There is a general perception that
      vision loss is &quot;normal with aging&quot; but 75% of vision loss is estimated to be preventable. The
      major causes of severe vision loss are age-related macular degeneration (ARMD), glaucoma,
      particularly primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG), and diabetic retinopathy (DR). Canada is
      headed for an epidemic of age-related eye disease and, unless something is done to prepare
      for this, severe vision loss will have significant consequences in terms of societal and
      economic costs. Through this proposed Research Program, and in conjunction with our
      international academic and private sector partners, we will build and develop unique
      quantitative imaging technologies to permit non-invasive assessment of visual changes,
      structural changes in the thickness of the retina at the back of the eye and also changes in
      the amount of blood flowing through the blood vessels that feed the retina with oxygen. This
      research will add to our basic knowledge in predicting the development of sight-threatening
      change in patients with the three diseases, and facilitate earlier detection of the problem
      to help us discover earlier treatments for people with these conditions. The reliability of
      each imaging technology will be assessed by determining its ability to differentiate between
      diseased and healthy eyes. Cross-sectional analyses at yearly intervals, as well as change
      over time analyses, will be undertaken.

      There are a number of major steps that are required prior to the utilisation of these
      technologies in a clinical setting. This phase of the Proposal will aim to validate and
      calibrate the new technologies, explore the signal-to-noise ratio of RBF and oxygen
      saturation parameters, generate values to define the impact of absorption, morphological
      fundus variation and pre-retinal autofluorescence on oxygen saturation imaging and will
      establish a database of healthy control imaging values for both new technologies and the
      reproducibility of those measurements. Note: Sample size calculations have been conducted for
      all aspects of this phase of the protocol, based upon our extensive retinal vascular
      reactivity work. We will build and develop unique quantitative imaging technologies to that
      will permit us to explore the physiology of retinal and choroidal perfusion and vascular
      regulation, and retinal oxygenation.

      Having completed the Validation and Calibration phase, this research will ultimately add to
      our basic knowledge in predicting the development of sight-threatening change in patients
      with the ARMD, diabetic retinopathy and primary open glaucoma, and facilitate earlier
      detection of the problem to help us discover earlier treatments for people with these
      conditions. The reliability of each imaging technology will be assessed by determining its
      ability to differentiate between diseased and healthy eyes. Through this proposed Research
      Program, we will build and develop unique quantitative imaging technologies to:
      Comprehensively assess the blood supply to, and vascular regulation characteristics of the
      posterior segment of the eye, a diagnostic capability that is currently severely limited.
      Assess oxygen saturation disturbances in the retina and ON that occur prior to clinically
      detectable changes, diagnostic capability that currently does not exist. Using the retinal
      blood supply and oxygen saturation parameters, we will derive net oxygen delivery to the
      retina and optic nerve head (ONH), a diagnostic capability that does not exist

    <description>The Quantitative, Doppler SD-OCT Blood Flow Technology will be validated and calibrated by manipulating end-tidal blood gases using the computer-controlled gas sequencer (Slessarev et al, 2005) in 15 healthy controls. Homeostatic inner retina blood flow values and the magnitude of vascular reactivity will be compared between Doppler SD-OCT blood flow technology and the Canon Laser Blood Flowmeter, an established standard, at specific locations within the retinal vascular tree.</description>

    <description>The Quantitative, Hyper-Spectral Imaging Derived Oxygen Saturation Maps of the major retinal vessels and capillary beds will be validated and calibrated in human volunteers using our novel and exact technique that allows the precise control of the partial pressure of oxygen (PO2) to induce controlled and safe levels of hypoxia. Oxygen saturation values will be compared to measured PO2 values (i.e. recognized standard) for various levels of hypoxia and will be used to provide in-sight into the properties of the data output e.g. effective operating range, linearity of response. At the end of the study, subjects will be returned to normoxic conditions to assess reproducibility of oxygen saturation maps.</description>

    <description>Subjects with symptoms of branch and central retinal artery and vein occlusion within the past 2 months will be used to validate the Doppler SD-OCT blood flow technology and the hyperspectral imaging derived oxygen saturation maps. In cases of central retinal vein and artery occlusion, imaging values (i.e. inner retinal and choroidal blood flow, oxygen saturation values of the major retinal vessels and the capillary beds of the retina and ONH) will be compared between the affected and unaffected eyes. In cases of branch occlusion, imaging values will be compared between the affected and unaffected quadrants of the affected eye and between the affected and unaffected eyes. The difference in inner retinal and choroidal blood flow for each eye will be calculated and compared between eyes.</description>

A database of healthy control values will be established for each technology taking into account extraneous factors such as age (range 40 to 70 years) and gender. The healthy control database will be compared to the results of each individual patient in the prospective study phase of this proposed Research Program (see Prospective Study Phase, 3, Control group). Statistical confidence limits for abnormality at each time point, and for progression overtime, will be established.
