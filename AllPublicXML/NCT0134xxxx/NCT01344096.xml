      In Gaucher disease type I bleeding is a common presenting symptom, that may manifest itself
      as frequent nose bleeds, easy bruising but can also cause substantial bleeding after surgical
      or dental procedures and may occur in association with pregnancy or delivery . The bleeding
      tendency is usually considered to be secondary to thrombocytopenia However 50,000 platelets
      are enough in healthy people to give a normal bleeding time but are associated with
      significant bleeding tendencies in Gaucher patients. Bleeding tendency might be attributed by
      genetic inherited or Gaucher related coagulation factors abnormalities which in some cases
      stabilize with ERT. However, In other cases the etiology is an abnormality of platelet
      function. This thrombocytopathy has not been delineated and apart from a few aggregation
      studies, no systematic analysis has been published that convincingly shows the cause of the
      disturbed function. While, experience shows that enzyme replacement (ERT, i.e: imiglucerase,
      Cerezyme®) reduces this bleeding tendency, in part due to the improvement in the thrombocyte
      count and elevation in coagulation factors, it is less clear what effect ERT has on the
      thrombocytopathy. This has clinical significance when patients need to be prepared for
      surgery or delivery or in the event of a major bleed. There is no consensus as to how
      patients should be prepared or treated. Different centres use different approaches. When the
      procedure is elective ERT is appropriate but in other situations DDAVP, fresh frozen plasma
      and platelet infusion are possible treatments. Even activated factor VII has been used when
      bleeding was not controlled. As in any other coagulation abnormality, treatment should be
      tailored to the specific cause of the bleeding diathesis. The aim of this study is to define
      the etiology of platelet dysfunction in Gaucher patients.

      Hypothesis: The investigators expect to see a difference between platelets activation profile
      among imiglucerase treated and untreated patients with at least a partial restoration of
      platelets function due to treatment commencement.

      Objectives:

      Delineating the cause of the thrombocytopathy in Gaucher disease patients:

        1. Identifying thrombocytopathy among a cohort of 70 Gaucher patients managed (treated and
           untreated) in our clinic using a panel of platelets function tests.

        2. Understanding the etiology for platelets dysfunction in Gaucher disease.

        3. Evaluating the impact of Imiglucerase treatment duration and Gaucher disease severity on
           platelet function
