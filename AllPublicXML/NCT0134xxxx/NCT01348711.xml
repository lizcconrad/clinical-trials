      To assess the role of uterine artery and maternal serum PlGf and sflt-1 and their combination
      in screening for pre-eclampsia and small -for-gestational age (SGA) fetuses at 12-14 weeks of
      gestation

      Pre-eclampsia (PE) and intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) are known as major factors in
      perinatal morbidity and mortality. Routine antenatal care is focused on the detection of
      women at increased risk to apply this population a program of careful monitoring and
      appropriate intervention.

      Uterine artery Doppler during anomaly scan at 12 to 14 weeks in selected women at increased
      risk, has proved to be accurate to detect those who will develop PE or IUGR during the second
      half of pregnancy.

      A variety of angiogenic proteins have been studied as potential markers for pre-eclampsia.
      Among these protein Plgf and sflt-1 have respectively demonstrated higher and lower levels in
      pregnant women who will subsequently develop pre-eclampsia.

      Our study is aimed to evaluate the performance of serum Plgf and sflt-1 measurement in
      association with uterine artery Doppler as a screening for placental insufficiency.

    <description>Pre-eclampsia is defined as hypertension (systolic blood pressure 140mmHg or greater or a diastolic blood pressure 90mmHg or greater on at least 2 occasions 4 hour or 1 week apart) accompanied by proteinuria (more or equal to 0.5g/day or 1 dipstick of ++ or more).
