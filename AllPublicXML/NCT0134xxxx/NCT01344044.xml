  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to examine the efficacy of a brain-computer interface system for the
      treatment of inattentive symptoms of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). The
      investigators hypothesis is that children with ADHD receiving treatment with the BCI-based
      training will improve to a greater extent than the control group.

      Additionally, the investigators are also conducting an fMRI study involving interested
      participants, to elucidate the neural mechanisms underlying any behavioural improvement. This
      is necessary to help the investigators gain a better picture of brain correlates related to
      ADHD and understand how the intervention can affect the brain.

      This BCI study will involve 2 phases. The first phase is a preliminary study to test the
      safety and effectiveness of the novel BCI device which involves newly developed dry electrode
      sensors and intervention game. Twenty children, aged 6-12 and diagnosed with Inattentive or
      Combined subtype of ADHD will be recruited for the study. This open-label, experimental arm
      will go through 8 weeks of BCI intervention.

      The second phase will be a randomized controlled trial involving 160 children. They will be
      randomized into the treatment or control arm. The treatment arm will receive 8 weeks of BCI
      intervention, similar to the experimental arm. The other group will serve as wait-list
      controls.

      The fMRI trial aims to examine the underlying neural processes explaining any therapeutic
      effects that may be seen.

      The study will enroll 70 children with ADHD, aged 6-12, who are participating in the main
      randomized controlled trial: 40 from the BrainpalTM intervention group and 30 from the
      control group; participants will undergo fMRI scan at Week 0 and 8 or Week 8 and 16. The
      study will recruit another 30 children aged 6-12 from the community as the healthy control
      group, who will undergo the same imaging procedure once. The scans will involve both
      functional and structural imaging.

    <description>This is a experimental arm to test out the safety and effectiveness of BCI in improving ADHD symptoms. This pilot arm is necessary as the BCI device, incorporating dry electrode sensors and intervention game, is newly developed and have not been tested out in children with ADHD. This preliminary study will also allow us to test out the treatment protocol (24 sessions of BCI training over 8 weeks) to see if it is efficacious.</description>
