  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the local control rates as well as acute and late toxicity rates of
      stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) for the treatment of benign and malignant head and neck
      tumors.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This single site, non-randomized, prospective, phase IV study includes 3 patient groups to be
      treated with SBRT:

        -  Benign tumors, such as paraganglioma, chordoma, chondrosarcoma, as the sole treatment or
           to gross residual disease after maximal safe resection

        -  Malignant tumors, such as nasopharynx cancer and squamous cell carcinoma, after initial
           external beam radiation (Residual Disease Group)

        -  Unresectable malignant tumors, such as nasopharynx cancer and squamous cell carcinoma,
           adenocarcinomas, and sarcomas which are recurrent after prior radiation (Primary RT
           Group) Data collected will include baseline patient demographics, pathology data,
           radiation therapy procedure, tumor recurrence data, and toxicities.

      Follow up data will be collected during the patient's standard office visits. The anticipated
      duration of this study is 5 years.

    <description>Routine follow up will consist of CT scan of the soft tissues of the neck with IV contrast (MRI may be used). Local recurrence is defined as tumor recurrence within the planning target volume. If necessary, a PET/CT scan may be used to aid in diagnoses local tumor recurrence. A local recurrence is defined as cancer recurrence within the planning target volume.Distant metastases will not be considered a treatment failure unless accompanied by local recurrence.</description>
