      The aim of this study is to compare the efficacy of super-LED reverse phototherapy with the
      fluorescent reverse phototherapy in term and late preterm newborns.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized controlled clinical trial with hospitalized infants in the Professor
      Fernando Figueira Medicine Institute(IMIP), who require phototherapy as an indication of the
      medical team. Following the sample calculation, 144 patients will be randomized according to
      gestational age (350/7-376/7 or 380/7-416/7 weeks) to receive super-LED reverse phototherapy
      or fluorescent reverse phototherapy with spectral irradiance of 8-12 microwatts/cm2/nm.The
      bilirubin will be determined by micromethod with bilirubinometer, after blood collection in
      heparinized capillary until bilirubin reaches level that indicates suspension of therapy.
