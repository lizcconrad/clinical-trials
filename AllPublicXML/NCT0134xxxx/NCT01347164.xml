    <textblock>
      Black men who have sex with men (MSM) have the highest rates of HIV infection in the United
      States and represent a population in need of new HIV prevention interventions. Although 20 to
      40% of Black MSM are estimated to have female partners, no interventions tailored to the
      needs of Black MSM/W have been developed and rigorously evaluated. This project will develop,
      implement, and evaluate an individual-level intervention (ILI), titled &quot;RISE&quot;, that will
      assist Black MSM/W to reduce their risk for acquiring and transmitting HIV infection. This
      intervention will address the effect of individual level factors, interpersonal relationships
      including sexual, peer and family relationships, and socio-cultural influences on the sexual
      risk behaviors of MSM/W. The intervention will consist of six counseling sessions held
      between a trained counselor and participant, and will be guided by three theoretical
      perspectives: an ecological perspective of behavior, stress and coping theory, and social
      cognitive theory. The COLOURS Organization, the sole agency in Philadelphia dedicated to
      exclusively serving the Black LGBT community, will be a key collaborator in the development
      and implementation of the intervention. The evaluation design utilizes a randomized
      controlled trial to test the effectiveness of the proposed intervention. Chain referral,
      based on principles of respondent-driven sampling, will be used to recruit 250 HIV-positive
      and HIV-negative Black bisexually-active men into this study.

      The specific aims of this research are to:

        -  develop a new theoretically-based individual-level HIV prevention intervention
           culturally tailored to the needs of HIV-positive and HIV-negative Black MSM/W;

        -  evaluate the intervention with a randomized control group design, using RDS to recruit
           250 Black MSM/W who do not inject drugs and who report recent unprotected sex;

        -  assess the efficacy of the intervention and test the intervention model through the
           collection of behavioral risk assessments and HIV and STD testing at three time points:
           baseline, immediately post-intervention and three-months post-intervention;

        -  examine and describe individual factors, interpersonal relationships and network
           factors, and socio-cultural factors that may affect risk behaviors for HIV infection and
           transmission among Black MSM/W;

        -  develop recommendations for recruiting Black bisexually-active men and providing them
           with targeted HIV prevention interventions.

      Evaluation data collection will be conducted using ACASI. Data analysis will include Repeated
      Measures ANOVA to make assessments of changes over time and intervention dose effects and
      structural equation modeling to assess causal associations between factors in the conceptual
      model. This proposed study has significance for increasing our understanding various types of
      factors that may affect sexual risk behaviors of Black MSM/W as well as potentially providing
      an important new tool for HIV prevention specifically targeting the needs and risk behaviors
      of Black MSM/W.
