      Twenty healthy smokers will be subjected to measurement of Pulse, Blood Pressure,
      electrocardiogram (ECG) and Echo at baseline and after smoking a cigarette. The measurements
      will be compare for any cardiovascular effects of a cigarette smoking on these parameters.

      Twenty male persons habituated to smoking (at least 5 cigarettes/day) will be recruited after
      an informed consent. Healthy persons with no systemic illness will be included. After a
      history and a routine examination, subjects will be asked to abstain from smoking for 3 hours
      and then their pulse, BP, ECG and echo recorded. The measurements will be repeated after 15
      min. and the average of these two taken as baseline readings. Then, they will be asked to
      smoke a cigarette and the measurements taken again. Special focus will be on Doppler measures
      of left ventricular (LV) function. The measurements are repeated immediately and at 5,10 and
      15 min. The data will be analyzed for any cardiovascular effects of smoking a cigarette. Chi
      square test for proportions and t-test for means will be done. A p value &lt; 0.05 will be taken
      as significant.
