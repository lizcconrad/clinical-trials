  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pulmonary administered anticholinergic agents have shown their importance in the chronic
      obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) management to reduce morbidity, disability and
      mortality. To date, the recommended treatment of moderate to severe COPD patients consist in
      the combination of ß2 agonist and long acting antimuscarinic compounds. There is still a
      medical need in new product that could exhibit both anti-inflammatory and strong
      bronchodilation potency. V0162 is a compound with a potent anticholinergic activity.

      Secondary PD properties of V0162 could enhance the efficacy of this antimuscarinic compound
      and could bring new option in the treatment of this life-threatening disease.

      This study has two parts. Part A will be conducted in 72 healthy volunteers. Part B will be
      conducted in 20 patients diagnosed with COPD.

      Part A The primary objective of this part of the study is to assess the local tolerability of
      escalating doses of V0162 in male healthy volunteers.

      Part B The primary objective of this part of the study is to assess the bronchodilator
      properties of V0162 at the maximal tolerated dose (determined in Part A) in COPD patients.

      In addition, pharmacokinetics and vital sign including ECG will be determined.
