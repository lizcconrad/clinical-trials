      Cannabis use disorders are an important public health problem in the United States, but there
      are no effective medications available to treat these disorders. The investigators intend to
      test a medication with interesting properties, nabilone, as a treatment for cannabis
      dependence and to study the relationship of this treatment with the brain using functional
      MRI brain scans. Nabilone and marijuana have similar effects upon behaviors and the human
      body, suggesting that nabilone may decrease cannabis withdrawal symptoms while allowing
      treatment-seeking patients to benefit from behavioral treatments when they are trying to stop
      using cannabis. The investigators propose to assess the relationship of nabilone, when added
      to behavioral treatment, on cannabis use patterns in cannabis-dependent patients. The
      investigators also aim to determine the effects of nabilone on performance on
      neuropsychological tests and to assess the correlation of neuropsychological performance to
      brain changes using functional MRI brain scans. The investigators hypothesize that patients
      receiving nabilone will reduce their use of cannabis more than patients receiving placebo
      during this 10-week treatment trial.

      Cannabis use disorders are an important public health problem in the United States, but no
      effective pharmacotherapies are available to treat these disorders. The investigators intend
      to test a novel agonist pharmacotherapy, nabilone, for cannabis dependence and to study the
      relationship of this treatment with the brain using BOLD fMRI measures. The behavioral and
      physiological effects of nabilone and Î”9-THC overlap, suggesting that nabilone may ameliorate
      cannabis withdrawal symptoms while allowing treatment-seeking outpatients to benefit from
      medical management (MM) sessions when they are trying to stop using cannabis. The
      investigators propose to assess the relationship of nabilone, when added to MM, on cannabis
      use patterns in cannabis-dependent patients. The investigators also aim to determine the
      effects of nabilone on performance on neuropsychological tests and to assess the correlation
      of neuropsychological performance to brain changes using BOLD fMRI measures.

      In this pilot study, subjects will receive either nabilone or placebo in addition to medical
      management (MM) over a 10-week treatment period. Subjects' responses to neuropsychological
      testing carried out while the subject is receiving fMRI scans at 3 time points: at baseline,
      4 weeks, and 10 weeks. Following treatment completion, subjects will have a follow-up visit
      at 14 weeks. This pilot study will evaluate the feasibility of nabilone treatment for
      cannabis dependence and will establish effect sizes for a larger trial in which subjects will
      receive high-dose nabilone, low-dose nabilone, or placebo in addition to MM.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Age range 18-45 years

          -  DSM-IV diagnosis of cannabis dependence, based on the Structured Clinical Interview
             for DSM-IV (SCID)

          -  express a desire to quit cannabis use within the next 30 days

          -  have used cannabis on more than4 days within the past 30 days

          -  for women of childbearing age, a negative pregnancy test at screening with agreement
             to use adequate contraception to prevent pregnancy and monthly pregnancy tests

          -  consent for us to communicate with their prescribing clinician

          -  furnish the names of 2 locators, who would assist study staff in locating them during
             the study period

          -  live close enough to McLean Hospital to attend study visits

          -  plan to stay in the Boston area for the next 3 months

          -  are willing and able to sign informed consent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  current diagnosis of other drug or alcohol dependence (excluding nicotine)

          -  recent (within 3 months) significant cardiac disease

          -  current serious psychiatric illness or history of psychosis, schizophrenia, bipolar
             type I disorder

          -  current medical condition (including significant laboratory abnormalities, such as
             liver function tests &gt;5 times the upper limit of normal range) that could prevent
             regular study attendance

          -  mental retardation or organic mental disorder

          -  acutely dangerous or suicidal behavior

          -  currently in a residential treatment setting in which substance use is monitored and
             restricted, since the restricted access to drugs could represent an important
             confounding variable

          -  pregnant, nursing, or, if a woman of childbearing potential, not using a form of birth
             control judged by the investigator to be effective

             or excretion of nabilone

          -  inability to read or write in English. The potential hazards of a Schedule II
             medication like nabilone underscore the importance of English proficiency in this
             medication trial.

          -  unwilling or unable to participate in MRI scanning (e.g., those having pacemakers,
             bone plates, screws, etc.; claustrophobia)

          -  a history of seizures, head trauma or other history of CNS insult that could
             predispose the subject to seizures .
