  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label study of palifosfamide-tris administered intravenously on Days 1, 2,
      and 3 of a 21-day cycle to subjects with advanced solid tumors. Enrolled subjects will
      receive a placebo-control infusion on Day -1 and then commence palifosfamide-tris study
      treatment 24 hours later on Day 1.

      Time-matched, intensive ECG monitoring will occur during and following placebo and
      palifosfamide-tris infusions on Days -1, 1, 2, 3 and 8. Generation of ECG data for study
      analysis will be performed in a blinded fashion at a central ECG laboratory.

      Blood and urine sampling to characterize the pharmacokinetics of palifosfamide-tris will be
      performed on Days 1 through 8 of Cycle 1.

        Inclusion criteria:

          1. Male or female subjects, age ≥ 18 years, who have provided written informed consent
             prior to completing any study specific procedure.

          2. Histologically or cytologically confirmed solid tumor that has progressed following
             available standard therapies or for which no standard therapy exist.

          3. Measurable or non-measurable disease by RECIST version 1.1

          4. Must have recovered from toxic effects of prior cancer treatment to ≤ Grade1per CTCAE
             v4.0, with the exception of any alopecia.

          5. ECOG Performance Status of 0 or 1.

          6. Adequate bone marrow, liver, and renal function, as assessed by the following
             laboratory requirements:

               1. Hemoglobin ≥9.0 g/dL.

               2. Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥1,500/uL.

               3. Platelet count ≥100,000/uL.

               4. Total bilirubin ≤1.5 x upper limit of normal (ULN)

               5. ALT and AST ≤2.5 x ULN. For subjects with documented liver metastases, ALT and
                  AST ≤5×ULN.

               6. International Normalized Ratio (INR) and activated partial thromboplastin time
                  [PTT] &lt;1.5 x ULN, if not therapeutically anticoagulated. Subjects who are being
                  therapeutically anticoagulated with an agent such as Coumadin (warfarin sodium)
                  or subcutaneous heparin may be included provided there is no prior evidence of
                  underlying abnormality in coagulation parameters, screening test results are in
                  appropriate therapeutic range, and anticoagulation regimen is stable and closely
                  monitored.

               7. Estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGRF) ≥60 mL/minute/1.73 m2.

          7. Male and female subjects must agree to use a highly reliable method of birth control
             (expected failure rate less than 5% per year) from the screening visit through 28 days
             after the last dose of study drug.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Subjects who have received prior chemotherapy, radiation therapy or any
             investigational agent within 28 days prior to the first dose of study drug.

          2. Unstable or clinically significant concurrent medical condition that would, in the
             opinion of the investigator, jeopardize the safety of a subject and/or their
             compliance with the protocol. Examples include, but are not limited to, unstable
             angina, congestive heart failure, recent (within 2 months of screening) myocardial
             infarction, ongoing maintenance therapy for life-threatening ventricular arrhythmia,
             uncontrolled asthma, HIV/AIDS without adequate anti-viral therapy, evidence of hepatic
             pathology due to or consistent with infection with a chronic hepatitis virus,
             uncontrolled major seizure disorder, or electrolyte imbalances.

          3. Presence of, or history of any illness or injury to the urinary tract (renal or
             post-renal) which may make the subject more susceptible to acute renal insufficiency
             in the case of potential renal adverse events. Types of injury or illness might
             include a history of polycystic renal disease, nephrectomy, renal transplant, acute or
             chronic renal failure.

          4. Active infection requiring systemic antibacterial, antifungal, or antiviral therapy
             within 2 weeks of the first dose of study drug. Subjects with HIV who are on effective
             anti-viral therapy or subjects with chronic herpes infections who use intermittent
             suppressive antiviral therapy for viral outbreaks may be included.

          5. Major surgery within 4 weeks prior to start of treatment.

          6. Documented symptomatic brain metastases. Screening for brain lesions by CT or MRI is
             not required for potential subjects; however, if there are any neurological signs or
             symptoms consistent with brain metastases, then a brain CT or MRI should be performed
             as clinically indicated.

          7. Currently pregnant or nursing.

          8. Subjects with implantable pacemaker or automatic implantable cardioverter
             defibrillator.

          9. Conditions that make the screening ECG repolarization difficult to interpret, or
             showing significant abnormalities. This includes, but is not limited to: high degree
             AV block, pace-maker, atrial fibrillation or flutter, prolonged QTc &gt;500ms on repeat
             measurements (e.g., 2 out of 3 ECGs), or bradycardia (defined as ≤ 50 beats/minute).

         10. Subjects who will be receiving medications that prolong the QT interval with a risk of
             causing Torsades de Pointes during the time period beginning 1 week prior to and
             during the Intensive ECG monitoring period (i.e., Cycle 1, Day -8 through Day 8).
