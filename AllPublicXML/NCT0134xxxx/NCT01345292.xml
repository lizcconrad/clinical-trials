    <textblock>
      This study is for people with sensitive teeth and involves going to the dentist for 4 visits
      over 6 weeks.

      During the first 2 weeks, you will just brush your teeth two times a day with the fluoride
      toothpaste provided.

      Then you will be assigned to a group if you qualify to continue in the study. All groups will
      get a marketed toothpaste and one group will also get a mouthwash with an experimental
      ingredient. You will have an equal chance of being assigned to any one of the three groups.

      For the next 4 weeks, you will brush with your assigned toothpaste and rinse with your
      assigned mouthwash if assigned to the mouthwash group. A dentist will look at your mouth,
      teeth, tongue and gums and check for sensitive teeth. The investigators will see if the
      mouthwash helps to reduce tooth sensitivity during the study.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an observer-blind, randomized, parallel-group, single-center, controlled clinical
      trial. Approximately 246 generally healthy adults meeting the necessary inclusion/exclusion
      criteria will be enrolled so that 210 subjects (70 per group) would reasonably be expected to
      complete the study. Subjects will have their oral soft/hard tissues assessed and will be
      evaluated for sensitivity levels at Screening (Visit 1), Baseline (Visit 2), Visit 3 at Week
      2 and Visit 4 at Week 4. During the first two weeks of the study, subjects will be instructed
      to brush their teeth for one minute in their usual manner, twice daily, using the provided
      standard fluoride toothpaste. Subjects will return for the Baseline exam and, upon
      qualification with entry criteria, will be assigned to one of three treatment groups.
      Qualified subjects will be instructed to brush their teeth two times daily for one minute in
      their usual manner using the provided toothpaste (standard fluoride toothpaste or 5%
      potassium nitrate toothpaste). Subjects assigned to the mouthrinse group will be instructed
      to rinse twice daily, after brushing, with the provided mouthrinse for 60 seconds using 10
      ml, for 4 consecutive weeks.

    <measure>Mean Tactile Sensitivity Score at Week 4</measure>
    <time_frame>4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Tooth sensitivity was measured using a Yeaple probe. The force at which discomfort was felt by the participant was recorded on a scale of 10-80 grams. The score for each participant was calculated by averaging the scores for all study teeth for that participant.</description>

    <measure>Mean Tactile Sensitivity Visual Analog Scale (VAS) Score at Week 2</measure>
    <time_frame>2 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Tooth sensitivity was measured using a VAS. At each visit, participants rated their perception of the pain/discomfort experienced from the Yeaple probe by marking a single vertical line on a VAS scale from 0 to 100 mm, where 0 = No Pain/Discomfort and 100 = Intense Pain/Discomfort. The dental recorder measured the length of the line from 0 to the participant's line and recorded the VAS score in mm. The investigator recorded a VAS score of 0 mm for participants who did not experience discomfort at the maximum force of 80 grams. The score for each participant was calculated by averaging the scores for all study teeth for that participant.</description>

    <description>Tooth sensitivity was measured using a Cold Air Stimulus. When being assessed, participants rated their perception of the pain/discomfort experienced when cold air was directed at the exposed root of each tooth by marking a single vertical line on a VAS scale from 0 to 100 mm, where 0 = No Pain/Discomfort and 100 = Intense Pain/Discomfort. The dental recorder measured the length of the line from 0 to the participant's line and recorded the VAS score in mm.

Participants were instructed as follows: &quot;Please rate the intensity of the pain/discomfort you have experienced in the last two weeks when drinking cold/hot beverages and/or foods, eating sweet and sour foods, breathing cold air, brushing your teeth or performing any habits/behaviors that solicit your dentinal hypersensitivity pain/discomfort since you first started using the product.&quot; The dental recorder measured the length of the line from 0 to the participant's line and recorded the VAS score in mm.</description>

        <description>Tooth sensitivity was measured using a Yeaple probe. The force at which discomfort was felt by the participant was recorded on a scale of 10-80 grams. The score for each participant was calculated by averaging the scores for all study teeth for that participant.</description>

        <title>Mean Tactile Sensitivity Visual Analog Scale (VAS) Score at Week 2</title>
        <description>Tooth sensitivity was measured using a VAS. At each visit, participants rated their perception of the pain/discomfort experienced from the Yeaple probe by marking a single vertical line on a VAS scale from 0 to 100 mm, where 0 = No Pain/Discomfort and 100 = Intense Pain/Discomfort. The dental recorder measured the length of the line from 0 to the participant's line and recorded the VAS score in mm. The investigator recorded a VAS score of 0 mm for participants who did not experience discomfort at the maximum force of 80 grams. The score for each participant was calculated by averaging the scores for all study teeth for that participant.</description>

        <title>Mean Tactile Sensitivity VAS Score at Week 4</title>
        <description>Tooth sensitivity was measured using a VAS. At each visit, participants rated their perception of the pain/discomfort experienced from the Yeaple probe by marking a single vertical line on a VAS scale from 0 to 100 mm, where 0 = No Pain/Discomfort and 100 = Intense Pain/Discomfort. The dental recorder measured the length of the line from 0 to the participant's line and recorded the VAS score in mm. The investigator recorded a VAS score of 0 mm for participants who did not experience discomfort at the maximum force of 80 grams. The score for each participant was calculated by averaging the scores for all study teeth for that participant.</description>

        <population>Analysis was based on the Intent-to-Treat (ITT) analysis set, defined as all randomized participants who used at least one dose of the study product and had baseline and at least one post-baseline efficacy assessment.</population>

        <description>At each visit, participants rated their perception of the pain/discomfort experienced by marking a single vertical line on a VAS scale from 0 to 100 mm, where 0 = No Pain/Discomfort and 100 = Intense Pain/Discomfort. Participants were instructed as follows: &quot;Please rate the intensity of the pain/discomfort you have experienced in the last two weeks when drinking cold/hot beverages and/or foods, eating sweet and sour foods, breathing cold air, brushing your teeth or performing any habits/behaviors that solicit your dentinal hypersensitivity pain/discomfort since you first started using the product.&quot; The dental recorder measured the length of the line from 0 to the participant's line and recorded the VAS score in mm.</description>

        <population>Analysis was based on the Intent-to-Treat (ITT) analysis set, defined as all randomized participants who used at least one dose of the study product and had baseline and at least one post-baseline efficacy assessment.</population>
