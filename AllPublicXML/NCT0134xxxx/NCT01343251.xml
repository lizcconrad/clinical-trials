  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main objective of this research study was to compare the following outcomes between
      patients with a Hemodialysis Reliable Outflow (HeRO) Graft and patients with a cuffed
      catheter for dialysis access over one year: quality of life and incidence of bacteremia,
      vascular interventions, hospitalizations, and death.

      All eligible participants who provided informed consent were included in the study.
      Participants who refused HeRO Graft implantation, or did not have the HeRO Graft implanted
      for any other reason, were followed in the control group. Several patients did not receive
      the HeRO graft due to anatomical challenges and failure to complete both steps of the
      two-stage implant procedure. All consented participants who had an implanted HeRO Graft were
      followed in the study group. All participants were followed until the study end, withdrawal,
      loss to follow-up, or death. The analysis included only HeRO Graft patients and control
      patients who were not lost to follow-up; patients who were lost to follow-up, before data
      collection, were excluded from analysis.

      After obtaining Institutional Review Board (IRB) approval, baseline demographic and clinical
      data was collected. Following surgery, implant procedure data was collected on study
      participants who received HeRO Grafts. HeRO Grafts were placed using a 2-step process with
      initial placement of the ePTFE portion, followed by completion of the graft by placement of
      the venous outflow component. Following enrollment, outcomes of interest were collected at
      follow-up visits scheduled weekly for 4 weeks, bi-weekly for 3 months, and monthly to 1 year,
      for a total of 18 follow-up visits. Study coordinators documented post-operative
      complications, incidence of thrombosis, hospitalizations, infection incidents, and deaths at
      each follow-up.

      Quality of life data were also collected from all participants using the RAND Corporation's
      Short Form (36) (SF-36) Health Survey. This survey was completed at enrollment and again at 3
      months, 6 months, and 12 months.

    <description>Compare the RAND Short Form (SF)-36 Health Survey, Total Test Scores at baseline, 3, 6, and 12 months between study arms. Total test scores range on a scale from 0-100, with the lower the score equating to more disability. The higher the score the less disability i.e., a score of zero is equivalent to maximum disability and a score of 100 is equivalent to no disability.The eight sections are: vitality, physical functioning, bodily pain, general health perceptions, physical role functioning, emotional role functioning, social role functioning, and mental health. The total score is calculated using a methodology described by the RAND Corporation, which assigns a recoded value to each survey item. Recoded items are averaged amongst scales and the total score is an average of the eight sections.

        <description>Compare the RAND Short Form (SF)-36 Health Survey, Total Test Scores at baseline, 3, 6, and 12 months between study arms. Total test scores range on a scale from 0-100, with the lower the score equating to more disability. The higher the score the less disability i.e., a score of zero is equivalent to maximum disability and a score of 100 is equivalent to no disability.The eight sections are: vitality, physical functioning, bodily pain, general health perceptions, physical role functioning, emotional role functioning, social role functioning, and mental health. The total score is calculated using a methodology described by the RAND Corporation, which assigns a recoded value to each survey item. Recoded items are averaged amongst scales and the total score is an average of the eight sections.
