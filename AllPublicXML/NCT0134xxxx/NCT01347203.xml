  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This will be a study existing of 4 periods, to evaluate for a single dose of 4 different
      tablets of DPOC-4088 the absorption and elimination from the body and the potential effect on
      blood clotting. The differences between the tablets are the dose (100 or 200 mg) and the rate
      of release of DPOC-4088 from the tablet (16 or 20 hours). The allocation of the tablets in
      each period will be determined by chance but is known upfront.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This will be a randomized, open-label, single oral dose study. The 4-period crossover study
      will determine and compare the PK and PD profiles of DPOC-4088 when administered as a single
      oral dose of 100 mg and 200 mg of DPOC-4088 in two prolonged release formulations (16 and 20
      hr) in 12 evaluable young healthy male subjects.

      Each subject (in a fasting state) will receive each of the 4 treatments (A, B, C, and D) in a
      balanced, 4-period crossover design. Each treatment consists of a single oral dose of 100 mg
      or 200 mg of DPOC-4088 in either prolonged release formulation (16 or 20 hr). Subjects will
      arrive at the study unit for an overnight fast of at least 10 hrs the evening before each
      dosing period and remain in the unit for at least 24 hrs after dosing. Standard meals will be
      provided and subjects will receive their first meal after dosing at 4 hrs post-dose. Blood
      samples will be drawn for PK and PD evaluations immediately prior to dosing and at specified
      time intervals for 48 hrs post-dosing. Each dosing period will be separated by at least a
      5-day washout period that is preferentially not to exceed 10 days.

      In healthy young male subjects, the safety, tolerability, and the PK profile of DPOC-4088
      will be assessed. Additionally, this study will assess the PD profile and the relationship of
      PK/PD in terms of the ability of DPOC-4088 to inhibit thrombin activity (based on
      prolongation of aPTT, ECT, TT and PT).
