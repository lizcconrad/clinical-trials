      The purpose of this study is to examine the movement pattern in patients with hip dysplasia
      preoperative, six and 12 month after minimally invasive approach for Periacetabular osteotomy
      (PAO). Secondary to examine the movement pattern in patients compared to healthy controls and
      historical data.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Congenital hip dysplasia is a disease characterised by pathological changes in the hip joint.
      Hip dysplasia is a normal disease with a prevalence of 4.3% in men and 3.6 in woman.
      Untreated hip dysplasia is a known cause of developing osteoarthritis early in life and
      symptoms as pain, hip instability together with a changed gait pattern are normal.
      Symptomatic hip dysplasia is seen in patients between 15 and 55 years and can be unilateral
      as well as bilateral. Causes of hip dysplasia are described as genetic, mechanic or hormonal.

      Today patients with hip dysplasia are offered a hip conserving surgery before the
      osteoarthritis has developed. In 2003 a minimally invasive approach for periacetabular
      osteotomy (PAO) was introduced at Aarhus University Hospital. An advantage of minimally
      invasive approach compared to the classical Bernese periacetabular osteotomy is minimal
      impact of the soft tissues in the hip region.

      Hip pain and activity limitations highly affect quality of life and physical function. The
      gait distance is reduced and patients have to compensate to relieve the pressure on the hip
      joint. Knowledge about the dynamics of the gait and running pattern in patients with
      dysplasia is important to understand the consequences of the dysplastic hip joint.
      Furthermore knowledge about gait compensations is relevant for the clinicians in the
      management and treatment of patients with hip dysplasia.

      Today, gait and running compensation is unknown after minimally invasive approach The purpose
      of this study is, therefore, to examine the movement pattern in patients with hip dysplasia
      preoperative, six and 12 month after minimally invasive approach for Peri-acetabular
      osteotomy (PAO). Secondary to examine the movement pattern in patients compared to healthy
      controls and historical data.
