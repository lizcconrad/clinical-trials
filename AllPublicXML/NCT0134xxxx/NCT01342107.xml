Lenses with a Grade 0 or 1 were rated as wettable and reported as a percentage of total lenses evaluated.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  18 years or age or older with normal eyes, other than correction for refractive error.

          -  At least 5 days successful daily wear (minimum 8 hours per day) of PureVision®,
             Acuvue® Oasys™, or Acuvue® 2 contact lenses prior to Visit 1

          -  Vision correctable to 20/30 (Snellen) or better in each eye at distance with lenses at
             Visit 1 (Day 0 - Baseline).

          -  Grade 0 or Grade 1 wettability in both eyes after at least 15 minutes of lens wear at
             Visit 1 (Day 0 - Baseline).

          -  Other protocol-defined inclusion criteria may apply.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Any ocular or systemic medical condition that may, in the opinion of the investigator,
             preclude safe administration of the test articles or affect the results of the study.

          -  Need to wear contact lenses on an extended wear basis (i.e., overnight) during the
             study.

          -  Use of products other than a multi-purpose solution or hydrogen peroxide solution,
             including daily and enzyme cleaners and saline rinses, for lens care at least 7 days
             prior to Visit 1 (Day 0 - Baseline).

          -  Use of over-the-counter (OTC) or prescribed topical ocular medications within 7 days
             prior to Visit 1. Use of lens rewetting drops is acceptable.

          -  History or current ocular infections or ocular inflammatory events.

          -  Ocular surgery within the past year.

          -  Participation in any investigational study within the past 30 days.

          -  Other protocol-defined exclusion criteria may apply.
