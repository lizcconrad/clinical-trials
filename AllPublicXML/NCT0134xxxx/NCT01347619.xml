  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators propose to evaluate the effectiveness of 3 different methods to promote the
      dissemination and adoption of evidenced-based review guides into the nursing home setting.
      Specifically, the investigators will adapt Comparative Effectiveness Research (CER) Review
      products developed by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ), specifically
      related to off-label use of atypical antipsychotic drugs, to improve their penetration into
      practice in the nursing home (NH) setting.

      The investigators propose the following specific aims:

      AIM 1: NEEDS ASSESSMENT To conduct a needs assessment for the NH setting relevant to the AHRQ
      Comparative Effectiveness Research Summary Guide (CERSG) entitled &quot;Off-Label Use of Atypical
      Antipsychotic Drugs.&quot; The assessment will identify: (a) interest in and barriers to the use
      of the AHRQ atypical antipsychotic CERSG in the NH setting; (b) the key audiences and
      stakeholders that influence atypical antipsychotic drug use in NHs; and (c) approaches to
      integrating comparative effectiveness research products into the NH setting.

      AIM 2: PRODUCTION OF THE TOOLKIT Guided by the needs assessment, the investigators will
      produce a toolkit containing tailored CERSG-based products targeting key audiences and
      stakeholders in the NH setting. The target audience(s) of the final CERSG-based products will
      be identified in Aim 1, and will potentially include: (a) facility leadership [NH
      administrator, Medical Director, Director of Nursing]; (b) prescribers and consultant
      pharmacists; (c) nursing staff [registered nurses, licensed practical nurses, and certified
      nurse assistants].

      AIM 3: EVALUATING THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE TOOLKIT To evaluate the effectiveness of the
      toolkit and three dissemination strategies using a matched, cluster randomized trial. NHs in
      the first arm will receive the toolkit only and web access to the materials; NHs in the
      second arm will receive the toolkit, web access, periodic audit and feedback reports of
      antipsychotic prescribing to NH leadership, and faxed educational messages adapted from the
      AHRQ atypical antipsychotic CERSG to prescribers; and NHs in the third arm will receive the
      previous items plus face-to-face academic detailing. Primary outcomes of the evaluation are
      the RE-AIM evaluation domains (reach, efficacy, adoption, implementation, and
      maintenance).The investigators will also include an assessment of facility-level changes in
      the use of atypical antipsychotic drugs.

    <description>NHs in this arm will receive a letter announcing the availability of an atypical antipsychotic toolkit within the facility and online at the Qualidigm website. The letter will be sent to the NH administrator, Director of Nursing, and Medical Director of each facility by Qualidigm. It will state that the toolkit is designed to provide NH staff, including prescribers, leadership, nursing staff, and patients' families with information about the use, risks and costs of atypical antipsychotics in the NH setting.</description>

    <description>Providing healthcare professionals with data about their performance (audit and feedback) may help improve their practice. It is more effective when clinicians previously agree to review their practice. We will use an adaptation of a &quot;Medicaid Utilization Report&quot; developed by AM Hamer. This report will show current atypical antipsychotic prescribing rates in the NH, with comparisons to state and national levels, and information regarding summary evidence for atypical antipsychotics from the AHRQ atypical antipsychotic CERSG. Reports will be sent to the NH administrator, Director of Nursing, and Medical Director of the facilities randomized to the moderate intensity arm on an every 4-month basis.</description>

    <description>This arm will receive the same information, toolkit, letters, and audit and feedback reports distributed to homes in the moderate-intensity arm. In addition, two visits to the NH will be scheduled by a pharmacist educator specially trained in the pharmacology of atypical antipsychotics, and communication techniques. Staff will be provided with up-to-date, unbiased information about antipsychotic use in NHs based on the AHRQ CER Review product adaptations. The educator will deliver targeted messages relevant to each stakeholder regarding roles in decision-making around the use atypical antipsychotic therapy in the NH setting. Each NH will receive up to two visits over the course of the 12-month intervention period.</description>
