    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this study is to determine whether HepavaxGene TF is non-inferior to
      the comparator vaccine both at impeding hepatitis B transmission from mothers positive for
      chronic hepatitis B (Stratum 1) to their children and also in terms of seroconversion rate in
      children of mothers negative for chronic hepatitis B (Stratum 2) one month after completion
      of the immunization schedule.

             hemodialysis;

          -  Subject's parent is allergic to any composition of Hepatitis B vaccine;

          -  A family history of thrombocytopenia, or other disturbance of blood coagulation, which
             may result in a contraindication for intramuscular injection;

          -  Known immunologic function damage;

          -  Mothers had received gamma globulin or immunoglobulin injection during pregnancy;

          -  Any congenital malformation

          -  Known or suspected to suffer from diseases such as active infection and cardiovascular
             disease;

          -  Any condition believed by the investigator to have possible impact on trial
             evaluation.
