    <description>Liraglutide will be prescribed and titrated by the treating physician and will be self-administered by the subject s.c. (under the skin) once daily. Study participants being treated with GLP-1 (Glucagon-Like Peptide 1)agonists or DDP-4-inhibitors (Dipeptidyl-peptidase 4 ) should stop treatment when initiating liraglutide treatment.</description>
