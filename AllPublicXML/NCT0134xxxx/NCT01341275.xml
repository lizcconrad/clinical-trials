      The aims of this study are to determine:

        1. the degree of immunity against hepatitis B,

        2. factors associated with immunity against hepatitis B,

        3. if the amount of antigen provided in a booster dose (used to measure the degree of
           immune memory) affects the body's response to the booster, and

        4. if the age at which the vaccination was initiated during infancy affects duration of
           protection against hepatitis B among adolescents 16-19 years of age born in the United
           States who were immunized against hepatitis B as infants. These data will be important
           to evaluate the potential need for a possible booster dose of hepatitis B vaccine among
           adolescents.

      Study subjects eligible for enrollment will:

        -  have blood drawn for baseline serologies

        -  receive the hepatitis B booster dose (randomly determined to be either a 10 ug or 20 ug
           dose)

        -  have blood drawn again 14 days later to determine if the booster dose has engendered an
           anamnestic response (a response attributed to prior immunity rather than a new response
           to the vaccine)

      The primary hypothesis is that the majority of young people will exhibit immune memory for
      hepatitis B in response to a booster dose of vaccine.
