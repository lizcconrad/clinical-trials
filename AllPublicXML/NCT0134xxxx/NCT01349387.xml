    <textblock>
      Main objective : Show that treatment with metformin in patients with type 2 diabetes has an
      effect on alternative splicing of the insulin receptor.

      Secondary objective : demonstrate that the effect on the ratio A/isoform B isoform with
      discontinuation of treatment with metformin can be réversé by the resumption of metformin
      treatment.

    <description>During their visit of consultation on the follow-up to the type 2 diabetes, les patients will be selected on the basis of active metformin treatment at a dose greater than or equal to 1400 mg/day. Patients will have to achieve a 10 ml blood sample. The blood will be processed by Ficoll gradient centrifugation to remove the red cells and isolate circulating leukocytes: this stage will be conducted in the CERITD. Analysis on circulating leukocytes and in particular the quantification of expressions of isoforms A and B of the INSR1 by quantitative RT - PCR gene will be conducted in the laboratory of the Professor Marc Peschanski (unit INSERM 861 I - STEM of Evry).
After inclusion in the study to J0, metformin treatment will be interrupted between J1 and J30, replaced by Januvia 100 mg/day dose, then resumed at J31.</description>
