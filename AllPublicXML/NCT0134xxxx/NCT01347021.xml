      The purpose of this study is to compare the vaginal sacrospinous colpopexy and high
      uterosacral colpopexy in the treatment of genital prolapse grade III/IV in women with uterus.

    <textblock>
      Hysterectomy is often the traditional approach for women with uterovaginal prolapse. However,
      hysterectomy alone does not address the underlying problem of deficient apical support.
      Surgical options for patients with apical prolapse include transvaginal suspension procedures
      using pelvic structures for fixation, such as the sacrospinous ligament or uterosacral
      ligaments.The objective of this study is to compare the sacrospinous fixation with high
      uterosacral in the treatment of uterine prolapse POP-Q stage 3 or 4 in terms of recurrence of
      prolapse,quality of life,complications,post-operative recovery, hospital stay.

    <description>Women with uterine prolapse grade III or IV were randomly allocated to the sacrospinous colpopexy or high uterosacral colpopexy with vaginal hysterectomy.Before the surgery P-Qol questionnaire were completed and urogynecological examination include de POP-Q system was done. All patients underwent clinical check-ups 1, 6 and 12 months postoperatively. Each check-up included clinical examination and questionnaire.</description>
