  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to evaluate the drug-drug interaction potential between BI
      201335 and concomitantly administered tenofovir which is used in treatment regimens for HIV
      infection and/or Hepatitis B infection. Results of this study will serve as a basis for
      guidance of dose adjustments or other precautionary measures when BI201335 and tenofovir are
      coadministered.
