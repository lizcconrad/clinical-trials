    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well pazopanib hydrochloride works in treating patients with
      advanced or progressive malignant pheochromocytoma or paraganglioma. Pazopanib hydrochloride
      may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth and
      by blocking blood flow to the tumor.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the anti-tumor activity (in terms of the tumor response rate using the Response
      Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors [RECIST] criteria) of pazopanib (pazopanib hydrochloride)
      (GW786034) in patients with advanced malignant pheochromocytomas and paragangliomas.

      SECONDARY OBJEC TIVES:

      I. To assess safety profile of pazopanib. II. To assess duration of tumor response. III. To
      assess time to treatment failure. IV. To assess progression-free survival time. V. To assess
      overall survival time.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. For patients with secretory tumors, to examine changes in urinary catecholamine and/or
      metanephrine levels.

      II. For patients with secretory tumors, to examine whether pazopanib-induced changes in
      urinary catecholamine and/or metanephrine levels during the first cycle of treatment may be
      associated with objective tumor response.

      III. To examine associations between tumor response and somatic mutational status in archived
      tumors, or germline mutational status in patient's peripheral blood mononuclear cells,
      (presence of succinate dehydrogenase complex subunit D [SDHD], succinate dehydrogenase
      complex subunit B [SDHB], ret proto-oncogene [RET], von Hippel-Lindau tumor suppressor [VHL],
      neurofibromatosis type-1).

      IV. To examine associations between tumor response and tumor expression levels of angiogenic
      and vascular markers including hypoxia inducible factor 1, alpha (HIF-1a), vascular
      endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGF-R) (total and phospho-) and microvessel density in
      archival tumor tissue.

      IV. To examine whether the extent of tumor response/regression may be correlated with plasma
      pazopanib (GW786034) concentration achieved after the third cycle (first cycle after run-in
      cycles) of pazopanib (GW786034) therapy.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive pazopanib hydrochloride orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-28 (days 1-14
      of courses 1 and 2). Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients undergo urine and blood sample collection at baseline and periodically during study
      for correlative studies.

      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed up every 3-6 months for up to 5
      years.

    <measure>Response Rate (RR) (Complete Response [CR] or Partial Response [PR]) Using RECIST Version 1.1</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 5 years</time_frame>
    <description>Response and progression are evaluated in this study using the international criteria proposed by the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) guidelines (version 1.1) Ninety-five percent confidence intervals for the true response proportion was calculated using the exact binomial test.
Complete Response (CR): All of the following must be true:
Disappearance of all target and non-target lesions.
Each lymph node must have reduction in short axis to &lt;1.0 cm.
Partial Response (PR):
At least a 30% decrease in PBSD (sum of the longest diameter for all target lesions plus the sum of the short axis of all the target lymph nodes at current evaluation) taking baseline measures as reference.
Overall Response (OR) was calculated by summing the number of patients with a CR or PR.</description>

      <recruitment_details>This study opened on 10/3/2011 and enrolled 2 patients prior to temporarily closing on 2/28/2012 due to safety concerns. After review of AEs, an addendum was implemented which instituted changes to treatment administration, namely, 2 - 14 day run-in periods where patients received pazopanib PO days 1-7 and then were assessed for safety.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>A total of seven patients were recruited to this study. One of the 5 patients registered to the study post-addendum cancelled prior to initiating treatment.</pre_assignment_details>

        <title>Response Rate (RR) (Complete Response [CR] or Partial Response [PR]) Using RECIST Version 1.1</title>
        <description>Response and progression are evaluated in this study using the international criteria proposed by the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) guidelines (version 1.1) Ninety-five percent confidence intervals for the true response proportion was calculated using the exact binomial test.
Complete Response (CR): All of the following must be true:
Disappearance of all target and non-target lesions.
Each lymph node must have reduction in short axis to &lt;1.0 cm.
Partial Response (PR):
At least a 30% decrease in PBSD (sum of the longest diameter for all target lesions plus the sum of the short axis of all the target lymph nodes at current evaluation) taking baseline measures as reference.
Overall Response (OR) was calculated by summing the number of patients with a CR or PR.</description>

        <title>Progression-free Survival Time</title>
        <description>Progression-free survival is defined as the time from registration to documentation of disease progression. If a patient dies without a documentation of disease progression, the patient will be considered to have had tumor progression at the time of their death unless there is sufficient documented evidence to conclude no progression occurred prior to death. Progression-free survival time will be estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method.</description>
