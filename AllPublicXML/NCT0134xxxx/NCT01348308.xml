  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of the OPTIMAL study is to demonstrate that the adjunction of Maraviroc to a
      combination of antiretroviral therapy in naive and late diagnosed HIV-1 infected patients
      counts may accelerate the kinetics of immune restoration and decrease the risk of disease
      progression and death.

      It is a randomized, versus placebo, double-blind trial, conducted in France, Spain and Italy.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>To demonstrate the clinical benefit of the adjunction of Maraviroc to a combination of antiretroviral therapy defined as decrease of clinical events</measure>
    <time_frame>From Week 0 to Week 72</time_frame>
    <description>The clinical benefit is the reduction of occurence of a composite outcome consisting of:
New AID-defining event (1993 CDC(Centers for Disease Control) expanded surveillance definition)
Non B or C events (Aspergillosis, Bartonellosis, Chagas disease, Leishmaniasis, Lymphoma, Microsporidiosis chronic intestinal, Nocardiosis, Penicillium marneffei extrapulmonary, Pneumocystis jiroveci extrapulmonary, Rhodococcus equi disease, Severe bacterial infections)
Serious non-AIDS events (Cardiovascular disease, Chronic end stage renal disease, Liver failure, Non-AIDS defining cancers, IRIS)
All cause of mortality</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Safety evaluation and Clinical, Immunological and pharmacological evaluation</measure>
    <time_frame>From Week 0 to Week 72</time_frame>
    <description>The secondary end points:
Clinical events (to compare Maraviroc and placebo arm for each component of the primary composite endpoint and other major outcomes)
Immunological evaluation (T cells phenotypic analysis; seric markers of immune activation)
Virological evaluation (plasma HIV viral load analysis; viral tropism testing,)
Pharmacokinetic evaluation (plasma concentration of Maraviroc and relationship with virological response)
Clinical and biological safety of the strategy (Adverse events &gt;= grade 2 on ANRS scale of adverse event)
