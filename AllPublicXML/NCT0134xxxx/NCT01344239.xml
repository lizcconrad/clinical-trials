      To investigate whether limb remote ischemic preconditioning (LRIP) has protective effects
      against intestinal and pulmonary injury in patients undergoing open infrarenal abdominal
      aortic aneurysm (AAA) repair.

      Remote ischaemic preconditioning may confer the cytoprotection in critical organs. We
      hypothesized that limb remote ischemic preconditioning (RIPC) would reduce intestinal and
      pulmonary injury in patients undergoing open infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA)
      repair.The primary outcomes included the biomarkers reflecting intestinal injury (serum
      intestinal fatty acid binding protein, endotoxin levels and diamine oxidase activity) and the
      variables reflecting pulmonary injury (arterial-alveolar oxygen tension ratio,
      alveolar-arterial oxygen tension difference and respiratory index). In addition, the severity
      of intestinal and pulmonary injury was assessed with different scoring methods, respectively.
      Markers of oxidative stress and systemic inflammation were measured as well.

    <time_frame>June,2011</time_frame>
    <description>Compared with the control group, patients in the LRIP group had significantly higher Cs and Cd , along with lower PA-aDO2 and RI at various phase (P&lt;0.05). Serum concentration of IL-6,IL-8, TNF-ɑ and MDA in LRIP group were decreased significantly at postoperative time points compared with those in control group (P&lt;0.05), but SOD was increased significantly at the same time (P&lt;0.05). Patient's ventilator support time and duration of ICU stay in LRIP group were shorter than that in control group (P&lt;0.05)</description>

    <description>The limb RIPC protocol was applied after anesthetic induction and before the start of surgery. The limb RIPC was induced by placing a blood pressure cuff on the left upper arm of patient for three inflating-deflating cycles: 5 min inflating to 200 mmHg followed by a 5 min reperfusion with deflating the cuff.</description>
