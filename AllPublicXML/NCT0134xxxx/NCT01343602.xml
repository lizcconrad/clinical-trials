  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of a modified approach of constraint
      induced movement therapy (&quot;CIMT at home&quot;) for chronic stroke patients, compared to
      conventional physiotherapy and occupational therapy (&quot;therapy as usual) with regard to the
      ability to participate in everyday activities.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study is a parallel cluster randomized controlled trial with therapy practices as
      clusters. After written consent from the patients, the therapists are randomly assigned to
      treat either the intervention or the control group. Blinded external assessors evaluate the
      patients using standardized outcome measures before and after the intervention, and six
      months later. The two coprimary endpoint assessments of arm and hand function as
      prerequisites for participation (defined as equal involvement in activities of daily living)
      are quality of arm and hand use and arm and hand function. Assessments are made four weeks
      post-treatment and relativized to baseline performance. Changes in primary outcomes are
      analyzed with mixed models, which consider the hierarchical structure of the data, adjusted
      to the baseline measurements and sex. The primary analysis compares the two randomized
      groups, with respect to the adjusted averages for each of the two coprimary endpoints. To
      keep an overall significance level of 5%, the two endpoints are tested at the significance
      level of 5% each in hierarchical order.

    <description>Therapists of the intervention group are trained in &quot;CIMT at home&quot;. During an initial home visit the therapist determines together with the patient an individually tailored home training program focussing on everyday practice and instructs the non-professional coach. For four weeks the patients will perform 2 hours of daily training at home together with an instructed non-professional coach (e.g. family member) applying shaping techniques (i.e. 20 consecutive days). Patients are supposed to wear a resting hand splint for the entire treatment period for 4 to 6 hours daily. During the four weeks the therapist will provide 5 weekly visits at the patients' home to instruct and supervise the training.</description>
