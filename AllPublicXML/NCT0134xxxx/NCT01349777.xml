      This study is an open label, multi-center, randomized trial, which is designed to evaluate
      the efficacy and safety of clopidogrel derivative (Pregrel®) therapy for 12 months in
      patients undergoing PCI compared to conventional clopidogrel (Plavix®).

    <textblock>
      Prospective, two arms, randomized multi-center trial of 1,056 patients enrolled at 3 centers
      in Korea.

      Following angiography, patients with significant diameter stenosis &gt;50% by visual estimation
      have documented myocardial ischemia or symptoms of angina and eligible for stenting without
      any exclusion criteria will be randomized 1:1 to: a) Pregrel® group vs. b) Plavix®. This
      trial is the non-inferiority study to demonstrate that the incidence of 12 months primary
      end-point in Pregrel® group.

          -  The patient must be at least 18 years of age.

          -  Patients with symptomatic coronary artery disease with objective evidence of ischemia
             (e.g. symptoms of angina pectoris, positive stress test results, or dynamic ECG
             changes).

          -  Patients are referred for PCI, or thought to be at high likelihood for requiring stent
             placement with or without conventional balloon angioplasty

          -  The patient or guardian agrees to the study protocol and the schedule of clinical and
             angiographic follow-up, and provides informed, written consent, as approved by the
             appropriate Institutional Review Board/Ethical Committee of the respective clinical
             site.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  The patient has a known hypersensitivity or contraindication to any of the following
             medications:

               -  Aspirin

               -  Both Clopidogrel and Ticlopidine

               -  Stainless steel and/or

               -  Contrast media (patients with documented sensitivity to contrast which can be
                  effectively pre-medicated with steroids and diphenylhydramine [e.g. rash] may be
                  enrolled. Patients with true anaphylaxis to prior contrast media, however, should
                  not be enrolled).

          -  Coronary anatomy not amenable to stent placement

          -  Female of childbearing potential, unless a recent pregnancy test is negative, who
             possibly plan to become pregnant any time after enrollment into this study.

          -  History of bleeding diathesis or known coagulopathy (including heparin-induced
             thrombocytopenia), or will refuse blood transfusions.

          -  Gastrointestinal or genitourinary bleeding within the prior 3 months, or major surgery
             within 2 months.

          -  Current known current platelet count &lt;100,000 cells/mm3 or Hgb &lt;10 g/dL.

          -  An elective major surgical procedure is planned that would necessitate interruption of
             thienopyridines during the first 1 year post enrollment.

          -  Non-cardiac co-morbid conditions are present with life expectancy &lt;1 year or that may
             result in protocol non-compliance (per site investigator's medical judgment).

          -  Patients who are actively participating in another drug or device investigational
             study, which have not completed the primary endpoint follow-up period.

          -  Administration of the following medications prior to randomization: GpIIb-IIIa
             inhibitor and clopidogrel within 7 days (already received pretreatment), or
             thrombolytics within 24 hours.

          -  Long-term (at least &gt; 3 months) use or requirement of NSAID or anticoagulation

          -  Patients with cardiogenic shock

          -  Acute MI patients within symptom onset &lt; 12 hours needing primary angioplasty

          -  Patients with left main stem stenosis (&gt;50% by visual estimate)
