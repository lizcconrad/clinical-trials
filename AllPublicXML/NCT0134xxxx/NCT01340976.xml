    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the safety LY2787106 in participants with cancer and anemia. It will
      also evaluate when LY2787106 can improve anemia. This study has two parts: Part A is a dose
      escalation evaluation. Part B is an evaluation of LY2787106 at a defined dose given with and
      without iron supplementation.
