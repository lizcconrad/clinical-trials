      The objectives of this study are:

        1. To see if autologous human umbilical cord blood treatment is safe for children with
           acquired hearing loss, and

        2. To determine if late functional outcome is improved following autologous human umbilical
           cord blood treatment for children with acquired hearing loss.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Acquired sensorineural hearing loss is characterized by a loss of functioning hair cells in
      the Organ of Corti, with greater hair cell loss correlating with more severe hearing
      impairment. Children with sensorineural hearing loss experience difficulty developing normal
      language which usually leads to poor academic and social development. Currently, there are no
      reparative therapeutic options available, and treatments are designed to augment the
      diminished function of the injured Organ of Corti.

      Pre-clinical data suggest progenitor cell infusions may enhance intrinsic repair mechanisms
      in the Organ of Corti which may restore hair cells. This treatment could ultimately lead to
      hearing improvement. Human umbilical cord blood (hUCB) is an available, autologous, stored
      progenitor cell population available for potential therapeutic use. The primary objective of
      this study is to determine the safety of autologous hUCB infusion in children with acquired
      hearing loss. The secondary objective is to determine if functional, physiologic and anatomic
      outcomes are improved following hUCB treatment in this patient population.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Evidence of a moderate to profound sensorineural hearing loss.

          2. Normally shaped cochlea, as determined by MRI.

          3. The loss must be considered acquired, NOT syndromic.

             the one month, six month and one year follow-up visits.

          7. Presence of a cochlear implant device.

          8. Evidence of a syndrome.

          9. Positive test for genetic hearing loss.
