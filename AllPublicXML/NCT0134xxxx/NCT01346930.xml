      The MUSIC OL study is an open-label extension study, in which all eligible patients having
      completed the double-blind AC-055B201/MUSIC study as scheduled receive macitentan 10 mg once
      daily. The study objective is to assess the long-term safety and tolerability of macitentan
      in patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF).

          -  Premature discontinuation of study treatment during the AC-055B201/MUSIC study due to
             an adverse event (AE) assessed as related to the use of macitentan, excluding events
             of IPF worsening.

          -  Pregnancy or breast-feeding.

          -  AST and/or ALT &gt; 3 times the upper limit of the normal range.
