  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There are two types of external radiation treatments; proton beam and photon beam radiation.
      What type of therapy participants will receive will depend upon the location of their tumor.
      Standard treatment would involve receiving either proton or photon radiation delivered by a
      three dimensional (3-D) conformal radiation technique. 3-D conformal radiation therapy is a
      technique where the beams of radiation used in the treatment are shaped to match the tumor in
      order to avoid damaging the healthy surrounding tissue. Standard treatment also may include
      photon radiation delivered by intensity modulated (IMRT) technique. In this research study we
      are using an investigational technique to deliver proton radiation therapy called intensity
      modulated proton radiation treatment (IMPT) which is used to target cancer while sparing
      healthy tissue. With IMPT (and standard IMRT), radiation intensity can be turned down during
      the treatment. This control over the intensity of the radiation dose has the potential to
      provide accuracy and allows us to more safely increase the amount of radiation delivered to
      the tumor. This accuracy may potentially reduce side effects that patients would normally
      experience with 3-D proton radiation therapy. Surgery is often an important component of the
      treatment for these tumors and may be integrated with the IMPT.

      -  Before beginning radiation therapy, the participants will have a radiation planning
           computed tomographic (CT) scan of the tumor site. This is considered standard of care
           and the doctor will use the images from this scan to plan the radiation treatment.

        -  Participants may also receive surgery either before or after the study radiation
           treatment. This surgery is also considered standard of care and would be done regardless
           of being in the research study.

        -  The IMPT technique for delivering radiation is for research purposes only. Radiation
           treatment to the affected tumor will be given daily, Monday through Friday.

        -  The following procedures will be performed once a week during treatment: assessment of
           nerve, neuromuscular, motor and sensory function by clinical exam and toxicity
           assessment.

        -  Participants will return for follow-up visits after completion of the radiation
           treatment at the following intervals: 6 weeks after completion of treatment, 6 months
           after treatment, every 6 months thereafter for 4 years, and then each year after for up
           to 15 years.
