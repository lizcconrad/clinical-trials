  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: Celecoxib is effective for reducing postoperative pain in adults. Children use
      celecoxib more rapidly than adults and require higher doses. Celecoxib is partially
      metabolized in the liver by a certain enzyme. A person's genetic variation of this enzyme can
      influence how well their body uses Celecoxib. Understanding the blood and cerebrospinal fluid
      (CSF) profile of celecoxib in children and the influence of genetics on metabolism would help
      to develop appropriate celecoxib dosing in children for various treatment options.

      Objective(s) and Hypothesis: Our primary objective will be to create a pediatric profile of
      celecoxib in the blood and the central nervous system as well as explore the relationship
      between CYP2C9 polymorphisms and documented adverse events

      The investigators hypothesize that the CSF concentrations of Celecoxib post dose are lower
      than plasma levels, take longer to reach peak concentration and are directly related to dose,
      genetics, and age. The investigators expect that Celecoxib will improve quality of life and
      reduce discomfort when administered before and after a lumbar puncture and bone marrow
      aspirate.

      Potential Impact: The results of this study will establish the safety of celecoxib in
      children as well as help us define the best dosing for acute pain. It may also help reduce
      the incidence of acute pain evolving into chronic pain. Finally, it may provide insight into
      celecoxib's future use in chemotherapy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Background: Celecoxib is a selective cyclooxygenase-2 (Cox-2) inhibitor belonging to the
      non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) class of medications. Adult studies have
      evaluated single dose and short term courses of Celecoxib and shown improved postoperative
      analgesia. One pharmacokinetic (PK) study suggested that celecoxib had faster clearance in
      pediatric patients implying the need for a higher dose in children. Adult literature has
      reported Cox-2 inhibitor administration up to 10 times the typical dose without adverse side
      effects. One adult chemotherapy drug trial involved high dose Celecoxib for a median of 8.4
      months with very limited side effects. Another study demonstrated that blood brain barrier
      (BBB) permeable selective Cox-2 inhibitors effectively reduced central nervous system
      Prostaglandin (PG) E2, (a surrogate marker of Cox-2 activity) concentrations and
      postoperative pain.

      Genotypic variability of the CYP2C9 liver enzymes has been implicated in altered PK of
      celecoxib in humans. Understanding the blood and CSF pharmacokinetics of celecoxib in
      children and the influence of genetics on metabolism would aid in the development of
      appropriate celecoxib dosing schedules for various pain models.

      At our institution, children diagnosed with hematologic malignancies routinely undergo
      general anesthesia for bone marrow aspiration/biopsy (BM) and diagnostic/ therapeutic lumbar
      punctures (LP). Post intervention site pain may be associated with a post dural puncture or
      atypical headache. Recently there have been reports of elevated Cox-2 expression in patients
      with CML and lymphomas. Data suggests that the combination of Cox-2 inhibitors with standard
      chemotherapeutics may enhance the potential of treatment for some hematological malignancies.
      Access to blood and cerebral spinal fluid provide a unique opportunity to determine celecoxib
      concentrations in the respective compartments.

      Objectives and Hypothesis: Our primary objective will be to create a pediatric
      pharmacokinetic profile of celecoxib in the blood and the central nervous system as well as
      explore the relationship between CYP2C9 polymorphisms and documented adverse events. The
      investigators hypothesize that the CSF concentrations of Celecoxib post ingestion are lower
      than plasma levels with a delayed peak concentration and directly related to dose, genotype,
      and age. The investigators expect that Celecoxib will improve quality of life and reduce
      discomfort when administered before and after a LP +/- BM.

      Experimental Design The study consists of two prospective cohort arms. A dose timing cohort
      to develop the pharmacokinetic profile for blood and CSF concentrations, and a dose
      escalation cohort in which increasing doses of a celecoxib suspension will be administered. A
      single blood sample to determine the CYP2C9 alleles will be drawn from each patient upon
      study entry.

      Potential Impact: CSF penetration of Cox-2 inhibitors may reduce the incidence of acute pain
      evolving into a chronic pain model. The results of this study will establish the safety of
      this class of medications in children and enable a more rational approach to their dosing in
      acute pain models and perhaps future chemotherapeutic protocols

    <description>1. All patients and CSF Dose timing Cohort (Oral celecoxib 10 mg/kg pharmacokinetic profile)
Mean Total and unbound plasma concentration ug/L at approximately the following time intervals (mins): 30, 60, 90, 120, 180, 300, 900

Mean CSF concentration ug/L at approximately 180 minutes
Ratio CSF/unbound plasma concentration at approximately 180 minutes
This information in conjunction with the pharmacokinetic profile established in the dose timing cohort (10 mg/kg) will be used to predict plasma and CSF values for tmax, Cmax, AUC, Vd/F, CL/F and t1/2 for 6 and 14 mg/kg oral doses respectively.</description>

    <description>All patients, on day of first scheduled LP, will receive celecoxib suspension 10 mg/kg by mouth 180 mins before their scheduled LP. Prior to beginning the second cycle of chemotherapy the patients will be randomly allocated to either of 2 cohorts (CSF dose timing cohort versus dose escalation cohort). The CSF dose timing cohort patients will be assigned to receive celecoxib 10 mg/kg at a predetermined time (60 mins, 120 mins, 300 mins and 900 mins before LP+/- BM) and they will rotate in chronological order for four chemotherapy cycles to complete the remaining time points of interest. The dose escalation cohort patients, at the beginning of each cycle of chemotherapy, will be administered either 6 or 14 mg/kg celecoxib 180 mins before LP for a total of 4 chemotherapy cycles.
Approximately 8-12 hours after the first dose, each patient will be required to ingest a second dose of celecoxib suspension (one half of the premedication dose) with food.</description>
