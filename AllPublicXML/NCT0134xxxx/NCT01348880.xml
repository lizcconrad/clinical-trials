  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study will be conducted as a multi-center, randomized, double-blinded, placebo
      controlled, crossover design. The investigational drug (vardenafil ODT (Orally Disintegrating
      Tablet)/placebo) will be given as a single administration at a dose of 10 mg vardenafil ODT
      during Period 1 or 2; the blinded matching placebo will be given as a single administration
      during the opposing period. The random code will determine the order of active drug
      (vardenafil ODT) and placebo for each subject. Blood pressure and heart rate profiles will be
      recorded by automated device pre-dose for 8 hours post-dose during Periods 1 and 2. The non
      investigational drug product (vasodilator), Procardia XL, will be background treatment for
      hypertension, taken daily by each subject. All subjects must be stable on the vasodilator for
      at least 4 weeks prior to Day 1 of Period 1. Special conditions for this study include the
      requirement that all subjects will be male, are between the ages of 65 and 80 years, and will
      have a diagnosis of erectile dysfunction (ED), as well as hypertension. Planned sample size
      will be 40 subjects evaluable for the primary analysis. Of the 40 subjects valid for this
      analysis, 20 will be between the ages of 65 and 69 years, and 20 subjects will be between the
      ages of 70 and 80 years. The total duration of the study will be approximately one year from
      first subject treated to last subject treated, including replacement of any subjects who fail
      to complete both periods of crossover dosing.
