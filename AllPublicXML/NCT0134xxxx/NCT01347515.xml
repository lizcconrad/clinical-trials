      Hypothesis: A functional olive oil tailored to provide the best relationship between phenolic
      compounds (amount and type) phenolic bioavailability and bioactivity (antioxidant and
      anti-endothelial dysfunction) will be a useful tool for increasing not only circulating HDL
      cholesterol concentration, but also the functionality (antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and
      reverse cholesterol transport capacity) of human HDL in vivo.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The first step is to determine, in healthy human subjects in postprandial condition, the best
      relationship between phenolic compounds (amount and type) / bioavailability and bioactivity
      (antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and anti-endothelial dysfunction) using olive oils enriched
      with its own broad-spectrum phenolic compounds.

    <description>Each volunteer will be given, in random order, a single dose of 30 ml on a base of 80 g bread, of the following functional olive oils (FOO): FOO750 ppm, FOO500 ppm, which are enriched with two different amounts of broad-spectrum phenolic compounds from the virgin FOO250 ppm; all prepared at the Universitat de Lleida.
Post-ingestion the volunteers will rest for 8h in a comfortable warm room. During the run-in period of 2 weeks prior the first postprandial study and 1 week between each FOO treatment period, all subjects will undergo a 2-day pre-treatment wash-out period of a phenol-free diet (saturated fatty acids in the diet will be 10-13% of energy in an isocaloric diet). Volunteers will avoid non-essential physical activity during the 3 days prior to the treatment day.</description>
