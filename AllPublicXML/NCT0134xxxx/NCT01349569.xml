    <textblock>
      This research is being done to find out if the investigators can improve outcomes for
      multiple myeloma patients by giving a myeloma vaccine to patients who are already on
      lenalidomide (Revlimid) and in a near complete remission.

    <textblock>
      This is a single institution, single arm, Phase II study examining the clinical efficacy of
      an allogeneic GM-CSF secreting myeloma vaccine in combination with lenalidomide. Fifteen (15)
      patients enrolled in the study must have two disease measurements (including the last one)
      consistent with a near complete remission (M-spike negative with persistence of
      immunofixation) per criteria for response in a 6 month period. Patients will continue on the
      dose of lenalidomide they were on prior to being enrolled but will need to discontinue
      steroids for at least 4 weeks. Patients will receive 4 vaccinations on day 14(+/-3 days) of
      cycles 1, 2, 3 and 6 from enrollment that will include both the myeloma vaccine as well as
      Prevnar.

Each vaccination will consist of five total intra-dermal injections, two each in the right and left anterior upper thighs, and one in the non-dominant upper arm (unless contraindicated). Each dose will be administered on an outpatient basis. The subject must be observed in the clinic for at least 30 minutes after vaccination is completed.</description>
