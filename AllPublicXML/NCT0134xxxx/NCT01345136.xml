  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to determine if RAD001 treatment will shrink or slow the growth
      of the vestibular schwannoma(s) in Neurofibromatosis 2 (NF2) patients. Secondary objectives
      include determining if RAD001 treatment will improve hearing ability in NF2 patients.

      RAD001 is an oral drug that is approved by Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for other types
      of tumors, it is not approved by the FDA for treatment of NF2 related tumors.

      This protocol is a Phase II, open-label, efficacy and safety study of single-agent RAD001 in
      patients with NF2. During the study, subjects will receive continuous daily oral treatment
      with RAD001 for up to 1 year or until tumor progression.

      Primary Objective: To determine whether RAD001 has an effect on the VS growth in patients
      with NF2 at a rate sufficient to submit the drug for further testing.

      Secondary Objectives: To determine whether RAD001 has an effect on the volume of other
      intracranial tumors, and to assess the effect of RAD001 on hearing function in patients with
      NF2 (when applicable).
