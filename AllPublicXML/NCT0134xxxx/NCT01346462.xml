  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators propose a pilot randomized controlled trial of a care transitions
      intervention in which trained Community Health Workers will act as supports for
      socioeconomically vulnerable patients who are being discharged from the Hospital of the
      University of Pennsylvania and Presbyterian Hospital. CHWs or IMPaCT Partners will help
      patients to overcome the challenges of transition, including arranging primary care provider
      (PCP) follow-up, filling medication prescriptions and obtaining referrals to community-based
      social services. As our primary outcome, the investigators will examine the effect of the
      IMPaCT intervention on rates of primary care follow-up. The investigators will also examine
      the effect of IMPaCT on secondary outcome variables including patients' satisfaction with the
      experience of transition, quality of discharge communication, medication adherence, self-
      rated health, and inpatient readmission within 30 days after discharge.

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Participant admitted to the General Medicine services of the Hospital of the
             University of Pennsylvania (HUP), or Presbyterian Hospital during the enrollment
             period

          2. Participant uninsured or insured by Medicaid at the time of discharge from the
             hospital

          3. Participant is 18-65 years old

          4. Participant is willing to participate and be contacted at 14 days post-discharge by
             telephone or through a home visit by research personnel (if no functioning telephone
             is present in the household)

          5. Participant resides in one of the following zip codes: 19104, 19131, 19139, 19143,
             19146. These zip codes have the highest frequency of readmissions to HUP and
             Presbyterian Hospital

          6. Participant is English speaking

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients with insurance other than Medicaid will be excluded as they are outside of
             the population of interest for this intervention targeted specifically at
             socioeconomically vulnerable patients. Dual eligible patients (Medicaid and Medicare)
             will be excluded. Patients older than 65 are eligible for the Transitional Care Model
             Intervention, which is a separate intervention offered at Penn Medicine hospitals.

          2. Non-English speaking participants will be excluded because in this pilot study, the
             study only has English-speaking PaCT personnel. In future studies, it will be
             important to study the effect of PaCT in non-English speaking populations.

          3. Patients outside of the target zipcodes are being excluded for feasibility reasons
             during this pilot study: with only two PaCT Partners, we are choosing to focus our
             resources on a geographic area that has the highest rates of readmissions in order to
             facilitate home visits.
