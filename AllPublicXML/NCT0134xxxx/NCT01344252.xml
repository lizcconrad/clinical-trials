  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The options for anesthesia in cataract surgery described are: general, regional or local. The
      local strategy, it may be by periocular blocking(subtenon, peribulbar or retrobulbar),
      subconjunctival or topical. The risks faced by subconjunctival, peribulbar or retrobulbar,
      have made subtenon and topical strategies the most used. Likewise, to improve the
      effectiveness of the topical strategy was added gel topical lidocaine and intracameral dose
      of lidocaine.

      Subtenon and topical anesthesia are two safe strategies and there were performed multiple
      studies showing that both are effective in controlling pain, but showing a slight superiority
      of subtenon. This difference does not appear to be clinically significant. In turn, the
      addition of gel and intracameral anesthesia, improved pain control. However, lack evidence to
      compare patient preference when using topical gel and intracameral anesthesia versus
      sub-Tenon anesthesia.

      Multiple advantages has the topical anesthesia. Besides being a safe strategy for the
      patient, offers a rapid visual recovery, no generates blepharoptosis or diplopia
      postoperatively, subconjunctival hemorrhage and chemosis.

      Because of this the investigators plan to conduct a study comparing the efficacy of gel
      topical and intracameral anesthesia versus subtenon anesthesia in cataract surgery with
      scleral incision, assessing the patient's preference Hypothesis: Topical administration of
      lidocaine in gel and intracameral anesthesia is a better strategy that subtenon anesthesia in
      cataract surgery
