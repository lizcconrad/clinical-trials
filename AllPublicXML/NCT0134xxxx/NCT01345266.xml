      This is a clinical study, with no investigational product, to characterise the inhalation
      profiles of healthy volunteers, volunteers with mild, moderate and severe Asthma and
      volunteers with mild, moderate and severe Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD),

             abnormality or parameters outside the reference range for the population being studied
             may be included if the Investigator agrees that the finding is unlikely to introduce
             additional risk factors and will not interfere with the study procedures.

          -  Non-smokers (never smoked or not smoking for &gt;12 months with &lt;1 pack year history)

             childhood and has now completely resolved, no longer requiring maintenance or
             intermittent therapy.

             causes significant disability.

             moderate or severe, based on current treatment, using the British Thoracic Society - -

             bronchodilators for 12 hours before study assessments

        [GOLD 2008]. The following lung function criteria are post bronchodilator

        Stage I:

          -  Mild COPD. FEV1/FVC &lt; 70%, FEV1 ≥ 80% predicted with or without chronic symptoms
