  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to look at the potential for an investigational drug (PF-04995274,
      under development by Pfizer, Inc. as a potential treatment for Alzheimer's disease) to
      reverse changes in memory and learning/problem solving skills caused by co-administration of
      a marketed drug called scopolamine. Scopolamine is known to cause temporary changes in memory
      and learning/problem solving skills that are similar to those seen in people with alzheimer's
      disease(AD).

      Changes in sponsor's organizational strategy have led to the decision to terminate the study
      and therefore to not conduct the second cohort (Cohort B/arms 2 and 3) . This decision was
      not based on significant safety concerns. Date of termination (ie, the date the site was
      notified to stop study activities) was 12 Oct 2011.
