  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to find out whether there is a correlation (link) between the
      level of potassium in blood samples drawn from a vein and those drawn from a heel stick in
      infants scheduled for elective surgery.

      This is a prospective study which will take place at the Children's Memorial Hermann Hospital
      Operating Room.

      After obtaining written informed consent from parents or guardians, infants and babies
      scheduled to have elective surgery under routine general anesthesia and are &lt;6 months of age
      will be included in the study. After the baby receives routine general anesthesia, a small
      amount of blood, 0.5 ml, will be drawn from a vein when an I.V. is started for the surgery.
      The largest possible cannula will be placed whenever possible to decrease hemolysis. If a
      baby has a central line, the blood sample will be drawn from it. If a baby has an existing
      peripheral I.V., a blood sample will be drawn from the I.V. cannula only if blood is freely
      running, to avoid hemolysis.

      Blood will be placed into a heparinized, 1 ml syringe for venous blood gas analysis. A second
      blood sample, 0.3 ml, will be drawn into a capillary pipette from a heel stick for capillary
      blood gas analysis. The heel will be properly sterilized, and a proper size lancet will be
      used. The same operator will be performing the heel stick in each case.
