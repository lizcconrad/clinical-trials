      The Brigham and Women's Pain Management Center is conducting a research study for chronic
      pelvic pain patients due to endometriosis. The study will assess the effect of
      electro-stimulation for the treatment of Chronic Pelvic Pain. You may be eligible if you have
      chronic pelvic pain due to endometriosis, are between the ages of 21- 64, and not taking
      opioid medication (such as morphine or oxycodone). The study will require two visits, each
      lasting about 2 hours. The study takes place at the Brigham &amp; Women's Pain Management Center,
      850 Boylston St., Chestnut Hill. Please contact Chrissie Cahalan at 617-732-9014 or
      ccahalan1@partners.org if interested.

    <description>Ear stimulation at specific points should work by stimulating a nerve called the vagus nerve. Previous research has shown that stimulating this nerve can help patients feel less pain. During any testing session, participants may receive either the real ear stimulation or a sham (placebo) treatment. The sham treatment will use the same equipment as the real treatment, but will not deliver any real stimulation to the ear. We use placebo/sham procedures in research to make sure that the study results are related to the study procedure, and not to other reasons.</description>

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Female volunteers between 21 and 64 years of age with chronic pelvic pain for more
             than six months by self report. Six months of chronic pain is the criteria most often
             used in CPP research.

          -  CPP diagnoses will include endometriosis pain.

          -  Average pain intensity of â‰¥4 on a scale from 0 to 10, because &lt;4 is considered a level
             with acceptable pain and function

          -  At least an 8th grade English-reading level; English can be a second language provided
             that the subjects feel they understand all the questions used in the assessment
             measures.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Any interventional procedure for CPP two weeks prior to the study or during the
             two-week study period, such as lumbar epidural steroids, nerve root blocks, etc.

          -  Any etiology for CPP due to a known local somatic lesion for the pain (e.g. fibroids
             etc.) documented by the patient's gynecologist, surgery and/or imaging. We wish to
             focus on functional CPP, which may be more amenable to RAVANS due to the systemic
             nature of VNS.

          -  Opioid usage, either oral or intrathecal.

          -  Surgical therapy in the previous 12 weeks, the intent to undergo surgery during the
             study period, or any clinically unstable systemic illness that is judged to interfere
             with the trial.

          -  Non-ambulatory status

          -  History of cardiac or nervous system disease that, in the investigator's judgment,
             precludes participation in the study because of a heightened potential for adverse
             outcome.

          -  An inability to complete questionnaires accurately.

          -  Cancer or other malignant disease, except carcinoma in situ of the skin

          -  Pregnancy
