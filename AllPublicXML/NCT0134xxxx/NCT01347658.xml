  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this clinical trial is to characterize drug interactions between one medicinal
      herb: Echinacea purpurea and the protease inhibitor etravirine.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Because of its CYP3A4 inducer activity in the liver but its inhibitor effect at the
      intestinal site, concomitant administration of Equinacea purpurea (a medicinal herb
      frequently used by HIV-infected patients) and etravirine (an HIV reverse transcriptase
      inhibitor) might result in clinically relevant pharmacokinetic drug interactions.

      15 HIV-infected patients on stable antiretroviral therapy including etravirine at the dosage
      of 200 mg twice daily during at least 4 weeks will be enrolled. After their inclusion in the
      study, patients will receive Echinacea purpurea root (500 mg every 8 hours) in addition to
      their antiretroviral treatment, from day 1 until two weeks later (day 14). On days 0 and 14,
      blood samples will be drawn immediately before and 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 and 12 hours after the
      administration of an etravirine dose, and etravirine concentrations in plasma will be
      determined by high performance liquid chromatography using a validated method.
