    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the local control rate as well as acute and late toxicity rates of
      stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) for the treatment of spine metastases and benign spine
      tumors.

    <textblock>
      This study is a single site, non-randomized, prospective, phase IV trial. Patients are
      composed of 2 groups:Spine Metastases OR Benign Spine Tumors. Data collected will include
      patient demographics, pathology data, tumor stage, SBRT dose fractionation scheme, dose
      received by adjacent critical normal tissues, tumor recurrence data, and acute and late
      toxicities.

      Follow up data will be collected during the patient's standard office visits. The anticipated
      duration of this study is 5 years

    <description>Evaluation of pain relief will be assessed using a 10-point visual analog scale.
Analgesic use will be documented to ensure that pain improvement is not due to an increase in the amount of analgesic usage.
Evaluation of neurologic improvement will be assessed by physical exam using the American Spinal Injury Association Impairment Scale.</description>

    <measure>local tumor recurrence rate</measure>
    <time_frame>5 years</time_frame>
    <description>Local recurrence is defined as tumor recurrence or progression within the planning target volume.
Local control rate will be evaluated by imaging techniques and/or clinical symptoms(worsening or no improvement in pain or neurologic compromise). If follow-up imaging is available, a local recurrence will be defined as an increase of &gt; 20% in tumor size.</description>

        Eligibility Criteria:

          -  Patient age &gt;= 18 years

          -  performance status of 0-3

          -  Vertebral and/or paraspinal metastases, with or without prior surgery and/or
             fractionated radiotherapy

          -  Benign extradural spine tumors such as chordomas, meningiomas, schwannomas,
             neurofibromas, paragangliomas, and arteriovenous malformations (AVMs).

          -  Established histologic diagnosis of a benign or malignant tumor of the spine.

          -  Arteriovenous malformation of the spine identified radiographically (no biopsy)

          -  Well-defined lesion involving no more than 2 adjacent vertebral levels or spinal
             segment

          -  Minimal spinal canal compromise that is not rapidly progressive. Ideally, the tumor
             should not be within 5 mm of the spinal cord.

          -  If chemotherapy is planned, ideally it should not have been given within 30 days of
             starting radiation and should not resume until at least 2 weeks after completing
             radiation. In addition, it is not recommended to perform SBRT when targeted
             anti-angiogenesis therapy is planned within 2 months of the procedure.

          -  Signed study-specific consent form

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Lesion involving &gt; 3 adjacent vertebral levels

          -  Overt spinal instability

          -  Neurologic deficit due to bony fragments/bony compression of neural structures

          -  Prior radiotherapy at the involved level(s) within 3 months of radiosurgery, more than
             one prior course of radiotherapy at the involved level(s), or more than 45 Gy previous
             radiation exposure at the involved level(s)

          -  Rapidly progressive spinal cord compromise or neurological deficit

          -  Paralysis, or otherwise compromised motor function due to radiographically confirmed
             cord compression

          -  Patient unable to undergo an MRI

          -  Pregnant or lactating women, due to potential exposure of the fetus to RT and unknown
             effects of RT on lactating females

          -  Patients with psychiatric or addictive disorder that would preclude obtaining informed
             consent
