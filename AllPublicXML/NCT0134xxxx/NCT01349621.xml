  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective study to compare unpolarized (conventional) to polarized light
      colposcopy. Subjects will be asked to participate in the study when they arrive for their
      prescheduled colposcopic examination. The study doctor will use a conventional or standard
      colposcope to perform the examination. His/her impression of the exam will be noted and if
      necessary a biopsy specimen will be obtained. The study doctor will then perform a colposcopy
      using a polarized light. His/her impression of the exam will be noted and a biopsy specimen
      will be obtained if necessary.

      This study is designed to test the hypothesis that polarized light colposcopy is more
      sensitive and more specific than standard, un-polarized light colposcopy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Women scheduled for a colposcopic examination at GRU or CerviCusco were asked to participate
      in the study. Interested patients read and signed an IRB-approved Informed Consent Document
      (ICD) that described the study and their potential involvement. The study coordinator read
      and or translated the ICD to women who spoke languages other than English or Spanish (i.e.
      Quechua).

      Pertinent disease specific demographic information was collected from each patient. Following
      insertion of a vaginal speculum and a one minute application of 5% acetic acid, polarized and
      non-polarized high resolution digital RGB images were taken of the ectocervix. Thereafter,
      non-polarized light colposcopy was performed as standard of care. The colposcopist derived a
      colposcopic impression and indicated whether a biopsy was necessary. So as not to compromise
      the next examination, Lugol's Iodine was not applied. Then, a polarized light colposcopy was
      performed. As before, the colposcopist derived an impression, indicated whether a biopsy was
      necessary and annotated the site of pending biopsy. Then if indicated, a minimum of one
      cervical biopsy was obtained from the area(s) representing the most severe colopscopic
      changes as seen during the non-polarized exam. The exact biopsy site was annotated.

    <description>We will examine 300 women scheduled for colposcopy using unpolarized and polarized light. To determine whether polarized light increases the sensitivity and specificity over unpolarized light, the area under a receiver operating characteristic curve (AROC) will be calculated. We anticipate that it will take approximately 8-10 months to enroll 300 subjects.</description>

             colposcopy

          -  Subject fully understands study procedures, alternative treatments available, the
             risks involved with the study, and voluntarily agrees to participate by giving written
             informed consent

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject is pregnant or may be pregnant

          -  Subject has known allergy to acetic acid

             studies involving collection of cervical specimens

          -  Subject has a history or current evidence of any condition, therapy, lab abnormality
             or other circumstance that might confound the results of the study, or interfere with
             the subject's participation for the full duration of the study, such that it is not in
             the best interest of the subject to participate
