  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study in subjects who underwent major
      surgery. Each subject's study participation consisted of a screening visit and a treatment
      period of up to 5 days. Following surgery (Day 0), subjects were randomly assigned to receive
      intranasal ketorolac 30 mg or intranasal placebo when the pain intensity (PI) rating equaled
      at least 40 mm on a 100-mm visual analog scale (VAS). Subjects received study drug every 8
      hours for 48 hours and then 3 times daily for up to 5 calendar days in total; the frequency
      of dosing could be reduced after 48 hours. Starting at the time of the first dose of study
      drug and continuing for the first 48 hours after surgery, the subjects had access to morphine
      sulfate (MS) administered via patient controlled analgesia (PCA). After PCA was no longer
      required, backup pain relief was provided by another standard nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory
      drug (non-NSAID) analgesic regimen. If the subjects were discharged before postoperative Day
      4, they could self-medicate at home through postoperative Day 4. A safety follow-up
      evaluation was conducted by telephone approximately 14 days after the end of dosing in a
      subset of subjects (n = 60).

      The primary objective was to evaluate the analgesic efficacy of multiple intranasal doses of
      ketorolac administered for up to 5 days. The secondary objective was to evaluate the safety
      and tolerability of this dosing regimen.

    <measure>The Summed Pain Intensity Difference (SPID) on Day 1</measure>
    <time_frame>6 hours after drug administration</time_frame>
    <description>Ratings of Pain Intensity (PI) were made using a 100-mm Visual Analog Scale (VAS) on which 0 = no pain and 100 = worst pain possible. The PI values were obtained every hour following the first dose of study medication on Day 1. Pain intensity difference (PID) was calculated by subtracting the posttreatment score from the baseline score, where the baseline score was the PI rating made prior to the first dose of study medication. A summed PID (SPID) on the first postoperative day was calculated at 6 hours.</description>

    <description>Ratings of Pain Intensity (PI) were made using a 100-mm Visual Analog Scale (VAS) on which 0 = no pain and 100 = worst pain possible. The PI values were obtained during the first 8 hours following the first dose of study medication on Day 1. PID was calculated by subtracting the posttreatment score from the baseline score, where the baseline score was the PI rating made prior to the first dose of study medication.</description>

    <description>A global evaluation of pain control was conducted once daily at bedtime using a 5-point categorical scale on which 0 = poor, 1 = fair, 2 = good, 3 = very good, and 4 = excellent.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Onset and duration of pain relief</measure>
    <time_frame>8 hours following first dose of study medication</time_frame>
    <description>The onset of pain relief was defined as the time when the stopwatch was stopped to indicate &quot;meaningful&quot; pain relief. Peak PID was calculated. Duration of analgesia was defined as the time from the first dose of study medication on Day 1 to the first dose of MS by PCA.</description>
