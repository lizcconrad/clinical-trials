    <textblock>
      TELEMED-HF is a randomized, controlled clinical intervention trial designed to: (1) examine
      the efficacy of an electronic Medication Adherence Support System (MASS) in improving and
      monitoring patients' medication adherence; to (2) i determine the effect of medication
      adherence on hospitalization and health care consumption.

    <description>A cost-benefit analysis will be assessed by means of the TiC-P questionnaire and event rate (and related DBC (diagnosis treatment combination, the Dutch system to allocate costs to treatments of specific patient groups)). The TiC-P questionnaire will enable us to compare healthcare consumption in the intervention and control group.</description>

    <description>The intervention consists of the use of an electronic Medication Adherence Monitor for a 6-month period as well as 2 visits to the heart failure outpatient clinic of the TweeSteden hospital (usual care). This monitor (a) dispenses all prescribed medication in the right dosage at the specified time, (b) reminds patients to take their medications through an alarm, sms or voicemail service and records adherence, and (c) sends critical data about non-adherence to the heart failure nurse, via a web application (CarebyWeb). The Medication Adherence Monitor is provided to the patient by the hospital pharmacy, including an instruction how to use the device. After the intervention patients return to usual care only. We expect a training effect, with continued improved adherence in the intervention group.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Stable systolic heart failure

          -  New York Heart Association functional class II-III, with a decreased pump function
             (left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) &lt;45%)

          -  Titrated to the most optimal doses of ACE-inhibitor or Angiotensin Receptor Blocker,
             and beta-blocker

          -  Receiving stable doses of at least 3 heart failure medications (at multiple times
             during the day) for 1 month with no plans to add or adjust heart failure medications
             or titrate further in the immediate future.

        Exclusion Criteria:
