      The investigators want to evaluate if preoperative MRI improves the surgical results,
      especially in respect to surgical margins. The impact on the surgical procedure will be
      evaluated.

      In addition the investigators will examine the accuracy of tumor detection, localization and
      staging.

      Background:

      During the last two decades, Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) of the prostate has evolved to
      become a promising tool in preoperative evaluation of prostate cancer. Several studies have
      evaluated the radiological and histopathological correlation. However, the sensitivity and
      specificity in regard to staging have shown wide ranges and poor reproducibility. These
      discrepancies can be explained by difference in patient selection, MRI methods, and criteria
      used for diagnosis. More studies are therefore needed to evaluate the clinical impact of
      preoperative MRI in patients with prostate cancer.

      Aims of the study:

      To evaluate 1) detection rate of tumor 1-3 (tumor 1 = index tumor), size of tumor 1-3,
      possible extraprostatic extension and predict presence of Gleason grade 4 and 5 tumor, 2) the
      influence of preoperative MRI on the surgical decision process with respect to the operative
      procedure for removal of the gland and pelvic lymph node dissection, and 3) the impact of
      preoperative MRI on the rate of positive surgical margins and functional results.

      Material and method:

      A prospective study including 400 consecutive patients referred to robot assisted
      laparoscopic prostatectomy randomised to preoperative MRI (intervention group) and no MRI
      (control group). The prostatectomy specimens will be histopathologically examined, and TNM
      classification will be performed according to 2002 AJCC standard.

        Inclusion criteria

          -  All patients suitable for surgery.

          -  Positive biopsy (Gleason grade &gt;3).

          -  Informed consent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients who do not sign the consent paper for any reason or do not accept the study
             premises.

          -  Patents who want to withdraw for any reason during the study.

          -  Patients with contraindications to MRI (pacemaker, claustrophobia etc) and/or surgery.

          -  Patients who have undergone a high quality MRI examination of the prostate at another
             radiological center. In this situation the MR examination is evaluated together with
             the surgeon but the patient is not included in the study. (In case of a low quality
             examinations, we will disregard the findings, and include the patient).

          -  If the surgeon finds it unacceptable to perform RALP without MRI, because of various
             reasons (eg. patient demand, too high risk etc) the patient will not be included in
             the study.

          -  If preoperative MRI reveals extensive tumor invasion into adjacent organ (T4) or
             skeletal metastases (M1), as these cancer stadiums do not benefit from RALP.
