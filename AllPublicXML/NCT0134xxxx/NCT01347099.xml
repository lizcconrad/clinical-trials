    <textblock>
      Cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) is an effective treatment for obsessive compulsive disorder
      (OCD) but there is a lack of properly trained CBT therapists. One possible treatment
      alternative is Internet-based CBT (ICBT) with minimal therapist input. The aim of this study
      was therefore to evaluate ICBT for OCD.
