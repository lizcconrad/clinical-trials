      The purpose of this study is to see if treating patients who have high levels of donor
      specific alloantibodies post-transplant with bortezomib might prevent the development of
      transplant glomerulopathy and preserve allograft function.

    <description>Patients randomized to bortezomib treatment will receive 2, 4-dose cycles of drug followed by a 2 month &quot;hiatus&quot;. At the end of this time, subjects will be re-evaluated for the appropriateness of receiving a 3rd and 4th cycle of bortezomib. Bortezomib will be given subcutaneously (under the skin). If unable to give subcutaneously, bortezomib will be given as a single IV (injection into vein) over a time of 3 to 5 seconds. Patients will receive up to 4, four-dose cycles of 1.3 mg/m(2) (based on body surface area).</description>

             abstain from heterosexual intercourse.

          -  Male subjects, even if surgically sterilized (i.e. status postvasectomy), must agree
             to 1 of the following: practice effective barrier contraception during the entire

             drug or completely abstain from heterosexual intercourse.

          -  Kidney transplant recipients (living and deceased donors) who received a transplant in
             the last 3 years and have high Donor Specific Antibody (DSA) levels (defined as Mean

Bortezomib: Patients randomized to bortezomib treatment will receive 2, 4-dose cycles of drug followed by a 2 month &quot;hiatus&quot;. At the end of this time, subjects will be re-evaluated for the appropriateness of receiving a 3rd and 4th cycle of bortezomib. Bortezomib will be given subcutaneously (under the skin). If unable to give subcutaneously, bortezomib will be given as a single IV (injection into vein) over a time of 3 to 5 seconds. Patients will receive up to 4, four-dose cycles of 1.3 mg/m(2) (based on body surface area).</description>
