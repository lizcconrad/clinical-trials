    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients must have histologically confirmed, unresected cancer of the pancreas or
             ampulla. The cancer may include any invasive histology (e.g. adenocarcinoma,
             neuroendocrine carcinoma).

          -  Patients must have measurable radiographic disease.Patients with previous complete
             resection are only eligible if there is measurable radiographic disease which is
             clearly felt to represent locally recurrent disease.

          -  Patients may receive any number of cycles of chemotherapy prior to treatment with
             SBRT, but not within 2 weeks of the first fraction of RT.

          -  Age &gt; or = 18 years.

          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status &lt; or = 2 (Karnofsky &gt; or
             = 60%)

          -  Life expectancy of greater than 3 months.

          -  Patients must have normal organ and marrow function.

          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Concurrent investigational therapy delivered over the period of treatment or
             observation (28 days post-RT) for dose limiting toxicity.

          -  Prior radiation therapy to the abdominal area which would overlap with the proposed
             area of treatment.

          -  Pregnancy.

          -  Primary disease &gt; 7.5 cm in largest diameter as measured by CT or MRI.

          -  Gross extension of tumor into the lumen of the duodenum.

          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to ongoing or active
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac
             arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with
             study requirements.

          -  Use of bevacizumab or vascular endothelial growth factor inhibitor chemotherapy within
             3 months before RT or 6 months after RT.
