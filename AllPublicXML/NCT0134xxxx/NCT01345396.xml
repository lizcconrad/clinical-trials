  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Asthma is the most frequent respiratory disease during pregnancy. In a third of cases, the
      level of asthma control can decrease during the pregnancy, especially between the 29th and
      the 36th week. The occurrence of such complications are linked with a high asthma severity
      level just before the conception and an history of respiratory complications in a previous
      pregnancy. Many reviews and recommendations claim that pregnant women with asthma should be
      included in an educational progamme. However, this is poorly studied. The purpose of this
      study is to observe if an educational programme given before the 20th weeks of gestation has
      an effect on asthma control until the end of gestation.
