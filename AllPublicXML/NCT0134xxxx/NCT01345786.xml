  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      For the contraceptive application a film-coated tablet has been developed which combines
      nomegestrol acetate (NOMAC) with estradiol (E2). This was an open-label, randomized,
      single-dose, four-way, replicate, cross-over study design conducted in 2 parallel parts at
      two sites, one site per study part. The primary objective of Part 1 was to assess the
      bioequivalence of NOMAC and E2 of the drug product manufactured using the commercial process
      (&quot;commercial batch&quot;) versus the Phase 3 drug product (&quot;Batch A&quot;). The primary objective of
      Part 2 was to assess bioequivalence of NOMAC and E2 of the drug product manufactured using
      the commercial process (&quot;commercial batch&quot;) versus the Phase 3 drug product (&quot;Batch B&quot;).
