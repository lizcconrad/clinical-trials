      The purpose of this study is:

        1. To determine the optimal recommended phase II dose of two investigational study drugs,
           LBH589 and RAD001, given in combination in all solid tumors (With enrichment for
           EBV-Driven tumors).

        2. To determine the pharmacokinetic profile of RAD001 in combination with two schedules of
           LBH589.

        3. To assess the preliminary anti-tumor activity of RAD001 and LBH589.

      This study will also be exploring the hypothesis that HDACi and mTOR inhibitors abrogate the
      effects of key viral proteins, and switch the virus from a latent proliferative phase to a
      lytic phase. Immunologic correlates will also be examined to ascertain T-cell subpopulations
      and expression of HLA class molecules. DCE-MRI will be subsequently employed in dose
      expansion to examine antiangiogenic effects.

      Dose escalation phase 1B of the study will evaluate the safety and tolerability of RAD001 in
      combination with LBH589 in all solid tumors, lymphomas; and enriched for EBV driven tumors.
      The phase 2 component will be a single arm, non-randomized study restricted to nasopharyngeal
      carinoma only (endemic type).

      A &quot;3+3&quot; dose escalation design will be adopted. Patients will start taking LBH589 three times
      a week and will have a run in period of one week, followed by continous administration of
      RAD001 from week 2. Pharmacokinetic assessments will be done on day 1 of LBH589
      administration and day 1 of concurrent administration of LBH589 + RAD001. ON day 31, there
      will be a one week drug holiday. This is done to explore the eliminaition kinetics from
      steady state,as well as the durability of target modulation.

      AEs of patients will be monitored closely. In the event of grade 3/4 toxicity, the cohort
      will be expanded to 6. Dose escalation of LBH589/RAD001 may proceed until the maximum
      tolerated dose (MTD)is reached. Once the MTD is established, an expasion cohort comprising 20
      EBV driven tumors will open at two different LBH589 dose schedules.

      Treatment will be continued until progression of disease, unacceptable toxcity, or
      discontinuation criterion is met.
