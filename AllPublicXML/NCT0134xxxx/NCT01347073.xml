  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This non-randomized, open-label study was approximately one year in duration and consisted of
      a short term NaPBA to HPN-100 switchover part involving two overnight stays followed by a
      12-month long term treatment period involving monthly visits.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This was an open-label study consisting of a 10-day switch-over period during which subjects
      were switched from their prescribed dose of sodium phenylbutyrate (BUPHENYLTM or NaPBA) to a
      dose of HPN-100 that delivered the same amount of the active ingredient, PBA, followed by
      long-term treatment with HPN-100 for up to 12 months. The study was designed to capture
      information important for evaluating safety, Pharmacokinetics, and efficacy while recognizing
      sampling limitations in young children and current standard of care. Patients eligible for
      this study included pediatric patients from 29 days to &lt; 6 years of age with either a
      diagnosed or clinically suspected Urea Cycle Disorders (UCD) who are receiving a stable dose
      of the powder formulation of NaPBA. Subjects were clinically stable and had been receiving a
      stable dose NaPBA powder for at least 5 days at the time of enrollment.

      During the switch-over part of the study, subjects switched from NaPBA to HPN-100 in one step
      and had two overnight stays with 24 hour blood sampling, the first of which was on Day 1,
      while still taking NaPBA, and the second of which was on approximately Day 10 while taking
      HPN-100. Subjects then continued in the long-term treatment phase which was 12 months in
      duration.
