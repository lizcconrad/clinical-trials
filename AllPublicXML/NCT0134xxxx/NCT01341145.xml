      The goal of this study is to determine if aerobic exercise or progressive muscle relaxation
      is associated with changes in cardiovascular health, brain function, and cognition.

      Cognition is the most important determinant of health status, quality of life and functional
      ability in older age. Therefore, early interventions that preserve and enhance cognitive
      function are crucial for ensuring successful aging. The most common treatable risk factor for
      late-life cognitive impairment is midlife hypertension (HTN). One highly promising
      intervention strategy is aerobic exercise as it has been associated cognitive benefits in
      non-demented older adults. However, it is still unclear whether this benefit is due simply to
      prevention of other risk factors (e.g., reductions in blood pressure) or if exercise can
      reverse the negative effects of HTN on the brain. The goals of the current study are to
      employ sensitive measures of neuroimaging and cognition in order to 1).Compare cerebral
      health in endurance trained versus sedentary middle aged adults with normal or borderline to
      stage 1 hypertension, 2). measure the effects of exercise training in previously sedentary
      middle aged adults adults with normal or borderline to stage 1 hypertension, and 3). examine
      if exercise-related differences and changes in neural integrity and cognition are mediated by
      systemic vascular health.
