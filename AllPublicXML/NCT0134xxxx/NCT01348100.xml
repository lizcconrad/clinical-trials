  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed as a 3-part trial to evaluate the safety of a novel depot formulation
      of iloperidone, compare 2 depot dosage forms, and perform dose ranging of 1 chosen form in
      support of a monthly depot dosing regimen. In Phase A, the study is designed to evaluate the
      safety of a crystalline iloperidone depot formulation. In Phase B, the pharmacokinetic and
      safety profile of 2 depot clinical dosage forms will be compared, and 1 form will be selected
      for assessment in Phase C. Phase C of this study is designed to define the dose-exposure
      relationship of the selected form and to provide information that will permit a comparison of
      the risk-benefit ratio of several doses of the study drug to enable optimal dose selection
      for later studies.

    <description>Blood samples for pharmacokinetic (PK) evaluation were drawn pre-dose and at 3, 6, and 12 hours on Day 1; at 0 and 12 hours on Day 2; and on Days 3, 4, 6, 8, 10, 14, 18, 22, and 26 following administration of iloperidone. PK parameters were calculated from plasma concentration-time data using non-compartmental methods. The duration that the concentration of iloperidone was above 4 ng/mL was calculated by linear interpolation. PK/pharmacodynamic analysis performed in other studies suggests that iloperidone plasma levels of 4 ng/mL or above provide clinical efficacy.</description>

        <title>Duration That the Concentration of Iloperidone Was Above 4 ng/mL (Teff) - Phase B</title>
        <description>Blood samples for pharmacokinetic (PK) evaluation were drawn pre-dose and at 3, 6, and 12 hours on Day 1; at 0 and 12 hours on Day 2; and on Days 3, 4, 6, 8, 10, 14, 18, 22, and 26 following administration of iloperidone. PK parameters were calculated from plasma concentration-time data using non-compartmental methods. The duration that the concentration of iloperidone was above 4 ng/mL was calculated by linear interpolation. PK/pharmacodynamic analysis performed in other studies suggests that iloperidone plasma levels of 4 ng/mL or above provide clinical efficacy.</description>

          <title>The Average Plasma Concentration (Cav) of Iloperidone Divided by Dose - Phase C</title>
          <description>Blood samples for pharmacokinetic (PK) evaluation were drawn pre-dose and at 3, 6, and 12 hours on Day 1; at 0 and 12 hours on Day 2; and on Days 3, 4, 6, 8, 10, 14, 18, 22, and 26 following administration of iloperidone. Blood samples were collected after each depot injection. PK parameters were calculated from plasma concentration-time data using non-compartmental methods. Cav was calculated as AUC0-672h/672 h.</description>
