    <textblock>
      1. Objectives : To evaluate superiority of U(Ubiquitous)-Healthcare(hereinafter referred to
           as Smart Care) Service being combined conventional treatment with health care service,
           in comparison to conventional treatment in obese patients with metabolic syndrome.

        2. Test and control group

             -  Test groups : The subject group who is receiving health care services using
                conventional treatment (hospital visit) and Smart Care Service (Telemonitoring).

             -  Control group : The subject group who is receiving conventional treatment (hospital
                visit).

        3. Target Subject: Obese patients with metabolic syndrome.

    <description>The control group will receive a weighting scale and pedometer. They should perform the same weight measurement (minimum three times a week) like the intervention group during the study, and measured results should be recorded in a diary of self body weight and the number of steps. In addition, the subjects should visit the site once per every three months (12 weeks).</description>
