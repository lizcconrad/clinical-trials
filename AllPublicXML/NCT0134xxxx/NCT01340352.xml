      Working hypothesis and aims:

      To investigate the association between cervical length in non-pregnant women, and the risk of
      premature birth.

      The participants will be recruited from the HaEmek Medical Center delivery room registration.
      Women delivered between 24-37 pregnancy weeks will be allocated to the study group. The
      investigators will invite them 3 month or more after delivery to ultrasound examination of
      the cervical length. The participants in the control group will be the women whom term
      delivery follows by chronological manner to those in study group. Data of the cervucal length
      will be collected at the time of the examination.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Women will be invited to undergo an examination in Ultrasound Unit of Department of
      Obstetrics and Gynecology, HaEmek Medical Center.

      Ultrasound examination will be performed using the Voluson E8 device, General Electric.

      The cervical length,between the external and internal orifice will be measured using
      conventional technologies available including: Doppler, three dimensional and two dimensional
      ultrasound.
