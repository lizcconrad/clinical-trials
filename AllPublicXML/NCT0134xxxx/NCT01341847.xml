      Aim of the Study :

      This study will compare the colonoscopy examination between the air method (air insufflation)
      and water method (water infusion) in unsedated patients with indication (symptoms and signs
      based) of colonoscopy examination. This study is based on earlier study which showed that
      water method had better results in reducing abdominal pain, caecal intubation and patients
      willingness to repeat colonoscopy examination than air method.

      Background:

      Colonoscopy examination is an important method to examine and establish the diagnosis of
      various diseases in the colon. Colonoscopy is successful when the tip of the scope reach the
      cecum and observe the caecal valve and/ or appendix orifice. This examination can be
      performed unsedated or under sedation (conscious sedation or deep sedation/general
      anaesthesia). The main disadvantage of unsedated colonoscopy method is the abdominal
      discomfort or pain during examination that may make patient distress and hemodynamically
      unstable and possibly stoppage of the examination before reach the cecum, but the severity of
      abdominal symptoms is vary from patient to patient. Many efforts have been tried to reduce
      the abdominal discomfort during examination. This unsedated method with air insufflation is
      our hospital standard method for colonoscopy examination since early 1980s, and less than 1%
      of patients were colonoscopied with conscious or deep sedation. Our study showed the success
      rate of this standard unsedated method was about 82%. The advantage of this method is
      inexpensive (feasible for most of people in developing country like us), patient may be
      examined ambulatory without escort, may back to work as soon as the examination is finished.
      Studies showed that replace the air insufflation with water infusion into colon since the
      beginning of the examination increased the success rate of caecal intubation and reduced the
      abdominal pain symptoms during colonoscopy examination(1). Sedation or general anaesthesia
      may increase the success rate of colonoscopy examination but it is costly, and may increase
      the adverse event especially in the elderly or patients with significance cardiopulmonary
      problems.

      Research Design and Methods:

      Eligible patients in the hospital clinics or wards will be offered to follow unsedated
      colonoscopy examination. The principle investigator (PI) will explain the study, the
      colonoscopy procedure , the various symptoms that may be felt during examination, the
      possible adverse event and medical effort to prevent it. Patient who sign the informed
      consent will be included in the study.

      Methods on the day of exam. Enrolled patients will be sent to the endoscopy room and
      colonoscopy will be performed by the principle investigator. Patient lie on the left lateral
      position with right hip and knee flexed and left leg straight. When the PI about to start the
      single-handed colonoscopy examination, the blinded observer open the sealed envelops with the
      code enclosed. A standard colonoscope will be inserted. Patient may be ordered to change the
      position and or abdominal compression may be applied by nurse to aid the colonoscope
      advancement. Oximetry, cardiac rhythm and blood pressure will be monitored during
      examination. Blinding will not be performed in this study because of the feeling of water or
      air effect inside the colon can be differentiated by the patient so that in our opinion it
      actually can not be blinded..The control method includes usual air insufflation during
      insertion and shortening maneuvers. The study method includes only water infusion (air pump
      is turned off) through the colonoscope during insertion since the scope is inserted into the
      anus until reach the cecum. Water will be infused as needed under endoscopist judgement
      through the adaptor on biopsy channel with endoscopic washer pump. The usual air insufflation
      will be used during colonoscope withdrawal to facilitate mucosal examination and perform any
      other intervention, such as biopsy. Hypothesis testing: The unsedated colonoscopy with
      natural temperature water infusion minimize the pain symptoms than unsedated colonoscopy with
      usual air insufflation.
