    <textblock>
      This is a retrospective study assessing pre- and postoperative radiographic indices of hip
      dysplasia in order to identify factors predicting failure following Periacetabular Osteotomy
      (PAO).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Even though the PAO is applied worldwide and is the preferred joint preserving treatment some
      issues remains unclear and controversial. One is the exact indication for surgery and risk
      factors for early failure of the procedure. The is a retrospective cohort study assessing
      pre- and postoperative radiographic indices of hip dysplasia in order to identify factors
      predicting failure following PAO. The minimum duration of follow-up is 2 years. Failure
      following PAO is defined by a WOMAC pain score &gt; 10 or the insertion of a total hip
      arthroplasty.
