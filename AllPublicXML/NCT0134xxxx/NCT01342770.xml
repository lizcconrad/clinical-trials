    <textblock>
      This pilot phase II trial studies how well pioglitazone works in treating patients with stage
      IA-IIIA non-small cell lung cancer. Pioglitazone hydrochloride may slow the growth of tumor
      cells and may be an effective treatment for non-small cell lung cancer.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the mechanism(s) of action of pioglitazone as a candidate chemopreventive
      agent for lung cancer by investigating the effects on Ki-67 defined in non-small cell lung
      cancer (NSCLC) tumor tissue.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the effects of pioglitazone on multiple markers listed below:

        -  Tumor tissue: caspase-3, cyclin D1, p21/Waf1, peroxisome proliferative activated
           receptor, gamma (PPARγ), mucin 1 (MUC1).

        -  Premalignant tissue: Ki-67, caspase-3, PPARγ.

        -  Histologically normal tissue: Ki-67, PPARγ. II. To evaluate the toxicity and safety of
           pioglitazone in this patient population.

      III. To analyze the expression of serum markers that are affected by pioglitazone.

      IV. To describe the effects of limited treatment with pioglitazone on tumor metabolic
      activity as determined by FDG-PET (assessed before and after a minimum of 2 weeks of
      treatment).

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive pioglitazone hydrochloride orally (PO) once daily (QD) for 14-42 days.
      Patients then undergo surgery.

Complete response (CR) is the disappearance of all non-nodal target lesions (TL) and each target lymph node (LN) must have reduction in short axis to &lt;1.0cm. Partial Response (PR) is at least a 30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameters (LD) of the non-nodal TR and the short axis of the target LN with the baseline sum diameters (BSD) as reference. Progression (PD) is at least 1 new malignant lesion or LN whose short axis increased to &gt;1.5 cm or at least a 20% increase in the sum of TL diameters with the minimum sum of diameters as reference.</description>
