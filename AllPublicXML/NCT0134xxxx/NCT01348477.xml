  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators describe a new surgical technique for inguinal hernia open repair, which
      will be compared with the Lichtenstein technique. The investigators seek to find the
      difference between the two techniques in postoperative pain.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators randomly assigned 168 adult patients with uncomplicated primary inguinal
      hernia to two treatment groups:

      Group A: 84 patients treated with the new technique Group B: 84 patients treated with the
      technique of Lichtenstein (gold standard) The investigators reviewed the patients operated on
      one week, one month, three months and six months after surgery. The investigators evaluated
      the presence of moderate to severe pain in each technique, as well as the intensity of pain,
      measured by visual analogue scale.

      The investigators also determined the presence of inguinal dysesthesias in each technique,
      measured by dermatome mapping.

    <description>Pain will be measured by the Visual Analogue Scale, from zero to ten. Measurements will be made per month, three months and six months after surgery. With these data we will built two survival curves (one for each group)with the proportions of patients still have pain in every time frame. We will compare the two curves with logrank statistic test.</description>
