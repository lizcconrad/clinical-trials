      This study will look at the impact of dosing as well as ongoing treatment with an
      investigation medication identified as PF-03654746, on cognitive and physiologic indicators
      of brain function. Data from this study will assist with the evaluation of the utility of
      functional magnetic resonance imaging, arterial spin labeling (ASL), and electrophysiologic
      measures in the detection of early signals of the effectiveness of medications developed to
      target cognitive impairment in schizophrenia. Safety and tolerability of PF-03654746 in this
      population will be also be evaluated.

    <description>All participants will receive 3 weeks of PF-03654746 and 3 weeks of placebo. PF-03654746 and placebo will be administered in a flexible titration regimen, beginning with 0.5 mg/d. If 0.5 mg/d is well tolerated, the dose will be increased to 1.0 mg/d after 5 days. If 1.0 mg/d is not well tolerated, the dose will be decreased to 0.5 mg/d, with the goal of achieving a stable dose of PF-03654746 within the first two weeks of dosing and avoiding further dose changes during the final week of dosing.</description>

             injury/trauma, as defined by one or more of the following:

               1. Loss of consciousness (LOC) for more than 1 hour;

               2. Recurring seizures resulting from the head injury;

               3. Clear cognitive sequelae of the injury;

               4. Cognitive rehabilitation following the injury.

         27. Subjects with a history of clinically significant neurological, metabolic, hepatic,

             disorders (eg, unstable angina, decompensated congestive heart failure, CNS infection
             or history of HIV seropositivity), which would pose a risk to the patient if they were
             to participate in the study or that might confound the results of the study. Active
             medical conditions that are minor or well controlled are not exclusionary if they do
             not affect risk to the patient or the study results. For example, the following are
             not exclusionary: a) stable and well controlled hypertension (BP normally 160/95 for
             at least 3 months); b) asthma (no serious attacks in the past year); c) hypothyroidism
             (T4 within normal limits for at least 1 year); and d) Type II diabetes (subjects with
             a reported HgbA1c outside of normal limits within the last 6 months should be reviewed
             with the study site Investigator);

         28. Subject received ECT treatment within the last 6 months;

         29. Prior participation in a clinical trial of any other psychotropic medication within 2
             months;

             Protocol;
