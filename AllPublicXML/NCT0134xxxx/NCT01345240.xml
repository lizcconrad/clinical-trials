        <description>Concentrations, by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), were presented as geometric mean concentrations (GMCs), and expressed in milli-international units per milliliter (mIU/mL). The assay cut-off was the seropositivity cut-off value of greater than or equal to (&gt;=) 10 mIU/mL. A decrease in the specificity of the anti-HBs ELISA assay had been observed in some studies for low levels of antibody (10-100 mIU/mL). The table shows updated results following partial or complete retesting/reanalysis, with study groups pooled by primary vaccine administered (RTS,S vs Engerix-B™).</description>

        <title>Pneumococcal Antibody Concentrations Against Synflorix™ Pneumococcal Vaccine Serotypes.</title>
        <description>Antibody concentrations were measured by GSK assay, and expressed as geometric mean concentrations (GMCs), in micrograms per milliliter (µg/mL). The pneumococcal vaccine serotypes assessed were the serotypes 1, 4, 5, 6B, 7F, 9V, 14, 18C, 19F and 23F. The cut-off of the assay, by GSK assay, was greater than or equal to (&gt;=) 0.2 μg/mL. This corresponds to a cut-off value of 0.35μg/mL by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA).</description>
        <time_frame>At Month 17, aka one month post the Month 16 booster dose of Synflorix™</time_frame>
        <population>The analysis was performed on the According-to-Protocol cohort for immunogenicity, which included all evaluable subjects (i.e. those meeting all eligibility criteria, complying with the procedures and intervals defined in the protocol, with no elimination criteria during the study) for whom data concerning immunogenicity measures were available.</population>

            <description>This group results from the pooling of the RTS,S Regimen A Lot 1, RTS,S Regimen A Lot 2 and RTS,S Regimen A Lot 3 groups. Subjects, healthy male and female infants aged between 8 and 12 weeks inclusive at the time of first vaccination, received 3 doses of RTS,S vaccine, Lot 1, 2 or 3, co-administered with Infanrix™-Hib, Polio Sabin™ and Synflorix™, at Weeks 0, 4 and 8, and 2 doses of Rotarix™ vaccine, at Weeks 6 and 10. In addition, subjects also received one dose of vaccine against yellow fever and against measles, at Week 32, and one booster dose of Infanrix™-Hib and Synflorix™, at Month 16, and one booster dose of Engerix B™ vaccine, at Month 50. The RTS,S vaccine and Engerix B™ were administered intramuscularly (IM) in the left anterolateral thigh, Infanrix™-Hib IM in the right deltoid, Synflorix™ IM in the right anterolateral thigh, and Rotarix™ and Polio Sabin™ orally. The measles and yellow fever vaccines were administered IM in the deltoid.</description>

        <title>Titers for Opsonophagocytic Activity Against Synflorix™ Pneumococcal Vaccine Serotypes.</title>
        <description>The pneumococcal vaccine serotypes assessed were the serotypes 1, 4, 5, 6B, 7F, 9V, 14, 18C, 19F and 23F. Streptococcus pneumoniae opsonophagocytic activity was presented as the dilution of serum (opsonic titer) able to sustain 50 % killing of live pneumococci under the assay conditions, expressed as geometric mean titers (GMTs). The cut-off of the assay was an opsonic dilution &gt;= 8.
This outcome concerns the subjects who received the RTS,S or Engerix-B™ vaccine co-administered with Synflorix™. Results presented are for the study groups pooled by co-administration, that is, for the RTS,S Regimen A and Engerix-B Regimen A groups.</description>
        <time_frame>At Month 3, aka at one month (1M) post Dose 3 of Synflorix™</time_frame>
        <population>The analysis was performed on the According-to-Protocol cohort for immunogenicity, which included all evaluable subjects (i.e. those meeting all eligibility criteria, complying with the procedures and intervals defined in the protocol, with no elimination criteria during the study) for whom data concerning immunogenicity measures were available.</population>

            <description>This group results from the pooling of the RTS,S Regimen A Lot 1, RTS,S Regimen A Lot 2 and RTS,S Regimen A Lot 3 groups. Subjects, healthy male and female infants aged between 8 and 12 weeks inclusive at the time of first vaccination, received 3 doses of RTS,S vaccine, Lot 1, 2 or 3, co-administered with Infanrix™-Hib, Polio Sabin™ and Synflorix™, at Weeks 0, 4 and 8, and 2 doses of Rotarix™ vaccine, at Weeks 6 and 10. In addition, subjects also received one dose of vaccine against yellow fever and against measles, at Week 32, and one booster dose of Infanrix™-Hib and Synflorix™, at Month 16, and one booster dose of Engerix B™ vaccine, at Month 50. The RTS,S vaccine and Engerix B™ were administered intramuscularly (IM) in the left anterolateral thigh, Infanrix™-Hib IM in the right deltoid, Synflorix™ IM in the right anterolateral thigh, and Rotarix™ and Polio Sabin™ orally. The measles and yellow fever vaccines were administered IM in the deltoid.</description>

        <title>Titers for Opsonophagocytic Activity Against Synflorix™ Pneumococcal Vaccine Serotypes.</title>
        <description>The pneumococcal vaccine serotypes assessed were the serotypes 1, 4, 5, 6B, 7F, 9V, 14, 18C, 19F and 23F. Streptococcus pneumoniae opsonophagocytic activity was presented as the dilution of serum (opsonic titer) able to sustain 50 % killing of live pneumococci under the assay conditions, expressed as geometric mean titers (GMTs). The cut-off of the assay was an opsonic dilution &gt;= 8.</description>
        <time_frame>At Month 17, aka one month post the Month 16 booster dose of Synflorix™</time_frame>
        <population>The analysis was performed on the According-to-Protocol cohort for immunogenicity, which included all evaluable subjects (i.e. those meeting all eligibility criteria, complying with the procedures and intervals defined in the protocol, with no elimination criteria during the study) for whom data concerning immunogenicity measures were available.</population>

            <description>This group results from the pooling of the RTS,S Regimen A Lot 1, RTS,S Regimen A Lot 2 and RTS,S Regimen A Lot 3 groups. Subjects, healthy male and female infants aged between 8 and 12 weeks inclusive at the time of first vaccination, received 3 doses of RTS,S vaccine, Lot 1, 2 or 3, co-administered with Infanrix™-Hib, Polio Sabin™ and Synflorix™, at Weeks 0, 4 and 8, and 2 doses of Rotarix™ vaccine, at Weeks 6 and 10. In addition, subjects also received one dose of vaccine against yellow fever and against measles, at Week 32, and one booster dose of Infanrix™-Hib and Synflorix™, at Month 16, and one booster dose of Engerix B™ vaccine, at Month 50. The RTS,S vaccine and Engerix B™ were administered intramuscularly (IM) in the left anterolateral thigh, Infanrix™-Hib IM in the right deltoid, Synflorix™ IM in the right anterolateral thigh, and Rotarix™ and Polio Sabin™ orally. The measles and yellow fever vaccines were administered IM in the deltoid.</description>

        <title>Anti-Rotavirus (Anti-RV) Antibody Concentrations</title>
        <description>Anti-Rotavirus (anti-RV) antibody concentrations were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and expressed as geometric mean concentrations (GMCs). The cut-off of the assay was the seropositive cut-off value of greater than or equal to (&gt;=) 20 units per milliliter (U/mL). This outcome measure was assessed in subjects who were administered Rotarix™ as part of an EPI regimen, with and without RTS,S vaccine co-administration. This outcome concerns the subjects who received the RTS,S or Engerix-B™ vaccine co-administered with Rotarix™. Results presented are for the study groups pooled by RTS,S or Engerix-B™ vaccine co-administration, that is, for the RTS,S Regimen B and Engerix-B Regimen B groups.</description>
        <time_frame>At Month 3, aka one month post Dose 2 of Rotarix™</time_frame>
        <population>The analysis was performed on the According-to-Protocol cohort for immunogenicity, which included all evaluable subjects (i.e. those meeting all eligibility criteria, complying with the procedures and intervals defined in the protocol, with no elimination criteria during the study) for whom data concerning immunogenicity measures were available.</population>

        <description>Assessed solicited general symptoms were fever, irritability/fussiness, drowsiness, and loss of appetite. Fever was defined as axillary temperature higher than (&gt;) 37.5 degrees Celsius (°C). Analysis for this outcome was performed solely for the 7-days follow-up periods following the primary vaccination with RTS,S vaccine or Engerix-B™ (at Day 0, and Months 1 and 2). Data presented are those for any occurrence of the assessed solicited general symptoms, that is, the occurrences of these symptoms regardless of their intensity grade or relationship to vaccination.</description>

        <title>Number of Subjects With Potential Immune Mediated Disorders (pIMDs)</title>
        <description>A potential immune mediated disorder (pIMD) was defined as an event about which concerns arose that vaccination may have interfered with immunological self-tolerance of the subjects. IMDs assessed included among others neuroinflammatory disorders (such as optic neuritis, multiple sclerosis, or encephalitis), musculoskeletal disorders (such as cutaneous lupus, rheumatoid arthritis, juvenile arthritis, or psoriatic arthropathy), gastrointestinal disorders (ulcerative colitis and ulcerative proctitis, celiac disease), metabolic diseases (such as autoimmune thyroiditis, or diabetes Mellitus Type 1, Addison’s disease), skin disorders (such as psoriasis or vitiligo), and other disorders such as vasculitis, pernicious anemia, or, sarcoidosis.</description>
        <time_frame>From Day 0 to Month 8.</time_frame>
        <population>The analysis was performed on the Total Vaccinated cohort, which included all vaccinated subjects for whom data were available.</population>

            <description>This group results from the pooling of the RTS,S Regimen A Lot 1, RTS,S Regimen A Lot 2 and RTS,S Regimen A Lot 3 groups. Subjects, healthy male and female infants aged between 8 and 12 weeks inclusive at the time of first vaccination, received 3 doses of RTS,S vaccine, Lot 1, 2 or 3, co-administered with Infanrix™-Hib, Polio Sabin™ and Synflorix™, at Weeks 0, 4 and 8, and 2 doses of Rotarix™ vaccine, at Weeks 6 and 10. In addition, subjects also received one dose of vaccine against yellow fever and against measles, at Week 32, and one booster dose of Infanrix™-Hib and Synflorix™, at Month 16, and one booster dose of Engerix B™ vaccine, at Month 50. The RTS,S vaccine and Engerix B™ were administered intramuscularly (IM) in the left anterolateral thigh, Infanrix™-Hib IM in the right deltoid, Synflorix™ IM in the right anterolateral thigh, and Rotarix™ and Polio Sabin™ orally. The measles and yellow fever vaccines were administered IM in the deltoid.</description>
