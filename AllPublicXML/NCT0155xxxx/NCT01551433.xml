  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test whether after an Ivor Lewis esophagectomy (the removal
      of a portion of the stomach and esophagus with re-attachment) there is an association between
      the intraoperative level of oxygen at the site where the esophagus is re-attached to the
      stomach (measured using the Wipox), and the incidence of a disruption at the site of the
      attachment after the surgery.

    <time_frame>2 years</time_frame>
    <description>The primary objective of this observational study is to determine whether in patients undergoing Ivor Lewis esophagectomy, low levels of tissue oxygenation at the anastomotic site are associated with increased risk of anastomotic leak (AL).</description>

    <time_frame>2 years</time_frame>
    <description>(age, co-morbidities, smoking history) and clinical variables (pre-operative therapy, intra-operative blood pressure and systemic oxygen saturation) with tissue oxygenation at the anastomotic site. Spearman rank correlation (for continuous variables) and Wilcoxon rank sum test (for categorical variables) will be used to test these associations.</description>

    <measure>To correlate anastomotic site tissue oxygenation with the postdischarge incidence of stricture</measure>
    <time_frame>2 years</time_frame>
    <description>the association between anastomotic site tissue oxygenation and the incidence of post-discharge stricture observed during the 6 months following surgery will be assessed using Wilcoxon rank sum test (with O2 levels on a continuous scale) and Fisher exact test.</description>

    <description>During the operation, once the gastric conduit has been mobilized and positioned, and once the anastomotic site has been identified by the surgeon, the assigned RSA will provide the Wipox instrument to the fellow (the primary surgeon will be blinded to the result) who will then obtain one measurement from the anastomotic site.</description>

    <description>In addition to the one Wipox measurement at the planned anastomotic site, the RSA will collect the systemic pulse oximeter reading, blood pressure, and heart rate at the time of the Wipox measurement. These measurements will be obtained as both internal controls of the accuracy of the Wipox (matching the Wipox pulse rate with the patient's), as well as additional variables to control for when assessing factors which might contribute to oxygen saturation at the anastomotic site. Pre-operative demographic information will be collected. This will include age, sex, any co-morbidities (cardiac, diabetes, respiratory), and use of pre-operative chemotherapy or chemo-radiotherapy.</description>
