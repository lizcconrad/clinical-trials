  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a 2-part, open-label study, designed to evaluate the effect of renal disease on the
      pharmacokinetics of BAL4815 (active isavuconazole moiety) relative to the pharmacokinetics in
      healthy subjects with normal renal function.

      In Part 1, eligible subjects will be enrolled into one of 2 groups based on their renal
      function. All subjects will receive a single 1-hour infusion of isavuconazole and will remain
      confined for 4 days. Subjects with normal renal function will return to the clinic for
      several outpatient visits over 15 days after dosing. Subjects with renal disease will
      complete the same outpatient visits which correspond to scheduled dialysis dates and then be
      readmitted to the clinic on study Day 15 to receive a second 1-hour infusion of isavuconazole
      followed by their normal dialysis procedure and then remain confined for 4 days. ECGs, vital
      signs, blood draws will be obtained throughout the study for safety and to assess the amount
      of study drug in the body as well as study drug removed in subjects undergoing dialysis.

      In Part 2, eligible subjects will be enrolled into one of 4 groups based on their renal
      function. All subjects will receive a single 1-hour infusion of isavuconazole and remain
      confined for 4 days. Subjects will return to the clinic for several outpatient visits over 15
      days after dosing. ECGs, vital signs, blood draws will be obtained throughout the study for
      safety and to assess the amount of study drug in the body.
