    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this preliminary study is to estimate sleep outcome effect sizes and
      determine feasibility for a novel yoga treatment of insomnia in participants with post
      traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Additional objectives are to evaluate relationships of
      sleep outcomes with measures of other PTSD symptoms, psychosocial health and possible
      mechanisms of action.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Male and non-pregnant female adults at least 18 years of age.

          -  A DSM-IV-TR diagnosis of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).

          -  Na√Øve to yoga and other meditative practices, defined as less than one hour per week
             for the past 6 months.

          -  Potential subjects receiving ongoing medical or psychological treatment are eligible,
             as long as treatment remains stable over the course of the study and does not include
             more than one hour weekly of mind-body medicine (strategies directly related to
             meditation and yoga).

          -  No more than 2 alcoholic or caffeinated drinks/day

          -  No illicit drug use

          -  Potential subjects are eligible if they have been on stable dosage (not PRN) of
             medication for PTSD symptoms including sleep disturbances and any medication that may
             influence sleep for at least 6 weeks prior to the study, and be willing to continue
             with same dosage for the duration of the study.

          -  No current substance abuse, defined as diagnosis of substance abuse or dependence
             disorder within the past year, and/or in/outpatient treatment for substance abuse or
             dependence in the past 6 weeks.

          -  No transcontinental travel over the course of the study.

          -  No night-shift or rotating shift work over the course of the study.

          -  Insomnia based on the American Academy of Sleep Medicine's Research Diagnostic
             Criteria (RDC) for insomnia due to a mental health disorder

          -  Potential subjects are eligible to participate in this study if they have sufficient
             mental and physical ability to fully participate in the parameters of the study.
             Subjects must be able to understand and comply with instructions in the group yoga
             sessions and home practice, complete questionnaires, participate in clinical
             interviews, and take part in all data collection activities. Subjects with severe
             mental or physical concerns that may prevent them from understanding and/or complying
             with the treatment will be excluded. For example, potential subjects confined to
             wheelchairs will not be eligible, although subjects with artificial limbs who are able
             to reasonably participate in the intervention may be deemed eligible. These
             determinations will be made during discussions with potential subjects on a case by
             case basis during the screening process.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        - Potential subjects are ineligible if pregnant.
