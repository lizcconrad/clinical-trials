  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the superiority of posterior crural repair during
      sleeve gastrectomy over no repair in decreasing the incidence of symptomatic and clinical
      reflux disease.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Longitudinal Sleeve gastrectomy is a type of Bariatric surgery where the stomach is divided
      vertically, reducing it to about 25% of its original size. Obesity itself is an independent
      risk factor for Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD); however it has been observed in the
      bariatric surgical community that many Longitudinal Sleeve Gastrectomy (LSG) patients are
      complaining of persisted GERD symptoms after LSG surgery. The incidence of GERD in these
      patients have been reported to be as high as 26%. GERD is an uncomfortable and dangerous
      disease, and if remains unchecked, it can cause ulcer disease, esophagitis, and even
      esophageal cancer. Because of this, bariatric surgeons want to reduce incidence of GERD after
      LSG, which led to multiple additions to the LSG procedures, which are currently being
      examined, namely, combined fundoplication with the sleeve, banded sleeve and a combined
      hiatal repair with SG. However, there have been no randomized comparative clinical trials to
      evaluate GERD as an endpoint after LSG.

      Of all the possible solutions to treat increased reflux after LSG, mentioned previously,
      repairing the hiatus at the time of surgery makes the most sense physiologically. LSG
      dissection requires the obliteration of the left phrenoesophageal ligaments that hold the GE
      junction in place. This essentially creates a weakness in the hiatus that can lead to hiatal
      hernia and subsequent reflux disease. Crural repair at the time of surgery strengthens the GE
      junction and reduces the possibility of hiatal hernia formation. Closing the crus around the
      esophagus may prevent the sleeve from herniating into the chest and reduces the occurrence of
      reflux by repositioning the GE junction into it0s normal location in the abdomen.

    <description>The primary outcome of the study will be the patients' self-assessment of their reflux symptoms as reported with the GSRS quality of life questionnaire that was specifically designed to be used as an outcome measure in clinical trials of intervention in GERD. The final primary outcome will be measured every year to assess allieviation or change of reflux sysmtpms over time and to ensure there is no reoccurence of symptoms.</description>
