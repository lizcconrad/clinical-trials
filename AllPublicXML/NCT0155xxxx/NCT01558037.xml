  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cytomegalovirus (CMV) is a common infection with 60-90% of all adults worldwide having
      evidence of having the infection at sometime in their life. Patients who have undergone
      transplantation are at risk at developing CMV, especially those patients who do not have
      antibodies to CMV pre-transplant, but received an organ from a recipient who has antibodies
      to CMV. Usually the disease CMV causes is mild and sometimes patients are not even aware they
      have the infection without tests to detect the virus. CMV can less commonly cause serious
      infections that affect many parts of the body including the intestines, liver, or lungs. In
      rare cases CMV infection in transplant patients can cause death.

      All patients who receive a transplant are monitored for CMV infection. The purpose of this
      study is to determine if there is a way the investigators can determine in advance which
      patients are at greatest risk of CMV infection. Specifically, this study will analyze the
      immune system of transplant patients to determine if there are specific elements of the
      immune system that 1) helps protect the body against CMV infection, and 2) helps the body
      combat CMV once it is infected. Identifying these specific elements of the immune system
      could improve the physician's ability to monitor the SOT patients for CMV infection, and to
      help treat CMV in those patients that become infected.

      Our hypothesis is that the degree of CMV cell-mediated immune (CMI) response correlates
      inversely with the risk of development of CMV replication and correlates with the response to
      initial therapy and risk of relapse after onset of replication. The primary aim of this study
      is to determine an association between CMV CMI response and both the risk of CMV infection
      and the degree of initial CMV viremia and rate of viremia clearance with standard CMV
      therapy. The first secondary aim is to determine an association between CMV QnPCR, CMV
      microRNA expression, TLR2 expression, and CMV-specific CMI and the risk of relapse of CMV
      disease after initial treatment. The second secondary aim is to determine an association
      between CMV QnPCR, CMV microRNA expression, TLR2 expression, and CMV-specific CMI collected
      at CMV infection and the following prospective data: Development of CMV end organ disease,
      resolution of symptoms of CMV infection, other non-CMV infections after initial CMV
      infection, graft rejection, recurrent or resistant CMV infection, and other markers of immune
      function. The third secondary aim is to determine an association between CMV QnPCR, CMV
      microRNA expression, TLR2 expression, and CMV-specific CMI response collected at CMV
      infection in solid-organ transplant (SOT) recipients and the following retrospective data:
      Type of SOT, CMV donor/recipient status, type and degree of immunosuppression, type and
      length of CMV prophylaxis, prior graft rejection and infections (non-CMV).

        The main study will recruit adult solid organ transplant recipients at Northwestern
        Memorial Hospital who are CMV donor positive, recipient negative (D+/R-) and SOT recipients
        at NMH who are CMV recipient positive, irrespective of donor status (D±/R+). A sub-study of
        this study will enroll up to 50 adult SOT recipients who have quantifiable CMV DNA by PCR
        and require CMV antiviral therapy, irrespective of their participation in the main study.
        Patients will be identified prior to transplantation as part of the pre-transplant
        evaluation process and will be consented either pre-transplant or on the first
        post-operative day in which they can provide written consent.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Main Study Subjects will be recruited if they are listed for a SOT (liver,
             liver-kidney, kidney, kidney-pancreas, cardiac). At the time of transplant, consented
             patients will have an immediate pre-transplant blood draw for baseline labs subsequent
             labs will only be drawn if the donor/recipient CMV serostatus is CMV D+/R- (up to a
             maximum of 50 subjects) or D+/R+ or D-/R+ (up to a maximum of 50 subjects). Subjects
             must be ≥ 18 years of age, be consentable, and agree to have laboratory and clinical
             follow-up at Northwestern.

          -  CMV Replication Substudy

          -  Subjects will be recruited if they have undergone SOT, are found to have a positive
             CMV QnPCR (&gt; 600 copies/mL) and will be subsequently treated for CMV infection with
             either intravenous ganciclovir or oral valganciclovir therapy at the discretion of the
             treating provider. Subjects must be ≥ 18 years of age, able to give consent, and agree
             to have laboratory and clinical follow-up at Northwestern.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects will be excluded if they have had a previous history of CMV infection after
             SOT prior to enrollment (a prior episode of CMV infection or replication prior to the
             onset of the current episode). Subjects will also be excluded if the subject cannot
             give informed consent or if the subject is not able to comply with follow-up testing
             and/or treatment.
