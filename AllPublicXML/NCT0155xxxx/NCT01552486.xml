  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Comparisons of surgical and non-operative treatment of patients with acute sciatica secondary
      to lumbar intervertebral disc herniation (AS/LDH) have shown no appreciable difference in
      outcome. The composition of the non-operative treatment of this patient population remains
      poorly defined. Spinal manipulative therapy (SMT) has demonstrated value in the treatment of
      AS/LDH. Recent preliminary studies suggest that SMT provides therapeutic benefit through the
      modulation of in vivo inflammatory mediators. This feasibility study will define the key
      experimental variables required to conduct a large multicentre study that will clarify the
      biological and clinical outcomes of SMT in the treatment of patients with AS/LDH.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  chief complaint of sciatica rather than lower back pain

          -  pain of up to 6 months' duration

          -  a McCulloch criteria score of 5/5 (two clinical symptoms and two clinical signs of
             sciatica, and diagnostic imaging confirming the presence of a herniated nucleus
             pulposus contacting a spinal nerve root at the appropriate level)

          -  fluency in spoken and written English to ensure subjects understand the content of
             questionnaires and consent

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  progressive neurological deficit

          -  spinal fracture

          -  spinal tumor

          -  spinal infection

          -  spinal nerve root motor score of less than 4/5

          -  spinal stenosis that is not attributable to a herniated disc

          -  any other significant spinal ailment or local or generalized co-morbidity ailment that
             could affect outcomes independently of SMT ( e.g. seronegative spondyloarthropathy,
             malignancy).
