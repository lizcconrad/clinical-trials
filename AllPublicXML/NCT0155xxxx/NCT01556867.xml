  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      At birth, the umbilical cord is cut, separating physically and symbolically the mother of his
      child. Before cord drop, umbilical area is a possible way of bacterial infection. Thus,
      umbilical cord infections constitute a major cause of neonatal morbidity and mortality in
      developing countries. In industrialized countries, omphalitis cases have almost disappeared
      whatever cord care strategies. At this day, care practices appear extremely different between
      countries, based more on habits and convictions that on evidence-based medicine. The
      investigators propose to conduct a non inferiority multicenter clustered crossed randomized
      study. Observations sessions will be performed on two consecutive periods of 5 months: 4
      months of recruitment and 1 month follow-up. Main objective is to demonstrate that dry cord
      care practice would not expose to a higher risk of omphalitis than antiseptic based care
      approach. The purpose of NEOCORD study is a simplification of cord care for paramedical teams
      and parents, but also a significant reduction of costs in a medico-economic approach.

    <description>The primary endpoint will correspond to the incidence of omphalitis occurred within 28 days post-birth.
The omphalitis is defined as the presence of erythema or serous or purulent in-cord tissue or umbilical perished. The stages are described to investigators about watching information in a search for suspected omphalitis.
This can be confirmed retrospectively by an Awards Committee composed of a Dermatopédiatre, a pediatrician and a pediatric surgeon.</description>

    <description>For children born during a control period, cord care will be done with an antiseptic whose choice is left to the discretion of the healthcare team.
In this essay, it opted not to impose an antiseptic. Indeed, the objective of the trial is to compare the two strategies for management of care.</description>
