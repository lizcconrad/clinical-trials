    <textblock>
      This study is being done to improve the ability to diagnose and to achieve higher-levels of
      functional recovery in soldiers and civilians who have suffered either mild Traumatic Brain
      Injury (TBIs) or moderate-to-severe TBIs at chronic stages of brain recovery (greater than 12
      months).

    <description>To examine short-term effects of treatment on cognition and real-life outcomes including psychological health, resilience, depressive symptoms, and symptoms of stress, in soldiers and civilians with TBI. Participants will undergo neuropsychological testing post-training (10 weeks), as well as 3-months post-training.</description>
