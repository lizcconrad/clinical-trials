    <textblock>
      This phase III multicentric international randomized trial is designed to compare the
      efficacy of Meropenem to the standard of care in infants below 90 days of age with clinical
      or confirmed late-onset sepsis (LOS).

      The aim is to assess efficacy , pharmacokinetics and safety of Meropenem which are not well
      known and documented in this population.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The principal objective is to compare the efficacy at test of cure (TOC) visit of meropenem
      to the standard of care (SOC) in the treatment of clinical or confirmed LOS in infants ≤ 90
      days of postnatal age.

      The secondary objectives are:

        -  To compare the safety profile of meropenem to SOC

        -  To compare the efficacy at TOC visit of meropenem to SOC in confirmed sepsis

        -  To compare the response to meropenem and SOC on day 3 of antibacterial therapy

        -  To compare the efficacy at TOC visit of meropenem to SOC ignoring the change of
           antibiotic(s) for safety reasons

        -  To compare the efficacy at TOC visit of meropenem to SOC by SOC regimen

        -  To compare survival at follow up (FU) visit (28 day visit) in the meropenem arm and SOC
           arm

        -  To compare new infections and relapses that occur between TOC and FU visits in
           participants with a favourable outcome at TOC visit by treatment arm

        -  To define the organisms causing LOS

        -  To study antibacterial susceptibility of LOS-causing organisms and to describe clinical
           and microbiological responses according to this

        -  To compare gut colonization by antibiotic resistant organisms after treatment with
           meropenem or SOC

        -  To compare bacterial eradication by treatment arm

        -  To compare time to NICU discharge across the 2 arms

        -  To describe PK of meropenem in infants ≤ 90 days of postnatal age with LOS

        -  To evaluate genetic parameters that may affect response to therapy

    <description>The proportions of participants with a favourable outcome will be calculated in the meropenem arm and in the SOC arm. A favourable outcome is met when an infant:
Is alive
Has resolution or significant improvement of all abnormalities that defined LOS at entry and has no new clinical or laboratory abnormalities requiring a new course of antibiotic therapy
Has microbiological eradication either confirmed or presumed and no new pathogens identified.</description>

    <description>Adverse events will also be summarised according to the need of a specific medical intervention or not. Analyses by time period will also be shown (from D0 to TOC visit and from TOC visit to follow-up). The number of patients experiencing at least one adverse event between D0 and TOC visit will be compared by treatment group.</description>
