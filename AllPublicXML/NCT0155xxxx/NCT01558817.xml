  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Outcomes after in-hospital cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) are very poor, particularly in
      patients with oxygen dependent chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) or metastatic
      cancer. Recent work found that in-hospital CPR is being performed more often before death
      with unchanging survival and that fewer CPR survivors are being discharged home, thus
      suggesting that CPR is increasingly performed without benefit and that the burden of this
      ineffective treatment is increasing. Unlike other medical procedures, CPR has become the
      default provided to all patients even those with tremendously poor outcomes. It is time to
      change the paradigm of CPR. Through comparing an innovative &quot;informed assent&quot; approach toward
      in-hospital CPR (informing patients that their underlying chronic illness makes outcomes of
      CPR so poor that CPR is not performed while allowing them to disagree) versus usual care in a
      group of chronically ill patients with reduced life expectancy, the investigators aspire to
      demonstrate that CPR delivery can be reduced. And in addition that DNR status increases,
      while preserving patient quality of life and decreasing the burden of this ineffective
      treatment to both patients and families. If effective, this informed assent intervention has
      the potential to revolutionize how the investigators discuss CPR with the investigators
      chronically ill patients.

    <time_frame>Within couple of hours (up to 2 weeks) after intervention</time_frame>
    <description>The following questions will be asked:
How helpful was this approach to discussing CPR with respect to CPR decisions?
Would you recommend this approach to discussing CPR for other patients who have serious illnesses?</description>

    <measure>Assessment of DNR status change or intervention follow-up from primary physician</measure>
    <time_frame>Three months after the intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Contact the physician for each patient at 3 months after the study visit to determine whether there are changes in the DNR status or if the physician has talked with the patients about the status since the study visit.</description>
