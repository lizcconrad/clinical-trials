      Influenza Virus Vaccine (Split Virion, Inactivated) that do not contain Preservative. HA
      contents 7.5μg/0.5ml per dose include H1N1、H3N2 and B.

      Inactivated Split Influenza Vaccine was manufactured by Sanofi Pasteur HA contents
      7.5μg/0.5ml per dose include H1N1、H3N2 and B.

      This is a randomized, blind phase 3 clinical trial. Total 1200 adults (ages from 6 months to
      36 months ) were selected, randomized to two groups [Influenza Virus Vaccine (Split Virion,
      Inactivated) and Inactivated Split Influenza Vaccine , each group n=600], adults in each
      group will be vaccinated with two doses of either Influenza Virus Vaccine (Split Virion,
      Inactivated) or Sanof IVV respectively,21 days apart.
