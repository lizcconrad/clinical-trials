  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the concentration of JNJ-39393406 achieved in the
      blood and cerebrospinal fluid of healthy adult volunteers following administration of a
      single dose of JNJ-39393406.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-centre, double-blind (neither physician nor patient knows the name of the
      assigned treatment), single dose study of JNJ-39393406 or placebo (a treatment identical in
      appearance to JNJ-39393406 but does not contain active drug) in healthy adult volunteers. The
      study consists of an eligibility screening examination (between 21 and 2 days prior to dose
      administration), a double-blind treatment period, and a follow-up examination (minimally 7
      and maximally 14 days after the dose administration). For each volunteer, the maximal study
      duration will not exceed 6 weeks. JNJ-39393406 or placebo will be administered as a single
      200-mg dose on Day 1 as a liquid nanosuspension (a formulation used to improve the solubility
      of the drug) with 240 mL (approximately 8 ounces or 1 cup) noncarbonated water between 8:00
      AM and 10:30 AM after a standard breakfast has been consumed (following a fast [not eating
      food] of at least 10 hours). Volunteers will then fast until approximately 4 hours after
      taking JNJ-3939406 or placebo after which lunch will be served.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Female volunteers must be postmenopausal (for at least 12 months)

          -  Body mass index (BMI) between 18 and 29.9 kg/m2, inclusive

          -  Healthy on the basis of physical examination, neurological examination, medical
             history, vital signs, and 12-lead ECG [including QTcB interval duration &lt;450 msec]
             performed at screening. Minor deviations in ECG, which are not considered to be of
             clinical significance to the investigator, are acceptable

          -  Healthy on the basis of clinical laboratory tests performed at screening. If the
             results of the serum chemistry panel [including liver enzymes], hematology, or
             urinalysis are outside the normal reference ranges, the volunteer may be included only
             if the investigator judges the abnormalities or deviations from normal to be not
             clinically significant

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  History of liver or renal insufficiency

          -  significant cardiac, vascular, pulmonary, gastrointestinal, endocrine, neurologic,
             hematologic, rheumatologic, psychiatric, or metabolic disturbances

          -  Relevant history of or current neurological disease including any history of post
             dural puncture headache, lower back pain or scoliosis and/or major (lumbar) back
             surgery, spontaneous, prolonged or severe bleeding with unclear origin, epilepsy or
             fits or unexplained black-outs

          -  History or family history of abnormal bleeding or of blood clotting or anemia
