  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Asthma is a chronic inflammatory bronchial disorder with three distinct components: airway
      hyper-responsiveness (respiratory hypersensitivity), airway inflammation, and intermittent
      airway obstruction. One of the characteristics of the disease is an inflammatory reaction of
      the immune system caused by cytokine production. A substantial number of asthma patients do
      not satisfactorily respond to steroid therapy and consequently have an unmet medical need for
      novel targeted therapies with improved specificity, tolerability, and compliance.

      Novel therapeutic strategies for the treatment of chronic inflammatory diseases by targeting
      early disease-causing mechanisms are a promising approach for the treatment of asthma. The
      transcription factor GATA-3 plays a key role in mediating the asthmatic immune response and
      has been shown to be necessary and sufficient for the production of cytokines interleukin
      (IL)-4, IL-5, and IL-13. The active principle hgd40 of the investigational medicinal product
      SB010 belongs to a new class of antisense oligonucleotide therapeutics, the 10-23 DNA
      (deoxyribonucleic acid)zymes (antisense oligonucleotide). DNAzymes are catalytically active
      nucleic acids that cleave complementary RNA (ribonucleic acid) molecules. By cleaving GATA-3
      mRNA, hgd40 reduces specific cytokine production and thereby reduces key features of allergic
      airway inflammation.

      DNAzymes are generated completely by chemical synthesis and can be produced under Good
      Manufacturing Practice (GMP) controlled conditions. The DNAzymes are not biological drugs,
      i.e. they are not generated by use of any living organism including cell culture or bacteria.
      The molecules are highly water-soluble and will be applied as solution directly in their
      synthesized form.

      The current study will evaluate the safety and tolerability of increasing multiple doses of
      inhaled SB010 in healthy male subjects.

    <description>The following pharmacokinetic parameters will be determined over 15 days using plasma samples, after a single dose on Day 1 and after repeated dosing at steady state on Day 12:
Area under the plasma concentration-time curve: from 0 to 12h, over 12h (dosing interval) after the last administration in steady state, and extrapolated to infinity.

    <description>Dose proportionality# after a single dose on Day 1 and after repeated dosing at steady state on Day 12 will be assessed across doses using the power model.
#Dose proportionality implies linear pharmacokinetics. The rates of absorption, distribution, metabolism, and elimination remain constant over the dose range. Thus, plasma concentration, area under the plasma concentration-time curve, maximum plasma concentration, and urinary recovery should increase in direct proportion to the dose.</description>
