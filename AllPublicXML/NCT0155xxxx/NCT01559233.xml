    <textblock>
      Patient demand for non-surgical, non-invasive, and no-downtime wrinkle and rhytides treatment
      procedures has grown dramatically over the past decade as new treatments and technologies
      have been introduced.

      This study was performed in order to evaluate the efficacy and safety of the Invasix FPlus
      System, an innovative noninvasive system intended for wrinkles and rhytides treatment.

      Subjects were treated for face wrinkles and rhytides reduction and followed for 3 months
      after last treatment. In order to evaluate treatment efficacy, pre and post treatment photos
      were introduced to three uninvolved physicians for blinded evaluation.
