  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      People with schizophrenia often have problems with negative symptoms; expressing and
      identifying their emotions, their amount of speech, motivation and interests, feelings of
      purpose, social skills, and experiencing enjoyment. For this reason, new interventions are
      being developed to treat these problems. One new intervention is the Motivation and
      Engagement (MOVE) Program. The MOVE program is a new program which consists of weekly
      meetings for 9 months between a patient and a trainer. The weekly meetings will consist of
      goal setting and organization of the home to make daily tasks more manageable. During the
      weekly meetings the patient and trainer will discuss emotions and the trainer will help the
      patient identify their emotions.

      The researchers hope to learn whether MOVE will help improve the problems. If it works the
      researchers will do a larger study comparing MOVE to other treatments that have addressed
      some of the problems already.

      The therapist will ask you if the sessions can be audio taped to ensure that the therapist is
      doing a helpful job for you. They will also ask if the session can be video taped so that the
      tapes can be used to train other therapists learning about MOVE. The choice to do either of
      these is voluntary and you can continue to participate in the study if you choose not to have
      the session be audio and/or video taped.You will be provided a University Release document to
      provide that permission if you so choose.

    <description>MOVE Program group: MOVE consists of medication follow-up at the CHCS or ATCMHMR and meeting once a week for 9 months with a MOVE trainer in your home. You and your trainer will work on interviews for the first three visits that will talk about negative symptoms, thoughts, attitudes, and social skills that will help each of you develop goals together. Activities will be developed around improving initiation, enjoyment, success and outcome. These activities will be customized to you and will change based on your needs weekly throughout the 9 months</description>
