      The purpose of this study is to determine whether radio-frequency (RF)-based plasma
      micro-tenotomy has a positive effective for the treatment of shoulder impingement syndrome
      with cuff tendinosis. Eighty patients with impingement syndrome and cuff tendinosis that
      treated arthroscopic were enrolled in the study. Patients were randomly assigned to receive
      either arthroscopic subacromial decompression alone (ASD group, n=40) or arthroscopic
      subacromial decompression combined with RF-based plasma micro-tenotomy (RF group, n=40).
      Clinical outcome data including VAS(Visual Analogue Scale) pain score, Shoulder range of
      motion (ROM), ASES(American Shoulder And Elbow Surgeons) score, UCLA(University of
      California, Los Angeles) score, Constant-Murley score and SST(Simple Shoulder Test) score
      were recorded preoperatively and at postoperative 3-week, 6-week, 3-month, 6-month and
      1-year.

    <description>A thorough subacromial decompression was performed as described by Neer (which include coracoacromial ligament resection, excision of the anterio-lateral tip of the acromion and thorough debridement of the bursa).an additional bipolar RF-based device (TOPAZ, Arthrocare, Austin, TX) connected to a System2000 generator (Arthrocare, Austin, TX) was used to perform the micro-tenotomy. The device functions using a controlled plasma-mediated RF-based process (Co-ablation).The device was placed on the tendon perpendicular to its surface, for 500 milliseconds, and micro-debridement was performed at 5-mm intervals by a 2-row fashion, which covered most of the foot-print region of the supraspinatous tendon and at a depth of 3 to 5 mm</description>
