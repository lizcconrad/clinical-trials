      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of a Global Postural Reeducation
      (GPR) program in subjects with chronic low back pain.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Approximately 80-85% of individuals will experience low back pain during their lifetime. It
      is one of the major concerns of current health care. There is evidence for the effectiveness
      of exercise therapy in patients with chronic low back pain. GPR is a physical therapy method
      developed in France by Philippe Emmanuel Souchard. Although this method is largely used as
      form of treatment in most countries, few studies showed its clinical effectiveness in chronic
      low back pain. This is the first randomized controlled trial, with assessor blind that
      evaluate the GPR effects in chronic low back pain. All outcome measurements are reliability,
      validated and sensitivity for statistical changes using the Visual Analogic Scale- VAS
      (0-10cm), Roland Morris Questionary, SF36 (Quality Life Questionary) and Beck Scale
      (Depression Symptoms).

    <description>The participants, after obtaining a written informed consent, were randomized for one of the two groups: In the Global Postural Reeducation group (GPR), they were submitted 1 time per week, during 12 weeks, at GPR sessions. The duration of sessions was 60 minutes each, with the same physical Therapist of the study. After the intervention, subjects returned to assessment 3 months after, with the blinded assessor. All the 6 postures from GPR were used during the study. All outcomes measurements, in both groups, were validated for Portuguese language and applicable at baseline, 3 months and 6 months after baseline.</description>

    <description>In the control group, no physical intervention was given during the study. After the study, 6 months after, all participants from control group received the same treatment given in GPR group, according to the Unifesp Ethics Committee orientations. All participants, of both groups, have a doctor from the study, if necessary.</description>
