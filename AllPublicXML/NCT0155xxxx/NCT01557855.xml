  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to collect data on the commercial use of Corus CAD
      (Age/Sex/Gene Expression score - ASGES) blood test to evaluate the clinical referral patterns
      of Primary Care Physicians after receipt of their patients' Corus Score, and to better
      understand patient management patterns for clinicians ordering the test.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, multicenter observational registry collecting and analyzing commercial
      utilization data of the Corus CAD assay (&quot;Test&quot;) also known as Age/Sex/Gene Expression score
      (ASGES) . The study will prospectively enroll approximately 670 evaluable subjects from
      qualified sites and evaluate the rate of referral versus Corus CAD (ASGES) score as
      continuous variables.

      Objective of the study is to assess whether the score provided by the Corus CAD (Age/Sex/Gene
      Expression score - ASGES) test has an effect on the Primary Care Physician's patient
      management and referral patterns once received:

        1. No further cardiac testing or treatment

        2. Medical therapy for angina or non-cardiac chest pain

        3. Referral to a cardiologist for stress testing with or without imaging, CT angiography,
           or invasive cardiac catheterization.

      Since it takes approximately two days for the physician to receive the result of the Corus
      CAD (Age/Sex/Gene Expression score - ASGES) , initial diagnostic testing will reflect local
      standard of care.
