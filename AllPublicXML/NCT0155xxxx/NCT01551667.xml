  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to detect differences in anti-S. aureus antibody
      assays (IgM, IgA, IgG and its subclasses) between (1) a group of patients with bacteremia due
      to a chronic wound (cases) and (2) a group of patients with localized chronic wound
      infections (control).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Secondary objectives include:

        -  To propose a diagnostic marker of bacteraemia based on the detection of anti-S. aureus
           by xMAP technology

        -  To evaluate the kinetics of the humoral immune response to S. aureus in patients with
           bacteraemia

        -  To evaluate the virulence of S. aureus isolated from chronic, infected wounds

        -  To enrich the Nîmes University Hospital biobank

        -  To evaluate the prevalence of different antibodies within each group
