  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Subjects have a type of lymph gland disease called Hodgkin or non-Hodgkin Lymphoma or
      T/NK-lymphoproliferative disease or severe chronic active Epstein Barr Virus (CAEBV) which
      has come back, is at risk of coming back, or has not gone away after treatment, including the
      best treatment we know for these diseases.

      Some patients with Lymphoma or T/NK-lymphoproliferative disease or CAEBV show signs of virus
      that is called Epstein Barr virus (EBV) that causes mononucleosis or glandular fever (&quot;mono&quot;
      or the &quot;kissing disease&quot;) before or at the time of their diagnosis. EBV is found in the
      cancer cells of up to half the patients with HD and NHL, suggesting that it may play a role
      in causing Lymphoma. The cancer cells (in lymphoma) and some immune system cells (in CAEBV)
      infected by EBV are able to hide from the body's immune system and escape destruction. We
      want to see if special white blood cells, called GRALE T cells, that have been trained to
      kill EBV infected cells can survive in the blood and affect the tumor.

      We have used this sort of therapy to treat a different type of cancer that occurs after bone
      marrow or solid organ transplant called post transplant lymphoma. In this type of cancer the
      tumor cells have 9 proteins made by EBV on their surface. We grew T cells in the lab that
      recognized all 9 proteins and were able to successfully prevent and treat post transplant
      lymphoma. However, in HD and NHL, T/NK-lymphoproliferative disease, and CAEBV, the tumor
      cells and B cells only express 4 EBV proteins. In a previous study, we made T cells that
      recognized all 9 proteins and gave them to patients with HD. Some patients had a partial
      response to this therapy but no patients had a complete response. We then did follow up
      studies where we made T cells that recognized the 2 EBV proteins seen in patients with
      lymphoma, T/NK-lymphoproliferative disease and CAEBV. Those proteins are called LMP-1 and
      LMP-2. The cells are called LMP-specific cytotoxic T-Lymphocytes (CTLs). We have treated over
      45 people on those studies. About 63% of those patients who had disease at the time they got
      the cells had responses including some patients with complete responses. This study will
      expand on those results and we will try and make the T cells in the lab in a simpler faster
      way. We will also make T cells that will still see the LMP proteins but also 2 other EBV
      proteins called EBNA-1 and BARF. These cells are called GRALE T cells. These GRALE CTLs are
      an investigational product not approved by the FDA.

      The purpose of this study is to find the largest safe dose of LMP-specific cytotoxic GRALE T
      cells created using this new manufacturing technique. We will learn what the side effects are
      and to see whether this therapy might help patients with HD or NHL or EBV associated
      T/NK-lymphoproliferative disease or CAEBV.

      Subjects (or their syngeneic donor) will give blood for investigators to make
      LMP/BARF1/EBNA-1 (GRALE) CTLs in the lab. These cells will be grown and frozen for the
      subject.

      Patients will be started on the lowest dose (1 of 3 different levels) of GRALE T cells. Once
      that dose schedule proves safe, the next group of patients will be started at a higher dose.
      This process will continue until all 3 dose levels are studied. If the side effects are too
      severe, the dose will be lowered or the GRALE T cell injections will be stopped.

      The GRALE T cells will then be thawed and injected into the subject over 2-10 minutes.
      Initially, two doses of GRALE T cells will be given 2 weeks apart.

      If after the 2nd infusion there is a reduction in the size of the lymphoma on CT or MRI scan
      as assessed by a radiologist, the subject can receive additional doses of the GRALE T cells
      if they wish (up to 6 times). Follow up testing will be collected just like after the 1st
      infusion.

      All of the treatments will be given by the Center for Cell and Gene Therapy at Texas
      Children's Hospital or Houston Methodist Hospital.

      We will follow the subjects after the injections. They will either be seen in the clinic or
      the subject will be contacted by a research nurse yearly for 5 years.

      If they receive additional doses of the GRALE T cells as described above, they will be
      followed until 5 years after the last dose of GRALE T-cells.
