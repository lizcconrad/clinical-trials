      Primary Objective:

      - To investigate the efficacy on skin manifestation of 16 weeks treatment of once daily
      regimen of hydroxychloroquine sulphate (HCQ) in patients with cutaneous lupus erythematosus
      (CLE) and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) with active skin manifestation (CLASI [Cutaneous
      Lupus Erythematosus Disease Area and Severity Index] activity score is ≥4) concomitant
      treatment with or without corticosteroid.

      Secondary Objectives:

        -  To evaluate the efficacy on skin manifestation and the safety of 16 weeks treatment of
           once daily regiment of HCQ versus placebo as the reference group in patients with CLE
           and SLE with active skin manifestation (CLASI activity score is ≥4) concomitant
           treatment with or without corticosteroid.

        -  To investigate the safety of 16 weeks treatment of once daily regiment of HCQ in
           patients with CLE and SLE with active skin manifestation concomitant treatment with or
           without corticosteroid.

        -  To investigate the safety and efficacy of 52 weeks long-term treatment of once daily
           regimen of HCQ in patients with CLE and SLE - To investigate the influence of the dose
           reduction of corticosteroid on CLE and SLE patients treated with HCQ concomitant with
           corticosteroid

        -  To investigate efficacy of once daily regimen of HCQ on systemic symptoms,
           musculoskeletal symptoms and immunological parameters in SLE patients.
