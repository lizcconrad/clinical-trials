  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase I/II trial studies the side effects, maximum tolerated dose, and effectiveness of
      paclitaxel albumin-stabilized nanoparticle formulation (nab-paclitaxel) in treating patients
      with recurrent or refractory Hodgkin or B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma. More effective and well
      tolerated therapies are needed to treat patients with relapsed and refractory lymphomas.
      Nab-paclitaxel combines a chemotherapeutic agent with a protein which may increase the
      anticancer drug concentration in the tumor while reducing toxic effects in normal tissue and
      may be an effective treatment for lymphoma.
