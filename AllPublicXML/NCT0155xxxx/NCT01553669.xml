      The primary hypothesis is, comparing with the control group, reminiscence therapy is
      significantly and clinically effective to improve the experiment group's depressive symptoms
      after six weeks therapy, and the efficacy can be maintained on the three months follow-up.

      The secondary hypothesis is, comparing with the control group, reminiscence therapy
      significantly reduce the loneliness and increase the self-esteem and life satisfaction of the
      experiment group.

      The subjects who are arranged to the experiment group will be intervened using the
      reminiscence therapy manual proposed by Watt and Cappeliez (2000). According to the manual,
      the group consisted of six weekly sessions of 90 min each. During each weekly session, the
      memories recalled focused on a different theme.

      Data collection will occur on screening (as for baseline or pre-test), after intervention
      immediately (as for post-test), and three months after the intervention (as for follow-up).
      And outcome measures use standardized instruments with demonstrated validity and reliability:

      Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS) Rosenberg self-esteem scale (SES) Life Satisfaction Index A
      (LSI-A) Russell's UCLA Loneliness Scale
