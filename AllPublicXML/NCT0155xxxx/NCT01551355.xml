    <textblock>
      As part of the Colombian Hearty Health Initiative program led by Mount Sinai Cardiovascular
      Institute, a multidisciplinary team design and implemented a pedagogic and communication
      strategies for the promotion of healthy heart habits (PPHH) in preschoolers. This included
      educational materials, pedagogical activities and the use of Sesame Workshop healthy habits
      for life materials. For Colombia, the latter were largely developed in collaboration with the
      Colombian Society of Pediatrics, Colombian Society of Cardiology and Cardiovascular Surgery,
      Colsubsidio and Fundación Cardioinfantil-Instituto de Cardiología.

      Background Increased levels of risk factors during childhood create an important life-long
      burden that favors the development of cardiovascular (CVD) disease in adulthood.
      Epidemiologic studies have demonstrated that cardiovascular disease risk factors are
      identifiable in childhood and persist through to adulthood. It is unknown whether
      interventions targeting preschoolers may change knowledge, attitudes and habits (KAH) towards
      healthy lifestyles and, eventually, reduce the burden of CVD.

      The goal of the proposed study is to assess over a five month intervention period, the impact
      of an educational intervention on preschooler's knowledge of, habits and attitudes towards
      healthy eating and living an active lifestyle. The impact of the intervention will be also
      assessed in parents and teachers.

      Methods The investigators will conduct a cluster, randomized controlled trial in 1216
      pre-school children 3 to 5 years of age, 928 parents, and 120 teachers from 14 preschool
      facilities in Bogotá, Colombia in a low socioeconomic and underprivileged community.
      Randomization will occur at the facility level. The intervention will include classroom
      activities and use of printed material (books, posters, teachers' guides, games) and videos.
      Meanwhile, children in the control facilities will continue with their usual curriculum. A
      structured survey will be used at baseline and end of study to evaluate changes in KAH and
      the authors a priori give differential weights (70-20-10, respectively) to the scores to
      compose a standardized weighted total score (WTS). The primary outcome will be the change in
      children's WTS and the secondary outcomes will be the changes in parents' and teachers´ WTS.

      Potential Impact of the Trial If found to be effective in improving the short-term changes in
      knowledge, attitudes and habits, the educational intervention may have the potential to
      influence the children's' diet and physical activity patterns throughout their lifetimes by
      early interventions when attitudes and habits are formed. The program also targets parents
      and teachers who contribute to shape children's attitudes and habits and who are often at
      high risk for health problems associated with unhealthy diet and limited physical activity
      themselves. The program aims to empower local partners in the health, education, media and
      government sectors to build up the capacities to ensure sustainability. If proven efficacious
      in the short term, further evaluative studies should test the hypothesis that this program
      will serve as an effective and sustainable model to improve children's health worldwide.

    <description>Change in weighted knowledge, attitude, habit (KAH) (70/20/10) score among children after 5 months of intervention as compared to prior to intervention.
The study hypothesized that the mean change in knowledge scores associated with this short intervention period would be larger than the mean changes in scores due to attitudes and habits, differential weights (70, 20, and 10, respectively) were given to the scores a priori to compose a standardized weighted total score (WTS).
The developed questionnaires measured knowledge, attitudes, and habits on healthy eating and living an active lifestyle in children, parents, and teachers.
Scale range: 0-100 Knowledge scale range: 0-100 Attitude scale range: 0-100 Habit scale range: 0-100 WTS (weighted total score) scale range: 0-100

        <description>Change in weighted knowledge, attitude, habit (KAH) (70/20/10) score among children after 5 months of intervention as compared to prior to intervention.
The study hypothesized that the mean change in knowledge scores associated with this short intervention period would be larger than the mean changes in scores due to attitudes and habits, differential weights (70, 20, and 10, respectively) were given to the scores a priori to compose a standardized weighted total score (WTS).
The developed questionnaires measured knowledge, attitudes, and habits on healthy eating and living an active lifestyle in children, parents, and teachers.
Scale range: 0-100 Knowledge scale range: 0-100 Attitude scale range: 0-100 Habit scale range: 0-100 WTS (weighted total score) scale range: 0-100
