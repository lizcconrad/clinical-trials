  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The macrolide group of antibiotics can cause QT prolongation, and endanger the patient with
      life threatening arrythmias. QT prolongation caused by Azythromycin, a relatively new
      macrolide, is extremely rare, and was not reported in clinical trials. Our hypothesis is that
      patients hospitalized with severe community acquired pneumonia, usually with multiple
      comorbid conditions will have a higher rate of QT prolongation, compared to the clinical
      trials published

  <detailed_description>

      Patients hospitalized with community aquired pneumonia will have their corrected QT measured
      daily during antibiotic therapy. Concomittant medications and electrolyte abnormalities that
      cause prolonged QT will be recorded
