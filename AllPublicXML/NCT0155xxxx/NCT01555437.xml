      Background: Small bowel Crohn's disease (SBCD) is a chronic relapsing disease, and clinical
      presentation can vary considerably. Patients are frequently assessed by capsule endoscopy
      (CE), which enables direct visualization of small bowel mucosal abnormalities; however, the
      correlations between CE scoring index (CESI), biological markers, and disease activity
      indices remain undefined.

      Methods: A prospective study was conducted between October 2008 and February 2011 on 58
      established SBCD patients and suspected patients who received a definitive SBCD diagnosis
      during study. Patients underwent complete CE, and were scored according to the CESI
      (inactive, &lt;135; mild inflammation, 135-790; moderate-severe inflammation, &gt;790) and
      Harvey-Bradshaw index (HBI). Statistical correlation between CESI, HBI, C-reactive protein
      (CRP), serum albumin, and hemoglobin was assessed. At follow-up (~9 months), 11 of the
      patients underwent CE with scoring for CESI, HBI, and CRP.

      Parameters CESI To calculate the CESI, the small bowel was divided into three tertiles. The
      degree of disease involvement in each tertile was determined by assessing three parameters:
      villous edema, ulceration, and stenosis. Endoscopic remission was defined as CESI of &lt;135.
      Mild inflammation was defined as CESI of 135-790, and moderate-severe inflammation as ≥790.

      HBI HBI was used to assess the clinical disease activity. Patients with HBI &gt;4 were
      considered to have clinically active disease.[7]

      Blood analysis At the time of CE, patients provided a blood sample for measurement of
      hemoglobin, serum CRP, and albumin. Hemoglobin (normal ranges: women, 120-160 g/L and men,
      140-180 g/L), albumin (normal range: 35-55 g/L), and CRP (upper limit of normal: &lt;8 mg/L)
      were determined by routine laboratory tests.
