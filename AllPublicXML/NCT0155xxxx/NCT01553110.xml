  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a study to learn more about the common cold from studying the nasal secretions
      produced during a cold or episode of allergic rhinitis.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study involves collecting and analyzing nasal mucus to see if there are changes in mucus
      properties during the course of a cold or episode of allergic rhinitis. Outcome measures
      include SNOT20 questionnaire, nasal secretion collection, acoustic rhinometry on the fifth
      and fourteenth day of symptoms. The investigators will also collect SNOT20 questionnaires on
      the tenth and twenty-eighth day.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Male and female subjects 12 years of age and older with acute nasal discharge fewer
             than 7 days or a history suggesting nasal allergic symptoms for at least 1 year.

             due to allergic rhinitis. Therapy with bronchodilators, nasal steroids, oral
             corticosteroids in the past 30 days. Therapy with antihistamines, nasal (Neti)
             washings, or decongestants in the past 24 hours. Use of any OTC cold or allergy
             medication 24 hours before study visits requires a 24 hour washout phase
