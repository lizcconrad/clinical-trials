  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Specific immunotherapy, which involves the administration of allergic extracts to patients
      with symptoms of allergic disorder, is the leading therapeutical tool of modern allergology.
      According to the latest studies immunotherapy not only reduces symptoms' severity but also
      may modify the course of allergic disease by reducing the risk of new sensitisations and
      development of more advanced stages of the disease.It has been hypothesized basing on
      clinical observation that perennial immunotherapy is more effective and safer in comparison
      to preseasonal immunotherapy. The aim of the study was to compare the effect of perennial and
      preseasonal immunotherapy on rhinoconjunctivitis symptoms and safety of both treatments.
