  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators want to relate disturbances in first-episode schizophrenic patients in
      (dopaminergic) D2 receptors, brain structure, brain function, and information processing to
      each other and to psychopathology. Additionally, the investigators want to examine the
      influence of D2 receptor blockade on these disturbances. The investigators expect
      disturbances in the dopaminergic system at baseline to correlate with specific structural and
      functional changes and with disruption in information processing as measured with
      psychophysiological and neurocognitive methods - and investigators expect D2 receptor
      blockade to reverse some of the functional and cognitive impairments. The investigators do
      not expect any effect of treatment on brain structure.

      The study is designed as a 4 week case-control follow-up study of 90 FE pt. with SCZ and 90
      controls matched with regard to age, gender, and parental socio-economic status. All subjects
      will be examined with a diagnostic interview (SCAN, Schedule for Clinical Assessment in
      Neuropsychiatry), medical and family history, and physical examination before inclusion. At
      baseline subjects will be examined with single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT),
      MRI, fMRI, psychophysiology, neurocognition. In addition, they will be screened for drugs,
      genetic testing, and ECG. Patients will further be examined with clinical validated rating
      scales to measure psychopathology, subjective well-being, and side-effects. After a period of
      4 weeks all assessments are repeated. During that period patients will be treated with
      amisulpride, while healthy controls will receive no treatment at all. Efficacy of
      antipsychotic treatment will be evaluated after this initial period of 4 weeks. All subjects
      will be re-assessed in the same test battery as mentioned above, except for SPECT and fMRI,
      after a period of 6, 12, and 24 months.
