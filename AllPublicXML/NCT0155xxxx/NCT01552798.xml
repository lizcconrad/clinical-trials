    <textblock>
      The purpose of this trial is to determine if a single, oral dose of a fast release aspirin
      1000 mg provides relief compared to acetaminophen 1000 mg and placebo in subjects with
      tension-type headache pain.

          -  Experiencing over the last year â‰¥ 4 tension type headaches of at least moderate
             intensity per month and with the majority of headaches lasting greater than three

          -  Understand the pain rating scales (as judged by the trial coordinator)

          -  Present with at least moderate headache pain on a 0-10 point numerical rating scale (a
             score of at least 4 on an 11 point scale ranging from 0 to 10) at the Treatment Visit

          -  Onset of pain within three hours of the Treatment Visit

             including the placebo

          -  Use of any immediate release analgesic/anti-pyretic within four hours or use of any
