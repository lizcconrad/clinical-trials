  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to find out if the experimental study agent, baminercept, is
      effective in treating patients with Sjögren's syndrome. The study will also determine if the
      study agent can be safely given to patients with Sjögren's syndrome; examine how it affects
      symptoms of the disease; and attempt to understand how baminercept affects the underlying
      mechanisms of Sjögren's syndrome and the immune system.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Sjögren's syndrome is an autoimmune disorder in which a person's own immune cells attack the
      body's tear and salivary glands. This disease is the second most common autoimmune disorder,
      affects close to four million people in the U.S., and has no known cause. About one-third of
      patients with Sjögren's syndrome have enlarged parotid glands (the largest salivary glands,
      the glands that make saliva); inflammation of organs such as the lungs and joints may also
      occur. There is no known effective treatment other than measures that can relieve symptoms.
      One of the most bothersome symptoms is dryness of the eyes and mouth. Eye drops and saliva
      stimulants (which help make more saliva) are common treatments. When other organs are
      affected, symptoms are treated with corticosteroids (prednisone), non-steroidal
      anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs, such as ibuprofen and naproxen), hydroxychloroquine
      (Plaquenil®) or other medications that suppress the immune system. These drugs may curb or
      kill cells of the immune system, but they are not always helpful, do not cure Sjögren's
      syndrome, and can have many side effects.

    <measure>Change From Screening in Stimulated Whole Salivary Flow at Week 24</measure>
    <time_frame>Screening to Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>After an unstimulated salivary flow assessment the participant was administered a single 5-mg dose of pilocarpine to stimulate saliva production. One hour after the administration of pilocarpine the participant spit into a preweighed 50-cm centrifuge tube for 15 minutes. The sample was weighed to determine the volume (1 g = 1 mL) of saliva. The volume of saliva (mL) was divided by the duration of the test (minutes) to calculate the stimulated salivary flow rate (mL/min). Change from screening was computed as the value at Week 24 minus the screening value. A positive value in change from screening indicates an improvement and a negative value indicates worsening.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) Sjogren's Syndrome Disease Activity Index (ESSDAI) at Week 24</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>The ESSDAI is a clinical index that measures Sjogren's syndrome disease activity. A physician scores the disease activity level of twelve organ-specific domains in 3 or 4 levels according to their severity. For example, for no disease activity the domain score equals 0 and for high disease activity the domain score equals 3 or 4. Each domain is assigned a weight between 1 and 6, and the domain score is multiplied by the domain weight. The sum of the weighted domain scores is the overall score, which can range from 0 to 123. A higher score indicates more disease activity. Change from baseline was computed as the value at Week 24 minus the baseline value. A negative value in change from baseline indicates an improvement and a positive value indicates worsening.</description>

          <description>The ESSDAI is a clinical index that measures Sjogren’s syndrome disease activity. A physician scores the disease activity level of twelve organ-specific domains in 3 or 4 levels according to their severity. For example, for no disease activity the domain score equals 0 and for high disease activity the domain score equals 3 or 4. Each domain is assigned a weight between 1 and 6, and the domain score is multiplied by the domain weight. The sum of the weighted domain scores is the overall score, which can range from 0 to 123. A higher score indicates more disease activity.</description>

        <title>Change From Screening in Stimulated Whole Salivary Flow at Week 48</title>
        <description>After an unstimulated salivary flow assessment the participant was administered a single 5-mg dose of pilocarpine to stimulate saliva production. One hour after the administration of pilocarpine the participant spit into a preweighed 50-cm centrifuge tube for 15 minutes. The sample was weighed to determine the volume (1 g = 1 mL) of saliva. The volume of saliva (mL) was divided by the duration of the test (minutes) to calculate the stimulated salivary flow rate (mL/min). Change from screening was computed as the value at Week 48 minus the screening value. A positive value in change from screening indicates an improvement and a negative value indicates worsening.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) Sjogren’s Syndrome Disease Activity Index (ESSDAI) at Week 24</title>
        <description>The ESSDAI is a clinical index that measures Sjogren’s syndrome disease activity. A physician scores the disease activity level of twelve organ-specific domains in 3 or 4 levels according to their severity. For example, for no disease activity the domain score equals 0 and for high disease activity the domain score equals 3 or 4. Each domain is assigned a weight between 1 and 6, and the domain score is multiplied by the domain weight. The sum of the weighted domain scores is the overall score, which can range from 0 to 123. A higher score indicates more disease activity. Change from baseline was computed as the value at Week 24 minus the baseline value. A negative value in change from baseline indicates an improvement and a positive value indicates worsening.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Visual Analog Scale (VAS) Scores for Sjogren's Syndrome Symptom Survey at Week 24</title>
        <description>On a 100-mm horizontal line the participant places a vertical mark to indicate responses to 14 questions about salivary and ophthalmic function. The range is 0 to 100, with 100 as the highest perceived difficulty, dryness, discomfort, swelling, thirst, dryness, severity, or sensitivity. Change from baseline was computed as the value at Week 24 minus the baseline value. A negative value in change from baseline indicates an improvement and a positive value indicates worsening.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Patient Self-Assessment of Fatigue, Overall Dryness, and Joint Pain at Week 24</title>
        <description>Three Visual Analog Scale (VAS) scores for patient self-assessment of symptoms of overall dryness, fatigue, and joint pain. On a 100-mm horizontal line the participant places a vertical mark to indicate responses to 3 questions. The range is 0 to 100, with 100 as the highest perceived tiredness, dryness, or joint pain. Change from baseline was computed as the value at Week 24 minus the baseline value. A negative value in change from baseline indicates an improvement and a positive value indicates worsening.</description>

A vertical mark made on a 100 mm line rated 0 (no symptoms) to 100 (severe symptoms) determines the score. Change from baseline was computed as the value at Week 48 minus the baseline value. A negative value in change from baseline indicates an improvement and a positive value indicates worsening.</description>
          <population>The Modified Intent-to-Treat with available data population included all randomized subjects who received at least one dose of either baminercept or placebo and who had Patient and Physician Global assessments of Disease Activity at Baseline and Week 48. Data were not available for six participants</population>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Tear Secretion as Measured by Lissamine Green Staining at Week 24</title>
        <description>Lissamine green stain was dropped into the participant's eyes and then an ophthalmologist used a slit lamp to examine the eye surface. Six areas of the eye surface were evaluated and scored from 0 to 3, with 0 being no tear film damage to 3, extensive tear film damage. The scores of all six areas in both eyes were totaled to obtain an overall score between 0 and 18. A higher score indicates insufficient tear flow and excessive dryness. Change from baseline was computed as the value at Week 24 minus the baseline value. A negative value in change from Baseline indicates an improvement and a positive value indicates worsening.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in the Short Form 36 (SF-36) Physical and Mental Health Component Summary Scores (PCS and MCS) at Week 24</title>
        <description>The SF-36 questionnaire completed by the subject measures health-related quality of life across multiple disease states. It has 36 questions with 8 subscale scores and 2 summary scores: PCS=physical functioning, role-physical, bodily pain, and general health; MCS=vitality, social functioning, role-emotional, and mental health. Scoring is done for both subscores and summary scores. For both, 0=worst score (or quality of life) and 100=best score. Summary measures were standardized to have a mean of 50 and a standard deviation of 10 in the 1998 general US population. Change from baseline is computed as the value at Week 24 minus the baseline value. A positive value in change from Baseline indicates an improvement and a negative value indicates worsening.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in the Short Form 36 (SF-36) Physical and Mental Health Component Summary Scores (PCS and MCS) at Week 48</title>
        <description>The SF-36 questionnaire completed by the subject measures health-related quality of life across multiple disease states. It has 36 questions with 8 subscale scores and 2 summary scores: PCS=physical functioning, role-physical, bodily pain, and general health; MCS=vitality, social functioning, role-emotional, and mental health. Scoring is done for both subscores and summary scores. For both, 0=worst score (or quality of life) and 100=best score. Summary measures were standardized to have a mean of 50 and a standard deviation of 10 in the 1998 general US population. Change from baseline is computed as the value at Week 48 minus the baseline value. A positive value in change from Baseline indicates an improvement and a negative value indicates worsening.</description>
