  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to look at the effectiveness of repetitive transcranial magnetic
      stimulation (rTMS) as a therapeutic intervention for patients with schizophrenia. The primary
      outcome is improvement in negative symptoms related to schizophrenia. The investigators are
      focusing on negative symptoms given their greater resistance to pharmacological and other
      established therapies. If the investigators trial were to show beneficial effects, its
      clinical significance would be great.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study builds on the results of a previous phase 1, single-site study in which we
      demonstrated the safety of image-guided theta burst stimulation (TBS) form of rTMS over the
      cerebellar vermis (Demirtas-Tatlidede et al., 2010) in eigh patients with schizophrenia.

      The primary goal of the present study is to assess efficacy of iTBS to the cerebellar vermis
      on positive and negative symptoms of schizophrenia. A second, added goal is to investigate
      the mechanisms of the expected clinical improvement.

      Schizophrenia is a leading cause of mental disability and current treatments still remain
      only partially successful for many patients. Our underlying hypothesis is that modulation of
      the cerebellar vermis may enhance activity of the neural systems that sub-serve cognition and
      emotion, reestablish the disturbed cerebellar regulation in schizophrenic patients, and
      produce clinical improvement.

    <description>Therapeutic efficacy was evaluated with the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) Positive Subscale, a 7 item subscale measuring the presence/absence and severity of positive symptoms of schizophrenia. The minimum score is 7 and the maximum score is 49, with higher values representing greater symptom severity. Change from baseline on the PANSS Positive Subscale can range from -42 to +42; negative values represent an improvement in symptom severity, and positive values represent worsening symptom severity. Therapeutic efficacy was assessed at baseline, after 5 days of treatment, 1 week post treatment, and 3 weeks post treatment.</description>

The minimum score is 16 and the maximum score is 112, with higher values representing greater psychopathology severity. Change from baseline on the PANSS General Subscale can range from -96 to +96; negative values represent an improvement in symptom severity, and positive values represent worsening symptom severity.

    <measure>Change From Baseline on the Clinical Global Impression (CGI) Severity of Illness</measure>
    <time_frame>Before treatment (baseline), last day of treatment (after 5 days of treatment), 1 and 3 weeks post treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Treatment response was evaluated with the Clinical Global Impressions (CGI) Scale, which is comprised of two companion one-item measures that use 7-point scales to evaluate severity of psychopathology and improvement from the initiation of treatment; each component is rated separately and the CGI does not yield a global score. The CGI Severity of Illness is a 7-point subscale in which a clinician rates the severity of the patient's illness at the time of assessment. Ratings range from 1 to 7 and higher values represent more severe psychopathology: 1 indicates a normal and not at all ill patient and 7 indicates among the most extremely ill patients. Change from baseline on the CGI Severity of Illness subscale can range from -6 to +6, with negative values representing an improvement in psychopathology and positive values representing worsening psychopathology. Severity of Illness was assessed at baseline, after 5 days of treatment, 1 week post treatment, and 3 weeks post treatment.</description>

The CGI Global Improvement is a 7-point subscale in which a clinician assesses how much a patient's illness has changed compared to baseline. Ratings range from 1 to 7, with 1 indicating very much improved and 7 indicating very much worse. Change from baseline on the CGI Global Improvement subscale can range from -6 to +6, with negative values representing an improvement in psychopathology and positive values representing worsening psychopathology.

    <measure>Change From Baseline on the Calgary Depression Scale for Schizophrenia</measure>
    <time_frame>Before treatment (baseline), last day of treatment (after 5 days of treatment), 1 and 3 weeks post treatment</time_frame>
    <description>The Calgary Depression Scale for Schizophrenia is a 9-item scale that assesses depressive symptoms in patients with schizophrenia. Each item is rated separately and ratings range from 0 to 3. Higher values represent more severe depressive symptoms: 0 indicates an absent symptom and 3 indicates a severe symptom. The overall Calgary Depression Scale score is computed by summing each item. The total Calgary Depression Scale score ranges from 0 to 27, with higher values representing more severe depression in patients with schizophrenia. Change from baseline on the Calgary Depression Scale can range from -27 to +27, with negative values representing an improvement in depressive symptoms and positive values representing worsening depressive symptom severity. Depression was assessed at baseline, after 5 days of treatment, 1 week post treatment, and 3 weeks post treatment.</description>

        <description>Therapeutic efficacy was evaluated with the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) Positive Subscale, a 7 item subscale measuring the presence/absence and severity of positive symptoms of schizophrenia. The minimum score is 7 and the maximum score is 49, with higher values representing greater symptom severity. Change from baseline on the PANSS Positive Subscale can range from -42 to +42; negative values represent an improvement in symptom severity, and positive values represent worsening symptom severity. Therapeutic efficacy was assessed at baseline, after 5 days of treatment, 1 week post treatment, and 3 weeks post treatment.</description>

        <description>Therapeutic efficacy was evaluated with the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) General Subscale, a 16 item subscale measuring the presence/absence and severity of general psychopathology of schizophrenia. The minimum score is 16 and the maximum score is 112, with higher values representing greater psychopathology severity. Change from baseline on the PANSS General Subscale can range from -96 to +96; negative values represent an improvement in symptom severity, and positive values represent worsening symptom severity. Therapeutic efficacy was assessed at baseline, after 5 days of treatment, 1 week post treatment, and 3 weeks post treatment.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline on the Clinical Global Impression (CGI) Severity of Illness</title>
        <description>Treatment response was evaluated with the Clinical Global Impressions (CGI) Scale, which is comprised of two companion one-item measures that use 7-point scales to evaluate severity of psychopathology and improvement from the initiation of treatment; each component is rated separately and the CGI does not yield a global score. The CGI Severity of Illness is a 7-point subscale in which a clinician rates the severity of the patient’s illness at the time of assessment. Ratings range from 1 to 7 and higher values represent more severe psychopathology: 1 indicates a normal and not at all ill patient and 7 indicates among the most extremely ill patients. Change from baseline on the CGI Severity of Illness subscale can range from -6 to +6, with negative values representing an improvement in psychopathology and positive values representing worsening psychopathology. Severity of Illness was assessed at baseline, after 5 days of treatment, 1 week post treatment, and 3 weeks post treatment.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline on the Calgary Depression Scale for Schizophrenia</title>
        <description>The Calgary Depression Scale for Schizophrenia is a 9-item scale that assesses depressive symptoms in patients with schizophrenia. Each item is rated separately and ratings range from 0 to 3. Higher values represent more severe depressive symptoms: 0 indicates an absent symptom and 3 indicates a severe symptom. The overall Calgary Depression Scale score is computed by summing each item. The total Calgary Depression Scale score ranges from 0 to 27, with higher values representing more severe depression in patients with schizophrenia. Change from baseline on the Calgary Depression Scale can range from -27 to +27, with negative values representing an improvement in depressive symptoms and positive values representing worsening depressive symptom severity. Depression was assessed at baseline, after 5 days of treatment, 1 week post treatment, and 3 weeks post treatment.</description>
