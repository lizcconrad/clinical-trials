  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase I-II multicenter international trial is designed to study the pharmacokinetics of
      meropenem and to characterize the safety profile of meropenem in the treatment of infants ≤
      90 days of postnatal age with probable or confirmed bacterial meningitis.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective will be to study the pharmacokinetics (plasma and cerebrospinal fluid)
      of meropenem in infants ≤ 90 days of postnatal age with probable or confirmed bacterial
      meningitis and to characterize the safety profile of meropenem in the treatment of infants ≤
      90 days of postnatal age with probable or confirmed bacterial meningitis.

      The secondary objectives are :

        -  To describe the efficacy of meropenem on day 3, at end of allocated treatment (EOAT), at
           test of cure (TOC) and at follow up (FU).

        -  To evaluate survival at FU

        -  To evaluate further episodes of meningitis (relapse or new infection) occurring between
           TOC and FU visits

        -  To define the organisms causing neonatal meningitis

        -  To describe the antibacterial susceptibility of meningitis-causing organisms and to
           describe the clinical and microbiological response according to this

        -  To evaluate mucosal colonization by resistant organisms before and after treatment with
           meropenem

        -  To evaluate bacterial eradication

        -  To evaluate functional genetic parameters that may affect response to therapy
