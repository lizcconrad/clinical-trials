      Open label, two part, Phase 1 dose escalation study to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity
      of repeat dose vaccination with ONT-10 in patients with previously treated Stage 3 or 4 solid
      tumors. Part 1 to evaluate escalating dose levels of ONT-10 administered subcutaneously every
      two weeks (Q2W) or weekly (QW) over 8 weeks. Part 2 evaluates the safety, immunogenicity, and
      potential anti-tumor activity of ONT-10 administered over 8 weeks at the Q2W and QW maximum
      tolerated does/recommended dose (MTD/RD) in cohorts of 15 patients each.

      This open label, two part, Phase 1 dose escalation study will evaluate the safety and
      immunogenicity of repeat dose vaccination with ONT-10 in patients with previously treated
      Stage 3 or 4 solid tumors with histologies that have been associated with expression of the
      MUC1 antigen as described in the medical literature. Part 1 will evaluate escalating dose
      levels of ONT-10 administered subcutaneously Q2W over 8 weeks (for a total of 4 doses) or QW
      over 8 weeks (for a total of 8 doses) to identify a MTD and/or RD for each dosing schedule,
      for further evaluation in Part 2 of the study. Part 2 will evaluate the safety,
      immunogenicity, and potential anti-tumor activity of ONT-10 administered over 8 weeks at the
      Q2W and QW MTD/RD in cohorts of 15 patients each.
