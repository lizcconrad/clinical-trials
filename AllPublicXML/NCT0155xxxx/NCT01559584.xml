  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Alopecia areata (AA) is a disease of the hair follicles with multifactorial etiology and a
      strong component of autoimmune origin. It is characterized by non-scarring hair loss on the
      scalp or any hair-bearing surface.

      Various therapeutic agents have been described for the treatment of AA, but none are curative
      or preventive. The aim of AA treatment is to suppress the activity of the disease.
      Phototherapy in the form of topical psoralen and ultraviolet A (PUVA) has been a well
      documented therapy for AA since 1978.

      A more recent technique of topical PUVA, namely phototoxic PUVA, has been adopted in two
      previous studies. Sessions were carried out once every 3 months, and a higher efficacy with
      more encouraging response rates in comparison to the conventional PUVA therapy has been
      documented. This assumed upper hand over the conventional PUVA might be due to increasing the
      amount of UV reaching the hair follicle cells and the surrounding inflammatory cells. Also it
      has been suggested that it might play a role as a powerful initiating agent of suppression
      through direct action at the DNA level. However, still the exact effect of this treatment has
      not been fully clarified.
