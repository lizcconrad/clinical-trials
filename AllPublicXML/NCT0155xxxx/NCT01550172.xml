      The purpose of the study is to determine whether a combined intervention of a night home
      monitoring system and cognitive-behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBTi) is effective in
      improving sleep in dementia caregivers who arise at night.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Informal caregivers provide the majority of care for chronically ill adults, including
      persons with dementia. While these individuals provide a great benefit to the chronically ill
      relative, being a caregiver is associated with deleterious health consequences, including
      premature mortality and higher rates of coronary heart disease (CHD). Another common
      complaint among dementia caregivers is poor sleep, which has been connected to premature
      mortality and higher rates of CHD in noncaregiving adults. Currently no sleep therapies are
      empirically validated as effective for caregivers of persons with dementia (PWD), and since
      PWD often arise at night, improving caregiver sleep could be potentially hazardous as a
      sleeping caregiver cannot provide supervision during night awakenings. Our primary purpose is
      thus to determine whether a combined intervention is effective in improving sleep in
      caregivers of PWD who arise at night. The intervention consists of a night home monitoring
      system that provides reliable alerts to caregivers when PWD leave the bed and move through
      the house. While this system improved home safety for PWD, it did not affect caregiver sleep,
      so a more traditional sleep therapy will be added—cognitive-behavioral therapy for insomnia.
      In the proposed study, experimental participants will receive the night home monitoring
      system + CBTi; active comparator participants will receive the night home monitoring system
      and sleep behavioral therapy. Participants will remain in the study for 29 weeks, with 4 data
      collection points. We hypothesize experimental participants will have less time awake after
      going to bed, and improved sleep efficiency (percent time asleep while in bed). Sleep data
      will be collected for multiple nights using actigraphy and sleep diary. Our secondary
      research questions focus on the relationship between poor sleep and CHD. Both in adults and
      in dementia caregivers, there appears to be a link between poor sleep and abnormal levels on
      coronary heart disease biomarkers, and likely an increase in CHD with poor sleep. We aim to
      further explore this relationship as well as determine whether levels of biomarkers improve
      with improved sleep from the intervention. We propose to draw blood samples at 4 data
      collection points and measure a set of biomarkers indicative of CHD.

    <measure>Total Wake Time (TWT)</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 27-28</time_frame>
    <description>Actigraphy, using the Actiwatch2, will be used to measure objective sleep; We will collect data for 14-day periods using a 30-second epoch length to accurately capture night-to-night variability.
Subjects will also complete a sleep diary for each day of actigraphic data collection, which will provide subjective sleep values of TWT. Data collected include bedtime, sleep start, number awakenings, minutes awake during night, wake time, out-of-bed time, minutes spent napping the previous day, and a sleep quality rating.</description>

    <measure>Nighttime Injuries</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 27-28</time_frame>
    <description>The Caregiver will be asked about any PWD injuries that occurred since the last data collection point. Injuries will be coded according to the American National Standards method of recording injuries. The following data are collected: nature of injury; part of the body affected; object, substance, exposure, or bodily motion that caused the injury; event that directly resulted in the injury; and time and place of the injury's occurrence. An injury will be considered nighttime if the caregiver reported being asleep at the time the injury occurred.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>D-Dimer Levels</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 27</time_frame>
    <description>D-Dimer is a marker of coagulation activation and has been associated with coronary events. It has also been inversely associated with wake after sleep onset as well as poor sleep quality and low sleep efficiency. D-dimer is a byproduct of fibrinolysis which remains after a blood clot has been degraded. It consists of two cross linked fragments of fibrinogen. Elevated levels of D-dimer are a marker of thrombosis, as it might occur along atherosclerotic plaques in coronary blood vessels. D-dimer will be measured by monoclonal sandwich ELISA, which measures in the 3.9 - 250 ng/ml range.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Tissue Plasminogen Activator Levels</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 27</time_frame>
    <description>Tissue Plasminogen Activator is an endothelial lining protein that catalyzes the conversion of plasminogen into plasmin, which is responsible for the degradation of fibrin into soluble degradation products. Caregivers of PWD showed higher levels of TPA. A meta-analysis of cardiovascular disease risk and TPA indicated that levels greater than 13.5 ng/ml increased CVD risk by 50%.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>C-reactive Protein (CRP) Levels</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 27</time_frame>
    <description>C-reactive protein (CRP) is a non-specific marker of inflammation shown in many studies to be elevated in AD caregivers and to be associated with poor sleep. High sensitivity CRP levels are consistently and independently associated with increased risk of cardiovascular events. HS-CRP will be measured by an ELISA.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Intercellular Adhesion Molecule-1 (ICAM-1)</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 27</time_frame>
    <description>Intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) is found in leukocytes and endothelium and is involved in adhesion of leukocytes to and through the endothelium. ICAM-1 is stimulated by the proinflammatory cytokines. ICAM-1 may participate in atherogenesis by increasing monocyte transmigration into the arterial intima.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>IL-6, and TNFα Levels</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 27</time_frame>
    <description>It is becoming apparent that sleep and immunity are strongly related and that impairments in sleep increase these circulating cytokine levels. Further, caregivers of Alzheimer's patients show both impaired sleep and elevated IL-6 and TNF-α. Levels of IL-6, IL-1, and TNF-α are partially controlled by sleep, and also regulate sleep and many aspects of the immune response. IL-6 and TNF-α are central mediators in the inflammatory process by regulating acute phase and coagulation protein, and inflammation plays a central role in the development and instability of atherosclerotic plaques.</description>
