  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to describe and compare plasmatic anti-proteasome
      auto-antibody concentrations among three distinct groups: (1) patients suffering from bullous
      pemphigoide; (2) patients suffering from other dermatological auto-immune diseases; (3) an
      elderly control group.

    <textblock>
      The secondary objectives of this study are:

      To compare the following parameters between the 3 groups:

        -  plasmatic proteasome concentrations

        -  plasmatic proteasome proteolytic activity

      To explore the potential relationships between:

        -  plasmatic proteasome concentrations

        -  plasmatic proteasome proteolytic activity

        -  plasmatic anti-proteasome auto-antibody concentrations

        -  measures of disease severity for dermatological auto-immune diseases

      To characterize plasmatic anti-proteasome auto-antibodies in patients suffering from bullous
      pemphigoide and other dermatological auto-immune diseases (other bullous auto immune
      diseases: pemphigus, cutaneous lupus, ...).

      To characterize the expression and the activity of proteasomes in skin samples, in plasma and
      in circulating mononuclear cells in patients with bullous pemphigoide.

        previous group and (3) 30 patients with other dermatological auto-immune disease (15
