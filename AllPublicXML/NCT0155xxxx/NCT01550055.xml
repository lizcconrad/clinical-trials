  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this study is to evaluate the clinical response and safety of
      cetuximab plus irinotecan synchronously/subsequently in patients with KRAS wild-type
      metastatic colorectal cancer

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      CMAB009 is a recombinant, human/mouse chimeric monoclonal antibody (mAb) that binds
      specifically to the extracellular domain of EGFR. It is composed of the Fv regions of a
      murine anti-EGFR antibody with human IgG1 heavy and k light chain constant regions and it is
      expressed by Chinese hamster ovary cells. It is a biosimilar of cetuximab (C225, Erbitux®)
      and it is developed by Shanghai Zhangjiang Biotechnology Limited Company and produced by
      Biomabs. Phase I study results suggest that CMAB009 showed well-tolerated safety profile and
      primary efficacy. This multicenter, open-label study was to determine whether adding
      cetuximab (CMAB009) to irinotecan increased the response rate and prolongs survival in
      patients with KRAS wild-type metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) previously treated with
      fluoropyrimidine and oxaliplatin.
