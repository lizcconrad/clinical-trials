  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators hypotheses is that the consumption of the investigators vitamin D fortified
      cheese will result in an increase in serum 25-hydroxy vitamin D levels in older
      institutionalized adults. Also, the consumption of the cheese with the higher amount of
      vitamin D will result in an improvement in wellbeing scores.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The institute of medicine increased the dietary reference intakes of vitamin D for all of the
      age groups. The Recommended Daily Allowance (RDA) is now 800 IU for older adults over the age
      of 70, and the Tolerable Upper Level (UL) is 4000 IU daily. Canadians are known to have an
      inadequate vitamin D status, and older institutionalized adults are particularly susceptible
      to this. One strategy to correct this is to fortify more kinds of foods with vitamin D. We
      have already demonstrated that we can get vitamin D into cheddar cheese and it is as
      biologically available as vitamin D in the liquid supplement.

      This new project aims to optimize the fortification process and deliver all of the vitamin D
      into cheddar cheese, and to measure its bioavailability and related changes in well-being
      during winter. We will assess the well being of the older institutionalized adults by
      administering the SF-36v2 health survey.

    <measure>The bioavailability of vitamin D from cheddar cheese fortified with vitamin D, in older institutionalized adults</measure>
    <time_frame>2 months</time_frame>
    <description>We are adminstering 2 doses of vitamin D fortified cheese. One cheese contains a higher 28,000 IU/week dose that we expect to see health benefits with. The other cheese contains a 200IU/week dose that is similar to the current milk fortification practice in Canada (100IU per serving).</description>

    <measure>A change in wellbeing scores using an SF-36 survey in the older institutionalized adults</measure>
    <time_frame>2 months</time_frame>
    <description>We have previously shown that a group of adults showed an improvement in their wellbeing scores after the consumption of 28,000 IU/week of vitamin D during the winter months. Therefore, we will assess whether well-being changes in older institutionalized adults after the consumption of the vitamin D fortifed cheese, by using an SF-36 well-being survey.</description>
