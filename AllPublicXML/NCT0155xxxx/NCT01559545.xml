  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Clostridium difficile bacteria can be a cause of significant diarrheal disease, particularly
      in people who have taken potent antibiotics. When C. difficile multiplies within the colon,
      it produces two toxins that cause inflammation and resultant abdominal pain, fever and
      diarrhea. Current treatment of mild to moderate disease is with immediate release
      metronidazole, an antibiotic that kills C. difficile. Dr. Reddy's Laboratories has developed
      a delayed release form of metronidazole to release just before the colon to increase the
      concentration of antibiotic in the colon to improve the effectiveness of metronidazole
      treatment and potentially to allow less whole body exposure to the antibiotic.

      This study will measure the amount of metronidazole in the blood and stool of patients with
      C. difficile associated diarrhea (CDAD) to confirm that the new formulations are releasing
      the antibiotic as designed, immediately before the colon.

             C.difficile toxin (by ELISA).

          3. Either a first episode of CDAD or a first recurrence (patients with more than 1
