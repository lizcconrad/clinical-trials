  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators recently completed a phase I study of intravenous ascorbic acid (IV AA)
      plus standard chemotherapy (gemcitabine and erlotinib) in patients with metastatic pancreatic
      cancer. The investigators determined that the target ceiling dosage of 100 grams of ascorbic
      acid is safe when given with the chemotherapy. This Phase II trial is an initial test of
      efficacy of the 100 gram dose of ascorbic acid, which will be given with the same standard
      chemotherapy. This open label study will recruit up to 35 subjects with metastatic pancreatic
      cancer who will receive ascorbic acid combined with gemcitabine and erlotinib as front-line
      treatment. The phase I data suggests that ascorbic acid when given in combination with
      gemcitabine and erlotinib may result in some tumor response, and the goal of this study is to
      better evaluate the response and confirm initial safety data

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Intravenous high dose ascorbic acid is a widely used alternative cancer treatment. Patients
      will receive standard care gemcitabine/erlotinib for treatment of their metastatic pancreatic
      adenocarcinoma. They will be closely monitored for disease response/ progression. If vitamin
      C has a beneficial effect on tumour cells, patients may experience a regression of tumor or
      tumor markers. Additional benefits include scans at no charge to the patient. This study
      requires several days of treatment per week and treatments are given in two different
      locations. The intravenous vitamin C treatments are given 3 times per week, these are given
      every week for an initial cycle of 15 weeks.

    <description>Safety: to assess safety of IVAA in combination with gemcitabine and erlotinib by evaluating the number of adverse events and serious adverse events occurring among study participants. Efficacy: to assess efficacy of IVAA in combination with gemcitabine and erlotinib. Partial response rate and progression free survival at 15 weeks will be assessed using RECIST criteria, and compared to the well-documented rates observed in previously published studies and historical dataset at Jefferson in patients treated with gemcitabine plus erlotinib alone.</description>

    <description>1) To evaluate quality of life using Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-General (FACT-G) quality assessment instrument. The FACT-G questionnaire as well as the Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS-29) will be used to assess quality-of-life longitudinally. Quality-of-life scores obtained from the FACT-G and PROMIS-29 will be summarized at multiple time points using means and standard deviations.</description>
