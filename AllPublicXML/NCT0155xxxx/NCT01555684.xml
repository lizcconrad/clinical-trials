  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is a demyelinating disease of the central nervous system (CNS) that
      often results in reduced muscle function which produces fatigue, weakness and a decline in
      daily mobility. Although the underlying cause of the disease is unknown a possible
      contributory mechanism is chronic cerebrospinal venous insufficiency (CCSVI). Post-mortem
      studies and magnetic resonance venography have shown a strong relationship between the
      cerebral venous system and MS cortical plaques. From this a role for CCSVI in MS has been
      suggested: venous malformations that result in venous hypertension, pressure on the blood
      brain barrier and subsequent inflammation due to leakage of haemosiderin into the parenchyma.
      This provokes an immune response which results in neurodegeneration. A procedure known as
      percutaneous venoplasty whereupon a balloon is inserted and inflated into the jugular vein
      has been developed to improve this drainage of the CNS, reduce venous hypertension and
      improve symptoms associated with MS. Although this procedure is widely practiced throughout
      the world it has yet to be fully accepted as it needs to be supported by evidence based
      clinical trials. As such NHS National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE)
      recently issued a consultation document to determine more about the procedure's clinical
      safety and efficacy. A common concern raised is the ability to prevent any possible placebo
      effect and like any other clinical trial should offer a sham procedure to a matched control
      group. The difficulty with this option are the ethical issues associated with an invasive
      sham treatment and also the practical issues of masking a potentially painful treatment such
      as venoplasty. One option is to have blinded neurological assessment of patients who have
      either been treated with venoplasty or had no active treatment. Another option is to use
      dependent measures that are unaffected by motivational or psychological influences which
      avoids any placebo effect issue. One such dependent measure is motor unit firing behaviour
      whilst contracting at a submaximal target force. Typically clinicians have used this to
      manage motor disorder patients but have used cumbersome invasive technology that can only
      measure a few motor units with limited accuracy. However, De Luca et al recently developed a
      high density surface electromyographic (HDsEMG) system that can measure 30-40 motor units
      with 92-97% accuracy. From this it has been proposed as a highly effective tool for
      evaluating efficacy of therapeutic interventions for upper motoneuron disorders such as MS.

      Accordingly the investigators propose to use a repeated measures design on an experimental
      (receiving venoplasty) and control (not receiving venoplasty) MS groups (6 patients in each
      group) to determine the effect of the treatment on muscular function, mobility and fatigue.
      This would be combined with independent blinded neurological assessment of the two groups of
      patients.

      This design enables us to achieve two aims:

        1. Acute neuromuscular response to the treatment

        2. Chronic response to the treatment (6 weeks) to determine the effect on muscular
           function, mobility and fatigue.*

      Methods

        -  Four (first two to establish baseline variability of measures) repeat visits to the
           laboratory at University of Stirling to establish neuromuscular measures:

             1. HDsEMG pre and post tetanic induced fatigue

             2. Muscle fibre conduction velocity as previously described (Hunter et al., 2011)

             3. Ultrasound for CCSVI determination on visits 1 and 3

             4. DEXA scans for alterations in body composition on visits 2 and 4

        -  With the use of accelerometers monitor free living activity on days 0-7 and 9-42 (post
           venoplasty).
