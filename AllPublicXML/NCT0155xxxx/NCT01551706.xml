    <textblock>
      This is a Randomized, Double-blind, Placebo-controlled, Pilot Study to Evaluate the Effect of
      ENI Patented Whole Grape Extract on Antioxidant Status.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will investigate the effect of ENI Patented Whole Grape Extract versus placebo on
      antioxidant status. The primary objective is to determine antioxidant status by measuring
      total antioxidant capacity and superoxide dismutase (SOD) in blood and 8-OHdG and
      8-isoprostane in first morning void urine samples prior to and after six weeks of
      supplementation with ENI Patented Whole Grape Extract.

      Secondary objectives will include the assessment of oxidized LDL (oxLDL) and safety
      evaluations:

        1. oxLDL

        2. Safety laboratory tests: CBC, electrolytes, glucose, creatinine, eGFR, AST, ALT,
           GGT,bilirubin

        3. Vital signs: heart rate and blood pressure

        4. Adverse events
