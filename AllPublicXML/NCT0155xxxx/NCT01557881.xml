      This clinical trial studies positron emission tomography (PET)/magnetic resonance imaging
      (MRI) in patients undergoing PET/computed tomography (CT). Diagnostic procedures, such as
      PET/MRI, may help doctors diagnose cancer or help doctors predict a patient's response to
      treatment

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To acquire PET/MRI scans of 100 patients which will be compared with PET/CT scans of the
      same subjects. The PET/CT scans will be used to provide the gold standard for evaluating the
      image quality and quantitative performance of the PET/MRI scans. After comparison and
      evaluation of the imaging capabilities and performance of the sequential PET/MRI imaging
      system for these 100 subjects, a second cohort of hundred consecutive subjects may be
      necessary and again comparisons made to the current standard of PET imaging, PET/CT. This
      validation of the attenuation correction methods and quantitative accuracy of the PET/MRI
      device compared to PET/CT will be a continuous iterative process that will result in
      optimized performance of the PET/MRI and will be a key step in its becoming available to
      other clinical research projects both within the Seidman Cancer Center as well as in other
      institutions.

    <description>University Hospitals Seidman Cancer Center [SCC] will house the Philips Ingenuity TF PET/MR, which is a hybrid scanner that merges magnetic resonance imaging with positron emission tomography scanning. University Hospitals is one of only five hospitals in the world with this technology. The PET/MRI system consists of two imaging scanners used sequentially as in PET/CT. The 3Tesla MRI component provides the high resolution that is necessary for soft tissue contrast and functional information on perfusion, diffusion, or metabolism. PET provides information about cellular metabolism and receptor status.</description>

    <criteria>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Only patients who are referred by their physician to have a clinical PET/CT will be
             eligible to participate in the study

          -  we propose to obtain a second PET/MRI on 100 patients after their clinical PET/CT
             imaging that spans several disease categories and includes the following cancers:
             lung, colon, melanoma, head/neck and lymphoma

          -  In addition to oncology patients, we anticipate imaging a subset of non-cancer
             patients who will also be imaged subsequent to their clinical PET/CT who will be
             referrals from neurology and cardiology

          -  All subjects will be at least 18 years old, or if under 18, parents or guardians must
             give consent

          -  Subjects must be stable and have experienced no adverse events from previous clinical
             PET/CT examination

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects who do not meet the above inclusion criteria
