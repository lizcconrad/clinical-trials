      The primary objective is to identify device characteristics, components or subsystems that
      manifest as screening score bias in SCOUT DS.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In the process of calibrating multiple SCOUT DS units, consistent inter-device score
      differences were found. These differences could create a bias in the measurement of Diabetes
      Risk scores (DRS) in human subjects. This study is intended to examine two of the various
      subsystems of the SCOUT DS to determine whether either of them might be capable of
      introducing bias into the measurements, with the ultimate aim of eliminating inter-device
      measurement variation.

      The testing of human subjects in this trial is necessary to determine whether variability in
      the performance of these device subsystems actually affect DRS scores in a real world
      setting.

      The trial will be a prospective, single site, investigational trial. The trial will utilize
      four SCOUT DS devices. Subjects will report to the investigative site for multiple visits.
      The number of visits will vary between three to seven visits.

    <description>The primary objective of this study is to identify device characteristics, components, or subsystems that manifest as screening score bias in SCOUT DS.
The study will switch subsystems between devices and if the bias differs by more than 3.5 Diabetes Risk Score units compared to the baseline score, we would conclude that the bias was contained within that particular subsystem</description>
