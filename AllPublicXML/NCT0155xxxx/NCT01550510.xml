    <textblock>
      This protocol is a phase I/II, study of ascorbic acid (AA) infusions combined with treatment
      with irinotecan versus treatment with irinotecan alone in patients with recurrent or advanced
      colorectal cancer who have failed at least one treatment regimen with a 5-FU based therapy.
      This study will be conducted as an amendment to Investigational New Drug # 77486.

    <description>Safety: The primary aim is to assess whether or not (IV) Ascorbic Acid (AA) with irinotecan therapy is relatively safe and well-tolerated according to Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) v4.0. Efficacy: To utilize CT or PET/CT scans to assess overall tumor response rate (complete and partial response) and evaluate disease progression in subjects with advanced or recurrent colorectal cancer treated with the combination of ascorbic acid and irinotecan versus irinotecan alone.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Age &gt; 18 years

          -  Metastatic colorectal carcinoma (stage IV disease).

          -  Patients must have progressed on one or more prior chemotherapy treatment regimens
             including at least one trial of a 5-FU/oxaliplatin based therapy (FOLFOX) in
             combination with bevacizumab. Patients must not have had standard chemotherapy within
             at least 2 weeks of beginning ascorbic acid treatment provided that they have
             recovered from any toxicities that they experienced.

          -  G6PD status &gt; lower limit of normal

          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status 0 to 2.

          -  Laboratory at baseline evaluation for inclusion in the study: creatinine ≤1.5X upper
             limit (if the creatinine is elevated, but ≤1.5X the ULN, a 24 hour creatinine
             clearance will be obtained); transaminase (AST/ALT) ≤2.0X upper limit of normal;
             bilirubin levels ≥ 2 mg/dL; ANC ≥1,500/mm3; Hemoglobin &gt; 8g/dL; platelet ≥
             100,000/mm3;

          -  Women of childbearing potential will confirm a negative pregnancy test and must
             practice effective contraception during the study.

          -  Willing and able to provide informed consent and participate in the study procedures.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with evidence of a significant current psychiatric disorder that would
             prevent completion of the study as determined by the PI will not be allowed to
             participate.

          -  Co-morbid medical condition that would affect survival or tolerance as determined by
             the PI. This includes patients who have not fully recovered from toxicities associated
             with prior therapy. It also includes subjects who, as determined by the PI, are at
             risk of experiencing fluid overload (i.e., congestive heart failure).

          -  Patients who currently abuse alcohol or drugs.

          -  Patients with known glomerular filtration rate of &lt;60ml/min or with nephrotic range
             proteinuria.

          -  Pregnant or lactating women

          -  Enrollment in active clinical trial/ experimental therapy or IND study within the
             prior 30 days.

          -  Contraindication for CT or PET/CT as per the PI.

          -  Patients who are on strong inducers of CYP3A4 which include but are not limited to:
             Aminoglutethimide, Bexarotene, Bosentan, Carbamazepine, Dexamethasone, Efavirenz,
             Fosphenytoin, Griseofulvin, Modafinil, Nafcillin, Nevirapine, Oxcarbazepine,
             Phenobarbital, Phenytoin, Primidone, Rifabutin, Rifampin, Rifapentine, St. John's
             wort.
