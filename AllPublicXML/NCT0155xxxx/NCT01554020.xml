    <textblock>
      This prospective international clinical trial is a two-arm, double-blind, randomized,
      placebo-controlled, parallel-group, multicenter study. 112 prediabetic subjects will be
      randomized to Blood Sugar Take Care or placebo. Randomization will be stratified by gender.
      The intervention period is 12 weeks. The primary outcome is fasting glucose levels.
