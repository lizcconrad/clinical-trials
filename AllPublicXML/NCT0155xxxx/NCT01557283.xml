    <textblock>
      With the new reimbursement criteria, we want:

      To describe the average treatment duration of patients with Enbrel expressed as a number of
      weeks/year.

      To describe the number of patients who receive continuous treatment To describe the number of
      patients who receive intermittent treatment To describe the number of weeks off treatment

    <time_frame>Start and end of cycle 1, 2, 3</time_frame>
    <description>Combined assessment of lesion severity and area affected into single score. Body was divided into 4 sections: head, arms, trunk, and legs. For each section, percent (%) area of skin involved was estimated: 0 = 0%, 1 = less than (&lt;) 10%, 2 = 10 to &lt;30%, 3 = 30 to &lt;50%, 4 = 50 to &lt;70%, 5= 70 to &lt;90%, 6 = 90 to 100%. Severity was estimated by clinical signs: erythema, induration, desquamation; scale: 0 = none to 4 = maximum. Final PASI = sum of severity parameters for each section*area score*weight of section (head: 0.1, arms: 0.2, body: 0.3, legs: 0.4); total possible score range: 0= no disease to 72= maximal disease.</description>

    <description>Percentage of body surface area affected by psoriasis was estimated using the palm method: one of the participant's palm to proximal interphalangeal and thumb = 1 percent (%) of total BSA. Regions of the body were assigned specific number of palms with percentage [Head and neck = 10% (10 palms), upper extremities = 20% (20 palms), Trunk (axillae and groin) = 30% (30 palms), lower extremities (buttocks) = 40% (40 palms)]. The total BSA affected was the summation of individual regions affected.</description>
