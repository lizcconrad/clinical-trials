    <textblock>
      With the new reimbursement criteria, we want:

      To describe the average treatment duration of patients with Enbrel expressed as a number of
      weeks/year.

      To describe the number of patients who receive continuous treatment To describe the number of
      patients who receive intermittent treatment To describe the number of weeks off treatment

      100 patients will be followed for at least 1 year

    <time_frame>Start and end of cycle 1, 2, 3</time_frame>
    <description>Combined assessment of lesion severity and area affected into single score. Body was divided into 4 sections: head, arms, trunk, and legs. For each section, percent (%) area of skin involved was estimated: 0 = 0%, 1 = less than (&lt;) 10%, 2 = 10 to &lt;30%, 3 = 30 to &lt;50%, 4 = 50 to &lt;70%, 5= 70 to &lt;90%, 6 = 90 to 100%. Severity was estimated by clinical signs: erythema, induration, desquamation; scale: 0 = none to 4 = maximum. Final PASI = sum of severity parameters for each section*area score*weight of section (head: 0.1, arms: 0.2, body: 0.3, legs: 0.4); total possible score range: 0= no disease to 72= maximal disease.</description>

    <description>Percentage of body surface area affected by psoriasis was estimated using the palm method: one of the participant's palm to proximal interphalangeal and thumb = 1 percent (%) of total BSA. Regions of the body were assigned specific number of palms with percentage [Head and neck = 10% (10 palms), upper extremities = 20% (20 palms), Trunk (axillae and groin) = 30% (30 palms), lower extremities (buttocks) = 40% (40 palms)]. The total BSA affected was the summation of individual regions affected.</description>
