  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Part I is a 3-period, active comparator-controlled, fixed sequence study to evaluate the
      safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of MK-7145 compared to furosemide
      in participants with moderate-to-severe renal insufficiency (RI) without heart failure (HF).
      Primary hypothesis for Part I is that at least one well-tolerated dose of MK-7145 will
      produce a greater 24hr urinary excretion of sodium (UNa) on the 1st day of MK-7145 dosing
      than 80 mg furosemide (on the 1st day of furosemide dosing) in participants with
      moderate-to-severe RI. If MK-7145 is safe at natriuretic doses in RI in Part I of this study,
      MK-7145 will be investigated in participants with heart failure (HF) and RI (Part II).

      Part II is 4 period, fixed sequence, active comparator controlled (in Period 1), titration
      (in Periods 2, 3 and 4) study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and
      pharmacodynamics of a titration regimen of MK-7145 compared to an optimized stable
      maintenance regimen of furosemide or torsemide in participants with New York Heart
      Association (NYHA) Class II and III heart failure and moderate or severe renal insufficiency.
      The primary hypothesis for Part II is that at least one dose of MK-7145, titrated according
      to a fixed dose titration regimen, will be associated with a reduction in N-terminal
      pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) compared to furosemide or torsemide (at 24 hours
      post morning dose on the last dosing day of each period) in participants with NYHA class
      II/III HF with moderate or severe RI.

    <time_frame>Baseline (Day -1) and 0-24 hours postdose on Treatment Day 1 of each treatment period</time_frame>
    <description>Urine was collected at Treatment Day -1 and Treatment Day 1 at 0-2, 2-4, 4-6, 6-8, 8-12, 12-24 hour. The 24-hour cumulative natriuresis will be estimated by the amount of sodium excreted into urine over 24 hour period postdose, where amount of sodium is the product of sodium concentration and the volume of urine. The change from baseline in UNa from baseline (Treatment Day -1) and 24 hours post-dose on Treatment Day 1 were calculated.</description>

    <time_frame>Day 15 for Periods 1, 2, and 3; Day 29 for Period 4</time_frame>
    <description>B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) is a substance secreted from the ventricles or lower chambers of the heart in response to changes in pressure that occur when heart failure develops and worsens. The level of BNP in the blood increases when heart failure symptoms worsen, and decreases when the heart failure condition is stable. The BNP level in a person with heart failure is higher than in a person with normal heart function. Levels of BNP levels were assessed 24 hours post last morning dose of study drug for each treatment period.</description>

        <description>B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) is a substance secreted from the ventricles or lower chambers of the heart in response to changes in pressure that occur when heart failure develops and worsens. The level of BNP in the blood increases when heart failure symptoms worsen, and decreases when the heart failure condition is stable. The BNP level in a person with heart failure is higher than in a person with normal heart function. Levels of BNP levels were assessed 24 hours post last morning dose of study drug for each treatment period.</description>
