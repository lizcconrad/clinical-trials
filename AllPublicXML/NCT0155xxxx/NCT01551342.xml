      -  This study includes two semi-consecutive parts:

             -  Part I Open label, controlled, Calibration part aimed to calibrate the CellDetect®
                device for identifying bladder cancer cells in urine samples.

             -  Part II Prospective, controlled, blinded part to determine the performance of the
                CellDetect® device in monitoring bladder cancer recurrence in patients with a
                history of TCC, using urine cytology samples

        -  The following subjects will be enrolled:

      Subjects previously diagnosed with bladder cancer undergoing routine cystoscopic
      surveillance, TURT or Cystectomy.

      Study aim:

        1. To calibrate the CellDetect® device for detecting TCC in urine cytology samples.

        2. Determine the performance of the CellDetect® device in identifying TCC recurrence in
           patients with a history of TCC using urine cytology samples.

      The study includes two parts:

      Part I Open label, controlled, Calibration part aimed to calibrate the CellDetect® device for
      identifying bladder cancer cells in urine samples.

      Part II Prospective, controlled, blinded part to determine the performance of the CellDetect®
      device in monitoring bladder cancer recurrence in in patients with a history of TCC, using
      urine cytology samples

      * The following subjects will be enrolled: Subjects previously diagnosed with bladder cancer
      undergoing routine cystoscopic surveillance, TURT or Cystectomy.

      Part I - up to 200 urine eligible samples Part II - up to 300 urine eligible samples

      Endpoints:

        1. To calibrate the CellDetect® device for identifying TCC in urine cytology samples.

        2. To determine the performance of the CellDetect® device in identifying recurrence of TCC
           in urine samples.

          1. Subject undergoing TURT or cystectomy due to any of the following reasons:

               -  Subjects with suspected or known TCC (hematuria subjects)

               -  Subjects with previously diagnosed TCC undergoing routine cystoscopic
                  surveillance.

          2. Ability to provide informed consent

          3. Age &gt; 18 years

        Subjects meeting the following criteria (all of them) will be included in the study:

          1. Subject with a documented history of TCC and who are undergoing routine cystoscopic
             surveillance, TURBT or cystectomy

          2. At least 4 weeks have passed since any treatment for TCC (including cystoscopy and/or
             TURBT procedures)

          3. Ability to provide informed consent

          4. Age ≥ 18 years old

               -  Exclusion Criteria

          4. No biopsy results available for subjects with positive findings on cystoscopy test,
             TURBT or cystectomy. [Note: such subjects will be excluded after recruitment and urine
             collection, as result of the delay in receiving biopsy results].

          5. If more than 3 months have passed between urine sample collection and TURBT or
