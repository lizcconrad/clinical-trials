  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This will be a single centre, open label, randomised, two-way crossover study in healthy
      volunteers under semi-fed conditions. Two formulations of paracetamol, are being tested in
      this study to establish at what time point a therapeutic concentration of paracetamol in the
      blood is reached. Subjects will attend a screening visit to check if they are eligible for
      study participation then within 15 days they will check-in to the unit for a stay of
      approximately 48 hours (hrs). They will be given a single dose of one of the preparations on
      the first day and then the other preparation on the next day. Regular blood samples will be
      taken along with other assessments for safety.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Males in good general heatlh and Body Mass Index between 19-28 kg/m2

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Disease

               1. Current liver impairment, renal impairment, history of or active gastrointestinal
                  ulcers, uncontrolled hypertension, haemophilia or other bleeding disorders.

               2. Current or recurrent disease, within 12 months of the screening, that could
                  affect the action, absorption or disposition of the study formulations or
                  clinical or laboratory assessments (e.g. hepatic disorders, renal insufficiency,
                  congestive heart failure).

               3. Current or relevant previous history, within 12 months of the screening visit, of
                  serious, severe or unstable physical or psychiatric illness, any medical disorder
                  that may require treatment or make the subject unlikely to fully complete the
                  study, or any condition that presents undue risk from the study treatments or
                  procedures.

          -  Medications

               1. Current or regular use at screening of any prescription, herbal or Over the

                  domperidone, cholestyramine, angiotensin -converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors,
                  acetazolamide, anticonvulsants, diuretics, methotrexate, non-steroidal
