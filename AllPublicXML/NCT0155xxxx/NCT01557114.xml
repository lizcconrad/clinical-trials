    <textblock>
      RATIONALE:Anti-melanoma activity of Ipilimumab both as a single therapy and in association
      with melanoma peptides has been shown as well as synergy between radiation therapy and
      anti-CTLA-A mAb in several tumor animal models for both local tumor control and distant
      effects.Radiotherapy increases tumor immunogenicity in several preclinical models by
      increasing MHC molecules expression and is able to induce significant tumor reduction in
      around 30% of cases. Thus, combining radiotherapy and administration of ipilimumab could
      elicit systemic antitumor response. Radiation therapy will expose tumor-associated antigens
      (TAA) and facilitate antigen presentation, and further blockade of CTLA-4 could amplify the
      immune antitumor response. In this therapeutical model, the use of the own patient tumor as a
      source of tumor antigens (in opposition with other vaccination protocols, where TAA are
      exogenic) is particularly adapted.

      PURPOSE: This Phase I trial determines the side effects and best dose of radiation therapy
      administered in combination with ipilimumab.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary: To determine the Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD), Dose Limiting Toxicity (DLT) and
      recommended Phase 2 dose of radiation therapy administered in combination with ipilimumab.

      Secondary:

      Adverse event profiles Preliminary anti-tumor activity following escalating doses of
      radiation combined to ipilimumab using the immune related response criteria irRC overall
      survival in patients treated with this combination systemic immunologic anti tumor response
      intratumoral immune response pharmacodynamic effects of ipilimumab and radiotherapy in
      combination on Absolute Lymphocyte Count (ALC) associations between ALC and anti-tumor
