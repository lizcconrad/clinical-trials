  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the effectiveness of Abatacept in real-world clinical
      practice. The main hypothesis to be examined in this study is, &quot;Abatacept's effectiveness
      results in a single real-world clinic (n = 100) are reproducible at another site (n ~= 200)&quot;.

      Two secondary hypotheses that will be tested are:

        -  Abatacept aids in achieving low disease activity or clinical remission in patients of
           the following Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) sub-groups: RF+/CCP+, RF+/CCP- RF-/CCP+
           RF-/CCP-; first time on a bio-tech drug; having previously failed a biological drug;
           having interstitial lung disease; identified as disabled; twenty-eight individual joints
           identified as {swollen, painful, tender, deformed or having decreased range of motion};
           on or not on oral DMARD; age; or gender.

        -  A database with sufficient attributes exists from which a patient's efficacy on
           abatacept is accurately predictable.
