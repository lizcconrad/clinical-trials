  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Human papillomavirus (HPV)-induced condyloma acuminata (CA), commonly known as anogenital or
      genital warts, is among the most common sexually transmitted diseases. There are a wide
      variety of available treatments of genital warts, but none are considered completely
      effective. It has been suggested that AS101 works by stimulating the innate and acquired arms
      of the immune system.

      In previous proof-of-concept clinical study AS101 topical cream was tested on HPV warts and
      shown cure in high percentages. However the cream formulation was unstable therefore a new
      formulation was developed mainly for the carrier. In this study the improved AS101 ointment
      will be tested in female patients with external genital warts in an open study to assess its
      safety and efficacy.

          -  All study participants who are sexually active must use a barrier protection method of
             contraception such as condom in addition to another birth control measure such as oral
             contraceptives, intrauterine device, spermicide or surgical sterilization during
             treatment and for 60 days after completion of treatment;

          -  Patients with first clinical diagnosis of external genital warts, in the external
             genitalia including vulva (labia minora and majora), inguinal folds, pubic area,
             perineum, perianal, or buttocks areas;

          -  A minimum of one lesion and a maximum of 10 lesions identified at study entry, and the

             intraepithelial neoplasia on cytology will be eligible if subsequent colposcopy with
             biopsy of suspicious area is negative for high grade squamous intraepithelial lesions
             (Grade 2 or 3). Atypia, HPV effect, and low grade intraepithelial lesions (Grade 1)
             are acceptable.
