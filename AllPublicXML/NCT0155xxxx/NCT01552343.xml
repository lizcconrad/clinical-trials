    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess psychometric properties (reliability and validity) of
      the Nocturia Impact (NI) diary.

      To assess the association between reduction of number of nocturnal voids and the mean changes
      in NI scores (sensitivity of the NI total score to change in nocturia).

      To assess which NI diary items account for the main difference in change in total NI score in
      treatment versus placebo.

    <measure>The Pearson Correlation Coefficient Between Change From Baseline to Month 1 in Number of Nocturnal Voids and Change From Baseline to Month 1 in Nocturia Impact (NI) Diary Total Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1 (Baseline), Month 1</time_frame>
    <description>This outcome is a measure of sensitivity of the NI Diary to change in nocturia.
The NI Diary is a 12-item instrument consisting of 11 core items and an overall impact question (Q12). Responses are scored from 0 (no impact) to 4 (highest impact); a lowering of score equals a decrease in impact caused by nocturia. The NI total score is the sum of the 11 core items scores. The NI total score was analyzable only if all 11 items (Q1-Q11) had non-missing responses. Otherwise, it was defined as missing. Missing values were not imputed. The average over the 3-day diary period prior to baseline (Day 1) and Month 1 was used for the overall impact score.
The correlation was estimated using Fisher's z transformation, i.e. the NI total score was based on a standardized scale from 0 (lowest impact) to 100 (highest impact).
Corresponding adjusted partial correlation coefficients were based on adjustments for mean number of Baseline voids, Baseline NI total score, age, and gender.</description>

    <measure>Difference in Mean Change From Baseline to Month 1 in Nocturia Impact (NI) Total Scores and Overall Impact Question for Responders and Non-Responders</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1 (Baseline), Month 1</time_frame>
    <description>This outcome is a measure of sensitivity of the NI Diary to change in nocturia.
The NI Diary is a 12-item instrument consisting of 11 core items and an overall impact question (Q12). The NI total score is defined as the sum of the 11 core items scores.
The overall impact question (Q12) and the NI total score were transformed using Fisher's z transformation, i.e. the scores were based on a standardized scale from 0 (lowest impact) to 100 (highest impact).
The difference in mean change in NI total score for subjects who experienced a reduction from baseline of &lt;33% in nocturnal voids at the Month 1 visit (non-responders) versus those with a reduction in nocturnal voids from Baseline of ≥33% (responders) was estimated.</description>

    <measure>Cohen's D Effect Size in Responsiveness in the Nocturia Impact (NI) Total Scores and Overall Impact Question as Measured From Baseline (Day 1) to Month 1</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1 (Baseline), Month 1</time_frame>
    <description>The responsiveness of the NI Diary was measured with Cohen's D effect size. The effect size was calculated for active treatment versus placebo, based on change from Baseline to Month 1. The effect size was evaluated as &quot;small,&quot; &quot;medium,&quot; or &quot;large&quot; if D was &lt;=0.35, &gt;0.35 - 0.65, or &gt;0.65, respectively.
Mean values are the Cohen's D effect size. Standard deviation is the pooled standard deviation.</description>

    <measure>Internal Consistency of the Nocturia Impact (NI) Total Score for Each Day NI Diaries Were Completed Assessed as Cronbach's Alpha Values</measure>
    <time_frame>Screening (Day -20 to Day -18), Baseline (Day -2 to Day 1) and Treatment (Day 28 to Day 30)</time_frame>
    <description>Cronbach's alpha (CA) is a measure of the internal consistency of the Nocturia Impact (NI) Total scores. Higher scores indicate a more reliable (precise) instrument. A value of 0.70 set as the benchmark for declaring the scale as internally consistent.
Cronbach's alpha was assessed for each of the three consecutive days NI diaries were completed during screening (Day -20 to Day -18), baseline (Day -2 to Day 1) and Month 1 (Day 28 to Day 30).</description>

    <measure>Construct Validity For the Nocturia Impact (NI) Total Scores and Overall Impact Question (Q12) for Participants With High/Low Number of Nocturnal Voids</measure>
    <time_frame>Screening (Day -20), Baseline (Day 1)</time_frame>
    <description>The known group validity was assessed by comparing participants who experienced ≥3 nocturnal voids to those who experienced &lt;3 nocturnal voids, using the average over 3 days for the Screening and Baseline diaries. Results are reported for the NI Total Scores and the Overall Impact Question (Q12).
The NI Diary is a 12-item instrument consisting of 11 core items and an overall impact question (Q12). The NI total score is defined as the sum of the 11 core items scores.
The overall impact question (Q12) and the NI total score were transformed using Fisher's z transformation, i.e. the scores were based on a standardized scale from 0 (lowest impact) to 100 (highest impact).</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline to Month 1 on Nocturia Impact (NI) Total Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Day -2 to Day 1), Treatment (Day 28-30)</time_frame>
    <description>The NI Diary is a 12-item instrument consisting of 11 core items and an overall impact question (Q12). Responses are scored from 0 (no impact) to 4 (highest impact); the NI total score is the sum of the 11 core items scores (range of 0-44) which is then transformed to a 0-100 scale (high score indicates high impact). The NI total score was analyzable only if all 11 items (Q1-Q11) had non-missing responses. Otherwise, it was defined as missing. Missing values were not imputed. The average over the 3-day diary period prior to baseline (Day 1) and Month 1 was used for the overall impact score. Negative change from baseline scores indicate a decrease in impact caused by nocturia.</description>

        <title>The Pearson Correlation Coefficient Between Change From Baseline to Month 1 in Number of Nocturnal Voids and Change From Baseline to Month 1 in Nocturia Impact (NI) Diary Total Score</title>
        <description>This outcome is a measure of sensitivity of the NI Diary to change in nocturia.
The NI Diary is a 12-item instrument consisting of 11 core items and an overall impact question (Q12). Responses are scored from 0 (no impact) to 4 (highest impact); a lowering of score equals a decrease in impact caused by nocturia. The NI total score is the sum of the 11 core items scores. The NI total score was analyzable only if all 11 items (Q1-Q11) had non-missing responses. Otherwise, it was defined as missing. Missing values were not imputed. The average over the 3-day diary period prior to baseline (Day 1) and Month 1 was used for the overall impact score.
The correlation was estimated using Fisher’s z transformation, i.e. the NI total score was based on a standardized scale from 0 (lowest impact) to 100 (highest impact).
Corresponding adjusted partial correlation coefficients were based on adjustments for mean number of Baseline voids, Baseline NI total score, age, and gender.</description>

        <title>Difference in Mean Change From Baseline to Month 1 in Nocturia Impact (NI) Total Scores and Overall Impact Question for Responders and Non-Responders</title>
        <description>This outcome is a measure of sensitivity of the NI Diary to change in nocturia.
The NI Diary is a 12-item instrument consisting of 11 core items and an overall impact question (Q12). The NI total score is defined as the sum of the 11 core items scores.
The overall impact question (Q12) and the NI total score were transformed using Fisher's z transformation, i.e. the scores were based on a standardized scale from 0 (lowest impact) to 100 (highest impact).
The difference in mean change in NI total score for subjects who experienced a reduction from baseline of &lt;33% in nocturnal voids at the Month 1 visit (non-responders) versus those with a reduction in nocturnal voids from Baseline of ≥33% (responders) was estimated.</description>

          <title>Difference in Mean Change From Baseline to Month 1 in Nocturia Impact (NI) Total Scores and Overall Impact Question for Responders and Non-Responders</title>
          <description>This outcome is a measure of sensitivity of the NI Diary to change in nocturia.
The NI Diary is a 12-item instrument consisting of 11 core items and an overall impact question (Q12). The NI total score is defined as the sum of the 11 core items scores.
The overall impact question (Q12) and the NI total score were transformed using Fisher's z transformation, i.e. the scores were based on a standardized scale from 0 (lowest impact) to 100 (highest impact).
The difference in mean change in NI total score for subjects who experienced a reduction from baseline of &lt;33% in nocturnal voids at the Month 1 visit (non-responders) versus those with a reduction in nocturnal voids from Baseline of ≥33% (responders) was estimated.</description>

        <description>Cronbach’s alpha (CA) is a measure of the internal consistency of the Nocturia Impact (NI) Total scores. Higher scores indicate a more reliable (precise) instrument. A value of 0.70 set as the benchmark for declaring the scale as internally consistent.
Cronbach's alpha was assessed for each of the three consecutive days NI diaries were completed during screening (Day -20 to Day -18), baseline (Day -2 to Day 1) and Month 1 (Day 28 to Day 30).</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline to Month 1 on Nocturia Impact (NI) Total Score</title>
        <description>The NI Diary is a 12-item instrument consisting of 11 core items and an overall impact question (Q12). Responses are scored from 0 (no impact) to 4 (highest impact); the NI total score is the sum of the 11 core items scores (range of 0-44) which is then transformed to a 0-100 scale (high score indicates high impact). The NI total score was analyzable only if all 11 items (Q1-Q11) had non-missing responses. Otherwise, it was defined as missing. Missing values were not imputed. The average over the 3-day diary period prior to baseline (Day 1) and Month 1 was used for the overall impact score. Negative change from baseline scores indicate a decrease in impact caused by nocturia.</description>
