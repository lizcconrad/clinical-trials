  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      After undergoing hernia surgery, hydrocelectomy or lower abdominal surgery, a child may
      experience some amount of pain in the post-operative period. As part of the anesthesia
      technique, the investigators routinely provide a nerve block done on the abdominal wall that
      will provide pain relief for at least 10 hours postoperatively. This is referred to as a TAP
      block. The purpose of this study is to determine if the nerve block performed with local
      anesthetic solution using a regular concentration solution vs. a diluted solution may offer
      different durations of pain relief.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Children undergoing groin surgery or abdominal surgery under general anesthesia are offered
      pain relief postoperatively using regional anesthesia techniques including a central block
      like a caudal block, or peripheral nerve blocks including ultrasound guided ilioinguinal
      nerve block or transversus abdominis plane (TAP) block. The TAP block, a peripheral block of
      the thoraco-lumbar nerve roots as they exit between the internal oblique and the transversus
      abdominis muscle can be easily visualized using ultrasound guidance. The TAP block has been
      used for analgesia following major surgeries including lower abdominal surgeries and in
      newborn infants following major abdominal procedures including colostomy placement.1 The
      purpose of this study is to determine if two different concentrations of bupivacaine
      delivered at a total dose of 1 mL/kg offer similar or altered analgesia, i.e., does the
      concentration of the anesthetic matter more than the volume of local anesthetic while
      performing a TAP block in children undergoing groin surgery. Parents and the investigators
      will be blinded to the solution used for the TAP block. The solution will be drawn up by an
      investigator who is not a participant in the patient's care in a sterile fashion.
