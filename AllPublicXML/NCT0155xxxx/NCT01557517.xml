      Background:

      - Oral graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) is a possible complication of bone marrow
      transplants. It is the result of the donor cells trying to attack the recipient s body.
      Symptoms include dry mouth, sensitivity and pain when tasting certain spices and flavors, and
      painful swallowing. Steroids are a possible effective treatment for GHVD, but they can cause
      side effects when given as pills or injections. Steroids given in a cream or rinse form,
      applied directly to the site of the symptoms, can have fewer side effects. However, their
      effectiveness as a rinse has not been tested in the mouth. Researchers want to see if a
      steroid called clobetasol can be used as a mouth rinse to treat oral GHVD.

      Objectives:

      - To see if a clobetasol rinse is a safe and effective treatment for oral graft-versus-host
      disease.

      Eligibility:

      - Individuals at least 12 years of age who have oral GHVD and are not allergic to clobetasol.

      Design:

        -  Participants will be screened with a physical exam and medical history. Blood and urine
           samples will be collected. They will also have an oral exam, a mouth tissue biopsy, and
           other tests before starting the study drug.

        -  Participants will be separated into two groups. One group will receive clobetasol; the
           other will have a placebo liquid.

        -  Participants will rinse their mouths with the study liquid three times a day after meals
           for 2 weeks.

        -  After 2 weeks, participants will have another study visit with blood tests and other
           exams.

        -  After the study visit, all participants will start to use the clobetasol rinse. Those
           who originally had clobetasol will use the rinse for another 2 weeks. Those who
           originally had a placebo will use the rinse for 4 weeks.

        -  Participants will have a follow-up exam after the end of treatment....

      BACKGROUND:

        -  Chronic Graft versus Host Disease (cGVHD) is a major late complication of allogeneic
           hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.

        -  The oral cavity is the second most commonly affected area in cGVHD and is a major cause
           of morbidity.

        -  Clobetasol is a high-potency topical corticosteroid widely used for a variety of
           inflammatory disorders of the skin and oral mucosa.

        -  Treatment of oral cGVHD by topical agents is an attractive strategy to potentially avoid
           adverse effects associated with systemic immunosuppression.

      OBJECTIVES:

      - To investigate efficacy of topical clobetasol 0.05% oral rinse for oral chronic
      graftversus-host disease (cGVHD)

      ELIGIBILITY:

      - Patients age 12-99 years with clinically significant oral cGVHD.

      DESIGN:

        -  This is a randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled, pilot study of clobetasol 0.05%
           topical oral rinse with an open label extension period.

        -  Patients will rinse oral cavity with 10cc of clobetasol 0.05% or placebo oral rinse for
           2 minutes 3 times a day.

        -  Treatment duration will be for 2 weeks in the randomized phase and 2-4 weeks in the open
           label phase.

        -  Up to 40 patients will be enrolled on this pilot trial until 34 evaluable patients are
           assessed.
