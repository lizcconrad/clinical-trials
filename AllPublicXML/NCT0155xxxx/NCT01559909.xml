  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Individuals with transfemoral (TF) amputation (above the knee amputation) may benefit from a
      socket that uses vacuum assisted suspension (VAS) to hold the socket onto the amputated limb.
      VAS may improve stability, weight bearing, comfort, proprioception, limb health, and
      function. To date, there is no evidence to support whether VAS alters balance, kinematics,
      and kinetics when walking for TF amputees as compared to conventional socket suspension
      technology. Further, there is question regarding what the optimal height of the socket should
      be to maintain stability and function. So long as stability is not sacrificed, it may be
      advantageous to lower the height of the socket to allow full hip motion and improve sitting
      comfort. The purpose of this investigation is to assess if the socket height alters the
      motion of the leg and changes the way one walks when using VAS compared to conventional
      socket suspension technology. In this study, TF amputees will be fitted with a VAS socket
      that will be attached to their current prosthesis using similar alignment. Individuals will
      be assessed while walking on a level floor and during stair negotiation while wearing the
      prosthesis with the VAS socket at various socket heights as well as their current socket.
      Additionally, balance and socket standing and sitting comfort will be investigated.
