    <textblock>
      This is a phase I, open-label, randomized study in healthy adults. Eligible subjects will be
      given single dose of either Dry Powdered Measles Vaccine (PMV) by Puffhaler® device, Dry PMV
      by SoloventTM device or licensed measles vaccine by subcutaneous route (SMV). Subjects will
      be followed for 180 days for safety.
