      Background: Celiac disease is an immune-mediated reaction to gluten, presenting with
      diarrhea, weight loss, abdominal complaints and a range of less common associated neurologic
      and psychiatric symptoms. Evidence of a link between schizophrenia and celiac disease dates
      back to 1961. Recent evidence shows that 5.5% (age adjusted) of persons with schizophrenia
      participating in the Clinical Antipsychotic Trials of Intervention Effectiveness (CATIE)
      study had a level of antibodies to tTG that is consistent with a diagnosis of celiac disease
      (compared to 1.1% of the comparison sample). An unexpected finding was that 23.4% (age
      adjusted) of the CATIE sample had antibodies to gliadin (compared to 2.9% of the comparison
      sample). It is hypothesized that a gluten free diet in people with schizophrenia who have
      Celiac disease or gluten sensitivity will have improvement in symptoms and quality of life.

      Objectives: The aim of this proposed pilot study is to establish the feasibility of a
      initiating and maintaining a Gluten-free diet in these two groups. For this study The
      investigators will identify 8 individuals who have positive assays to tTG antibodies and
      confirmed celiac disease (N=4), or positive assays for anti-gliadin antibodies (N=4). The
      investigators plan to consent at least 2 subjects from each group and ask them to participate
      in a two-week open label treatment of a gluten free diet. The groups are;

        1. Celiac disease (positive tTG antibody); and

        2. Positive assay on Antigliadin antibodies

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects will be of either gender and of any race, with an age range of 18 55.

          -  Subjects will meet DSM-IV (APA, 1994) criteria for either schizophrenia or
             schizoaffective disorder. A best estimate diagnostic approach will be utilized in
             which information from the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV (First et al,
             1997) is supplemented by information from family informants, previous psychiatrists,
             and medical records to generate a diagnosis.

          -  Subjects will be required to have celiac disease (positive tTG antibody) or have
             gluten sensitivity (positive or AGA antibodies).

          -  Must be clinically stable and on the same antipsychotic for at least two months with
             an unchanged dose for the prior four weeks.

          -  Participants must complete the Evaluation to Sign Consent with a score of 10/12 or
             higher.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Pregnant or lactating women will be excluded. Pregnancy will be determined by
             pregnancy test. Lactating will be determined by participant report.
