  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The clinical trial was designed to evaluate the immunogenicity and safety against pediatric
      Inactivated influenza vaccine (Split Virion) (0.25ml formulation) of Hualan administered on
      infants age 6 months to 36 months.

    <textblock>
      The clinical trial was designed randomized and double-blind. Participants included up to 810
      persons (540 persons in test group and 270 persons in control group).

      Healthy 6-36 months infants were selected, whose guardians were volunteers and had signed the
      informed consent. Subjects were selected according to the inclusion and exclusion criteria.
      Every subject accepted 30min's observation in the hospital after vaccination and received
      periodic follow-up till the fourth week after the boost vaccination.

      Blood of subjects was collected at the third week after the boost vaccination for the
      analysis of the immunogenicity. During the test, the adverse reactions and detailed
      information were reported to the SFDA under the status of blinding every month. Unblinding
      was conducted after the completion of the follow-up of subjects.
