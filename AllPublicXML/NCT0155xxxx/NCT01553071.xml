  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In preclinical studies, the anti-cancer efficacy of fenretinide, a synthetic retinoid that
      causes cytotoxicity by mechanisms which include increased intracellular dihydroceramides, has
      been shown to be enhanced by safingol, a stereochemical-variant dihydroceramide precursor.
      This phase I study represents the first clinical trial employing this promising combination.
      The drug administration schedule (fenretinide given on Days 1-5, safingol given on Days 1-2
      of each 21-day cycle) reflects the in vitro observation that tumor cell exposure to safingol
      increased fenretinide efficacy both during and after safingol administration. The total dose
      of fenretinide, 4600 mg/m2 over 5 days, represents a 30% total dose reduction from the single
      agent MTD dose of 1280 mg/m2/day x 5 days determined on the PhI-42 study. This fenretinide
      dose is expected to produce plasma levels in the 30?s ?M. This dose reduction has been
      employed to reduce the potential for overlapping hepatic toxicities between these two agents.

      The administration of a reduced fenretinide dose on Day 1 (600 mg/m2 on Day 1, escalated to
      1000 mg/m2/day on Days 2-5) has been selected due to earlier observations that initial
      exposure to the soy bean oil vehicle in the fenretinide emulsion may induce endogenous
      lipases, thereby permitting tolerance of higher total doses fenretinide emulsion subsequently
      administered. The starting dose of safingol in this study, 210 mg/m2/day x 2 days (420 mg/m2
      total), corresponds to 50% of the recommended Phase II safingol dose (bolus) determined in
      the Schwartz, et al, Phase I study of safingol plus cisplatin 60 mg/m2 (the MTD of
      single-agent, intravenous (emulsion) safingol was not reached in the Phase I safingol run-in
      monotherapy portion of this study), and was selected to provide an adequate safety margin
      against the potential for overlapping toxicities (such as hepatic transaminitis).

      The study has been designed to optimize the safety of this novel combination. Treatment will
      be administered in the inpatient setting. Central venous access will be mandated to avoid the
      potential for hemolysis and thrombophlebitis associated with the preclinical peripheral
      administration of a previous safingol formulation in rats. To reduce the incidence of
      hypertriglyceridemia, a revised fenretinide delivery schedule will be employed. Patients will
      also be encouraged to maintain a low-fat diet during fenretinide administration. Serum
      triglycerides will be monitored every 12 hours. To monitor for cardiac toxicity, which was
      noted in canine studies at the highest dose of safingol plus fenretinide tested, serum
      troponin T levels will be monitored daily. To limit the potential for hepatotoxicity
      resulting from a possible drug interaction observed between intravenous fenretinide,
      ceftriaxone and acetaminophen in a pediatric patient, the concurrent administration of
      ceftriaxone, or acetaminophen, with the fenretinide emulsion infusion will be prohibited.

          1. Radiation therapy, chemotherapy, and other investigational agents within 3weeks (6
             weeks for nitrosourea or mitomycin C) prior to starting fenretinide + safingol.
             Patients must have recovered from toxicities of prior therapy.

          2. Concurrent administration of any other investigational agents

          3. Uncontrolled intercurrent illnesses including, but not limited to, ongoing or active
             systemic infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris,
             cardiac arrhythmia, coagulation disorders; other major medical illnesses of the
             cardiovascular or respiratory systems or psychiatric illness/social situations that
             would limit compliance with study requirements.

          4. Pregnant women are excluded from this study because the effects of fenretinide and
             safingol on the developing human fetus are unknown. Because there is an unknown but
             potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the
             mother with fenretinide and safingol, breastfeeding must be discontinued.

          5. Major surgery in the last three weeks due to unknown effects of fenretinide and
             safingol on wound healing.

          6. Patients with previously untreated brain metastases (including parenchymal, meningeal
             or dural-based CNS lesions) are excluded. However, patients with previously treated
             (surgery, radiation or both), clinically inactive brain metastases, who have not
             received corticosteroid therapy within three weeks of starting protocol therapy, are
             eligible.

          7. Known allergy to egg products or soy bean oil.

          8. Patients known to be HIV-positive receiving anti-retroviral therapy are excluded from
             the study because of possible pharmacokinetic interactions.

          9. Baseline fasting triglycerides &gt; 2.5 institutional upper limit of normal (IULN) or
             hypertriglyceridemia requiring medication. Patients requiring medication for other
             dyslipidemias (i.e., elevated LDL cholesterol) are eligible.

         10. Concomitant use of the following drugs (see Concomitant Medications, Section 3.3):
             antioxidants; herbal or other alternative therapy medications; vitamin supplements
             (especially vitamins A, C, and E) other than a standard dose multivitamin,
             acetaminophen, cyclosporine A or analogue; verapamil; tamoxifen or analogue,
             ketoconazole, chlorpromazine; RU486; indomethacin; or sulfinpyrazone, tetracycline,
             nalidixic acid, nitrofurantoin, phenytoin, sulfonamides, lithium, ceftriaxone, and

             If the patients discontinue usage of the above drugs, they can be eligible for
             enrollment into the study after a washout period of four half-lives.

         11. Poorly-controlled diabetes mellitus, as defined as fasting serum glucose concentration
             over 200 mg/dl or a hemoglobin A1C over 7.5%.

         13. Known history of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or
             biologic composition to fenretinide, such as 13-cis-retinoic acid, retinol, or
             all-trans-retinoic acid.

         14. Patients with esophageal cancer with unresected or recurrent primary tumors in the
             esophagus are only permitted after discussion of patient with Study Chair due to
             concern of tumor necrosis and esophageal perforation.

         15. Baseline (pre-treatment) serum troponin T (TnT) ≥ 0.03 ng/mL. Troponin T levels may be
             rechecked and therapy given if levels decrease to &lt; 0.03 ng/mL.

         16. Baseline (pre-treatment) EKG with any of the following changes consistent with cardiac
             ischemia:
