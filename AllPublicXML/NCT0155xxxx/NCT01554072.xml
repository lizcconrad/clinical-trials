  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pulmonary rehabilitation consists of a multidisciplinary program of care for patients with
      chronic respiratory disease, which currently encompasses numerous features and physical
      training methods aimed at maintaining stability clinic for people with Chronic Obstructive
      Pulmonary Disease (COPD), especially in patients who, even with optimized clinical treatment,
      continue their decline and symptomatic physical functions and 8 so that these social. goals
      are achieved the patient with COPD should integrate into a program of RP assiduous and with
      accompanying several times per week, for several months, which for a number of factors is not
      always possible. For this reason, it is the research of methodology of RP that hold their
      effectiveness, but with greater flexibility and viability to people with COPD. On this basis,
      this study aims to investigate the effectiveness of a program of RP semi-domiciliar in which
      the patient suffering from COPD can receive guidance and training in person, to develop it
      partially in own domicile.

      The protocol of the experimental procedure will begin with the explanation of the purpose,
      risks and benefits of the study volunteers to patients with COPD. Subsequently, based on an
      evaluation form, will collect data on the past history and current disease and performed a
      general physical examination. Then the patients will respond to two questionnaires. The first
      will research the Medical Council (MRC) 13, which is a dyspnea scale to categorize in terms
      of disability, patients with COPD. The second questionnaire will be the Airway Questionnaire
      20 (AQ20) 14 specific for obstructive pulmonary disease, which is validated for the local
      language and highly reliable for the evaluation of patients with COPD, containing 20
      questions related to respiratory health to evaluate the quality of life. Subsequently, the
      same day, the patients carry out the following tests: spirometry, respiratory muscle
      strength, respiratory muscle endurance, assessment of training load of the upper and shuttle
      test and bioimpedance

    <description>Patients will receive a booklet of exercises, besides containing an explanation of his illness and the importance of exercise in their quality of life, an exercise routine physical to be held three times a week for two consecutive months. Patients will be instructed individually on each exercise, performing with supervisor that there be no doubt about execution, thereby minimizing any possible mistake in practice at home. For each day of the year ended data should be recorded in a daily monitoring. At the end of two months of the PR program semi-home patients will be subject to review so that all tests should be applied again.</description>
