  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a biomedical study of interventional type which includes 29 patients on 9 months: 8
      months recruiting and 1 month follow up.

      Patients with hormone dependent breast cancer metastatic or non-metastatic, for which an
      indication of hormonal therapy treatment (with tamoxifen or anti-aromatase) is retained, will
      be enrolled in this study.

      The main objective of this study is to evaluate the feasibility for the determination of
      Oxysterols (CT, CE, OCDO) in this patient population, before and after the initiation of
      treatment (ie, at D0 before and D28 after beginning of treatment).

    <description>Oxysterols measured are the following : OCDO (6-oxo-cholestan-3 beta, 5 alpha-diol), CE (cholesterol-5,6-eposides) and CT (cholestane-3 beta, 5 alpha, 6 beta-triol).
Calibration curve will be established for each Oxysterol by GC/MS using deuterated analogues of each oxysterols for the quantification.</description>

          3. Patient that should receive a chemotherapy and / or another targeted therapy (other
             than hormonal therapy) for the treatment of the breast cancer.

          4. Any other medical or psychiatric condition or laboratory abnormality severe, acute or
