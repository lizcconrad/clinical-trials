      This study seeks to determine whether screening pregnant women for malaria with malaria rapid
      diagnostic tests (RDTs) may detect placental infection and predict risk of poor birth
      outcomes due to malaria in areas of varied malaria transmission in Africa.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Malaria prevention measures for pregnant women are critical and available, but the
      effectiveness of intermittent preventive treatment (IPTp) with sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine, a
      cornerstone in this prevention effort, is declining with increasing parasite resistance. New
      drugs for IPTp are being considered, but there are disadvantages to presumptive use of the
      few remaining efficacious antimalarials. An alternative approach may involve screening with
      diagnostic tests to better target efficacious antimalarial treatment to asymptomatic women
      with laboratory evidence of malaria infection. Light microscopy of peripheral maternal blood
      misses a large proportion of cases, and PCR is unavailable in routine health care settings.
      Preliminary evidence suggests that detection of parasite antigen in peripheral blood may
      provide an accurate indicator of clinically significant infections and predict pregnancy
      outcomes. Therefore, screening with RDTs may offer an accurate and practical way to identify
      pregnant women who will benefit from targeted therapy for placental malaria infection.
      Antigen detection thresholds vary widely among RDTs, and the distribution of target antigens
      in peripheral blood circulation is expected to differ; therefore, the potential value of RDTs
      in this population can best be established by evaluating the detection of placental
      parasitemia for highly-characterized RDTs, enabling results to be extrapolated to other
      products and programs. The study described here is proposed to address this question.

        Women presenting for routine antenatal care in the second and third trimesters of

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Specific participant selection criteria include:

          1. Presenting for care after quickening and before onset of labor (i.e. in the second or
             third trimester of pregnancy)

          2. Age between 16 years and 44 years, inclusive

          3. Willingness and ability to follow up with study visits and activities through the
             duration of pregnancy and at delivery

          4. Absence of history of serious adverse reaction to sulfa drugs

          5. Absence of history of serious adverse reaction to artemisinin-based drugs (depending
             on national policy on treatment of malaria in pregnancy)

          6. Absence of HIV infection (both because guidelines for malaria prevention in pregnancy
             for HIV-infected women differ from those for HIV-negative women, and in order to avoid
             confounding of pregnancy outcomes by HIV-related complications or treatments in this
             early evaluation)

          7. Absence of history of or current obstetrical complications (e.g. pre-eclampsia,
             eclampsia, hypertension during pregnancy, post-partum hemorrhage, evidence of multiple
             gestation)

          8. Absence of chronic disease (e.g. diabetes mellitus, sickle cell disease)

          9. Absence of evidence of severe acute disease requiring inpatient management or referral

         10. Provision of written informed consent

         11. Enrollment Hb ≥7 g/dL
