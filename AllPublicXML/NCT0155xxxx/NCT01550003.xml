      A Multicenter, Open-label Study to Assess the Pharmacokinetics, Safety and Efficacy of
      Certolizumab Pegol in Children and Adolescents With Moderately to Severely Active
      Polyarticular-course Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis (JIA).

      The overall study consists of a Screening Period of up to 4 weeks and an Open-Label Treatment
      Period which will continue until the approval of the marketing application for the
      Polyarticular-course Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis (JIA) indication in the subject's country
      or region or until further notice from UCB (approximately 4-6 years duration; depending on
      region). A Final Visit will be conducted 12 weeks after last dose of study medication.
      Overall, study visits will occur monthly during the first 6 months and every 2 months
      afterwards. All patients will receive active treatment with Certolizumab Pegol. The dose will
      depend on actual weight. Home dosing will be allowed between study visits.

      If less than 50 % of the study population achieves an adequate response to the treatment
      (American College of Rheumatology Pediatric 30 % (PedACR30) response) at Week 16, the study
      will be entirely discontinued.

    <description>CZP will be administered subcutaneously as a fixed dose based on weight every 2 weeks (Q2W) or every 4 weeks (Q4W) throughout the study.
CZP will be provided by UCB as a CZP 200 mg/ml solution for single subcutaneous (sc) injection, in a single use prefilled syringe (PFS). Each PFS contains an extractable volume of 0.25 mL, 0.5 mL or 1 mL of CZP solution.
Eligible subjects will begin with 3 loading doses of CZP followed by a treatment dose for the duration of the study based on the weight range:
10 to &lt; 20 kg: Loading dose = 50 mg Q2W (1 x 0.25 mL sc); treatment dose = 50 mg Q4W (1 x 0.25 mL sc);
20 to &lt; 40 kg: Loading dose = 100 mg Q2W (1 x 0.5 mL sc,); treatment dose = 50 mg Q2W (1 x 0.25 mL sc);
≥ 40 kg: Loading dose = 200 mg Q2W (1 x 1.0 mL sc); treatment dose = 100 mg Q2W (1 x 0.5 mL sc);</description>
