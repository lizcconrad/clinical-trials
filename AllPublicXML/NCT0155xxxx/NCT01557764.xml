    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies the effectiveness of lapatinib ditosylate (lapatinib) together
      with trastuzumab in treating patients with HER2-negative breast cancer that carries HER2 gene
      mutations. Lapatinib may kill tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell
      division and growth. Trastuzumab, a monoclonal antibody, may block the ability of tumor cells
      to grow and spread. Giving lapatinib together with trastuzumab may provide a more effective
      treatment for patients with this type of cancer.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patient must have histologically or cytologically confirmed metastatic breast cancer

          -  The breast cancer has been tested negative for HER2 (0 or 1+ by immunohistochemistry
             [IHC] or non-amplified by fluorescence in-situ hybridization [FISH])

          -  Patient may have measurable or evaluable disease

          -  If given prior radiotherapy and/or prior chemotherapy, the patient must have completed
             radiation therapy and be at least 1 week from the last chemotherapy administration,
             with adequate recovery of bone marrow and organ functions, before starting lapatinib
             or trastuzumab

             * Note that the HER2 sequencing analysis can be performed while patient is receiving
             other systemic therapies so the results could be used to determine whether the patient
             is eligible to receive lapatinib and trastuzumab when disease progresses from current
             therapy

          -  Patient must have had at least one lines of systemic therapy for metastatic breast
             cancer

          -  Patient must have disease that progressed on his/her most recent treatment regimen

          -  Patient must be &gt; 18 years of age.

          -  Patient must have an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status =&lt; 2

          -  Total bilirubin =&lt; 1.5 x institutional upper limit of normal (IULN) unless due to
             Gilbert's syndrome

          -  Creatinine =&lt; 1.5 x IULN

          -  Patient must have a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) &gt;= institutional lower
             limit of normal (ILLN) to be eligible for study treatment; to avoid the cost of
             screening, patients with known recent LVEF &lt; LLN or symptoms of congestive heart
             failure are not eligible for registration

          -  Women of childbearing potential (WOCBP) and men must agree to use adequate
             contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control, abstinence) prior to study
             entry and for the duration of study participation; should a woman become pregnant or
             suspect she is pregnant while participating in this study, she must inform her

             either in the primary or metastatic tumor are eligible for study therapy with
             lapatinib and trastuzumab; those without mutations in HER2 are not eligible for study
             drug therapy; information and tissue collected from patients without HER2 mutations
             will be used for molecular epidemiology studies of HER2 negative breast cancer

        Exclusion Criteria:

             limit compliance with study requirements

          -  Patient must not have acute or currently active/requiring antiviral therapy hepatic or
             biliary disease (with the exception of patients with Gilbert's syndrome, asymptomatic
