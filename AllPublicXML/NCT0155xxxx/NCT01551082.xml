  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Discharging patients home with air leak and chest tube to portable drainage device after
      thoracic resection is cost effective and safe without compromising patients outcome or
      satisfaction. Despite good outcomes this practice is not done universally by thoracic
      surgeons.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Medical chart database to identify patients ,of one thoracic surgeon over the last seven
      years, who underwent thoracic resection and were discharged home with an air leak and chest
      tube to portable drainage device was completed. Once all patients were identified, all
      possible vulnerable patients were discarded. Written consent for participation was obtained
      by eligible patients and subjects willing to participate were given further explanation of
      the study. All willing participants completed an Outpatient Chest Tube Quality of Life
      Questionnaire. Upon completion of the questionnaire participants involvement in the study was
      complete. Data was collected and correlations between variables statistically analysed to
      determine significant factors affecting care.
