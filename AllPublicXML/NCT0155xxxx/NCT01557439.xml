      Primary Objective of this pivotal study was to assess the bioequivalence between Test
      Product: Levocetirizine Dihydrochloride 5 mg Tablets of M/s Ipca Laboratories Limited, India
      and the corresponding Reference Product: Xyzal® (levocetirizine dihydrochloride) 5 mg Tablets
      of M/s UCB Inc.,USA, under fasting condition in normal, healthy, adult, human subjects in a
      randomized crossover study.

      Secondary Objective was to monitor the safety and tolerability of a single oral dose of
      Levocetirizine Dihydrochloride 5 mg Tablets in normal,healthy, adult, human subjects.

      The study was conducted with 28 healthy adult subjects. In each study period, a single 5 mg
      dose of either test or reference was administered to the subjects as per the randomization
      schedule in each study period with about 240 mL of water at ambient temperature in sitting
      position.

      The duration of the clinical phase was approximately 11 days including washout period of at
      least 7 days between administrations of study drug in each study period.
