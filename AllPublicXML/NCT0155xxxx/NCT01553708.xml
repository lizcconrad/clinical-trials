  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Partial thickness burn wounds are most likely to heal within 2-3 weeks mainly by mechanism of
      epithelialization. However, it depends on the depth of the wounds and patient condition.
      Infection is one of the most common complications causing delay in wound healing which might
      affect to quality of patient's life. Generally, the standard treatment of partial thickness
      burn wound is topical 1% silver sulfadiazine cream. Previous studies had been reported the
      broad spectrum antimicrobial activity of silver sulfadiazine cream but it did not demonstrate
      the accelerating effect of wound healing. Therefore, the combination of substance which can
      promote wound healing to topical silver sulfadiazine cream might benefit for partial
      thickness burn wound treatment.

      The objective of this study was to compare the results of partial thickness burn wound
      treatment at burn unit, Siriraj hospital with topical cream containing 1% silver sulfadiazine
      plus 6% epidermal growth factor (EGF) and 1% silver zinc sulfadiazine. The demographic data
      (age, sex, %body surface area burn), time of wound closure, pain and itching, dose and type
      of pain and itching medication, adverse effect of topical medication, some laboratory results
      and cost of expenses.

      This is the prospective, double blinded, randomize-controlled study. The sample sizes were
      partial thickness burn wound patients who were treated at burn unit, Siriraj hospital.
      Patients were allocated into 2 groups receiving treatment with either topical silver
      sulfadiazine plus EGF or silver zinc sulfadiazine. All parameter data were analyzed with
      repeated measure ANOVA and independent t-test.
