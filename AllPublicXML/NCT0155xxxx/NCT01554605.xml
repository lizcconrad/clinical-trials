    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to investigate the role of gait disturbance as a cause for
      difference in Bone Mineral Density (BMD) between both hips. Each subject will undergo the
      following tests: Functional Mobility Testing, Gait analysis, Motion Analysis, Assessments for
      Balance and Gait and Cognitive assessments.
