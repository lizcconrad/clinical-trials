      This study is a Phase I/II, multicenter, randomized, study of the efficacy and safety of
      ranibizumab injection monotherapy verses a duel therapy of 0.3mg ranibizumab combined with
      ultra wide, 200° field angiography guided pan retinal photocoagulation in patients with
      CSME-CI secondary to diabetes mellitus (Type 1 or 2).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Approximately 40 eyes will be randomized at 3 investigational centers in the United States.
      This study consists of a screening period of up to 14 days (Days -14 to -1), and a 36-month
      treatment period (Day 0 to Month 36). Subjects who provide consent will enter the screening
      period to determine eligibility. As part of the screening process, the examining investigator
      will evaluate the macular foveal avascular zone fluorescein images to determine subjects'
      eligibility. Eligible subjects will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio so that approximately 20
      eyes will receive 0.3 mg ranibizumab monotherapy, and approximately 20 eyes will receive 0.3
      mg ranibizumab combined with Ultra wide 200° field angiogram guided targeted pan retinal
      photocoagulation (PRP). Subjects must meet VA and retinal thickness eligibility requirements
      during the screening period. The subject can have both eyes in the study. If both eyes are
      eligible, one eye will be randomized, to cohort 1 while the other eye will be randomized to
      the cohort 2. A subject with both eyes in the trial will have each eye in a separate cohort.

After the first session of PRP, subject's will have ultra wide 200º field angiography performed every 3 months to indicate areas of peripheral ischemia, which will be selectively treated at V9 (Month 6), V21 (Month 18), and V28 (Month 25), preserving areas of more perfused retina. This will minimize any visual field loss secondary to nonselective pan-retinal photocoagulation.</description>
