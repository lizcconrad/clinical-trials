  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to create a model using intra-operative modified SOFA score and
      peri-operative clinical factors to predict prolonged stay in the cardiac intensive care unit
      (CICU) for adult cardiac surgery with heart-lung machine

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cardiac surgery using cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) is commonly associated with a systemic
      inflammatory response that exacerbates peri-operative life-threatening complications and
      multiple organ dysfunction syndromes. These features can prolong the stay in the CICU. Many
      peri-operative clinical risk factors contribute to those adverse outcomes resulting in
      prolonged CICU stay. If the investigators can create a model to identify the effects of these
      intra-operative clinical risk factors to prolonged CICU stay

    <time_frame>24 hours after CPB</time_frame>
    <description>Blood samples were collected for cytokines investigation and leukocyte counts. Clinical scoring systems , major peri-operative clinical risk factors were calculated and recorded at each time point. Univariate odds ratio were calculated for each factors for prolonged CICU stay. Those significant factors were included in logistic regression model for analysis of adjusted odds ratios. Then, a model for prolonged CICU stay is constructed.</description>
