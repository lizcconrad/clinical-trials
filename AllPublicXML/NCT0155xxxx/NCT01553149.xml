      This randomized phase II trial studies how well low-dose lenalidomide works compared with
      high-dose lenalidomide in treating younger patients with juvenile pilocytic astrocytomas or
      optic nerve pathway gliomas that have come back (recurrent), have not responded to treatment
      (refractory), or are growing, spreading, or getting worse (progressive). Lenalidomide may
      stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking blood flow to the tumor. It is not yet known
      whether low-dose lenalidomide is more or less effective than high-dose lenalidomide in
      treating patients with juvenile pilocytic astrocytomas or optic nerve pathway gliomas.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the objective response rate in children with recurrent, refractory, or
      progressive juvenile pilocytic astrocytomas and optic pathway gliomas who are treated with
      Regimen A low-dose (20 mg/m^2/dose) or Regimen B high-dose (115 mg/m^2/dose) lenalidomide.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To estimate the event-free survival (EFS) (based on standard two-dimensional tumor
      measurements, determined by each institution) of children with recurrent, refractory, or
      progressive juvenile pilocytic astrocytomas and optic pathway gliomas who are treated with
      lenalidomide.

      II. To compare response categories and EFS across the 3 magnetic resonance (MR) sequences
      (T2-weighted, fluid attenuated inversion recovery [FLAIR], T1-weighted post-contrast).

      III. To correlate steady-state pharmacokinetics of lenalidomide (1 sample obtained between
      days 5-21) with objective response and EFS.

      IV. To evaluate toxicities of long-term lenalidomide use.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

      ARM I (Regimen A): Patients receive low-dose lenalidomide orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days
      1-21. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 26 courses in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      ARM II (Regimen B): Patients receive high-dose lenalidomide PO QD on days 1-21. Treatment
      repeats every 28 days for up to 26 courses in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up annually for approximately 3
      years.

    <description>Correlation of lenalidomide concentration obtained from the steady-state sample and the number of cycles received prior to the occurrence of disease progression will be performed using Pearson's correlation coefficient.

    <description>Response categories (complete response, partial response, stable disease, and progression) will be determined from the following three standard magnetic resonance sequences, T2-weighted, fluid attenuated inversion recovery, T1-weighted post-contrast. Percent agreement between the sequences will be estimated as the number of follow-up scans in which the corresponding sequence agreed divided by the total number of follow-up scans. Standard error will be estimated by use of the bootstrap method to account for the correlated dependent response data, and these values will be used to estimate the 95% confidence intervals.</description>
