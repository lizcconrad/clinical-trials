    <textblock>
      The Institute of Medicine identifies Prolonged Grief (PG) as a critical under-addressed
      public health problem for which are no empirically supported treatments. The purpose of this
      application is to pilot-test Behavioral Activation (BA) therapy for PG. BA is a well
      supported, stand alone intervention for depression and recently applied to posttraumatic
      stress disorder, which reduces rumination and avoidance behaviors that otherwise thwart
      access to natural rewarding contingencies and resources. The treatment focuses on promoting
      stable, active routines, self-care behaviors, enhanced self-efficacy, and reengagement with
      pleasurable activities and significant social resources. Rumination, disengagement, and low
      self-efficacy are defining features of PG. Further, in response to loss of intimates, the key
      factors that differentiate resilient people from those that have difficulties adapting is the
      maintenance or fast resumption of social and occupational functioning. Thus, the main
      hypothesis of this study is that BA for PG will result in clinically significant reductions
      in rumination and functional disengagement. This is a preliminary small-scale pilot
      assessment of potential efficacy and feasibility of completing a large scale study of BA for
      PG.

    <description>Behavioral Activation for Major Depressive Disorder (BA; Martell, Addis, &amp; Jacobson, 2001) is based on behavioral theories of depression, which posit that psychopathology occurs when active, goal-directed behavioral repertoires have been either unreinforced or punished. These aversive consequences tend to reinforce escape and avoidance behavior, such as passively ruminating on unmet needs and/or deprivations, rather than actively engaging the environment. BA employs operant conditioning principles to increase active, goal-directed behavioral strategies and decrease passive or avoidant behavioral strategies to help people engage with and obtain adequate reinforcement from their environment. Use of BA was based research suggesting that disengagement/avoidance is related to prolonged pathology after loss</description>
