      RATIONALE: Modern radiotherapy techniques in a neoadjuvant setting have the potential to
      minimize morbidity and maximize efficacy. An additional boost dose can be provided locally by
      HDR-brachytherapy in patients with positive margins after tumor resection.

      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying the safety and efficacy of a combination of modern
      radiotherapy elements applied to the tumor and small volumes of surrounding normal tissue
      (IMRT, IGRT; brachytherapy in case of positive resection margin) and see how well it works in
      treating patients with High-Risk Soft Tissue Sarcoma of the Extremities.
