      The purpose of this study is to respond to The French Health Authority which has requested
      BMS France and Astra Zeneca (AZ) France to set-up a long-term cohort study in a
      representative sample of French Type 2 Diabetes mellitus (T2D) patients treated with
      Saxagliptin to generate real world data on drug utilization, joint population, non
      comparative effectiveness and safety
