  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to investigate water flow in dental devices and to
      understand the function of water flow behind oral hygiene improvements. Understanding this
      mechanism may help with the design of future products.

      The overall clinical response (plaque, gingivitis, bleeding) in participants with varying
      stages of gingival health as well as the causative or indicative hallmarks of selected
      biological responses underpinning the overt clinical manifestations described above will be
      evaluated. The chief biological response that will be investigated is how a reduction in the
      concentration of bacterial lipopolysaccharide endotoxins (LPS) in interproximal plaque may
      influence improvements in the clinical response (e.g., through mitigation of bleeding) when
      compared to a change in the plaque biomass within which a large component of the endotoxins
      reside. The hypothesis is that improvements in clinical bleeding may result more from the
      removal or reduction of toxic bacterial products that serve as the direct impetus of the
      inflammatory response rather than from sheer bulk removal of interproximal plaque. From a
      methods development perspective, this study will also assess the feasibility of measuring
      endotoxin load from clinical samples. Ultimately it is anticipated that a comprehensive
      evaluation of clinical benefits conferred by continuous fluid streaming will emerge upon
      analysis of the relationships between clinical and biological data sets, particularly where
      causal relationships may exist between both parameters.
