      The investigators propose that inability to tolerate the distress of opioid withdrawal and
      the negative affect associated with early abstinence are key factors in early illicit opioid
      lapse and subsequent buprenorphine treatment drop-out. Our intervention aimed at increasing
      distress tolerance is designed to increase treatment adherence.
