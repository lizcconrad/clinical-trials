  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether a single intracoronary infusion of
      Ad5FGF-4, delivered during induced transient ischemia, is effective in improving myocardial
      perfusion, angina functional class, patient symptoms, and quality of life. Short-term (8
      weeks) and long-term (12 month) safety of Ad5FGF-4 will also be evaluated. The primary
      endpoint is change in adenosine triphosphate (ATP) stress SPECT reperfusion defect size.
