      This study will enroll subjects who have completed Protocols 209FX301, 209FX302, or are
      currently participating in Protocol 2202 into a long-term study in which all subjects will
      receive active drug (arbaclofen).

      Three studies sponsored by Seaside Therapeutics, Inc., are currently evaluating the efficacy
      of STX209 for management of typical problem behaviors in subjects with FXS. These are Study
      209FX301, &quot;A Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled Study of the Efficacy, Safety, and
      Tolerability of STX209 (Arbaclofen) Administered for the Treatment of Social Withdrawal in
      Adolescents and Adults with Fragile X Syndrome;&quot; Study 209FX302, &quot;A Randomized, Double-Blind,
      Placebo-Controlled, Fixed- Dose Study of the Efficacy, Safety, and Tolerability of STX209
      (Arbaclofen) Administered for the Treatment of Social Withdrawal in Children with Fragile X
      Syndrome;&quot; and Study 22002, &quot;An Open-Label Extension Study to Evaluate the Safety,
      Tolerability and Pharmacokinetics of STX209 in Subjects with Fragile X Syndrome.&quot; This study
      will enroll subjects who have completed Protocols 209FX301, 209FX302, or are currently
      participating in Protocol 22002 into a long-term, open-label study. The open-label extension
      protocol will provide data on the long-term safety and tolerability of STX209 among subjects
      with FXS who receive treatment under conditions reflective of their typical medical care
      rather than in their previously completed study.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Successfully completed all scheduled visits of the previous protocol ( 22002,
             209FX301, or 209FX302).

          2. A parent,LAR, or caregiver must be willing and able to accompany the subject to all
             study visits, participate in phone calls, complete study assessments, administer study
             medication, and report the subject's condition and medication use to site staff
             members.

          3. Prior to the conduct of any study-specific procedures, the subject must provide
             written informed consent to participate in the study ( if developmentally appropriate)
             or verbal assent and the parent/caregiver/LAR must provide written informed consent.
             If the caregiver attending the clinic visits is not the parents, caregiver, or LAR,
             written consent must also be obtained for the caregiver's participation in the study.

          4. Current treatment with no more than 3 psychoactive medications, including
             anti-epileptics, unless the Medical Monitor is consulted.

          5. Subjects with a history of seizure disorder must have been seizure free for 6 months
             and be taking anti-epileptics, or seizure free for 3 years if not receiving
             anti-epileptic treatment. If currently receiving treatment with anti-epileptics, serum
             concentration levels must be tested and be in therapeutic range.

          6. Negative pregnancy test for females of childbearing potential or be using a medically
             acceptable form of birth control.

        Exclusion Criteria

          1. Subjects with any condition that might interfere with the conduct of the study,
             confound interpretation of the study results, or endanger their own well-being. This
             includes, but is not limited to impairment of renal function, evidence or history of
             malignancy or any significant hematological, endocrine, cardiovascular, respiratory,
             hepatic, or gastrointestinal disease.

          2. Subjects who are currently engaged in illicit drug or alcohol abuse.

          3. Subjects who had a serious adverse event (SAE) while taking STX209 during their
             previous protocol (22002,209FX301,309FX302)that the Investigator considered related to
             STX209, unless approval from the Medical Monitor is obtained.

          4. The occurrence or continuation of any AE or condition during Studies 22002, 209FX301,
             or 209FX302 that, in the opinion of the Investigator, should exclude this subject from
             participating in the open-label extension.

          5. Subjects taking another investigational drug, other than STX209, currently or within
             30 days of Visit 1. Subject must not take any investigational drugs during this study.

          6. Subjects who, in the Investigator's opinion, might not be suitable for the study.

          7. Subjects treated with vigabatrin, tiagabine, or riluzole currently or within 2 weeks
             of Visit 1.

          8. Subjects treated with racemic baclofen currently or within 1 week of Visit 1.
