  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Almost half of the Dutch population is currently characterized by overweight and obesity.
      Losing weight is not the problem in obesity treatment, it is the seemingly obligatory weight
      regain after weight loss: the yoyo-effect. The primary objective of this study is to
      investigate the association between the weight-loss-induced cellular stress response and the
      rate of weight regain. The secondary objective is to investigate the differences in cellular
      stress response and weight regain after rapid and slow weight loss. To investigate this,
      subjects will receive meal replacements replacing either all or part of the daily meals
      during the intervention period. THe first group will consume 500 kcal/d diet for 5 weeks
      while the second group consumes a 1250 kcal/d diet for 3 months, both followed by 1 week
      normalization and a 2 week strict weight maintenance diet. During the 9-month follow-up
      period subjects will receive dietary advice according to the Dutch recommendations for
      healthy eating. The association between the amount of weight regain after the weight loss
      period and changes in adipokines, parameters of adipocyte metabolism, in vivo adipose tissue
      metabolism, adipocyte extracellular matrix gene expression profiles, adipocyte stress protein
      expression and gene polymorphisms in selected genes.
