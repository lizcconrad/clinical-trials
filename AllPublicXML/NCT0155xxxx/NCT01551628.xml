      The purpose of this study is to determine whether Recombinant Human Arginase 1 (rhArg1)is
      safe and effective in the treatment of patients with Relapsed or Refractory Leukemia or
      Lymphoma.

    <textblock>
      This is a pilot, open-label study of PEG-BCT-100 in patients with relapsed/refractory
      leukemia or lymphoma who have satisfied all inclusion/exclusion criteria.

      Approximately 15 subjects will be enrolled or when 10 evaluable subjects are included in the
      study. Evaluable subjects are defined as subjects who have received 4 consecutive doses of
      PEG-BCT-100 1600U/kg within 6 weeks from the first 1600U/kg dose and completed the first
      disease response assessment.

      After the initiation of trial treatment, safety parameters will be evaluated throughout the
      study. Adverse event (AE) will be graded according to the National Cancer Institute Common
      Toxicity Criteria for Adverse Events version 4.0 (NCI CTC AE v4). AE and serious AE (SAE)
      will be detected and recorded on the Case Report Forms (CRFs) until 15-28 days after the last
      dose of PEG-BCT-100.

      Patients who achieve complete remission (CR)/complete remission with incomplete blood count
      recovery (CRi) following the 4 consecutive 1600U/kg doses may continue PEG-BCT-100 at the
      discretion of the investigator.

      Patients who achieve partial remission (PR) or stable disease (SD) following the 4
      consecutive 1600U/kg doses can continue treatment up to disease progression. Further
      continuation will be determined by the clinical judgment of the Investigator. Patients who
      have disease progression will be discontinued PEG-BCT-100.

      Blood samples for PK and PD analysis will be collected and analyzed.

    <description>The primary endpoint is defined as the adverse event and serious adverse event related to the trial treatment. The adverse event includes unexpected clinical findings which could be related to the metabolic consequences of acute or prolong arginine depletion.
The following measures will be used to evaluate the safety of the trial treatment:
vital signs
laboratory tests of safety i.e. hematology, blood biochemistry, urinalysis

    <description>The percentage of patients who have disease controlled following the 4 doses of PEG-BCT-100 1600 U/kg.

    <description>The subtracting baseline (SB) method will be used considering the endogenous background of arginase when estimating the PK parameters. The peak and trough concentrations will be listed for each dosing. The elimination rate and half life of rhArg1 will be estimated by the PK samplings during the postponement of trial treatment. The elimination rate will be assumed to be linear and estimated using the non-compartmental model. The individual steady state will be determined by visual inspection.</description>

    <description>Patients will receive weekly IV infusions of PEG-BCT-100, until evidence of disease progression, intolerable adverse events, or withdrawal of patient consent. For safety sake, each subject will receive an induction dose of PEG-BCT-100 500 U/kg and 1000 U/kg at week -2 and week -1, respectively. The study dose of PEG-BCT-100 1600 U/kg will be initiated at week 1 (Day1). Each escalation of dose level will be determined by the investigator according to each subject's tolerability and criteria for treatment discontinuation.</description>
