  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:

      Randomized trials show improved outcomes among acute coronary syndrome (ACS) patients treated
      with Bivalirudin1. Optimal antithrombotic treatment in patients undergoing percutaneous
      coronary intervention (PCI) is crucial to balance the risk of post-PCI bleeding versus
      ischemic complications2. Bivalirudin, a direct thrombin inhibitor has been extensively
      investigated as an intra-procedural antithrombotic therapy in patients with stable angina,
      Non ST-segment elevation acute coronary syndrome (NSTE-ACS), and ST-segment elevation
      myocardial infarction (STEMI). Bivalirudin, when used with or without glycoprotein IIb/IIIa
      inhibitors (GPI) during PCI has been found to be superior to Unfractionated heparin (UFH)
      with or without GPI in reducing 30-day bleeding complications without significant increase in
      the rate of ischemic events3-5.

      Moreover,after otherwise successful PCI,an increase in cardiac biomarkers has been shown to
      occur in 5% to 30% of patients6. Recent studies have focused their attention onthe reduction
      of infarct size and the incidence of periprocedural (type IVa) myocardial infarction
      (PMI)after elective PCI7-8. Therefore, we will perform a single-center, prospective and
      randomized study to assess if Bivalirudin versus UFHis effective in preventing elevation of
      biomarkers of MI after coronary stent implantation in patients already treated with aspirin
      and clopidogrel,with anatomically complex lesion.

      Objective:

      to assess the safety and efficacy of routine usage of the Bivalirudin vs UFH in patients with
      coronary artery disease (CAD), after stent implantation in coronary long lesions, to avoid
      periprocedural myocardial necrosis.

      Setting:

      Single-center, spontaneous, prospective, randomized 1:1 study of Bivalirudin infusion vs UFH
      in the setting of CAD, after PCI with stenting incoronary long lesions.

      Comparison: Bivalirudin vs UFH, in preventing elevation of biomarkers of MI after coronary
      stent implantation in patients already treated with aspirin and clopidogrel, with
      anatomically complex lesion.

      Population:Patients with diffuse CAD undergoing percutaneous treatment on a native coronary
      vessel with planned implantation stents in overlapping with a total stent length &gt;33 mm for
      long coronary lesions in vessels with a reference vessel diameter 2.25-4.0 mm.

      Assessment Following the procedure, blood samples for CK, CK-MB and Troponin will be
      collected at 6,12 and 24 h post PCI. CK-MB values will be considered abnormal if they will
      elevate above the upper limit of normal (ULN). This is set at 6 mg/L by our local laboratory.
      If the first blood sample showed a CK-MB level ≥18 mg/L (≥3 times upper normal limit), a
      second blood sample would be drawn every 8 h later until a downward trend will be observed.
      For patients with two or more blood samples drawn, the peak CK-MB level will be used for
      analysis.

      End-points:

      The primary end-point of this study will be the incidence of periprocedural myonecrosis that
      was defined as a peak post-procedural CK-MB elevation &gt; 1 time the upper limit of normal
      (ULN) alone or associated with chest pain or ST-segment or T-wave abnormalities, in patients
      undergoing non-urgent PCI.

      Secondary end-points will be the rate of MACCE (major adverse cerebro-cardiovascular events,
      ie the composite of death, myocardial infarction [defined according to the Academic Research
      Consortium statement], target vessel revascularization or stroke), the rate of major
      bleedings (Bleeding Academic Consortium [BARC] 3-5), minor bleedings (BARC 2), and the rate
      of NACE (net adverse clinical events, ie the composite of MACCE and major bleedings) at 30
      days, 6 and 12 month follow-up. Adverse events will be determined by telephone interview
      and/or medical record review. Clinical follow-up: telephone-based interviews and office-based
      direct visits will be performed at 1, 6 and 12 months, respectively, for end-point
      adjudication.

      Sample size and statistical analysis: Given an expected rate of abnormal post-procedural peak
      CK-MB &gt; 1 x ULM of 48% (based on results of the INSTANT trial) for the control group and 29%
      for the experimental group (thus a 40% relative risk reduction), aiming for a 0.05 alpha and
      0.80 power, a total of 204 patients will need to be enrolled (102 patients per group).

        Inclusion Criteria:Clinical Inclusion Criteria

        Candidates for this study must meet all of the following criteria:

          -  Male or female able to understand and sign a witnessed informed consent

          -  Age ≥ 18 yo

          -  Patients with stable (CCS 1-4) or unstable angina pectoris (but with the most recent
             anginal episode occurring &gt;48 hours before the index procedure) or documented silent
             ischemia

          -  Ongoing or recent episode (&lt;48 hours) of unstable coronary artery disease (including
             non-ST-elevation acute coronary syndromes)

          -  Stable Hemodynamic conditions (systolic BP &gt; 100 HR &gt; 40 &lt; 100).

          -  No clinical and ECG changes suggestive of ongoing acute or recent (&lt;48 hours)
             myocardial infarction.

        Angiographic inclusion criteria

          -  Angiographic evidence of a de novo lesion &gt; 50% requiring implantation of two stents
             in overlapping with a total stent length&gt; 33 mm and reference vessel diameter between
             2.5 and 4.0 mm (by visual estimation) in one coronary vessel. Multiple lesions in the
             same vessels can be included but at least one lesion should require implantation of
             two stents in overlapping with a total stent length &gt; 33 mm. The definition of
             multivessel disease requires an intention to treat at least two lesions (with a least
             one with the characteristics reported above) in two different major epicardial
             segments. For example, the presence of a lesion in the left anterior descending artery
             and in the obtuse marginal or the presence of a lesions in the right postero-lateral
             branch and in a diagonal branch will qualify as multivessel. The presence of lesions
             in the left anterior descending artery and in the diagonal branch will not qualify as
             multivessel. Bifurcation lesions and ostial lesions can be included, but only if at
             least two stent in overlapping with a total stent length &gt; 33 mm are implanted in the
             same branch. When treating diffuse lesion in the same vessel, overlapping stenting is
             recommended with high pressure (&gt;14 atm post-dilation) of the overlap zone. There is
             no maximum stent length to treat one coronary vessel.
