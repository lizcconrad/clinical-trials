  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) is an important cause of morbidity and mortality in
      ventilated critically ill patients specially in intensive care unit (ICU). It is associated
      with an increased duration of mechanical ventilation, high death rates and increased
      healthcare costs in China. However, VAP is preventable and many practices have been
      demonstrated to reduce the incidence of this disease, but the morbidity is still so high. So
      much more methods of prevention should be needed to reduce the incidence of VAP.

      Statins (3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors) present
      anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory effects besides their ability to regulate cholesterol
      composition. So it is hypothesized that early use of statin may prevent some of the infection
      disease such as VAP.

      Actually, Two studies have showed that statin treatment is associated with reduced risk of
      pneumonia. However, the relationship between statins and reduced risk of pneumonia is not
      consistent.

      After reviewing some of the guidelines,meta analyses and system reviews, the investigator
      find that advanced age,immune suppression from disease or medication and specially depressed
      level of consciousness are the risk factors of VAP. So the investigator assumes that early
      use of statin may give us a favorable outcome in the patients with coma or in the patients
      with severe disease (Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score &gt; 15 or Glasgow
      coma score &lt; 7).

      In addition there is no prospective study to investigate the role of statins in VAP in the
      patients with ischemic stroke. The investigator hopes that this study can approve the
      relationship between statins and reduced risk of VAP in the patients with ischemic stroke.
      And it can improve the processes,outcomes and costs of critical care as well.

      This is a one-center, two-arm, randomized, single-blinded, controlled trial. When a patient
      with ischemic stroke who needs mechanic ventilation is admitted to ICU,a sealed envelop will
      be opened which decide whether the patient is assigned to the placebo arm or the atorvastatin
      arm. During they stay in ICU, one tablet of atorvastatin (40mg) or one tablet of placebo will
      be administered. Atorvastatin or placebo will be administered through an enteral feeding tube
      or administered orally when patients are able to safely take oral medications.

      VAP diagnosis accords with the comprehensive evidence-based clinical practice guidelines for
      ventilator-associated pneumonia:Diagnosis and treatment which was published in 2008.
