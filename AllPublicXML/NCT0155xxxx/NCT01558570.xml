      The purpose of this protocol is to collect serum zonulin levels in people with schizophrenia.
      This one time visit will collect zonulin levels, antibodies to gliadin (tissue
      transglutaminase and antigliadin antibodies) and other information that may relate to
      increased intracellular tight junction permeability as it related to the immune and stress
      system and the immune association with kynurenic acid pathway 50. Data will be collected for
      use in future grant applications and published reports.

    <time_frame>1 day</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will undergo a one-time blood draw in order to test for zonulin concentration in serum (ng/mg) and these results will be compared to normative data to screen for elevations. The sample size for this pilot study was estimated based on the known prevalence of Celiac disease in schizophrenia, a disease known to have elevated zonulin levels.</description>

      Laboratory Measures:

      Zonulin and gliadin antibodies will be sent to the lab of Dr. Alessio Fasano for assay.

      Genetic and Biochemical analysis will be sent for analysis and storage of blood sample at the
      Maryland Psychiatric Research Center Neurogenetics laboratory under the direction of Dr.
      Ikwunga Wonodi. Analysis will include kynurenic acid metabolites, inflammatory markers from
      Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells (PBMC) and future genetic analysis including but not
      limited to human leukocyte antigen (HLA) haplotypes (DQ2 and DQ8).

      Cytokines will be analyzed by the Cytokine Core Laboratory at the University of Maryland
      using Luminex Technology.

      Other standard laboratories will be done by Lab Corp or other contract laboratory.

        Patients with schizophrenia will be recruited by MPRC through their patient recruiting
        network including the Treatment Research Program and the Outpatient Research Program and
        affiliated sites. Patient with schizophrenia may also be recruited through the NIDA
        screening protocol process. (UMB approved IRB protocol HP-00043664)
