  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The duration of treatment of community acquired pulmonary infection varies between 5 and 14
      days according to the authors (22), or even 3 days with new drugs having long half-life (2).
      For nosocomial pulmonary infection, treatment durations are not standardized (5). It is
      simply mentioned the concept of &quot;usual&quot; treatment of at least 15 days. However, recent
      studies used 10 days of treatment without significant decrease in the rate of healing
      compared to usual treatment. It is essential to clarify the optimal duration of antibiotic
      treatment. Indeed, any excessive extension of treatment may increase the occurrence of
      adverse effects (renal toxicities, hepatic...), and induce resistance of bacteria to
      antibiotics (selection pressure), colonization of the patient by Multiresistant bacteria and
      an increase in the cost of treatment

      This is a prospective, randomized, open, multi-center study.

      3.1 Primary Objective

      Show that antibiotic therapy of 8 or 15 days is equivalent in terms of clinical cure rates in
      the treatment of early onset nosocomial pulmonary infection in patients under mechanical
      ventilation.

      3.2 Secondary Objective

        -  Study of nosocomial infections: assessing the influence of the duration of antibiotic
           treatment on the rate of fatal pulmonary and extra-pulmonary infection (definition of
           nosocomial infections: annex XIII).

           • Study of bacterial Ecology: research of changes in the flora of the gut under
           treatment and analysis of pathological samples (antibiotic resistance phenotypes
           +/-genotypes).

        -  Economic Survey: analyze the costs related to the treatment of nosocomial pneumonia and
           its complications in two study groups.

    <description>The primary endpoint of the present study was the clinical cure rate at day 21. Complete clinical recovery was determined by the absence of the following criteria: death, septic shock (except when associated with a documented non-respiratory infection), intercurrent adverse event attributable to the protocol (or for which attributability to the protocol could not be ruled out) requiring modified antibiotic treatment, and patients who relapsed.</description>

    <measure>Rate of secondary infections</measure>
    <time_frame>21 days</time_frame>
    <description>The study focused on establishing incidence of secondary nosocomial infections; number of patients on antibiotic treatment; total number of days of antibiotic treatment; duration of MV; number of patients still under ventilation; number of patients still in ICU; length of stay in ICU on day 21; and mortality rate at 3 months.</description>
