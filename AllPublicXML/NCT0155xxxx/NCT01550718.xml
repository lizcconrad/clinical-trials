  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Alzheimer's disease (AD) is increasing exponentially, with a projected quadrupling of cases
      by the mid 21st century. Individuals with AD are at increased risk for a host of medical and
      psychiatric conditions, and evidence is accumulating supporting the efficacy and
      effectiveness of psychosocial interventions for improving their mood, function, health, and
      quality of life. Such interventions are likely to be most effective when they are implemented
      during the early stages of dementia, when individuals and their family members are coping
      with the initial diagnosis and associated changes in abilities and activities. Recent
      randomized clinical trials by the Principal Investigator and colleagues have developed two
      non-pharmacologic interventions to reduce the social, psychological, physical, and behavioral
      impact of dementia. This investigation is focused on facilitating their translation into
      ongoing community-based programs, such as those provided by Alzheimer's Association chapters,
      senior centers, retirement homes, and other health care providers. The core content of each
      intervention has been retained in order to maintain or improve their efficacy, and each has
      been modified to a 4-week group format to increase efficiency of delivery. These modified
      interventions (ESML-Social and ESML-Ex) will be compared to each other and to a usual care
      (UC) control group. Outcomes will be assessed at baseline, 1-month post treatment, and 4
      month follow-up. Primary outcomes at the 1-month assessment include: social activity
      participation, family communication, physical activity participation, and physical function.
      Primary outcomes at 4-month follow up include overall quality of life and depression. It is
      hypothesized that ESML-Ex and ESML-Social both will have greater improvements than UC. It is
      hypothesized that ESML-Social will have greater improvements in social participation and
      family communication than ESML-Ex and UC. It is hypothesized that ESML-Ex will have greater
      improvements in physical activity participation and physical functioning than ESML-Social and
      UC. If successful, these 4-week programs may be developed into &quot;modules&quot; that can be
      incorporated into programming for individuals with early stage dementia in a variety of
      community settings.
