  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Labor pain is universal and occurs acutely. This is the most painful experience in a woman's
      life. Pain relief during labor is expected to have positive impact on the progress, outcome
      and cost of labor. However, it is controversial whether labor analgesia shortens the length
      of labor and influences progression to cesarean.Labor analgesia can be performed via spinal,
      epidural or systemic routes (intravenous or intramuscular). Opioid agonists (meperidine,
      fentanyl etc.) as well are the systemic agents frequently used for labor analgesia.Results of
      the studies concerning effect of meperidine on the length of labor are controversial.

      Many studies have expressed that meperidine has no effect or effect on the progress of
      labor.This study aims to evaluate the effect of meperidine on the length of active phase of
      labor in nulliparous or multiparous women, who will be randomized into case and control
      groups.

      -  Participant eligibility for the study included gestational age between 34 and 42 weeks,
           live fetus, cephalic presentation, and were in active phase of labour with
           well-establish uterine contractions (3 contractions within 10 min) and cervical
           dilatation between 3 and 5 cm with a partially effaced cervix ( %70 or more ).

        -  Exclusion criteria are placenta previa, placental abruption, caesarean section or any
           uterine scarring, abnormal placentation (accreta, increta, or percreta), multiple
           gestation, fetal macrosomia (≥4000 g), suspicious of cephalopelvic disproportion,
           meperidine allergy, use any kind of labour induction or augmentation before on admission
           for delivery in our hospital.

        -  A Simple randomisation using a random-number table was performed by the investigational
           pharmacy staff, who took no further part in the study.

        -  The primary outcome of interest in this study is the labor duration.
