  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study seeks to determine if non-esterified fatty acid (NEFA) taste detection thresholds
      change with repeated testing. Threshold testing for NEFA taste has been reported by a number
      of laboratories, including our own; however, these studies have reported data for only one
      testing occasion. The investigators seek to conduct repeated testing to measure the
      test-retest reliability of these methods. The investigators believe that with repeated
      exposure to NEFA, a person's sensitivity increases. The investigators are also testing the
      efficiency of testing by two methods (forced-choice ascending trial versus staircase).
      Additionally, the association between taste responses, diet and BMI will be explored.
