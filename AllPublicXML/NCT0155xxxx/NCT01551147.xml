  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objectives are

        -  to determine the effect of ONO-6950 200 mg QD versus placebo administered for 8 days on
           early asthmatic response (EAR) and late asthmatic response (LAR) induced by inhaled
           allergen

        -  to determine the safety and tolerability of ONO-6950 200 mg QD administered for 8 days
           in patients with asthma

      The secondary objectives are:

        -  to compare the effect of ONO-6950 versus montelukast on the % decrease of FEV1 following
           allergen exposure, and

        -  to determine the effect of ONO-6950 versus placebo and montelukast on allergen-induced
           airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR) as measured by methacholine challenge
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will examine if ONO-6950 could alleviate EAR and LAR caused by an allergen
      challenge in subjects with asthma. Patients will be required to have EAR and LAR after
      standardized allergen challenges during the screening. Eligible patients will complete a
      randomized, double-blind, three-way crossover study. During each of three evaluation periods,
      patients will be administered either 200 mg ONO-6950, 10 mg Montelukast, or placebo for 8
      days. Each evaluation period will occur over 8 days and will include various assessments
      following allergen challenge and methacholine challenge. The study does not require an
      overnight stay at the clinical research center.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients of both genders, between 18 to 60 years of age, with bronchial asthma
             symptoms for at least 6 months

          -  Patients with FEV1 ≥ 70% of predicted after withholding short-acting β agonists for at
             least 8 hours prior to testing
