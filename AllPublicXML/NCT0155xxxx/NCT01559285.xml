  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this trial, the investigators intend to examine whether the concentration of local
      anesthetics during epidural analgesia could be modulating factor for change of hemodynamics
      in patients undergoing major upper abdominal surgery.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      One hundred and twenty patients scheduled for major abdominal surgery under TEA combined
      general anesthesia were randomized in a double-blinded method to receive one of three
      different concentration study solutions in 8 ml of volume after the induction of anesthesia:
      0.75% ropivacaine (60 mg), 0.375% ropivacaine (30 mg), or 0.2% ropivacane (16 mg).

      In each group, the patients were divided into two subgroups at the age of 60 to perform age
      based analysis. The acquired hemodynamic data after administration of epidural loading dose
      were compared and analyzed between young and elderly groups in each group.
