    <textblock>
      CLONEMESI is an academic, independent, randomized placebo-controlled trial to assess the
      effect of transdermal (TD) clonidine in improving the symptoms of severe Hyperemesis
      Gravidarum(HG) affecting women in their 6th-12th week of pregnancy. The study has a crossover
      design.

    <textblock>
      Setting. The trial is performed at a single hospital setting after admission of patients.

      Ethics. The study has been approved by our local Ethics Committee and women are requested to
      sign an informed consent. No pharmaceutical company is involved in any phases of the trial
      including protocol design, study conduction, coordination and monitoring, data handling and
      analysis.

      Randomization. The patients are allocated to a random list to receive first placebo and then
      TD clonidine or the other way round.

      Blinding. Neither the patients nor their attending caregivers know the order of
      administration . The outcome assessors are blinded as well.

      Treatment.The patients are randomly treated with and without TD clonidine for 2 consecutive
      periods of 5 days , other antiemetic drugs (promethazine, metoclopramide, ondansetron) and
      anti- reflux drugs (ranitidine, omeprazole) being administered on a scheduled or as-needed
      basis. All patients receive intravenous hydration and supplementation with thiamine.

      Assessment. Physical condition of patients are assessed daily: blood pressure (lying and
      standing), body weight, morning ketonuria. Two different clinical self administered scores as
      PUQE (Pregnancy Unique Quantification of Emesis) and VAS (Visual Analogue Scale) are employed
      to check daily the intensity of symptoms and the sense of wellbeing. The consumption of
      antiemetic and anti-reflux drugs administered in the two periods is monitored .

    <description>PUQE in an acronym for Pregnancy Unique Quantification of Emesis, a validated clinical score for assessment of severity of emesis in pregnancy.
It is composed of three items; every item has a score from 1 (best) to 5 (worst).
The sum range varies from 3 (best) to 15 (worst). Participants are followed for the whole duration of hospital stay (10 days) asking them to score their symptoms daily.</description>

    <time_frame>Mean values of first period of five days are compared with mean values of second period of five days. Change is reported as baseline value - value at day 5 or at day 10.</time_frame>
    <description>VAS is a Visual Analogic Scale formulated in 5 items. Every item has a score from 0 (best) to 10 (worst). The sum range swings from 0 (best ) to 50 (worst). Participants are followed for the whole duration of hospital stay (10 days) asking them to score their symptoms daily.</description>

    <time_frame>participants are followed for the whole duration of hospital stay (10 days) comparing the first period of 5 days with the second period of 5 days</time_frame>
    <description>The patients were randomly treated with and without TD clonidine (5mg patch) for 2 consecutive periods of 5 days , other antiemetic drugs (promethazine, prochlorperazine, metoclopramide, ondansetron) and anti reflux drugs (ranitidine, omeprazole) being administered on a scheduled or as-needed basis.
All patients received intravenous hydration and supplementation with thiamine, during both periods. The use of steroids was allowed as a rescue medication in case of further worsening of symptoms.</description>

    <description>The APGAR score is the most common indicator of neonatal status immediately after delivery.
The test is done by a doctor, midwife, or nurse. The health care provider will examine the baby's:
Breathing effort Heart rate Muscle tone Reflexes Skin color Each category is scored with 0, 1, or 2, depending on the observed condition. The APGAR rating is based on a total score of 1 to 10. The higher the score, the better the baby is doing after birth.</description>

        <title>PUQE Score for Assessment of Severity in Hyperemesis Gravidarum</title>
        <description>PUQE in an acronym for Pregnancy Unique Quantification of Emesis, a validated clinical score for assessment of severity of emesis in pregnancy.
It is composed of three items; every item has a score from 1 (best) to 5 (worst).
The sum range varies from 3 (best) to 15 (worst). Participants are followed for the whole duration of hospital stay (10 days) asking them to score their symptoms daily.</description>
        <time_frame>Mean values of first period of five days are compared with mean values of second period of five days. Change is reported as baseline value - value at day 5 or at day 10.</time_frame>
        <population>A sample size calculation for crossover studies using a model available on line (MGH Mallinckrodt General Clinical Research Center - Harvard Medical School) showed that a total of 12 patients were needed in order to detect a difference of 2 points of PUQE score between the two groups at P &lt; 0.01 and a beta &gt; 0.90.</population>

    <limitations_and_caveats>Efficacy and safety issues are represented by maternal exposure in a critical period for organogenesis and hypotensive effect of the drug.
Findings based on a very limited number of women limit the reliability of results</limitations_and_caveats>
