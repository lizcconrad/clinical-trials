  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of the UpholdTM LITE mesh
      over a 12 month follow up period, using a composite outcome including a good anatomical
      correction for both anterior and apical compartments (stage 0 or 1), no prolapse (bulge)
      symptoms (answer &quot;no&quot; at question 3 of the PFDI-20) and no reintervention for recurrent
      prolapse of the anterior or apical compartment.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Secondary objectives include the evaluation of the following:

        -  Change from baseline of POP-Q scoring at 6 weeks, 6 months and 12 months post procedure,
           including evolution of treated or non-treated posterior compartments.

        -  The proportion of patients with anatomical prolapse (C/D), but who are asymptomatic.

        -  Change from baseline of mean quality-of-life scores.

        -  Evaluation of mesh properties from procedure date through study period.

        -  Peri-operative and post-treatment pain score assessment comparing the various anesthesia
           regimes used (Visual Analog Scale).

        -  Assessment of patient subjective outcomes for overall treatment effects and
           satisfaction.

        -  Objective evaluation of mesh shrinkage by standardized ultrasound measurements.
