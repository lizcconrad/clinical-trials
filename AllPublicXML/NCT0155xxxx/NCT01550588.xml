  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background and hypothesis:

      The appropriate treatment strategy for secondary stroke prevention in patients with
      cryptogenic stroke and patent foramen ovale (PFO) remains challenging. Clinical and
      anatomical variables reported to be risk factors associated with stroke recurrence include
      older age, large PFO, large right-to-left shunting, and combined atrial septal aneurysm
      (ASA), which, however, were not confirmed by other studies. The investigators hypothesized
      that percutaneous closure of PFO could be an effective option for secondary prevention in
      cryptogenic stroke patients with high-risk PFO.

      Trial Objective:

      The primary objective of this study is to assess whether percutaneous device closure of PFO
      is superior to conventional antithrombotic treatment in preventing stroke recurrence in the
      cryptogenic stroke patients with high-risk PFO.

      Selection of patients:

      Among cryptogenic stroke patients, patients who was identified as high risk PFO which might
      be defined as high-risk of recurrence (PFO size ≥ 2 mm or atrial septal aneurysm or
      hypermobility by TEE) will be randomized 1:1 to :a) Device closure using Amplatzer device vs.
      b) standard medical therapy alone. All patients will be followed for at least 2 years.

      Echocardiography Findings for high-risk PFO Digitally, stored transesophageal
      echocardiographic images were reviewed and analyzed by an investigator. Using calipers, the
      PFO size was measured as the maximum separation of the septum primum from the septum
      secundum. ASA or hypermobility was defined as ≥ 10 mm of phasic septal excursion either into
      the atrium or a sum total excursion of ≥ 15 mm during the cardiorespiratory cycle, with a
      base of ≥ 15 mm.
