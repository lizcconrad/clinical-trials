  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study was to evaluate the influence of a systematic extra intravenous fluid
      supplementation during phototherapy in comparison to a fluid supplementation due to short
      term demand in preterm infants.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      60 preterm infants (GA â‰¤ 32 week) were assigned randomly to either receive a fluid
      supplementation due to short term demand (control group, n=30;) or a 20% extra fluid
      supplementation (study group, n=30) during intermediate phototherapy.

      Collected data:

        -  cardiorespiratory parameters(heart rate, blood pressure, SaO2 and capillary refill time,
           breathing rate, temperature) and a pain score was completed at the first day of
           phototherapy

        -  The maximum total serum bilirubin levels (TSB) within one week after onset of
           phototherapy
