    <textblock>
      This is an open, multicentre, prospective observational (non-interventional) study, performed
      in Belgium.

      Principal objectives:

        1. To evaluate the prevalence of cardiovascular risk factors and cardiac function (as
           routinely evaluated) before treatment with anthracyclines of patients with metastatic
           breast cancer (MBC) aged &gt; or = 65 years

        2. To observe the management of cardiovascular risk during and after anthracycline
           treatment

        3. To compare liposomal versus non-liposomal anthracycline therapy (ratio 1:1) on cardiac
           function, outcome and quality of life (EORTC QLQ-C30)

      Secondary objectives:

        1. To evaluate the efficacy of anthracyclines on progression free survival and tumor
           response as routinely measured (e.g. recist criteria, tumor markers and other exams)

        2. To evaluate cardiovascular event type: ECG changes, arrhythmia, decrease of ejection
           fraction, heart failure and rate according to allocated treatment.

        3. To find out how quality of life, e.g. such as described according to EORTC QLQ-C30
           criteria or Karnofsky index is achieved in the various patient subgroups

        4. To correlate the therapeutic choice and posology of anthracyclines for MBC with
           Cardiovascular risk at baseline

        5. To calculate the cardiovascular risk according to SCORE

      The physician will be requested:

        -  To include 15 consecutive patients aged &gt; or = 65 years who will be treated with
           anthracyclines in first and second line MBC. The physician will be encouraged to enrol 2
           arms of 8 patients (one treated with liposomal and one with non-liposomal
           anthracyclines) for observation and comparison. Each arm will be closed as soon as 150
           patients are included at a national level.

        -  To report their cardiovascular risk factors

        -  To provide the results of routinely performed cardiac evaluation before treatment

        -  To monitor routinely cardiovascular parameters during treatment and report them
           afterwards

        -  To monitor efficacy and tolerance of treatments, as normal practice prescribes, reported
           and related to the variables described in objectives

        -  To ensure that quality of life will be assessed with the EORTC QLQ-C30 questionnaire

        -  To monitor and report progression free survival and cardiac events

        -  To record and transmit spontaneously reported adverse events. These will be handled
           according to legal requirements

      Follow-up will cover a period of 15 months following inclusion.

      The study will have 3 visits and 2 contacts:

        -  One visit at entry

        -  One visit after 3 cycles of anthracycline containing therapy

        -  One visit at the end of treatment

        -  Contact at 9 months after inclusion

        -  Contact at 15 months after inclusion

      It is planned to include data from 15 consecutive female patients per specialized center in
      Belgium.

      The total number of patients aimed is 300.
