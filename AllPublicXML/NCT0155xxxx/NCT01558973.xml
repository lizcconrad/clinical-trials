      The purpose of this study is to explore whether frontal brain activation in response to
      stress varies as a function of the presence or extent of early trauma and whether or not this
      effect is greater in women compared to men. To examine the effect of stress on thinking and
      remembering. To examine the separate and interactive effects of stress, addiction,
      withdrawal, and genetics; and to examine fMRI brain activation associated with stressful,
      reward-related-cue and neutral/relaxing audiotaped scripts,visual images and emotional video
      clips in addicted individuals and in healthy controls.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Between ages 13-50 years old (adolescents 13-17 years old)

          -  Able to read and write.

          -  COCAINE DEPENDENT SUBJECTS: meet DSM-IV criteria for cocaine dependence; report
             current cocaine use of at least once a week or more; confirmation of cocaine use via
             positive urine toxicology screen during initial assessments and upon admission to the
             CNRU.

          -  OPIOID DEPENDENT SUBJECTS: meet DSM-IV criteria for opiate dependence and are
             participating in substance abuse treatment including pharmacotherapy for opioid
             dependence.

          -  ALCOHOL DEPENDENT SUBJECTS: meet DSM-IV criteria for alcohol dependence and are
             currently abstinent from alcohol as documented by substance abuse treatment
             participation.

          -  HEALTHY CONTROLS: negative urine toxicology screens during intake appointments
             indicating no history of current or past dependence on alcohol or illicit drug use.

          -  Healthy adolescent boys and girls, with no medical or psychiatric conditions;

          -  WOMEN: have a regular menstrual cycle.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Any significant current medical condition such as neurological, cardiovascular,
             endocrine, renal, liver, thyroid pathology; subjects on medications for any medical
             condition will be excluded.

          -  Any subjects with foreign ferromagnetic metal objects in their body or other MR
             contraindications will be excluded including subjects who work as welders.

          -  Women on oral contraceptives, peri- and post-menopausal women, and pregnant or
             lactating women (as alterations in stress response are associated with these states).

          -  IQ below 75
