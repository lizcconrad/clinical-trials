    <textblock>
      Purpose To evaluate whether adding a transversus abdominis plane block in patients undergoing
      elective laparoscopic hysterectomy reduces Patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) morphine
      requirements during the first 24 hours postoperatively.

      Forty-six patients undergoing laparoscopic hysterectomy will be randomized into two groups:

        1. Group treatment TAP (n=23) will receive the following analgesia:

             -  US guided transversus abdominis plane block performed with 40ml of 0.375%
                levobupivacaine (20 ml per side) after general anaesthesia induction, before
                surgical start

             -  Morphine PCA with loading dose i.v. titrated by the PACU nurse if pain &gt; 5/10 at
                rest

        2. Group control will receive:

             -  Morphine PCA with loading dose i.v. titrated by the PACU nurse if pain &gt; 5/10 at
                rest

      Primary Outcome Measures:

      Morphine consumption (mg) (Time Frame: 24 hours) in Groups TAP and Control

      Secondary Outcome Measures:

        -  Pain at rest and during movement quantified as Numerical Rating Scores (0-10) for pain
           when resting in bed and during cough during the first 24 hours postoperatively

        -  Time to PACU dimission, evaluated as patient's achievement of a White's score &gt; or =
           12/14

        -  Time to home discharge, evaluated as patient's achievement of a PADDS score &gt; or = 9

        -  Functional patient capacity as measured before surgery and whenever a White's score &gt; or
           = 12 will be reached (2minute walking test)

        -  Eventual side effects such as nausea/vomiting

    <textblock>
      After the start of the study, we had a higher drop out size than expected. We therefore added
      a 13% of patient to initial power calculation to compensate for drop outs.

      Total number of patients enrolled = 52 (46 + 6) Total number of patients who completed the
      study = 44
