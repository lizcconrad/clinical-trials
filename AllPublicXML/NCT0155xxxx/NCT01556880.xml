      Mobile phone use is almost a routine part of society worldwide. All mobile phones can deliver
      and receive short-messaging service text messages, providing a perfect medium for delivering
      information and support. Since short-messaging service is little exploited in clinical
      research or practice in Chinese population, this study examined the effectiveness of one-way
      messaging which is less expensive and is easier to undertake. We aimed to determine the
      effectiveness of using SMS to provide pre-diabetes and diabetes information by promoting
      healthy lifestyle modification and reducing the two-hour post-glucose loading plasma glucose,
      the risk of acquiring Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus among professional drivers with pre-diabetes.

Messages prompted subjects to get rid of smoking and eating out, to persevere with the quit smoking attempt with the emphasis on the peer pressure on the smoking cessation by the smoking ban in restaurants.
