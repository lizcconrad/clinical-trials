    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to down-regulate VEGF expression in esophageal cancer patients
      by thalidomide, so to improve their chemoradiotherapy effect. Patients with esophageal cancer
      receiving chemoradiotherapy were divided into different sub-group according to dynamic change
      of their VEGF level,and those showed increased or unchanged VEGF were added thalidomide at
      random. Efficacy and side effect of thalidomide combined with chemoradiotherapy were
      evaluated, and at the same time, activity of thalidomide on esophageal cancer and its
      clinical safely were assessed.

      Radiotherapy:Patients will be conducted CT simulation, and three-dimensional conformal
      radiation therapy (3DCRT) was performed. 1.8-2.0 Gy/fraction, 5 fractions a week, with a
      total dose of 60-72Gy will be delivered for all patients by 6-MV-X-ray of linear accelerator.

      Chemotherapy: Patients will be concurrently administered with irradiation every 4 weeks with
      PT regimen (cis-platinum of 25 mg/m2/d, d1-4; PTX(paclitaxel)of 135mg/m2/d, d1) for 4 cycles.
      For the first 2-cycles of chemotherapy they will be concurrently given with irradiation and
      the remained 2 cycles, after irradiation.

      Administration of thalidomide: Determine serum VEGF level of the esophageal cancer patients
      3-4 weeks after the beginning of radiotherapy, those whose VEGF level, compared with that
      before radiotherapy, increased or unchanged will be divided into two groups: one is given
      thalidomide concurrent with the following chemoradiotherapy, 100mg/d at bedtime for the
      initial week, and if no moderate above side effect occurred 200mg/d from the next week till
      the end of chemoradiotherapy; the other received concurrent chemoradiotherapy only.

      VEGF determination: Peripheral venous blood samples will be taken in one week before, 3-4
      weeks during, and in one week after radiotherapy respectively. The serum VEGF will be
      determined by the double antibody sandwich ELISA.
