  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A proper digital nerve (PDN) defect causes partial or complete sensory loss of the finger
      pulp, which results in functional disability.The dorsal branch of the PDN can be transferred
      for reconstruction of such nerve defects.In this study, the investigators modified the
      Lesavoy et al' technique and evaluated the efficacy of dorsal sensory branch transfer for PDN
      defects. For comparison, the investigators collected a consecutive series of 32 patients with
      finger PDN defects treated using a traditional sural nerve graft from February 2005 to
      October 2008.

    <measure>static 2-point discrimination (2PD) test</measure>
    <time_frame>26 months</time_frame>
    <description>At final follow-up, we measured the sensibility of the pulps and the donor sites using the static 2-point discrimination (2PD) test. The test points were at the center of the radial or ulnar portion of the pulp and the donor sites separately. Each area was tested 3 times with a Dellon-Mackinnon discriminator. Two out of 3 correct answers were considered proof of perception before proceeding to another lower value.</description>
