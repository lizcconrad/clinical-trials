    <textblock>
      This study aimed at evaluation of the metabolic effects of honey, as a supplemental food, in
      patients suffering from type 1 diabetes mellitus. A crossover design (two 12-weeks
      intervention periods) was used to measure honey effects. The subjects were randomized into
      two groups (intervention to control [I/C] and control to intervention [C/I] groups. Each
      group consisted of 10 patients. . The subjects in the I/C group consumed 0.5 ml honey/kg/day
      in the first 12-week period (period 1) while the subjects in the C/I group did not receive
      honey as a control in period 1. After period 1 the subjects of each group exchanged their
      protocol for the following 12-week period (period 2).
