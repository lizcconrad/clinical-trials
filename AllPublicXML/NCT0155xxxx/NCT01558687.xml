  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main purpose of this clinical trial is to find out if cilengitide has an effect on brain
      tumor cells but also particularly on the blood vessels supplying the tumor with nutrient and
      oxygen in patients newly diagnosed with non-resectable (inoperable) glioblastoma.

      In addition, this clinical trial will investigate if the addition of cilengitide in
      combination with standard treatment prolongs life in patients with non-resectable
      glioblastoma. Similarly, the duration of response of the cancer to this treatment and the
      side effects of the therapy will be analyzed. Furthermore, additional data on how the body
      deals with this substance will be collected (this is called pharmacokinetics or
      pharmacokinetic (PK) analysis). In this clinical trial the investigators would also like to
      learn more about the disease and the response to the experimental medication by measuring
      certain &quot;markers&quot;.

      This imaging trial will investigate the biological effects of cilengitide monotherapy on the
      tumor microvascular function and tumor viability in a homogenous non-pretreated subject
      population with newly diagnosed Gliobastoma (GBM). The purpose of this clinical trial is to
      study the effect that cilengitide may have on certain markers of cancer in your tumor and/or
      blood and to learn if there are any disease-related markers that could help in predicting how
      subjects respond to the administration of cilengitide.

      The investigators anticipate that approximately 30 subjects will participate in this clinical
      trial. The clinical trial will be conducted in approximately 4 medical centers in the
      following countries: Germany, Poland, and Switzerland. The investigators anticipate the
      clinical trial will last until the end of 2013. Your participation in the trial may last up
      to 86 weeks.

    <description>Subjects will receive cilengitide monotherapy for 2 weeks (Weeks 1 and 2); thereafter, cilengitide will be given in combination with the standard treatment regimen during Weeks 3 to 36. The standard combination treatment of radiotherapy (RTX) plus Temolozomide (TMZ) will be administered for a maximum of 6 weeks (Weeks 3 to 8), followed by TMZ maintenance treatment starting 4 weeks after RTX (i.e., Week 13) for up to 6 cycles, 4 weeks per cycle.
Cilengitide monotherapy treatment will be given to subjects in Group A for another 10 months as maintenance treatment (Weeks 37 to 78). Subjects in Group A may continue to receive cilengitide maintenance treatment beyond 10 months (beyond Week 78) until occurrence of progressive disease (PD) or unacceptable toxicity, or withdrawal for any other reason. A 28-day safety follow-up will be performed after the last dose of cilengitide.</description>
