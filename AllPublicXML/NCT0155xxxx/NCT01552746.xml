  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Shoulder pain is a well known problem after thoracical surgery. The pathogenesis of the pain
      is uncertain, but mainly a mix of referred pain and mechanical strain to the shoulder. It is
      believed to last a few days. Persisting shoulder pain after thoracical surgery is a problem 1
      year after surgery, but it is unknown if it is related to acute postoperative shoulder pain.

      The purpose of the study is to systematically describe postoperative shoulder pain after
      lobectomy and examine the time progress up to 1 year after surgery.
