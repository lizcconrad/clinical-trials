      1. Background: The ideal method to remove small colorectal polyps in patients who are
           taking antithrombotic agents is unknown.

        2. Aim: The aim of this study is to evaluate postpolypectomy bleeding and the complete
           retrieval rate after the removal by colon snare transection without electrocautery for
           small polyps in patients who are taking antithrombotic agents.

        3. Design: A prospective, consecutive study.

        4. Setting: Municipal hospital outpatients.

        5. Interventions: Polypectomy by cold snare technique (Cold polypectomy) was performed for
           colorectal polyps up to 10 mm in diameter in patients who continue to take
           antithrombotic agents. The primary outcome measure was bleeding within two weeks after
           polypectomy. Secondary outcome measure was the complete retrieval rate of colorectal
           polyps based on the pathological examination.

    <description>All colorectal polyps up to 10 mm found except for tiny hyperplastic polyps in the rectum and distal sigmoid colon are removed. The technique is cold resection of the polyp without tenting and then suction of the transected polyp into a trap followed by submission to histopathological evaluation.</description>
