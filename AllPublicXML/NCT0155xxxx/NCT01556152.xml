  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN) represents a diffuse symmetric and length-dependent
      injury to peripheral nerves that has major implications on quality of life (QOL), morbidity,
      and costs from a public health perspective. Painful diabetic neuropathy affects 16% of
      patients with diabetes. Pharmacological agents used in the management of painful DPN mainly
      include tricyclic antidepressants, selective serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake
      inhibitors, opioids, and anti epileptic drugs. However, only two drugs (duloxetine and
      pregabalin) have been formally approved by the EMEA and the US FDA for the treatment of
      painful DPN. Generally, the available treatment options do not give total relief, are not
      effective in all patients, and only about one-third of patients may achieve more than 50%
      pain relief. Hence newer therapies are required for the treatment of DPN.

      This is randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group study. The study will
      include patients with type 1 or type 2 diabetes mellitus with history of pain attributed to
      DPN for least 6 months and no greater than 5 years.

      Patients will be recruited after providing written informed consent.
