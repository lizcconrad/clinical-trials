  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In the investigators previous study of 51 breast reconstructions (32 patients), we compared
      three different assessments of vascular perfusion of tissue; clinical judgment, fluorescein
      dye angiography (FDA) and laser-assisted indocyanine green dye angiography (ICG). Because
      tissue with poor perfusion becomes necrotic and can compromise the success of breast
      reconstruction, it is important that tissue with poor perfusion be removed at the time of the
      reconstructive surgery. However, it is also important to remove the least amount of
      potentially necrotic tissue as possible so that the breast reconstruction is not compromised
      by lack of skin. Therefore finding the best way to assess potentially necrotic tissue is a
      vital clinical question. In the initial study the 3 different assessment methods which were
      made at the time of surgery were compared to the subsequent development of necrotic tissue.

      In the initial study, clinical judgment was the basis for determining the tissue removed
      because it had the potential to become necrotic. The investigators collected data with the
      FDA system and ICG system, but this data was not used in making the clinical decisions. The
      study followed the progression of tissue to overt necrosis and this clinical outcome was then
      compared to the predictions made by the three different assessment strategies. The
      investigators found that clinical judgment failed to detect tissue which subsequently became
      necrotic in 21 out of 51 instances for a failure rate of 41%. The FDA system predicted larger
      areas of potentially necrotic tissue than clinical judgment, but was found to over-predict
      the area that became necrotic by 82% - 88% (88% if all cases were included and 82% if only
      those cases which subsequently developed necrosis were included). Although the ICG system is
      similar to the FDA system in that a dye is used to assess perfusion, the ICG system has
      enhanced software which improves the estimated perfusion. The ICG system provided 90%
      sensitivity and 100% specificity in the predicted vs. actual necrotic tissue at specific
      absolute perfusion units values.

      Hypothesis: Using the values of absolute perfusion units discovered in the previous study and
      implementing its use in the operating room will decrease all-inclusive necrosis rates to
      below 10%, reflecting a 31% decrease in the investigators necrosis rate.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators current rate of the development of all-inclusive mastectomy skin necrosis
      was approximately 41%. This means that current methods of clinical assessment fail to
      identify regions of mastectomy skin with poor blood flow that lead to necrosis in 41% of
      patients. The investigators know that using the SPY imaging system is more sensitive for
      necrosis than clinical assessment. With SPY Q analysis the investigators hope to obtain 90%
      sensitivity, 100% specificity at absolute perfusion unit values identified in the previous
      study. The investigators do not anticipate obtaining a 0% all-inclusive necrosis rate but do
      believe they can eliminate all clinically significant necrosis that would result in operative
      debridement or removal of implant. The less severe forms of necrosis including epidermolysis
      and incisional necrosis are self-limiting and usually do not require invasive interventions.
