  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this pilot study is to test an artificial pancreas system which uses
      the intra-peritoneal (IP) route for insulin delivery in type 1 diabetic patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      During this study, the investigators would like to evaluate the intra-peritoneal insulin
      delivery as a potential breakthrough method for delivering insulin within the artificial
      pancreas system.

      The intent is to exploit the rapid action achieved by IP insulin to compensate for meals and
      for management of the basal insulin needs. Patients will come for two closed-loop admissions
      of 24 hours. The first closed-loop will be performed using subcutaneous route, whereas the
      second one will be performed using the intra-peritoneale route.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Unwilling to perform repeated glucose checks, consume standardized meals, and/or take
             insulin as instructed

          -  Evidence of cardiovascular event during the previous 6 months, non stabilized
             retinopathy, or clinically significant screening laboratory abnormalities

          -  Pregnancy, breast feeding, or intention of becoming pregnant

          -  Medical condition requiring use of an acetaminophen-containing medication that cannot
             be withheld for the study admissions.

          -  Patient is actively enrolled in another clinical trial or was part of study within 30
             days or whose annual study income is over 4 500€
