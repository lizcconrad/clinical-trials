    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether the drug Leukine (GM-CFS) is safe and
      tolerated by patients with autoimmune myasthenia gravis (MG).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Twelve patients aged 18-80 with symptomatic generalized autoimmune MG that are not being
      treated with medication that suppresses their immune system, other than prednisone, will
      enter the study at UIC over a two year period. The study will involve a screening visit and
      visits at baseline and at days 5, 15, 30, 45, 60, 90, and 120. The study drug, Leukine
      (GM-CFS), is given by injection. Subjects will give themselves one dose of GM-CSF every day
      for 10 days. Study visits will include muscle testing, immunologic studies and
      quality-of-life studies.
