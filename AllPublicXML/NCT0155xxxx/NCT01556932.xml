    <textblock>
      This randomized clinical trial studies ABH (lorazepam, diphenhydramine hydrochloride, and
      haloperidol) gel in patients with nausea. ABH gel, when absorbed into the skin, may be an
      effective treatment for nausea and vomiting. The general purpose of this research study is to
      improve the treatment of nausea and vomiting.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. The primary outcome is the change in numeric rating scale in self-reported nausea on a
      0-10 scale from baseline to 60 minutes of treatment.

      OUTLINE: All individuals who are eligible are randomized to a sequence of treatments: either
      placebo-ABH or ABH-placebo. The randomization list will be generated by the Study
      Biostatistician. Neither the patient nor the investigator will have knowledge of the actual
      content of Drug A or B, so the study will be double-blinded, and placebo controlled.

      Drug A: The dose of the drugs in the 1.0 mL dose will be 2 mg of lorazepam, 25 mg of
      diphenhydramine, and 2 mg of haloperidol in a pluronic lecithin organogel. It will be rubbed
      on the volar surface of the wrists by the subject, for 2 minutes as done in clinical
      practice, at time 0. Drug B: equivalent but no ABH.

      Subjects will rub 1 mL of the first drug, Drug A gel, between their wrists for 2 minutes.

      Subjects will be asked to rate and complete their nausea on the Memorial Symptom Assessment
      Scale (CMSAS). At time 60 two options can occur. One, if there is no effect after the first
      drug in one hour, then patients will receive the second drug. If there is no effect in one
      hour from second drug, patients will stop the study and resume normal treatment for their
      nausea. Or two, if the first gel reduces nausea by more than 1 point on the 0-10 scale,
      subjects will wait 4 hours to apply the next gel. At this point, the study procedures will be
      repeated. After treatment, patients are followed up for up to 8 hours.

      Subjects will be asked to rate their nausea on a 0 (no nausea) to 10 (worst possible nausea)
      scale at baseline, 60, 120, 180, and 240 minutes.

      Subjects will complete the Memorial Symptom Assessment Scale (CMSAS), a reliable and valid
      instrument for assessing relevant symptoms including lack of energy, lack of appetite, pain,
      dry mouth, weight loss, feeling drowsy, shortness of breath, constipation, difficulty
      sleeping, difficulty concentrating, and nausea.

    <measure>The Change in Numeric Rating Scale in Self-reported Nausea From Baseline Minus 60 Minutes of Treatment.</measure>
    <time_frame>60 minutes after application</time_frame>
    <description>The outcome measure for change was calculated from value at baseline minus value at 60 minutes. Subjects were asked to rate their nausea on a 0 (no nausea) to 10 (worst possible nausea) scale. Subjects who were eligible were randomly assigned to two sequences: one sequence used ABH gel first and then placebo; and the other sequence used placebo first and then ABH gel. We assumed that there was no carry-over effect from the first treatment to the second. A paired t-test was used to compare if ABH gel is not better than the placebo gel. A repeated measure analysis was used to compare the two treatment sequences. This endpoint was chosen as the drug gel because it is typically used as a &quot;prn&quot; (as needed) gel in actual practice, when relief is needed in short order.</description>

    <description>All subjects randomized to two sequences of treatments: either placebo-ABH or ABH-placebo. All participants will receive both drug A and drug B.
After applying gel, Drug A or B, on wrists for 2 minutes, time 0. From baseline to 60 minutes of treatment two options will occur. At 60 minutes, if patients have at least 1 point reduction in their nausea score, they must wait 4 hours before switching to opposite drug. After administration of drug, the study procedures will be repeated. Or, at 60 minutes, if no change or increase in nausea score has been recorded, alternative treatment will be given. If the second treatment is ineffective at one hour (total time 2 hours) then alternative usual medications will be given. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for up to 8 hours.</description>

        <title>The Change in Numeric Rating Scale in Self-reported Nausea From Baseline Minus 60 Minutes of Treatment.</title>
        <description>The outcome measure for change was calculated from value at baseline minus value at 60 minutes. Subjects were asked to rate their nausea on a 0 (no nausea) to 10 (worst possible nausea) scale. Subjects who were eligible were randomly assigned to two sequences: one sequence used ABH gel first and then placebo; and the other sequence used placebo first and then ABH gel. We assumed that there was no carry-over effect from the first treatment to the second. A paired t-test was used to compare if ABH gel is not better than the placebo gel. A repeated measure analysis was used to compare the two treatment sequences. This endpoint was chosen as the drug gel because it is typically used as a “prn” (as needed) gel in actual practice, when relief is needed in short order.</description>
        <time_frame>60 minutes after application</time_frame>
        <population>25 participants were consented, two subjects declined treatment, one expired subject. Two subjects refused to continue after first treatment and did not complete the second treatment. Only 20 patients were analyzed because of missing data not done by those two subjects on the second treatment.</population>
