    <textblock>
      In this End Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) patients who need Erythropoietin (epo) hormone will
      get it by a small implant of skin using their own skin, the implant will be treated in the
      laboratory and programmed to secrete Epo. The implant secretes the patients own epo
      minimizing the need for injections for a period of up to 6 months.

      This will be a Phase I-II, open-label, single-center, uncontrolled, tailored dose study. The
      trial will be conducted in Israel at the Tel Aviv Sourasky Medical Center.

      Subjects will undergo similar study procedures and evaluations; however each patient will
      receive his or her own individually targeted dose of EPO delivered via EPODURE Biopumps. The
      targeted dose may vary between 20IU/kg/d to 65IU/kg/d based on each patient's weight, the
      historical average EPO amount administered and historical Hb levels including at least the 3
      months prior to inclusion in the study. The objective is maintaining Hb levels within the
      target range of 10-12 g/dl.
