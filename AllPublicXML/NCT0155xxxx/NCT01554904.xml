  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study will test the hypothesis that training with the Facial-Flex exercise device for six
      weeks will improve snoring in patients with primary snoring or very mild sleep apnea.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Subjects will be studied before and after 6 weeks of Facial-Flex training using portable
      monitoring. There will be 8 patient visits and 2 additional trips to the sleep center to
      return the portable sleep monitor.

    <measure>Snore Index</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline and after 6 weeks of facial muscle training</time_frame>
    <description>The snore index is the number of snores per hour of monitoring. The pre-treatment and post-treatment (6 weeks) values will be compared. A snore is a vibratory noise usually noted during inspiration and associated with vibration of the uvula and palate. The snore sensor in this study is the nasal pressure cannula connected to a sensitive pressure transducer. Snoring is detected as a fine (high frequency) oscillation superimposed on the nasal pressure waveform. The device [Sleep Scout (ClevMed, Cleveland Ohio)] has an automated scoring detection algorithm to identify breaths with snoring. Each breath with vibration is counted as a snore. As the algorithm is automated and the same snore threshold was used for both baseline and 6 week sleep studies, this prevents technologist bias in detecting snores (breaths with vibration).</description>

    <description>The facial flex (FF) exerciser manufactured by Facial Concepts, Inc is an FDA approved Class I medical device for treatment of facial muscle laxity. Facial muscles tend to weaken with age. The combination of deteriorating elastic tissue and facial muscle weakness causes the face to sag. Facial flex consists of two plastic tipped curved lower bars which slide across each other. An external dynamic resistance is provided by elastic bands.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with a history of loud snoring but no observed breathing pauses by bed
             partner (or only very mild obstructive sleep apnea on a previous sleep study within
             the prior year) will be enrolled.

          -  Very mild sleep apnea is defined here as an apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) &lt; 10/hour).

          -  This assumes that the AHI is computed using hypopnea defined as a 30% drop in the flow
             signal associated with a 4% or greater arterial oxygen desaturation.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Prior upper airway surgery

          -  Daytime sleepiness (Epworth sleepiness scale &gt;12/24), (obesity BMI &gt; 35 kg/M2)

          -  Significant arterial oxygen desaturation defined as 5 minutes or more with an arterial
             oxygen desaturation less than 88%

          -  Severe insomnia with less than 4 hours of sleep per night

          -  Uncontrolled psychiatric disorder

          -  Any disorder causing facial weakness

          -  Pregnancy

          -  Temporal mandibular joint problems.

The facial flex (FF) exerciser manufactured by Facial Concepts, Inc is an FDA approved Class I medical device for treatment of facial muscle laxity. Facial muscles tend to weaken with age. The combination of deteriorating elastic tissue and facial muscle weakness causes the face to sag. Facial flex consists of two plastic tipped curved lower bars which slide across each other. An external dynamic resistance is provided by elastic bands.</description>

          <title>Snore Index</title>
          <description>The snore index is the number of snores per hour of monitoring. The pre-treatment and post-treatment (6 weeks) values will be compared. A snore is a vibratory noise usually noted during inspiration and associated with vibration of the uvula and palate. The snore sensor in this study is the nasal pressure cannula connected to a sensitive pressure transducer. Snoring is detected as a fine (high frequency) oscillation superimposed on the nasal pressure waveform. The device [Sleep Scout (ClevMed, Cleveland Ohio)] has an automated scoring detection algorithm to identify breaths with snoring. Each breath with vibration is counted as a snore. As the algorithm is automated and the same snore threshold was used for both baseline and 6 week sleep studies, this prevents technologist bias in detecting snores (breaths with vibration).</description>
