  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This randomized, controlled effectiveness study examines Nutributter programming within an
      integrated package of maternal and child health services offered by Haiti's Ministry of
      Health (MSPP) to prevent undernutrition among young children in Haiti. The aim of the process
      evaluation is to better understand the uptake of NutributterÂ® as a complementary food in the
      diets of young children and its feasibility and acceptability as part of MSPP's package of
      services. This project is being carried out at a public hospital in Fort San Michel, an
      impoverished community outside of Cap Haitien, Haiti.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Length for Age</measure>
    <time_frame>Once per month for 6 months, then once after 12 months.</time_frame>
    <description>Length (measured in centimeters) for age is an indicator of stunting, an outcome of chronic undernutrition during the first 2 years of life. Because our primary purpose is to prevent undernutrition, we are highly interested in this measurement.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Weight for Height</measure>
    <time_frame>Once per month for 6 months, then once after 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Weight (measured in kilograms) for height (measured in centimeters) is an indicator of moderate to severe acute malnutrition and if an infant is underweight, she/he could require immediate medical attention. We therefore weigh each participant to assess their current health status in this regard.</description>
