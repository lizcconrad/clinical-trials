  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study has two main aims: 1) To determine if ingestion of solid or beverage food forms
      will change appetite hormone responses, and 2) To determine whether &quot;learning&quot; (defined as 2
      week daily consumption) about the metabolic consequence of ingesting solid or beverage foods
      forms varying in energy alters appetite hormone responses.

      Beverage consumption has been implicated in the problem of obesity. However, the exact
      relationship between beverages, lower appetitive response and lower compensatory dietary
      responses remains unclear. This study aims to address this gap in the research. For aim 1,
      the null hypothesis is that the energy in beverage and solid forms will not affect appetite
      hormonal responses differently. The alternative hypothesis is that exposure to the
      energy-yielding beverage will elicit a lower appetitive hormone response compared to oral
      exposure to the solid food form. For aim 2, the null hypothesis is that learning will not
      change appetite hormone responses. The alternative hypothesis is that learning will decrease
      appetite hormone responses in the non-energy-yielding beverage more than in the
      energy-yielding beverage.

      The main aims will be studied in 3 phases. In phase 1,the unconditioned cephalic phase
      responses of participants to nutritive and non-nutritive beverage and solid food forms will
      be determined. In phase 2, participants will consume a randomly allocated solid food or
      beverage (either nutritive or non-nutritive) consecutively for 2 weeks. In phase 3, (which
      will occur immediately after the end of Phase 2), participants will be retested for their
      cephalic phase responses to determine if there is an effect of learning on appetite hormone
      response.

    <description>Amount of meal ingested will be determined by presenting a pre-weighted meal and water to the participant at 137 minutes. The meal will be provided in excess of an amount that can be consumed. Participants are asked to eat until comfortably full.
