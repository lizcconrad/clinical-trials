  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Epilepsy is common in childhood. Children with epilepsy are at increased risk of impaired
      health, functioning, psychological well-being, and quality of life. There is compelling
      evidence that physical activity improves the medical and psychosocial aspects of health in
      adults with epilepsy - but there are no such studies in children. This study is to see if
      increased levels of physical activity can influence children's functioning, psychological
      well-being, and quality of life.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There are many unfounded assumptions about the dangers of exercise in children with epilepsy
      - assumptions that may be seriously detrimental to children's health, and that we have good
      reason to challenge. This project explores the innovative idea that enhancing physical
      activity in children with epilepsy will have a positive effect on medical and psychosocial
      outcomes. The primary purpose of this study is to examine whether increasing physical
      activity levels through a six-month walking program, that includes behavioral counselling and
      self-monitoring of physical activity, as compared to varied un-standardized current
      practices, positively influences health and quality of life over one year. The secondary
      purposes are to (i) determine which environmental and personal facilitators and barriers to
      physical activity are experienced when increasing physical activity levels through a
      six-month walking program; (ii) determine if physical activity levels established during the
      six-month program will be sustained over a subsequent six-month period that includes
      self-monitoring of physical activity only; (iii) identify aspects of health that are
      amendable to change with enhanced physical activity, and explore the relationships among
      physical activity and impairments, functioning, psychological well-being and quality of life;
      and (iv) assess if there is a dose-response relationship between physical activity and a
      variety of health and social factors and quality of life.
