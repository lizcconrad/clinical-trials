  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To explore whether there is a different response to omega-3 fatty acid rich diet with respect
      to the hepatic fat fraction % (HFF), triglyceride, and ALT levels between the rs738409 minor
      allele (GG) and the common allele homozygous (CC) of PNPLA3.

      Hypothesis: We expect that subjects homozygous for the minor allele of the rs73049 SNP will
      lower their triglyceride, hepatic fat content, and ALT levels more with dietary intervention
      than the common allele homozygous supplementation.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is emerging as one of the most common complications
      of childhood obesity. It is associated with and predicts the metabolic syndrome, independent
      of overall obesity. Increased ALT levels are associated with deterioration in insulin
      sensitivity and glucose tolerance, as well as with increasing free fatty acid (FFA) and
      triglyceride levels. The prevalence of metabolic syndrome and prediabetes increases with the
      increases in hepatic fat content in a cohort of obese adolescents.

      Fatty liver, independent of visceral and intramyocellular lipid content plays a central role
      in the impairment of liver, muscle and adipose insulin sensitivity in obese adolescents.
      Thus, fatty liver disease may be the hepatic component of the metabolic syndrome.

      Omega 3 fatty acids lower plasma triglyceride concentrations. The subjects entering the omega
      diet study will be consuming an omega rich diet that is tailored to their caloric needs. This
      calculation is based on the patient's weight, age, and gender with the purpose of not
      modifying their weight at all. Weight maintenance is a very important factor in this arm of
      the study. They will be on the diet for 12 weeks.
