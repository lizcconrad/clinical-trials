  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In preparation for future large-scale genome wide association studies, reliable methods must
      be developed for measuring perceived pain and for estimating the effects of potentially
      confounding factors such as appropriate covariates. The major objectives of our pilot
      investigation are to develop optimal methods to characterize the primary endpoint of the
      study—knee pain, and to gather preliminary data on genetic markers in the human genome that
      are associated with a certain pain phenotype. The specific issues for this study will be to
      carry out a preliminary gene association analysis of acute perioperative pain in individuals
      undergoing total knee replacement and to define a pain phenotype that is composed of
      multidimensional domains such as opioid consumption, inflammatory markers, anxiety level,
      degree of catastrophizing, etc. This pain phenotype has to be sensitive enough to pick up
      changes in pain experience that can be attributed to single nucleotide polymorphisms.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In spite of advances in postoperative management and the standardization of postoperative
      care, there is a wide variability in the degree of pain relief achieved which cannot be
      accounted for. The aim of this study is to devise a method for defining a pain phenotype
      sensitive enough to detect differences in genetic makeup between individuals who undergo a
      standard surgical procedure (total knee replacement). This methodology will serve as a pilot
      study for future genome wide association studies. Given the multidimensional aspects of pain
      experience, the phenotype will be combined of various dimensions comprising postoperative
      pain. Reports about single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), which account for some of the
      variability of pain, have been reported in the literature using different pain models. To
      test the sensitivity of our method of phenotyping, the investigators aim to determine if
      variability in our clinical phenotypes can be explained by some of the SNPs published in the
      literature. Patients scheduled for elective unilateral primary total knee arthroplasty will
      be asked to report on various clinical pain variables, fill psychometric questionnaires, be
      subjected to quantitative sensory testing, genotyped for a genes associated with pain, and
      additional SNPs. A composite pain profile will be composed for each patient initially
      examining five candidate genes and related SNPs to find out the SNPs that are significantly
      associated with given pain phenotypes. Samples will be banked for future study of other genes
      associated with pain. Other clinical variables will be collected (e.g. opioid consumption).
      At six and twelve months, psychological questionnaires and pain questionnaires will be sent
      to patient. A model using pain during physical therapy as the dependent variable will be fit
      to the data. Knee joint fluid, urine, and serum will be collected from approximately 30% of
      the subjects who provide their additional consent cytokine and other inflammatory marker
      analysis. All biological specimens will be banked for future analysis. This is a pilot,
      preliminary study which will assess patients prospectively and attempt to correlate markers
      on genes and single nucleotide polymorphisms with patient phenotypes. This method which will
      serve as the foundation for a future genome wide association study of pain. This is a
      preliminary, developmental, prospective follow-up study to develop a tool that will be
      sensitive and specific enough to be used in a large-scale candidate genome association pain
      study.

        <title>NRS-Pain With Movement on POD 2</title>
        <description>The primary endpoint is the pain reported by subjects, using the NRS-Pain with movement on the second day after surgery.The assumption behind this study is that certain genetic variants (e.g. single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) are responsible for part of total variation of certain clinical phenotypes (e.g. post-operative pain here).

            <description>All patients will have whole blood drawn for genotyping, and participate in the various assessments (psychosocial questionnaires, qualitative sensory testing, etc).
Whole blood for genotyping: This study requires genotyping by extracting DNA from blood sample. A blood sample will be drawn once during visit 2 (day of surgery) or any other time prior to that after the signing of informed consent. Four vacutainers of which hold 8.5 mL will be drawn during this time totaling approximately 34 mL of blood which completes the genomic sampling portion of the study.</description>
