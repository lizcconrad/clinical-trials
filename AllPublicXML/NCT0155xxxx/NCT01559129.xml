    <textblock>
      The purpose of this first study is to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics,
      pharmacodynamics and efficacy of pomalidomide (CC-4047) in the treatment of subjects with
      systemic sclerosis with interstitial lung disease.

    <textblock>
      Based upon interim analysis data from the Phase 2 proof of concept study in subjects with
      systemic sclerosis with interstitial lung disease (CC-4047-SSC-001), the study did not meet
      its primary endpoint of improvement in Forced Vital Capacity (FVC) nor for improvement in the
      modified Rodnan skin score at 24 and 52 weeks, for subjects who had completed blinded
      treatment. In this study, pomalidomide was well tolerated with an adverse event profile
      comparable to the risk safety information known for pomalidomide in other diseases. Treatment
      has stopped, but patients will remain in follow up.

    <description>An adverse event (AE) is any noxious, unintended, or untoward medical occurrence that may appear or worsen in a subject during the course of a study. It may be a new intercurrent illness, a worsening concomitant illness, an injury, or any concomitant impairment of the subject's health, including laboratory test values, regardless of etiology. Any worsening (ie, any clinically significant adverse change in the frequency or intensity of a preexisting condition) should be considered an AE</description>

    <description>Forced vital capacity (FVC) is a pulmonary function test. Pulmonary function tests will be assessed at multiple time points by a central vendor throughout the study. Spirometry assessments will include the following parameters: - FVC: Volume of air that can forcibly be blown out after full inspiration - Forced expiratory volume (FEV)1: Maximum volume of air that can forcibly be blown out in the first second during the FVC maneuver, measured in liters (will only be assessed at Screening)</description>

    <description>Improvement in skin thickening is associated with improved survival and may be useful as a surrogate measurement in clinical studies. The mRSS is an assessment tool which is used to evaluate the extent and severity of the skin thickening associated with Systemic Sclerosis (SSc). Seventeen body areas are evaluated on a 4-point scale (0 [normal], 1 [mild], 2 [moderate], or 3 [severe]). The total score, which is the sum of the 17 individual body assessments, can range from 0 to 51.</description>

    <description>The UCLA SCTC GIT 2.0, which has been shown to correlate with other quality-of-life assessments, such as the SF-36, is a 34-item, health-related quality of life self-administered, evaluation tool, which targets GI activity and severity in subjects with SSc. Individual scales include, Reflux, Distention/Bloating, Fecal Soilage, Diarrhea, Social functioning, Emotional well-being and Constipation. The items are scored on a 0 to 3 range, where 0 indicates better health and 3 indicates worse health (except for Questions 15 and 31 which are scored as 0 (better health) or 1 (worse health). In addition to the 7 scale scores, scores from 6 of the 7 scales (excluding constipation) can be combined to form a total GIT score. The total score captures overall burden (severity) of SSc-associated GIT</description>

    <description>The BDI and TDI Indexes provide interview-based measurements of breathlessness related to activities of daily living. The BDI is a discriminative instrument that includes specific criteria for each of three components (functional impairment, magnitude of task and magnitude of effort) at a single point in time. The TDI is an evaluative instrument that includes specific criteria for each of three components to measure changes from a baseline state. At baseline, dyspnea is rated using five grades from 0 (severe) to 4 (unimpaired) for each category to form a baseline score (0 - 12). During the transition period, the TDI assesses changes in dyspnea using seven grades ranging from -3 (major deterioration) to +3 (major improvement). The ratings for each of the three categories are then added to form a total transition focal score (range, -9 to +9).</description>

             criteria to be eligible for the study:

          -  Repeat FVC at Baseline (Visit 2) within 5% of the FVC measured at Screening

          -  Carbon monoxide diffusing capacity (DLco) ≥ 35% and ≤ 80% of predicted value at
             Screening

          -  Abnormalities on high resolution computed tomography consistent with sclerodermatous
             involvement of the lung (eg, ground glass, honeycombing)

        FVC ≥ 45% and &lt;70% at Screening and Baseline (Visit 2) [with or without a documented
        pre-specified FVC decline or fibrosis score]

             prior to Screening

          -  Use of bosentan, ambrisentan, sildenafil, tadalafil and macitentan for PAH within 28
             days (4 weeks) of Screening

             disease-modifying properties within 4 weeks of Screening

          -  Use of any investigational drug within 4 weeks of Screening or 5
