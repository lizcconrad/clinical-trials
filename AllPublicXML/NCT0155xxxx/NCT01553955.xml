  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a device study in some respects, in that specialized centrifuges are commonly used to
      make platelet rich plasma, and we are studying the use of standard laboratory equipment to do
      so. However, it is primarily interventional in that we will evaluate the percentage success
      of trainees in the concentration of viable platelets to more than 4X baseline using a generic
      speed centrifuge and a single spin method.
