      The purpose of this study is to evaluate and compare the safety and efficacy of intermittent
      vismodegib and of Photodynamic Therapy (PDT).

    <textblock>
      This is a Phase II, 28 month, randomized, two arm multicenter clinical study design. During
      the initial 7 months of the study, all 24 subjects will receive vismodegib, 150mg/day. They
      then will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive intermittent vismodegib, 150 mg/day, during
      months 10-13, 16-19, and 22-25 or to receive treatment with PDT at month 10 and at three
      month intervals thereafter. The safety and efficacy of intermittent vismodegib and of PDT
      will be assessed at the time of the subjects' visits to the Study Center and at the time of
      telephone contacts. A Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) will review results for an interim
      analysis when 12 subjects have completed 28 months. The DSMB review will focus on adverse
      events and efficacy results. Subjects will be monitored for the presence of surrogate
      endpoint biomarkers (SEBs) at each Study visit.

    <description>Primary:
i. To compare the efficacy of (i) intermittent vismodegib vs. (ii) the efficacy of photodynamic therapy (PDT) in preventing the return of the burden of surgically eligible BCCs (SEBs) to baseline level following 7 months of continuous vismodegib therapy.
ii. To compare the cumulative diameter (burden) of SEBs in patients treated intermittently with vismodegib vs. with photodynamic therapy (PDT).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The cumulative diameter (burden) of SEBs in patients treated intermittently with vismodegib vs PDT during months 8-28 maintenance period.</measure>
    <time_frame>A Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) will review results for an interim analysis when 12 subjects have completed 28 months.</time_frame>
    <description>i. To assess the safety of intermittent vismodegib in patients with multiple BCCs (BCNS and non-BCNS) during months 8-28.
ii. To assess resistance of SEBs to treatments in patients with multiple BCCs (BCNS and non-BCNS) treated intermittently during months 8-28.
iii. To assess the degree of reduction of SEBs after 7 months of continuous daily vismodegib therapy.
iv. To conduct an exploratory evaluation in non-BCNS patients with multiple BCCs (high burden of disease) of the efficacy and tolerability of intermittent vismodegib vs PDT</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

        The subject:

          -  has had diagnosed at least 10 SEB (of diameter 3 mm diameter or greater on the nose or
             periorbital skin, 5 mm or greater elsewhere on the face, or 9 mm or greater on
             non-facial areas excluding the skin below the knees) during the two years before study
             entry.

          -  meet diagnostic criteria for basal cell nevus syndrome
