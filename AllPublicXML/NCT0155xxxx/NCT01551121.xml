  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      3 Nursing homes in the Limousin region will be equipped with the automated telesurveillance
      system. Patient will be selected by general practitioner and randomized into two groups after
      informed consent. One group will have cameras installed and the other will not and will act
      as a comparison group. Patient will be assessed three times during the study, at inclusion, 6
      months and 12 months. Each assessment is composed of a standard geriatric assessment, a fall
      questionnaire, an autonomy scale (SMAF scale) and a quality of life questionnaire (EQ5D).
      Every falls will be considered as adverse events and will therefore be listed along the study
      and characterized in types and number.

    <description>Patient in the &quot;intervention group&quot; will have camera installed in their room. These cameras can either work in visible or infrared range. They are physically linked to a server that will store and analyze images in real-time. The server works 24h/24 and 7d/7 and will send an alert to the care personnel via their computers and personal pagers if it detects an anomaly. Anomaly could be falls, high risk behavior (patient standing up on its bed), abnormal length of stay in the bathroom, prolonged inertia. It will then allow them to intervene at the right time and the right place. Geriatrician can also review images in order to determine the cause of the incident and then act on each patient prevention and care strategy</description>
