  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) is widely used for unresectable hepatocellular
      carcinoma (HCC). However, the hypoxia caused by TACE in surviving tumor cell leads to release
      of angiogenic and growth factors contributing to poor outcome. Sorafenib can block tumor cell
      proliferation and angiogenesis. The hypothesis is that patients with unresectable HCC may
      benefit from sorafenib in combination with TACE.
