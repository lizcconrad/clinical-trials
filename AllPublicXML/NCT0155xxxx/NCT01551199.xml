      To evaluate the feasibility, acceptability and effectiveness of Multiple Channel Exposure
      Therapy-Veterans (MCET-V) as a treatment for returning service members with comorbid
      posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and panic disorder (PD) in two phases. The first phase
      of the study will examine the feasibility and acceptability of MCET-V.

    <textblock>
      With the increasing number of Operations Iraqi Freedom and Enduring Freedom (OIF/OEF)
      veterans returning from war-zone areas, many will experience anxiety disorders such as PTSD
      and comorbid problems. Currently, about one in every six OIF/OEF veterans experiences PTSD
      and co-occurring PD. Although effective treatments exist for treating one or the other, we do
      not yet have treatments that can simultaneously target PTSD and PD. Thus, recent attention
      has focused on the development of multi-component treatments that simultaneously address PTSD
      and PD. This study is the first systematic investigation of a time-limited, multi-component
      cognitive-behavioral treatment for veterans with specific comorbid anxiety problems. The
      purpose of the first phase of the study is to evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of
      the multi-component cognitive-behavioral treatment in an open trial.

    <measure>Clinician Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS)</measure>
    <time_frame>1-week post-treatment (approximately week 14)</time_frame>
    <description>The CAPS is a clinician-administered interview assessing 17 symptoms of PTSD (based on DSM-IV criteria). Frequency of symptoms are rated on a scale from 0 (never/none) to 4 (daily/almost every day). Intensity of symptoms are rated using a scale of 0 (none) to 4 (extreme). Total severity score is derived by summing the frequency and intensity scores. A recommended cut-off of 45 is used to determine the presence of full PTSD. Higher scores suggest greater symptom severity.</description>

        <title>Clinician Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS)</title>
        <description>The CAPS is a clinician-administered interview assessing 17 symptoms of PTSD (based on DSM-IV criteria). Frequency of symptoms are rated on a scale from 0 (never/none) to 4 (daily/almost every day). Intensity of symptoms are rated using a scale of 0 (none) to 4 (extreme). Total severity score is derived by summing the frequency and intensity scores. A recommended cut-off of 45 is used to determine the presence of full PTSD. Higher scores suggest greater symptom severity.</description>
