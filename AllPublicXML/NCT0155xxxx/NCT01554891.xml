  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The current study will evaluate the initial reliability and validity of a new instrument, the
      INTRuST Structured Assessment for Evaluation of TBI (SAFE-TBI), in three samples of Operation
      Enduring Freedom/Operation Iraqi Freedom/Operation New Dawn (OEF/OIF/OND) veterans. The
      SAFE-TBI is a relatively brief measure developed by INTRuST consortium investigators and
      designed to be given by a trained administrator. It allows for a determination of the level
      of evidence for exposure to a mild traumatic brain injury (TBI) using the following
      categories: Strong, Moderate, Weak, or No Evidence of mild TBI. The first objective is to
      determine the reliability (both test-retest and inter-rater) in a sample of 100 veterans
      recently returned from deployment at Joint Base Lewis-McChord and Fort Bragg (Cohort 1), who
      have screened positive for TBI on the Post-Deployment Health Assessment. The second objective
      is to determine the concordance between the SAFE-TBI and the VA TBI Screen in 100 OEF/OIF/OND
      veterans within the Northern New England VA Research Consortium (Cohort 2). The third
      objective, to be carried out in a sample of 200 Walter Reed National Military Medical Center
      (WRNMMC) and Fort Belvoir Community Hospital OEF/OIF/OND patients (Cohort 3), is to determine
      the sensitivity and specificity of the SAFE-TBI using the INTRuST study &quot;Brain Indices of
      Risk for Posttraumatic Stress Disorder after Mild Traumatic Brain Injury&quot; initial evaluation
      as the &quot;gold standard&quot; for TBI assessment.

          <description>100 OEF/OIF/OND veterans returning to Joint Base Lewis-McChord and Fort Bragg who screen positive for TBI on the Post Deployment Health Assessment (PDHA) TBI screen.
This component of the project assessed test-retest reliability (4-6 weeks), as well as the eﬀects of diﬀerent raters; Research Coordinators (TRCs) vs. experienced TBI Clinicians (TBICs) at the Madigan Army Medical Center (MAMC) TBI Clinic. Cohort 1 included subjects recently returned from deployment in Iraq or Afghanistan to Joint Base Lewis-McChord or veterans served at the White River Junction and Togus VAMC who screened positive for TBI on the PDHA. After the initial interview, the SAFE-TBI will be administered for the second time 4-6 weeks later. Participants were assigned to one of four assessment paradigms (i. TRC time 1 and TBIC time 2; ii. TRC time 1 and TRC time 2; iii. TBIC time 1 and TBIC time 2; or iv. TBIC time 1 and TRC time 2).</description>

Participants were OEF/OIF/OND veterans (seeking care at the Northern New England VA Research Consortium [NNEVARC]) that screen positive for TBI on the VA screen when seeking treatment at the VA. Prior to the second level in-depth TBI evaluation, they were interviewed by a TRC using SAFE-TBI.</description>

This component of the project assessed test-retest reliability (4-6 weeks), as well as the eﬀects of diﬀerent raters; Research Coordinators (TRCs) vs. experienced TBI Clinicians (TBICs) at the Madigan Army Medical Center (MAMC) TBI Clinic. Cohort 1 included subjects recently returned from deployment in Iraq or Afghanistan to Joint Base Lewis-McChord or veterans served at the White River Junction and Togus VAMC who screened positive for TBI on the PDHA. After the initial interview, the SAFE-TBI will be administered for the second time 4-6 weeks later. Participants were assigned to one of four assessment paradigms (i. TRC time 1 and TBIC time 2; ii. TRC time 1 and TRC time 2; iii. TBIC time 1 and TBIC time 2; or iv. TBIC time 1 and TRC time 2).</description>

Participants were OEF/OIF/OND veterans (seeking care at the Northern New England VA Research Consortium [NNEVARC]) that screen positive for TBI on the VA screen when seeking treatment at the VA. Prior to the second level in-depth TBI evaluation, they were interviewed by a TRC using SAFE-TBI.</description>
