  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Preoperative accurately staging T1a or T1b in early esophageal cancer is vital for the
      choices of treatment. At present, the main diagnostic method for early esophageal cancer is
      endoscopic ultrasound (EUS). However, the accuracy of EUS alone is poor. Thus, it is
      necessary to improve endoscopic ultrasound examination methods. This project is concerning on
      the efficacy of EUS combining with submucosal injection of saline for staging T1a and
      T1b-esophageal cancer. Patients and methods: 80 cases of pathological confirmed early
      esophageal cancer were randomly divided into two groups: endoscopic ultrasonography group
      (EUS group) and EUS combining with submucosal injecting saline group (EUS+SIS group). All the
      cases will be performance by endoscopic or surgical resection; postoperative pathologic
      diagnosis will be obtained involving echo, depth, margin and other features. The EUS results
      of two groups of patients will be compared with pathologic results. From comparison, the
      efficacy and accuracy of EUS+SIS for staging T1a and T1b in esophageal cancer patients will
      be validated. Through this study, the investigators may develop a routine diagnostic and
      accurately staging method for early esophageal cancer patients.
