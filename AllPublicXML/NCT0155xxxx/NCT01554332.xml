        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Men and women (non-pregnant) age 21-70 years;

          -  Able to give informed consent in accordance with institutional policies;

          -  Diagnosis of chronic neuropathic pain according to the DN4 Neuropathic Pain Diagnosis
             scale (score ≥ 4).

          -  Documented pain for at least 12 months;

          -  Documented previous or current treatment for neuropathic pain with medications from at
             least two of the following groups at adequate doses: antidepressants, anticonvulsants,
             and/or gabapentinoids;

          -  VAS scores of at least 6 during baselines #1 and 2.

          -  Documented clinical diagnosis of neuropathic pain associated with one of the following
             conditions: facial pain, post-stroke pain, brachial plexus avulsion, or phantom limb
             pain of the upper extremities.

          -  In the group with post-stroke pain, only patients with predominant face and upper
             extremity pain will be included. This will be defined as a difference of ≥ 30% or ≥ 2
             points in VAS scores between these regions and lower extremity (in patients who also
             have pain in the leg).

          -  No change in current neuropathic pain medication regimen for at least 4 weeks prior to
             study enrollment.

          -  Able to comply with all testing and follow-up requirements as defined by the study
             protocol.

          -  Must be determined medically stable by surgeon to undergo cortical stimulation
             surgical procedure.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Alcohol, medication, or illegal substance dependence or abuse within last 12 months;

          -  Trigeminal neuralgia or atypical facial pain.

          -  Post-stroke pain predominantly in the lower extremity.

          -  Advanced cardiovascular disease which renders anesthesia and surgery as unsafe as
             determined by neurosurgeon;

          -  Clinically relevant abnormality (e.g. tumor) on study MRI;

          -  Has cardiac pacemaker/defibrillator or other implanted active stimulator;

          -  Has a medical condition requiring a repetitive MRI body scan;

          -  Requires chemotherapy for the treatment of malignancy or requiring chronic oral or
             intravenous, immunosuppressive, or steroid therapy;

          -  Is unable to comply with study visit schedule and timeline;

          -  Past ablative or relevant intracranial surgery;

          -  A female lactating or of child bearing potential, with a positive pregnancy test or
             not using adequate contraception;

          -  Other medical conditions likely to require hospitalization within the next year.
