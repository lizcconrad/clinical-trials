    <textblock>
      The main objective of this study is to compare results for the detection of circulating
      melanoma cells (CMC) using CellSearch versus EPISPOT (EPithelial ImmunoSPOT) techniques
      between a group of patients with metastatic melanoma and a group of hospitalized control
      patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The secondary objectives of this study include:

      A. To compare the following elements between the two patient groups:

        -  the number of CMCs per ml of blood as determined by EPISPOT

        -  the number of CMCs per ml of blood as determined by CellSearch

        -  the percentage of patients with at least 2 CMCs per ml of blood according to the two
           techniques

        -  the % of CMCs expressing KI67

        -  the % of CMCs expressions S100 (only the EPISPOT technique)

      B. To compare the EPISPOT and CellSearch techniques is terms of the following:

        -  the number of CMCs detected per ml blood

        -  the number of CMCs expressing antigen KI67

      C. To re-evaluate the 2-CMC per ml blood threshold
