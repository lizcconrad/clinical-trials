  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Numbness, tingling, and pain in the hands and feet following the administration of
      chemotherapy (also called chemotherapy-induced neuropathy (CIN)) is a common problem in
      oncology patients. However, more information is needed on why patients develop neuropathy and
      how it impacts their mood, ability to function, and their quality of life. In addition,
      effective treatments for this problem are not available at the present time. This study will
      be conducted in two parts. In Part 1, patients who have finished chemotherapy and did or did
      not develop CIN will be evaluated to determine why some patients do and other patients do not
      develop CIN. In addition, the impact of CIN on patients' mood, function, and quality of life
      will be evaluated by comparing patients' reports on these important outcome measures. In
      addition, genetic markers that contribute to or protect against the development of CIN will
      be evaluated. Part 2 of this study will test the effects of a new treatment called photon
      stimulation (also called infrared light therapy) compared to placebo treatment to improve
      sensations in the feet of oncology patients with CIN. Patients who receive the photon
      stimulation will have greater improvement in sensation in their feet compared with those who
      do not receive photon stimulation.

      This protocol is designed in two parts. Part 1 will use an &quot;extreme phenotype&quot; approach to
      evaluate the phenotypic and genotypic characteristics of chemotherapy induced
      neuropathy(CIN)in a sample of oncology patients who have completed their chemotherapy and
      did(n=400)and did not (n=200) develop CIN. Patients with and without CIN will be matched, in
      a 2 to 1 ratio, on their cancer diagnosis and CTX agents administered (i.e., only a platinum
      compound, only a taxane, or both). Patients will be recruited in cohorts of 30 to 40 to
      insure that the matching criteria are met and the 2:1 ratio is achieved.

      In a single study visit, to take place at the outpatient CTSI CRC (CCRC) at Mt.
      Zion,participants will be enrolled, complete a battery of sensorimotor tests and
      questionnaires, and provide a single blood specimen for genomic analysis.

      Part 2 will be a pilot study of a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial
      (RDBPCT) of photon stimulation in a sample of patients (n=142) with CIN who participated in
      Part 1. Participants will be randomized to receive the active treatment or the placebo in a
      series of 8 treatments, lasting 7 minutes each, across a 14-day period. Participants will be
      assessed at baseline and after the 2nd, 4th, 6th, and 8th treatments with sensory, motor,
      balance, pain intensity and pain quality measures, mood, and quality of life measures. Blood
      specimens will be drawn on treatment days 1, 4, 5, and 8 for gene expression.

    <description>The LED diode wavelength chosen for this study is 870 nanometers. When activated, the photon stimulator is preset to deliver 1800 Joules in a 7 minute treatment period. Patients will receive a total of 8 treatments, to both feet simultaneously, within a 14 day period depending on their schedule.</description>

          5. has a rating of &gt;3 on a 0 to 10 numeric rating scale (NRS) on any one of the following
             sensations from the Pain Qualities Assessment Scale (i.e., numb, tender, shooting,
             sensitive, electrical, tingling radiating, throbbing, cramping, itchy, unpleasant),91

          6. if they have pain associated with the CIN, has an average pain intensity score in
             their feet of &gt;3 on a 0 to 10 NRS;

          7. has a Karnofsky Performance Status (KPS) score of &gt;50;

          8. is able to read, write, and understand English; and

          9. signs a written informed consent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. If they have CIN in their hands, because we have no experience treating CIN in
             patients' hands with photon stimulation and the photon stimulator is designed to
             provide treatment only to the feet.

          2. Women will be excluded if they intend to become or are pregnant or lactating. Men and
             women will be required to take active measures to prevent pregnancy while on the
             study.

          3. If unwilling to provide the scheduled blood specimens they will be excluded.
