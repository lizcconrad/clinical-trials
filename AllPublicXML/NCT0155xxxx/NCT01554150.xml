    <description>The Contact Service arm is effectively a waiting list control. Participants assigned this arm will remain on the service's waiting list during the 3 months of the therapy phase. These participants will have access to a 'Contact Service' provided by the study therapist, where they are able to contact him if they want further information about the study or their treatment options.</description>

    <description>In MOL the therapist has two goals: to get the client to talk about his or her problem as it is currently being experienced, and to ask about disruptions, which are thought to indicate background thoughts coming into awareness. The assumption is that when somebody is experiencing problems that they feel they cannot solve, the only way for these to be properly resolved is for change to come from within that person. The MOL therapist helps the person redirect their awareness to think about the problem in more productive ways. It is present-focused, with the therapist asking questions relating to process rather than content. The therapist does not give advice and there is no homework. In MOL clients schedule sessions as and when they feel they need them and decide how long each session should be.</description>
