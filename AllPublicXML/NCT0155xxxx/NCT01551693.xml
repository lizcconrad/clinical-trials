  <brief_title>STA-9090(Ganetespib) in Patients With Unresectable Stage III or Stage IV Melanoma</brief_title>
  <official_title>This Trial is an Open Label, Parallel Cohort, Phase II Study Evaluating the Efficacy of the Heat Shock Protein 90 (Hsp90) Inhibitor STA-9090 in Patients With Unresectable Stage III or Stage IV Melanoma Who Were Intolerant of, or Progressed on, Prior Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitor Treatment. Two Cohorts Will Enroll Concurrently. One Cohort Will be Composed of Patients With Melanoma Expressing a Mutation in the Protein BRAF and the Other Cohort Will be Composed of Patients With Melanoma Expressing Wild-type BRAF.</official_title>

  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      STA9090 is a drug which inactivates or blocks the work of a protein called Heat Shock Protein
      90 or HSP90. HSP90 is a protein that helps some molecules inside your cells to have the right
      shape. By stopping HSP90's activity, those molecules never get to have the right structure of
      be functional and they are destroyed. The investigators believe that if they stop the
      activity of HSP90, the rapidly dividing cells that are in your tumor(s) may slow down. In
      this research study the investigators are looking to see how well STA9090 works in stopping
      the spread of your melanoma.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  To determine the proportion of patients alive, free of disease progression, and still
           taking STA-9090 at 6 months by BRAF mutant or wild type (WT) status.

      Secondary

        -  To assess best overall response rate and six month response rate by BRAF status

        -  To evaluate the rates of one-year overall survival and progression-free survival by BRAF
           status

        -  To determine safety and tolerability of STA-9090 by BRAF status

      Exploratory

        -  To compare the rates of response and of six-month PFS between BRAF status cohorts

        -  To explore, using peripheral blood mononuclear cells, the relationship between change in
           expression of hsp90 client proteins (e.g., BRAF, CRAF, AKT, CDK4, KIT) with response to
           therapy and progression free survival by BRAF status

        -  To explore the relationship in biopsied melanoma metastases between changes in
           expression of hsp90 client proteins (e.g., BRAF, CRAF, AKT, CDK4, KIT) with response to
           therapy and progression-free survival

        -  To explore response rate and 6 month progression free survival, in subset of patients
           with melanoma expressing a mutation in KIT

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>6-month Progression-Free Survival Rate</measure>
    <time_frame>Disease was evaluated radiologically at baseline and every 8 weeks on treatment; Treatment continued until evidence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Relevant for this endpoint was disease status at 6 months.</time_frame>
    <description>6-month progression-free survival rate was defined as the proportion of patients absent death or progression based on Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST) before 6 months. Per RECIST 1.0 criteria: progressive disease (PD) is at least a 20% increase in the sum of longest diameter (LD) of target lesions taking as reference the smallest sum LD recorded since the treatment started or the appearance of one or more new lesions. PD for the evaluation of non-target lesions is the appearance of one or more new lesions and/or unequivocal progression of non-target lesions.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Best Overall Response</measure>
    <time_frame>Disease was evaluated radiologically at baseline and every 8 weeks on treatment. Median (range) treatment duration was 1 cycle/4 weeks (1-2 cycles; 4-8 weeks).</time_frame>
    <description>Best overall response (BOR) on treatment was based on RECIST 1.0 criteria. For target lesions, complete response (CR) is complete disappearance of all target lesions and partial response (PR) is at least a 30% decrease in the sum of longest diameter (LD) of target lesions, taking as reference baseline sum LD. CR or PR confirmation required within 4 weeks. Progressive disease (PD) is at least a 20% increase in the sum LD of target lesions from smallest sum LD as reference or the appearance of one or more new lesions. Stable disease (SD) is neither meeting PR or PD. PD for the evaluation of non-target lesions is the appearance of one or more new lesions and/or unequivocal progression of non-target lesions. CR is disappearance of all non-target lesions.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Overall Survival</measure>
    <time_frame>Patients were followed every 4 weeks for survival until death, lost to follow-up or study closure (approximately 6 months after the last patient ended treatment). In this study cohort, patients were followed up to 13 weeks.</time_frame>
    <description>Overall survival is defined as the time from study entry to death or date last known alive and estimated using Kaplan-Meier (KM) methods.</description>

        <title>6-month Progression-Free Survival Rate</title>
        <description>6-month progression-free survival rate was defined as the proportion of patients absent death or progression based on Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST) before 6 months. Per RECIST 1.0 criteria: progressive disease (PD) is at least a 20% increase in the sum of longest diameter (LD) of target lesions taking as reference the smallest sum LD recorded since the treatment started or the appearance of one or more new lesions. PD for the evaluation of non-target lesions is the appearance of one or more new lesions and/or unequivocal progression of non-target lesions.</description>
        <time_frame>Disease was evaluated radiologically at baseline and every 8 weeks on treatment; Treatment continued until evidence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Relevant for this endpoint was disease status at 6 months.</time_frame>

        <title>Best Overall Response</title>
        <description>Best overall response (BOR) on treatment was based on RECIST 1.0 criteria. For target lesions, complete response (CR) is complete disappearance of all target lesions and partial response (PR) is at least a 30% decrease in the sum of longest diameter (LD) of target lesions, taking as reference baseline sum LD. CR or PR confirmation required within 4 weeks. Progressive disease (PD) is at least a 20% increase in the sum LD of target lesions from smallest sum LD as reference or the appearance of one or more new lesions. Stable disease (SD) is neither meeting PR or PD. PD for the evaluation of non-target lesions is the appearance of one or more new lesions and/or unequivocal progression of non-target lesions. CR is disappearance of all non-target lesions.</description>
        <time_frame>Disease was evaluated radiologically at baseline and every 8 weeks on treatment. Median (range) treatment duration was 1 cycle/4 weeks (1-2 cycles; 4-8 weeks).</time_frame>
