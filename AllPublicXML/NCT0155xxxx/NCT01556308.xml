      Introduction: Epidermolysis Bullosa Simplex-Dowling-Meara (DM-EBS) is a rare genodermatosis
      characterized by spontaneous or post traumatic large cutaneous blisters. No curative
      treatment is actually available. Some data suggest a role of inflammation in the occurrence
      of blisters. The aim of this study is to study the epidermis inflammatory mechanisms in
      DM-EBS.

      Material and methods: A first retrospective immunohistochemical study will be led on
      remainder skin biopsies of DM-EBS patients took for the diagnosis. A second clinical
      multicentric prospective study will be led on 8 patients older than 1 year with severe
      DM-EBS. After informed written consent, they will answer to a standardized questionnaire. In
      case of flare of the disease, the liquid and the top of the blisters will be took. Samples
      will be analyzed in the Pr Nicolas 851 INSERM unit. After centrifugation of the liquid
      blisters, the repartition of inflammatory cells will be evaluated by Fluorescence Activated
      Cell Sorting on the pellet. Markers of inflammation will be evaluated on the surnageant with
      Luminex® technical with a multiplex targeting cytokines and chemokines. An immuno-histochemic
      analysis in association with a quantitative PCR will be made on the top of the blisters. If
      unknown, genotypic study will be made.

      Perspectives: A better comprehension of physiopathological mechanisms in DM-EBS could offer
      new therapeutic ways.
