  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic pain, by definition, persists over long periods of time, but both sufferers of pain
      and their caregivers are aware that pain levels can fluctuate greatly over time. Being able
      to define pain variability and its underlying causes would be an important advance in our
      understanding of chronic pain, and would in turn lead to better approaches to the treatment
      of chronic pain. In this study, the investigators propose to evaluate in 60 people with
      chronic pain of the knee due to osteoarthritis over 3 months, collecting data regarding
      magnitude of pain, physical activity level, and medication status twice daily during this
      period of time. The investigators then will assess the variability in pain levels over time,
      the frequency of &quot;flares&quot; of osteoarthritis (OA) pain and their relationship to physical
      activity, medications, and clinical descriptors of the population, e.g., age, gender, body
      mass index (BMI). Additionally, evaluations will be made regarding temporal patterns of OA
      knee pain as well as assessment of subgroups of patients with the overall group being
      studied.
