    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of ketamine (infusion of
      0.5mg/kg) and venlafaxine compared to the use of venlafaxine alone in the treatment of major
      depression (MADRS score ≥ 20 ) to six weeks of treatment.

    <description>Assessment of depression by MADRS defining six weeks:
the state of clinical response defined by a MADRS score less than 50% in MADRS score at baseline initial set.
the state of clinical remission is defined by obtaining a MADRS score ≤ 8.</description>
