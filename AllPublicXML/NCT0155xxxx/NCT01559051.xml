  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The intent of this clinical study is to answer the questions: 1) Is the proposed treatment
      safe and 2) Is treatment effective in improving the health of patients with human Chronic
      Obstructive Pulmonary Disease.

      This will be an open-label, non-randomized multi-center patient sponsored study of Autologous
      SVF (AD-SVF) implantation after liposuction using an IV delivery system and Inhalation
      infusion. AD-SVF will be derived from the patient's adipose-derived tissue. Liposuction using
      local anesthesia and syringe collection will be performed to collect the adipose tissue
      specimen for subsequent processing to isolate the stem cells. The cells will be delivered
      intravenously.

      The adipose tissue specimen will be collected from the patient's abdomen or applicable area
      using tumescent syringe liposuction. The adipose tissue is transferred to the laboratory for
      separation of the adipose tissue-derived stem cells, which are then transferred for IV
      delivery. The number of cells injected will vary depending on the amount of tissue processed
      and the number of cells obtained from the process.
