  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A few studies suggest that patients suffering from neurodegenerative diseases (such a
      multiple sclerosis or Alzheimer's disease (AD)) show decreased thickness of the retinal nerve
      fiber layer (RNFL), indicating axonal degeneration. High-definition spectral domain optical
      coherence tomography (SD-OCT), performed without radiation in a few seconds per eye, offers a
      precise and standardized estimation of this parameter, which could constitute a biomarker for
      cerebral axonal degeneration. These RNFL deficits might even be the earliest sign of AD,
      prior to damage of the hippocampal region that impacts memory.

      Besides, some associations of AD with some degenerative diseases of the eye (glaucoma,
      microvascular abnormalities, age-related macular degeneration (AMD)) have also been reported.

      It therefore seems interesting to determine whether RNFL thickness, and other ocular
      parameters, may give some indications for a better detection of AD and cognitive decline in
      the elderly.
