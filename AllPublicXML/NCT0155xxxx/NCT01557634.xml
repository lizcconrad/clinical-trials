  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The incidence of type 1 diabetes (T1D) is increasing worldwide with evidence of most rapid
      increase in preschool children. Intensive control of blood glucose levels, although essential
      to protect against onset and progression of diabetes-related complications, faces unique
      challenges in toddlers and preschool children. A closed-loop system can enhance accuracy of
      insulin delivery and help people with T1D attain a tight glucose control avoiding the risk of
      hypoglycaemia. The main components of the system are a continuous glucose monitor (CGM), an
      insulin pump and a computer-based 'model predictive algorithm', which calculates the amount
      of insulin to be given by the insulin pump according to the CGM values. In the studies
      performed thus far the efficacy and safety of closed-loop glucose control were evaluated in
      children and adolescents aged 6 to 18 years. The results showed that closed-loop improved
      control of blood glucose and prevented nocturnal hypoglycaemia, as compared to the
      conventional insulin pump therapy. The objective of the current study is to extend the
      evaluation of closed-loop further to younger children aged 2 to 6 years, who may gain a great
      benefit from this novel therapy. The present study adopts an open-label, randomised, 2 period
      cross-over design whereby closed-loop insulin therapy using diluted insulin (20IU/ml)will be
      compared with closed-loop with standard insulin (100IU/ml)in 12 young children with T1D.
      Participants aged 2 to 6 years will be randomised for two overnight studies in a clinical
      research facility, during which glucose levels will be controlled by either the
      computer-based closed-loop algorithm using diluted insulin or by closed-loop with standard
      insulin. On both occasions, participants will receive a self-selected evening meal and
      closed-loop will run from 17:00 until 08:00am the following day. The study will take place at
      the Wellcome Trust Clinical Research Facility, Cambridge with participants recruited from
      paediatric diabetes clinics in England.
