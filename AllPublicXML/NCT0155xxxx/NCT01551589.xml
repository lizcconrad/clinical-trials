      This study examines contrast advantages and disadvantages of elective or prophylactic nodal
      irradiation in the treatment of esophageal cancer with three-dimensional conformed
      radiotherapy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Esophageal lymph node drainage area is rich, according to different sites, easy to metastasis
      to different regions. For patient underwent concurrent chemoradiotherapy, how reasonable
      design the clinical target volume of lymph node drainage area has always been controversial,
      one is to irradiate positive lymph nodes only, the other is to irradiate the easier involved
      lymph node area according to different sites, in order to contrast advantages and
      disadvantages of the two kind of target area design，so the study was designed.
