    <textblock>
      This is a randomized controlled double blinded study involving two (2) investigational sites
      in the United States. All subjects (n=40) will receive either Prontosan Wound Irrigation
      Solution and Gel treatment or standard of care treatment (0.9% saline) and placebo gel. This
      is a 12-week study.
