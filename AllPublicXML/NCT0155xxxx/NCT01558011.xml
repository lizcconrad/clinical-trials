    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, non-comparative phase II study of sequential capecitabine plus
      oxaliplatin followed by docetaxel plus capecitabine in patients with unresectable gastric
      adenocarcinoma.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There are two primary objectives in different steps. In the first step, the primary objective
      of this study is to investigate the objective response rate in patients receiving sequential
      capecitabine plus oxaliplatin followed by docetaxel plus capecitabine in patients with
      unresectable gastric adenocarcinoma.

      In the second step, the primary objective of this study is to screen the predictive
      biomarkers of three different chemotherapeutic drugs and also investigate the objective
      response rate in patients receiving sequential capecitabine plus oxaliplatin followed by
      docetaxel plus capecitabine in patients with unresectable gastric adenocarcinoma.
