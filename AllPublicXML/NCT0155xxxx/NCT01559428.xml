  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Plant sterols and stanols (also called phytosterols and phytostanols) are structurally
      related to cholesterol, but absorbed to a much lesser extent. Due to this structural
      similarity, plant sterols and stanols inhibit intestinal cholesterol absorption and lower
      serum LDL cholesterol concentrations by about 10% at daily intakes of 2.5 g. Plant sterol-
      and stanol-enriched food products are therefore widely available on the market to lower the
      risk for coronary heart disease. Plant sterols can undergo oxidation, which results in the
      formation of oxyphytosterols. Animal studies have now suggested that oxyphytosterols are
      atherogenic. Although oxyphytosterols have been identified in human serum samples, the effect
      of an increased intake of plant sterols on serum oxyphytosterol concentrations in humans is
      not known. On the other hand, plant stanols cannot be oxidized and lower not only cholesterol
      absorption, but also plant sterol absorption.

      The major objective of the present study is to examine the effects of dietary plant sterols
      and stanols on fasting serum concentrations of oxyphytosterols. The minor objective is to
      investigate the effects of these products on postprandial serum oxyphytosterol
      concentrations.
