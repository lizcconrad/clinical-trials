    <textblock>
      This is a Phase II study of Vigil™ autologous tumor cell vaccine integrated with bevacizumab.
      All patients will have had Vigil™ prepared and stored from initial primary surgical
      debulking. Patients meeting eligibility criteria will receive Vigil™ 1.0 x 10e7
      cells/intradermal injection once every 4 weeks and bevacizumab 10 mg/kg intravenously every 2
      weeks.

    <description>Time to progression (TTP) following bevacizumab integrated with Vigil vaccine in patients failing standard of care in study CL-PTL 105 or in those not otherwise qualifying after vaccine production. This will be measured from the treatment start date (date of first dose) to either the date the patient is first recorded as having disease recurrence (even if the patient went off treatment because of toxicity), or the date of death if the patient dies due to any causes before progression.</description>
