  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to evaluate how surgery for esophageal cancer affects the patient's
      quality of life over time. The investigators hope this study will provide important
      information that can be used to improve the quality of life of patients with esophageal
      cancer. This study will also look at how standard tests and information collected from the
      patients difficulty swallowing can predict the extent of their esophageal cancer before
      surgery.

    <description>To evaluate whether a combination of a dysphagia score of 2-4 and a specific CT scan maximal tumor thickness. the patient's CT scan (either performed elsewhere or at MSK) will be reviewed by one radiologist, who will assess the maximal thickness of tumor involvement (&gt;=cm). Patients will then undergo their planned a staging Endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS) by the gastroenterology service, at which time the EUS depth of invasion will be assigned. The dysphagia score and CT thickness will then be compared to the EUS depth (considered the 'gold standard')</description>
