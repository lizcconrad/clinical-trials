  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of the study is to determine the safety and pharmacokinetics of a 7 day course
      of oral mibefradil given four times a day in healthy volunteers. This is a dose escalation
      study in which the total daily dose of mibefradil will be increased with each cohort.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will establish the safety, detailed pharmacokinetics, and, possibly, maximum
      tolerated dose (MTD) of ascending doses of mibefradil administered four times a day (QID) in
      healthy volunteers. The knowledge gained will then guide the details of a study of Interlaced
      Therapy™ in patients with recurrent High Grade Glioma (HGG). Non-clinical studies are
      currently on-going in the efficacy of Interlaced Therapy™ in ovarian cancer, pancreatic
      cancer, and intracranial malignancy.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Normal healthy volunteers aged 19 to 55 years, male or female, and willing and able to
             sign informed consent;

          2. Females must have a negative pregnancy test at screening and be practicing a suitable
             method of birth control so that, in the opinion of the Investigator, they will not
             become pregnant during the course of the study, or females can be postmenopausal (no
             menstrual period for one year) or surgically sterilized. Females must either be
             sexually inactive (abstinent) for 14 days prior to Screening and remain so through 30
             days following the final dosing of the study drug or have been using one of the
             following acceptable methods of birth control for the times specified:

               -  Barrier method (condom or diaphragm) with spermicidal for at least 14 days prior
                  to Screening through Day -1 through 30 days following the final dosing of the
                  study drug;

               -  Surgical sterilization (vasectomy) of partner at least 6 months prior to Day -1;

                  ligation, hysterectomy, hysterectomy with unilateral or bilateral oophorectomy,
                  or bilateral oophorectomy.

          3. Male subjects must continue to use their approved contraceptive method for 60 days
             after participating in the study.

          4. Has a body mass index (BMI) between 18.0 and 32.0 kg/m², inclusive; and
