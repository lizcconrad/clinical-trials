  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators propose to test the hypotheses that compared with Hook Plate (HP), Locking
      Plate (LP) reduces the postoperative complications and leads to a better functional recovery
      after unstable distal clavicle fractures (Neer 2b).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Controversy exists regarding the optimal treatment for patients with unstable distal
      clavicular fractures (Neer 2b). The recognized treatment alternatives are Hook plate.Notably,
      criticisms on this fixation method also appeared and the potential risks of hook migration,
      loosening, subacromial impingement or rotator cuff injury, and acromial osteolysis were still
      unsolved. Recently, Herrmann et al.and Largo et al.stabilized the distal clavicle with
      Locking plate (LP) and these studies offered encouraging support for LP. Because of small
      sample size (27 patients) and nonrandomization, the convictive power of these researches is
      not strong enough.

    <description>All participants will have an open reduction internal fixation. The affected upper limb will be temporarily fixed by a sling after admission. Under necessary test, general anaesthetic and antibiotic prophylaxis, the patients will be placed in a beach-chair position in an orthopaedic theatre. The operated side will be prepped and draped and a transverse incision will be made over the fracture site. The fracture ends will be identified, reduced and fixed with HP. X-ray was applied to check the grade of reduction before the operation is completed. Post-operative care will include early active mobilization managed by a standard physiotherapy rehabilitation regime.</description>
