      The investigators will obtain human skin specimen (sized approximately 1 cm x 1 cm) for
      dermatological surgical patients in National Taiwan University Hospital, after informed
      consent was obtained. Human skin keratinocytes, fibroblasts, and melanocytes will be cultured
      from the human skin specimen. The three dimensional images of these cultured cells will be
      observed by a ultra-high resolution 3-dimensional optical coherence tomography.
