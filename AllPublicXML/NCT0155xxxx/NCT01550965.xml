      This study evaluated the quality of life (QOL) and economic impact of adalimumab treatment in
      participants with ulcerative colitis (UC).
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This was a single arm, open-label, multicenter study. The primary objectives were to study
      the effect of adalimumab on QOL (as measured by Short Inflammatory Bowel Disease
      Questionnaire (SIBDQ)), the utilization of health care resources, and the costs of care for
      subjects with UC who were treated with adalimumab in the usual clinical practice setting. The
      secondary objectives were to further assess the effect of adalimumab on disease activity and
      to collect additional safety data in subjects with UC.

    <measure>Mean Change From Baseline in European Quality of Life - 5 Dimensions - 5 Level (EQ-5D-5L) Total Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 0 (baseline), Week 2, Week 8, Week 18, and Week 26</time_frame>
    <description>EQ-5D-5L Total Score provides a descriptive profile of health status. It comprises of 5 dimensions of health (mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression) to describe the subject's current health state. Each dimension comprises 5 levels with corresponding numeric scores ranging from 1 (no problems) through 5 (extreme problems). A unique EQ-5D-5L health state was defined by combining the numeric level scores for each of the 5 dimensions and the total score ranges from -0.594 to 1, with higher scores representing a better health state. An increase in the EQ-5D-5L total score indicates improvement. N = participants with evaluable baseline and post-baseline data.</description>

        <description>TSQM is a questionnaire to be completed by the participants to determine their satisfaction of the medications for ulcerative colitis including the study drug. The TSQM is a 14-item subject-rated scale that evaluates the effectiveness, side effects, convenience, and global satisfaction of the medication over the past 2-3 weeks. Each of the 14 questions are scored from 1 (worst) to 7 points (best); and each of the domains are scored from 0 (less satisfaction) to 100 (better satisfaction). N = participants with evaluable baseline and post-baseline data.</description>

        <description>The SIBDQ is a disease-specific health-related quality of life (HRQoL) questionnaire, used to detect changes in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) participants by measuring physical, social and emotional status. The SIBDQ consists of 10 questions, each question is scored on a scale from 1 (poor QoL) to 7 (good QoL). A higher score indicates a better health-related quality of life. Total scores range from 10 (poor QoL) to 70 (good QoL). N = participants with evaluable baseline and post-baseline data.</description>

The physician considered the participant’s reported information such as number of stools, rectal bleeding, abdominal discomfort, and functional assessment during the previous day prior to the visit, and other observations such as physical findings, and the participant’s performance status at the time of the visit. Based on the above information the investigator made an overall assessment of participant’s current severity of UC using the ordinal scale from 0 (normal) to 3 (severe disease).</description>

        <title>Mean Change From Baseline in European Quality of Life – 5 Dimensions – 5 Level (EQ-5D-5L) Total Score</title>
        <description>EQ-5D-5L Total Score provides a descriptive profile of health status. It comprises of 5 dimensions of health (mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression) to describe the subject's current health state. Each dimension comprises 5 levels with corresponding numeric scores ranging from 1 (no problems) through 5 (extreme problems). A unique EQ-5D-5L health state was defined by combining the numeric level scores for each of the 5 dimensions and the total score ranges from -0.594 to 1, with higher scores representing a better health state. An increase in the EQ-5D-5L total score indicates improvement. N = participants with evaluable baseline and post-baseline data.</description>

Non-responders to adalimumab were to be discontinued from treatment at Week 8. After Week 8, dose escalation to 40 mg weekly was allowed for flare or non-response.</description>

        <description>WPAI-SHP is a questionnaire used to assess the effect of the participant's health problems on their ability to work and perform regular activities. A higher score indicates an increased impairment. A positive value of change indicates an increased impairment of work productivity and the limitation of activities of daily life, while a negative value indicates an improvement. The percentage of work time missed data was applicable to employed participants only. N = participants with evaluable baseline and post-baseline data.</description>

        <title>Mean Change From Baseline in Work Productivity and Activity Impairment Questionnaire: Specific Health Problem (WPAI-SHP): Percentage of Impairment While Working</title>
        <description>WPAI-SHP is a questionnaire used to assess the effect of the participant's health problems on their ability to work and perform regular activities. The scores on the WPAI questionnaire are presented as percentages (multiplying the scores by 100), with 0% representing no impact on productivity and 100% representing complete impact on productivity. Change in WPAI-SHP was calculated by deducting the final score from the baseline score. A higher score indicates an increased impairment. A positive value of change indicates an increased impairment of work productivity and the limitation of activities of daily life, while a negative value indicates an improvement. The percentage of impairment while working data was applicable to employed participants only. N = participants with evaluable baseline and post-baseline data.</description>

        <title>Mean Change From Baseline in Work Productivity and Activity Impairment Questionnaire: Specific Health Problem (WPAI-SHP): Percentage of Activity Impairment</title>
        <description>WPAI-SHP is a questionnaire used to assess the effect of the participant's health problems on their ability to work and perform regular activities. The scores on the WPAI questionnaire are presented as percentages (multiplying the scores by 100), with 0% representing no impact on productivity and 100% representing complete impact on productivity. Change in WPAI-SHP was calculated by deducting the final score from the baseline score. A higher score indicates an increased impairment. A positive value of change indicates an increased impairment of work productivity and the limitation of activities of daily life, while a negative value indicates an improvement. N = participants with evaluable baseline and post-baseline data.</description>
