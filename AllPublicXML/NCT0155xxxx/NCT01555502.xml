    <textblock>
      To test the effect of post operative complications on the health related quality of life
      (HRQOL) after Video Assisted Thoracoscopic Surgery (VATS) for Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer
      (NSCLC).

      The HRQOL of patients with early stage NSCLC will be assessed at baseline (before surgery)
      using 3 different reliable and valid HRQOL questionnaire (SF-36, EQ-5D and QLQ30/13), then at
      regular intervals in the early post-operative period (2,4,8 and 12 weeks) the HRQOL will be
      assessed using the same questionnaires to determine the difference between patients with
      low/no post operative complications to those with high grade post-operative complications.

      Post operative complications will be assess while the patients in the hospital on a daily
      basis using the Clavien classification system for surgical complications.
