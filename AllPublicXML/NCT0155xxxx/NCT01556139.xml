  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The reduction in effort tolerance as result of a decreased efficiency in ventilation is
      common both in patients affected by COPD (McKenzie) and chronic heart failure (CHF) (Ribeiro,
      Frankenstein). One of the most common cause is the reduced respiratory muscle strength and
      endurance. Some studies have evaluated the effect of a specific training on the muscular
      strength both in pulmonary (Battaglia, Powell) and cardiac patients (Winkelmann, Chiappa).
      Moreover, only few studies investigated a specific training for such patients (Koppers,
      Sherer) because of the complicated equipment needed to prevent hypocapnia. Up to date,
      portable and economic systems for isocapnic hyperpnea have been developed for respiratory
      muscle training.

      Primary aim of the study was to evaluate the effectiveness of the respiratory muscle training
      -by the technique of the isocapnic hyperpnea- on the effort tolerance and endurance in
      patients with COPD and CHF

      Secondary aims were: A.to quantify the number of patients with deficit of respiratory muscles
      endurance and B.to verify different response of training between COPD and CHF patients

      All consecutive stable patients with diagnosis of COPD or CHF and normal MMSE, admitted in
      Foundation S. Maugeri in Lumezzane (Brescia, Italy) for routinary rehabilitation at
      Respiratory and Cardiac Rehabilitative Divisions are enrolled.

      All patients who met the inclusion criteria (see above)are informed about the aim of the
      project, sign an informed consent and are enrolled in the study.

      40 patients are enrolled. They are divided in two groups of 20 each (10 cardiac and 10
      respiratory patients) named:

        1. Spirotiger Group: these patients perform 20 sessions of usual training (cyclette and
           calisthenic exercises) and specific training (further 20 sessions) for respiratory
           muscles with SPIROTIGER

        2. Control Group: these patients perform 20 sessions of usual training (cyclette and
           calisthenic exercises) and additional 20 sessions with a placebo device (Threshold)

    <description>The Training group perform 20 sessions of a specific training with Spirotiger, a device allowing respiratory muscle training with isocapnic hyperpnea.
The setting is the following:
volume/size of the breathing bag: 50% of the vital capacity (VC) and ventilation (VE= Tidal volume x respiratory rate) at 66% of the MVV aiming to reach 15 minutes of training without breaks. During the initial sessions, the patient can interrupt training every 5 minutes and recover.
increase in training: after 15 minutes of exercise VE is increased up to 75% of the MVV through modification of the volume of breathing bag or respiratory rate.
At the end of 15 minutes of exercise, further increases in ventilation are 10% of each previous step.</description>
