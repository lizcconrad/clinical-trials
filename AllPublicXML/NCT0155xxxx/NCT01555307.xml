  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study was to evaluate the effectiveness of balance exercises added to
      typical joint range of motion and muscle strengthening exercises on balance in patients
      following total hip or knee joint arthroplasty

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Rehabilitation program following total hip and knee joint arthroplasty typically focus on
      joint range of motion and muscle strengthening exercises. Although the balance ability of
      these patients tends to be reduced, leading to limitations in mobility and activities of
      daily living, clinicians often assume that strength and joint range of motion exercises will
      ultimately lead to improvement in balance, making the typical exercise programs appropriate.
      However, the feasibility and effectiveness of introducing balance specific exercises during
      the post-operative period is unclear.
