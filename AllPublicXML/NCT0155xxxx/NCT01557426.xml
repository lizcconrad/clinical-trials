      Objectives:

      This study aims to characterize severe skin and soft tissue infections (SSTIs) in the
      emergency department through the acquisition of ultrasound images. A wide range of SSTIs will
      be imaged and recorded, leading to a registry of these infections. The registry will show
      whether ED (emergency department) sonographers can accurately characterize these infections,
      as compared to the final hospital diagnosis. The registry will also provide data for a
      case-control study comparing ultrasonographic characteristics of necrotizing skin and soft
      tissue infections (NSTIs) to those of non-necrotizing SSTIs.

      Research procedures:

      In this study, the investigators will approach patients who present to the Emergency
      Department with a possible skin and/or tissue infection. Study subjects must be ED patients
      requiring admission to the hospital for the primary problem of an SSTI due to the need for
      follow-up. If the patient consents to participating in the study, the investigator will
      obtain and record an ultrasound image of the infected area. An ultrasound image of an
      uninfected area of skin will also be recorded for comparison. Patient information regarding
      personal history, physical examination, blood tests and x-rays will also be gathered from
      participants.

    <description>A linear ultrasound transducer will be used with ultrasound gel to obtain an image of subcutaneous structures and tissues over the involved body site. Ultrasound video will be recorded whenever possible, however studies that are not recorded will still be included. Video recording will be initiated once the desired image is obtained. Appropriate measurements will be made and views identified using the features of the ultrasound machine. Scanning of the contralateral body segment will then be performed. The ultrasound probe will be thoroughly cleaned and disinfected between ultrasound scans.</description>
