    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to identify genetic changes associated with the initiation,
      progression, and treatment response of response of cutaneous and hematologic disorders using
      recently developed high-throughput sequencing technologies. The improved understanding of the
      genetic changes associated with cutaneous and hematologic disorders may lead to improved
      diagnostic, prognostic and therapeutic options for these disorders.
