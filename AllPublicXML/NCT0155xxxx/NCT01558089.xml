    <textblock>
      This open-label, prospective, observational study will evaluate the clinical response to
      etanercept + methotrexate therapy in patients with moderate to severe rheumatoid arthritis,
      as prescribed by the rheumatologist in a normal clinical setting in Greece
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All subjects enrolled should meet the usual prescribing criteria for Etanercept as per the
      local product information and should be entered into the study at the investigator's
      discretion

    <description>Good European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) response at 6 months based on DAS28 EULAR response criteria defined as Good response = DAS28 change &gt;1.2 with DAS28 ≤3.2; Moderate response = DAS28 change &gt;0.6 with DAS28 &gt;3.2-5.1; Non-response = DAS28 change ≤0.6 and absolute DAS28 &gt;5.1</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline and Visit 4 (Month 6)</time_frame>
    <description>In order to calculate the DAS28 the number of swollen joints and tender joints were assessed using the 28 Joint Count (TJC28 and SJC28). A joint was counted as tender/swollen if the tender/swelling code was 'Present'. Swollen and tender 28 joint counts will be performed at visit 1 (baseline), visit 2, visit 3 and visit 4 or early withdrawal.</description>

    <description>The patients used a 100 mm Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) to score their general health during the last week. The scale ranged from 0 (no pain) to 100 mm (severe pain)</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in EQ-5D Health Index at Visit 4 (Month 6)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Visit 4 (Month 6)</time_frame>
    <description>The European Quality of Life-5 Dimensions (EQ-5D) was measured on a 5 item scale. The scores for the 5 items (mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression) ranged from 1 (no problem) to 3 (extreme problems). For EQ-5D, participants rate questionnaire to assess health-related quality of life in terms of a single utility score. Health State Profile component assesses level of current health for 5 domains: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain and discomfort, and anxiety and depression. Each of the 5 dimensions is divided into 3 levels of perceived problems: Level 1=no problem; level 2=some problem; level 3=extreme problem. A unique health state is defined by combining 1 level from each dimension. A total of 243 possible health states are defined in this way. Each state is referred to in terms of a 5 digit code. Score is transformed and results in a total score range -0.594 to 1.000; higher score indicates a better health state.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in HAQ-DI at Visit 4 (Month 6)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Visit 4 (Month 6)</time_frame>
    <description>The Health Assessment Questionnaire-Disability Index (HAQ-DI) is composed of 20 items. It is a participant-reported assessment of ability to perform tasks in 8 categories of daily living activities: dress/groom; arise; eat; walk; reach; grip; hygiene; common activities over past week. Each item scored on 4-point scale from 0-3: 0=no difficulty; 1=some difficulty; 2=much difficulty; 3=unable to do. Overall score was computed as sum of domain scores and divided by number of domains answered. Total possible score ranges from 0-3: 0=least difficulty and 3=extreme difficulty.</description>

    <measure>Predictor of Good EULAR Response Versus Moderate/No Response at Visit 4 (Month 6) - DAS28 (LOCF)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Visit 4 (Month 6)</time_frame>
    <description>In a first step a univariate logistic regression model was fit for the following baseline variables: DAS28 (n=48), Physician's Global Assessment of Disease Activity (VAS) (n=47), Patient's Global Assessment of Disease Activity (VAS) (n=47), CRP (n=46), Patient Pain (VAS) (n=47), HAQ-DI (n=47), EQ-5D (n=47). Only those variables that were significant at a 10% level were then included in the second step: a multivariate analysis with stepwise regression (entry level=10%, stay level=5%). The final model presented in the Basic Results table displays those covariates which were significant at the 2-sided 5% level (baseline value for DAS28; n=48). Note that DAS28 is not a categorical variable; therefore no stratified results for this variable are presented.</description>

        <description>The European Quality of Life–5 Dimensions (EQ-5D) was measured on a 5 item scale. The scores for the 5 items (mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression) ranged from 1 (no problem) to 3 (extreme problems). For EQ-5D, participants rate questionnaire to assess health-related quality of life in terms of a single utility score. Health State Profile component assesses level of current health for 5 domains: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain and discomfort, and anxiety and depression. Each of the 5 dimensions is divided into 3 levels of perceived problems: Level 1=no problem; level 2=some problem; level 3=extreme problem. A unique health state is defined by combining 1 level from each dimension. A total of 243 possible health states are defined in this way. Each state is referred to in terms of a 5 digit code. Score is transformed and results in a total score range -0.594 to 1.000; higher score indicates a better health state.</description>

        <title>Predictor of Good EULAR Response Versus Moderate/No Response at Visit 4 (Month 6) - DAS28 (LOCF)</title>
        <description>In a first step a univariate logistic regression model was fit for the following baseline variables: DAS28 (n=48), Physician’s Global Assessment of Disease Activity (VAS) (n=47), Patient’s Global Assessment of Disease Activity (VAS) (n=47), CRP (n=46), Patient Pain (VAS) (n=47), HAQ-DI (n=47), EQ-5D (n=47). Only those variables that were significant at a 10% level were then included in the second step: a multivariate analysis with stepwise regression (entry level=10%, stay level=5%). The final model presented in the Basic Results table displays those covariates which were significant at the 2-sided 5% level (baseline value for DAS28; n=48). Note that DAS28 is not a categorical variable; therefore no stratified results for this variable are presented.</description>

          <title>Predictor of Good EULAR Response Versus Moderate/No Response at Visit 4 (Month 6) - DAS28 (LOCF)</title>
          <description>In a first step a univariate logistic regression model was fit for the following baseline variables: DAS28 (n=48), Physician’s Global Assessment of Disease Activity (VAS) (n=47), Patient’s Global Assessment of Disease Activity (VAS) (n=47), CRP (n=46), Patient Pain (VAS) (n=47), HAQ-DI (n=47), EQ-5D (n=47). Only those variables that were significant at a 10% level were then included in the second step: a multivariate analysis with stepwise regression (entry level=10%, stay level=5%). The final model presented in the Basic Results table displays those covariates which were significant at the 2-sided 5% level (baseline value for DAS28; n=48). Note that DAS28 is not a categorical variable; therefore no stratified results for this variable are presented.</description>
          <population>The analysis was based on the FAS population. The FAS comprised participants who received at least 1 dose of Methotrexate + Etanercept, and completed at least 1 assessment following first dose.</population>
