  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A total of 1,180 women diagnosed with Gestational Diabetes Mellitus (GDM) from 2005 to 2009
      have and continues to be randomly assigned to either the intervention group or the control
      group. GDM women in the intervention group will have five consulting sessions with a
      dietician during the first year and two sessions during the second year. The intervention
      group are given detailed advice about how to achieve the six goals of the intervention. The
      primary aim will test whether lifestyle intervention can reduce incident Type 2 Diabetes
      (T2D) in women with prior GDM. The second aim will test gene-intervention interactions
      through fine-mapping established genes for glucose, IR, lipids, obesity and T2D in relation
      to metabolic traits for T2D in GDM women.
