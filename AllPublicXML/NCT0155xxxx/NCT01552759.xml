  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study investigates the hormones that the body produces in response to food intake and in
      response to stress, and the way that stress influences food intake. In particular, it
      compares the hormone levels and food intake of people with and without binge eating disorder.
      In order to find out how these appetite- and stress-related hormones are linked to brain
      activity, the study also includes an fMRI scan, a non-invasive procedure that looks at which
      regions of the brain are most active during a food-related scenario.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The objectives are to study appetite-related hormones regulating food intake under normal
      conditions and following a stressor in the morning and evening (when most binge episodes
      occur), to help reveal biological mechanisms in BED. We plan to enroll: 32 obese Ss with BED
      (16m, 16f), 32 obese Ss without BED (16m, 16f) and 32 normal-weight Ss without BED (16m,
      16f). Height, weight, waist circumference, and body fat will be assessed during a first
      appointment. On two different days separated by at least a week, Ss will ingest a fixed
      liquid meal once in the morning and once in the evening. Appetite ratings and collections of
      blood and saliva to measure hormones will continue for 2 hours after the fixed meal. This
      will be followed on each day by a laboratory stress protocol (Socially Evaluated Cold Pressor
      Test; SECPT), and then consumption of an ad libitum meal 30 minutes later. On one day during
      the protocol, the participant will collect saliva using a swab immediately after waking and
      again at 08.00. In order to capture more naturalistic eating episodes, all Ss will
      additionally record food intake, rate appetite, and measure salivary cortisol before and
      after one evening meal, and one after-dinner snack (or after-dinner binge for BED Ss). On two
      additional days, we will use fMRI to assess brain activation in response to high-palatability
      food (HPF) relative to low-palatability food (LPF) or non-food (NF) visual cues following the
      SECPT and a control condition using warm water. On each day, following the fMRI scan, an ad
      libitum meal will be consumed.

    <time_frame>Assessed at systematic intervals (-15, 0, 10, 30, 60, 90, 120 min) before and after the morning fixed meal at 10.00 and the evening fixed meal at 17.00</time_frame>
    <description>Blood and saliva concentrations of hormones influencing appetite will be measured at systematic intervals (-15, 0, 10, 30, 60, 90, 120 min) before and after the morning fixed meal at 10.00 and the evening fixed meal at 17.00. Appetite will additionally be rated at each assessment point. This will be followed by a cold pressor test, and then 30 min later by an ad libitum meal 30 min later, with blood and saliva measurements taken before and after completion of the meal.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Cortisol Awakening response</measure>
    <time_frame>Assessed on one weekday morning during the 3-week participation period</time_frame>
    <description>On one weekday morning during the 3-week participation period, participants will take one saliva measurement on awakening and at 08.00 while still fasting. Awakening and 08.00 cortisol levels are expected to be higher in BED compared with nonBED Ss, and in obese nonBED compared with normal-weight nonBED Ss.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Psychological Scales</measure>
    <time_frame>During one initial consultation and on two subsequent visits at least 1 week apart</time_frame>
    <description>Various questionnaires will be administered to test relationships between outcomes (e.g., intake, hormone levels), and psychological constructs including depression, perceived stress, external and emotional eating and restraint, binge-eating behavior, and night eating. Outcomes will be correlated with scale scores, and scores will be compared between groups. Among other relationships, we anticipate positive correlations between binge eating score, ad libitum intake and ghrelin SECPT response. Psychological scores will be entered as covariates as appropriate.</description>
