  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Young African-American women who report a higher frequency of alcohol use have particularly
      higher rates of sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)
      sex behaviors. Unfortunately, there are no evidence-based HIV interventions designed to be
      gender- and culturally-appropriate for this population. To address this, the investigators
      propose to add to the CDC-defined evidence-based intervention (DEBI), Horizons, a new
      intervention form, Group Motivational Enhancement Therapy (GMET), which has shown promise in
      reducing alcohol use and alcohol-related HIV risk-taking. To test how effective the combined
      Horizons+GMET alcohol-specific portion is, it will be evaluated with a time equivalent
      Horizons+attention control general health promotion (GHP) portion focusing on nutrition
      health promotion, and to an enhanced standard-of-care program. In this study, 600 young
      African American women, 18-24 years of age, who report 3 or more occasions where they drank
      alcohol in the past 90 days will be recruited to complete a four-part baseline assessment
      consisting of: 1. an audio computer assisted self interview (ACASI), 2. videotaped
      communication role plays to objectively measure communication skill ability (subsample), 3.
      provide a vaginal specimen to test for STDs and 4. Provide a urine pregnancy screen. After
      participants complete their baseline assessment, they will be randomly assigned to one of
      three conditions: 1. Horizons+GMET alcohol-specific condition, 2. a time-equivalent
      Horizons+GHP condition, or 3. an enhanced standard-of-care control condition. The GMET
      alcohol-specific component has shown to be effective in influencing several alcohol-specific
      concepts (attitudes, norms, self-efficacy) and reducing sexual risk-taking among
      culturally-diverse high-risk youth. The GMET alcohol-specific module was designed to increase
      woman's awareness of the unfavorable effects of alcohol on themselves, their sexual
      decision-making, and their male partner and teaches women strategies to reduce the
      possibility of engaging in sex under the influence of alcohol. In addition, the GMET
      alcohol-specific module provides skills training needed to effectively talk about sexual
      intentions to use condoms and/or refuse risky sex when they or their male sex partner has
      been using alcohol. After completing one of the three conditions, participants will complete
      a brief ACASI posttest to evaluate immediate changes in hypothesized social and psychological
      mediators of safer sex and alcohol use. Participants will also return to complete follow-up
      assessments at 3, 6, 9, and 12-months after their intervention. If the Horizons+GMET
      intervention is observed to be effective, investigators will work closely with the CDC DEBI
      program to help distribute the intervention to public health agencies and community based
      organizations (CBOs).
