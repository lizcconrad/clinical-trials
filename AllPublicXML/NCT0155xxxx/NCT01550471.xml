  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will provide the clinicians guidance on the safest combination of inhaled and
      nasal corticosteroids for children with mild asthma and allergic rhinitis respectively;
      however, one safety concern is that these products are independently known to have
      dose-related effects on short term and intermediate term growth. Knemometry is a non invasive
      technique for measuring short-term lower leg growth in children and is currently the method
      of choice in growth studies of short duration. Subjects will be seen on a weekly basis for 18
      weeks and at each visit, lower leg length will be measured using knemometry.

      This will be a single-center, cross-over study evaluating the effect of Omnaris Nasal Spray
      200 mcg QD and Alvesco Inhalation Aerosol 80 BID versus Beconase AQ Nasal Spray 168 mcg BID
      and QVAR Inhalation Aerosol 40 mcg BID versus Placebo Nasal Spray QD and Placebo Inhalation
      Aerosol BID on short term growth in pediatric subjects with mild asthma and allergic
      rhinitis. During the course of the study, subjects will be seen on a weekly basis and lower
      leg length will be measured using knemometry. Knemometry is a non invasive technique for
      measuring short-term lower leg growth in children and is currently the method of choice in
      growth studies of short duration. During the run-in and wash-out periods, subjects will not
      be treated with any medications or placebos. During the active treatment periods, subjects
      will be treated with Omnaris Nasal Spray 200 mcg QD and Alvesco Inhalation Aerosol 80 BID or
      Beconase AQ Nasal Spray 168 mcg BID and QVAR Inhalation Aerosol 40 mcg BID, or Placebo Nasal
      Spray QD and Placebo Inhalation Aerosol BID. Eligible subjects will be randomized into the
      study which will contain one run-in period (Period 1), 3 active treatment periods (Periods 2,
      4 and 6) and 2 washout periods (Periods 3 and 5). Each period will be of 3 weeks duration and
      the entire study duration will be 18 weeks. Subjects will be seen on a weekly basis for 18
      weeks and at each visit, lower leg length will be measured using knemometry.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Subjects will include females and males 12 to 15 years of age.

          2. All subjects must have a history of physician diagnosed mild asthma and allergic
             rhinitis as documented by PCP medical record or detailed history by study
             investigator.

             history of abnormal growth as assessed by medical history.

          4. Subjects may be on current treatment with montelukast as this drug does not affect
             growth. If a subject is on montelukast at screening/baseline, they will remain on a
             stable dose throughout the study.

          5. Subjects must be willing to comply with study requirements.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        1. Subjects will be excluded if they have asthma greater than mild persistent severity as
        defined by NHLBI guidelines.

        2 Subjects will be excluded if they used any systemic steroids within the past 60 days.

        3. Subjects will be excluded if they had more than one burst of systemic steroids within
        the past year.

        4. Subjects will be excluded if their baseline FEV1 is &lt; 80% predicted. 5. Subjects will be
        excluded if they have any other serious systemic disease other than asthma.

        6. Subjects will be excluded if they have taken any medication known to affect growth i.e.
        ADHD medications within the past 60 days 7. Subjects will be excluded if they have a
        history of allergy to any of the study medications.

        8. Subjects will be excluded if they have active chickenpox or measles or recent exposure
        to chickenpox or measles.

        9. Subjects will be excluded if they have any history of tuberculosis of the respiratory
        tract.

        10. Subjects will be excluded if they have any active fungal, bacterial, viral or parasitic
        infections.

        11. Subjects will be excluded if they have any history of herpes simplex infection of the
        eye.

        12. Subjects will be excluded if they have taken any immunosuppressive drugs within the
        past 2 months.

        13. Subjects will be excluded if they have any history of Churg-Strauss syndrome or other
        eosinophilic disorders.

        14. Subjects will be excluded if an investigator deems they have any mental or development
        health issues, such as autism, moderate to severe mental retardation or severe ADHD, that
        interferes with their ability to complete the knemometry measurements.

        15. Subjects will be excluded if an investigator deems they have any physical issues, such
        as inability to sit independently or amputation of lower leg, that interferes with their
        ability to complete the knemometry measurements.
