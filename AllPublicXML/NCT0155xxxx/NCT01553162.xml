      RATIONALE: Studying samples of blood, tissue, or bone marrow from patients with cancer in the
      laboratory may help doctors learn more about changes that occur in DNA and identify
      biomarkers related to cancer.

      PURPOSE: This research trial is studying dexamethasone and prednisone sensitivity in samples
      from younger patients with high-risk B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Identify differences in the effect of dexamethasone (Dex) and prednisone (Pred) on
           glucocorticoid receptor (GR) occupancy and gene expression in high-risk (HR) B-cell
           precursor (BCP)-acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) samples from patients aged 1-9.

        -  Identify differences in gene expression and GR occupancy of response elements in HR
           BCP-ALL patients &gt; 10 years old in response to both Dex and Pred.

      OUTLINE: Archived samples are analyzed for gene expression analysis and genomic location of
      glucocorticoid receptor by ChIP sequencing (ChiPseq) and RNA sequencing. Data of gene
      expression and ChiPseq data sets are compared by luciferase reporter assay.
