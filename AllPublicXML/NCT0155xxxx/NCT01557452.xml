  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Givinostat is expected to exert a clinically relevant therapeutic effect on polyarticular JIA
      through the inhibition of the production/release of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as
      IL-1β, IL-6 and TNFα, which are involved in the pathogenesis of the arthritic process.

  </brief_summary>
  <overall_status>Terminated</overall_status>
  <why_stopped>
    Previous study DSC/08/2357/36 did not show efficacy for Givinostat in JIA. Decision wasn't
    related to any tolerability concerns

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  patients with fever related to JIA or other systemic features of JIA during 12 months

          -  baseline prolongation of QT/QTc interval, use of concomitant medications that prolong
             the QT/QTc interval or history of additional risk factors for TdP.

          -  clinically significant cardiovascular disease

          -  clinically significant illness i.e. any condition that in the opinion of the

             were to participate in the study

          -  psychiatric illness/social situation that would limit compliance with study medication
             and protocol requirements
