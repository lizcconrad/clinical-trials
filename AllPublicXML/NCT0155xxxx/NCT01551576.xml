      The purpose of our study is to image human prostate tissue using a transrectal photoacoustic
      imaging probe.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE(S):

      The primary objective of this pilot study is to assess PAI-performance in a clinical setting
      to understand limitations of our current PAI instrumentation and to help improve the
      next-generation design.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVE(S):

      To do preliminary evaluations of oxygen saturation in lesions based on PAI-measurements in
      order to distinguish malignant from benign prostatic tissue as a basis for future studies.

    <description>The types of measures can be divided into three groups: 1) Operator determined measures during or just after the examination; 2) Post processing measures determined during post processing of the captured data and images; 3) Measures related to standard imaging and histopathological examination.</description>

        Medical oncologists with appropriate patient populations will be informed of the study and
        the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Potential participants will be recruited from the
        Stanford Urologic Oncology Clinic. A study investigator will follow-up with participants
        who are interested in participating in this study. Study information will be posted on the
        Stanford Cancer Center website as well.
