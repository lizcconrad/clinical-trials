  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It has well known that diets rich in fruits, vegetables and cocoa products are associated
      with positive health benefits and these positive effects have been shown to be due to
      compounds they contain called flavanols. Flavanols have been shown to exert their positive
      effects by indirectly increasing nitric oxide (NO) bioavailability. NO is a potent
      vasodilator that is believed to play a role in increasing blood flow to active muscle during
      exercise. This regulatory process is impaired with healthy aging. The underlying premise to
      this study is that if NO bioavailability can be increased following flavanol ingestion, will
      there be a restoration of blood flow during exercise in older individuals? Accordingly, the
      first part of this research project will compare the acute vascular effects of flavanol
      ingestion between a young and old group. The investigators have hypothesized that both groups
      will show an improvement in blood flow to active muscle during exercise, though the magnitude
      of the change will be greater in the older group. The second part of this project will look
      at the effects of 4 weeks of daily flavanol ingestion in the old group. The investigators
      hypothesize that subjects will demonstrate an improvement in blood flow to active muscle
      during exercise after the 4 week intervention and that the magnitude of the change will be
      greater than the acute effects. Findings from this proposal will provide evidence for the
      efficacy of flavanols to be used (as a simple and safe lifestyle intervention) to reverse or
      combat impaired blood flow regulation in older individuals.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in femoral blood flow during exercise following flavanol consumption</measure>
    <time_frame>During knee extension exercise, change from baseline in blood flow 2 hours post flavanol ingestion</time_frame>
    <description>Blood flow regulation to active muscles during knee extension exercise can be assessed by using ultrasound to measure blood flow in the femoral artery. This will be done before and after stimulation of the sympathetic nervous system. A baseline value will be obtained and then the measurement will be performed again 2 hours after flavanol ingestion.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in flow-mediated dilation (FMD) following flavanol consumption</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline in FMD 2 hours post flavanol ingestion</time_frame>
    <description>Flow-mediated dilation is commonly used as an index of nitric oxide bioavailability. Nitric oxide is believed to play a role in blood flow regulation during exercise. A baseline value will be obtained and then the measurement will be performed again 2 hours after flavanol ingestion.</description>
