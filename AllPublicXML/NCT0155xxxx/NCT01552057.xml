    <measure>Change From Baseline to 14-Week Endpoint in Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire (FIQ)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 14 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>FIQ is a 20-item, self-administered questionnaire using Likert-type scales to measure participant (pt) outcomes over the past week. Items 1 through 11 measured physical functioning on 4-point scales. Items 12 and 13 measured the number of days a pt felt well and days a pt was unable to work due to fibromyalgia symptoms. Items 14 through 20 were 11-point scales on which a pt rated work difficulty, pain, fatigue, morning tiredness, stiffness, anxiety, and depression. If a pt did not do all the tasks listed, those items were deleted from scoring. Algorithms were used to determine total FIQ scores which ranged from 0 to 100; higher scores indicated a more negative impact. LS mean was calculated using an MMRM approach including administration groups, observation points, and interaction between administration groups as fixed effects, and baseline as well as the presence or absence of major depressive disorder as covariates; a linear model with unstructured error variance was applied.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline to 14-Week Endpoint in 36-Item Short-Form (SF-36) Health Survey Domain Scores</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, up to 14 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The SF-36 Health Survey is a generic, health-related survey assessing the participant's quality of life on 8 domains: physical functioning, daily functioning (physical), bodily pain, general health, vitality, social functioning, daily functioning (emotional), and mental health. Each domain was scored by summing individual items pertaining to that domain and transforming scores into a 0 to 100 scale, with higher scores indicating better health status or functioning. LS mean was calculated using an ANCOVA approach including administration groups as fixed effects, and baseline as well as the presence or absence of complication by major depressive disorder as covariates.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline to 14-Week Endpoint in Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 14 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The BDI-II is a 21-item self-administered questionnaire designed to assess the characteristics of depression. Each item was scored on a 4-point scale ranging from 0 (not present) to 3 (present in the extreme) and was summed to give a total BDI-II score. A total BDI-II score of 0 through 13 was considered minimal, 14 through 19 was mild, 20 through 28 was moderate, and 29 through 63 was severe depression symptoms. LS mean was calculated using an MMRM approach including administration groups, observation points, and interaction between the administration groups and as fixed effects, and baseline as well as the presence or absence of major depressive disorder as covariates; a linear model with unstructured error variance was applied.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline to 14-Week Endpoint in Widespread Pain Index (WPI) and Symptom Severity (SS) in American College of Rheumatology (ACR) Fibromyalgia Diagnostic Criteria 2010</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 14 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>WPI: Participant-reported areas (out of 19 points on the body) in which the participant had pain in the past week. WPI scores ranged from 0 (no areas) to 19 (all areas). SS: The sum of severity scores for fatigue, waking unrefreshed, and cognitive symptoms [each rated from 0 (no problem) to 3 (severe; life-disturbing problems)] plus the severity of somatic symptoms in general [rated from 0 (no symptoms) to 3 (a great deal of symptoms)]. The total SS score ranged from 0 and 12. LS mean was calculated using an MMRM approach including administration groups, observation points, interaction between the administration groups and the observation points as fixed effects, and baseline as well as the presence or absence of major depressive disorder as covariates; a linear model with unstructured error variance was applied.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline to 14-Week Endpoint in Average Pain and Worst Pain Severity Score Within 24-Hours in Participant Diary</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 14 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Each morning participants rated their average pain and worst pain within the past 24 hours on separate 11-point Likert scales with scores ranging from 0 (no pain) through 10 (worst possible pain). These scores were then averaged for the week and compared to baseline. LS mean was calculated using an MMRM approach including administration groups, observation points, and interaction between the administration groups as fixed effects, and baseline as well as the presence or absence of major depressive disorder as covariates; a linear model with unstructured error variance was applied.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline to 14-Week Endpoint in Brief Pain Inventory-Severity (BPI-S) and Brief Pain Inventory-Interference (BPI-I) Scores on the BPI-Modified Short Form</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 14 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>BPI-S and BPI-I are self-reported scales measuring severity of pain and interference on function, respectively. Severity scores ranged from 0 (no pain) to 10 (severe pain) for each question assessing worst pain, least pain, and pain right now. Interference scores ranged from 0 (does not interfere) to 10 (completely interferes) for each question assessing interference of pain in past 24 hours with general activity, mood, walking ability, normal work, relations with other people, sleep, and enjoyment of life. Average interference was the average of non-missing scores of individual interference items. LS mean was calculated using an MMRM approach including administration groups, observation points, and interaction between the administration groups as fixed effects, and baseline as well as the presence or absence of major depressive disorder as covariates; a linear model with unstructured error variance was applied.</description>

        <description>BPI 24-hour average pain severity is a self-reported scale that measures the severity of pain based on the average pain over the past 24-hours. Severity scores ranged from 0 (no pain) to 10 (severe pain). Least squares (LS) mean was calculated using a mixed-effects model repeated measures (MMRM) approach including administration groups, observation points, and interaction between the administration groups as fixed effects, and BPI average pain severity at baseline and the presence or absence of major depressive disorder as covariates; a linear model with unstructured error variance was applied.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline to 14-Week Endpoint in Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire (FIQ)</title>
        <description>FIQ is a 20-item, self-administered questionnaire using Likert-type scales to measure participant (pt) outcomes over the past week. Items 1 through 11 measured physical functioning on 4-point scales. Items 12 and 13 measured the number of days a pt felt well and days a pt was unable to work due to fibromyalgia symptoms. Items 14 through 20 were 11-point scales on which a pt rated work difficulty, pain, fatigue, morning tiredness, stiffness, anxiety, and depression. If a pt did not do all the tasks listed, those items were deleted from scoring. Algorithms were used to determine total FIQ scores which ranged from 0 to 100; higher scores indicated a more negative impact. LS mean was calculated using an MMRM approach including administration groups, observation points, and interaction between administration groups as fixed effects, and baseline as well as the presence or absence of major depressive disorder as covariates; a linear model with unstructured error variance was applied.</description>

        <description>The SF-36 Health Survey is a generic, health-related survey assessing the participant’s quality of life on 8 domains: physical functioning, daily functioning (physical), bodily pain, general health, vitality, social functioning, daily functioning (emotional), and mental health. Each domain was scored by summing individual items pertaining to that domain and transforming scores into a 0 to 100 scale, with higher scores indicating better health status or functioning. LS mean was calculated using an ANCOVA approach including administration groups as fixed effects, and baseline as well as the presence or absence of complication by major depressive disorder as covariates.</description>

        <description>The BDI-II is a 21-item self-administered questionnaire designed to assess the characteristics of depression. Each item was scored on a 4-point scale ranging from 0 (not present) to 3 (present in the extreme) and was summed to give a total BDI-II score. A total BDI-II score of 0 through 13 was considered minimal, 14 through 19 was mild, 20 through 28 was moderate, and 29 through 63 was severe depression symptoms. LS mean was calculated using an MMRM approach including administration groups, observation points, and interaction between the administration groups and as fixed effects, and baseline as well as the presence or absence of major depressive disorder as covariates; a linear model with unstructured error variance was applied.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline to 14-Week Endpoint in Brief Pain Inventory-Severity (BPI-S) and Brief Pain Inventory-Interference (BPI-I) Scores on the BPI-Modified Short Form</title>
        <description>BPI-S and BPI-I are self-reported scales measuring severity of pain and interference on function, respectively. Severity scores ranged from 0 (no pain) to 10 (severe pain) for each question assessing worst pain, least pain, and pain right now. Interference scores ranged from 0 (does not interfere) to 10 (completely interferes) for each question assessing interference of pain in past 24 hours with general activity, mood, walking ability, normal work, relations with other people, sleep, and enjoyment of life. Average interference was the average of non-missing scores of individual interference items. LS mean was calculated using an MMRM approach including administration groups, observation points, and interaction between the administration groups as fixed effects, and baseline as well as the presence or absence of major depressive disorder as covariates; a linear model with unstructured error variance was applied.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline to 10 Weeks in the BPI 24-Hour Average Pain Severity Item of the BPI-Modified Short Form Score (MMRM)</title>
        <description>BPI 24-hour average pain severity is a self-reported scale that measures the severity of pain based on the average pain over the past 24-hours. Severity scores ranged from 0 (no pain) to 10 (severe pain). LS mean was calculated using an MMRM approach including administration groups, observation points, and interaction between the administration groups as fixed effects, and BPI average pain severity at baseline and the presence or absence of major depressive disorder as covariates; a linear model with unstructured error variance was applied.</description>
