      The primary objective of this study is to compare the efficacy of unilateral and bilateral
      neuromodulation tests at 1 month.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The secondary objectives of this study are to compare the following elements between a group
      of patients undergoing unilater modulation tests (standard procedure) and a group of patients
      undergoing bilateral neuromodulation tests (experimental procedure) (at 1 month):
      Pollakiuria, pad use, urge incontinence, symptom severity, % of patients not eligible for an
      implant, debimetry, tolerance, complications, quality of life.

    <description>An electrode is placed near a sacral nerve with an anal motor response under general anesthesia. During and adjustment phase, the electode is connected to a test box which allows for adjustment of stimulation parameters. After pinpointing stimulation parameters, the external test box is replaced by an implanted device.</description>

    <intervention_name>Bilateral electrode placement and testing</intervention_name>
    <description>Two electrodes are placed, one near each sacral nerve under general anesthesia. During an adjustment phase, the electodes are connected to a test box which allows for adjustment of stimulation parameters. This can result in the use of one or the other, or both electrodes, thus increasing the chances of success and the possibility that the patient is eligible for an implant. After pinpointing stimulation parameters, the external test box is replaced by an implanted device.</description>
