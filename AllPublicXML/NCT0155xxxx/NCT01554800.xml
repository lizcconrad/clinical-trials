    <textblock>
      This study is a phase 1, intravenous, open-label, single-dose escalation study to evaluate
      the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of ACP-501 (recombinant human
      Lecithin Cholesterol Acyl Transferase (rhLCAT)) in subjects with coronary artery disease
      (CAD). Four cohorts consisting of 4 subjects each will receive one dose of ACP-501. The dose
      will be escalated by cohort.

      After signing informed consent, subjects entered into the trial will be followed for up to 8
      weeks which includes: up to 4 weeks screening, entry criteria assessments on Day 0 and
      single-dose IV infusion on Day 1, and 4 weeks of follow-up.

             screening

          -  HDL-C &lt; 50 mg/dL for men and &lt; 55 mg/dL for women

          -  Body Mass Index (BMI) of approximately 18 to 35 kg/m^2; and a total body weight &gt;= 50

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Myocardial infarction, stroke, or coronary intervention/revascularization procedure
             within 6 months prior to dosing.

             II).

          -  Ventricular tachyarrhythmias.

          -  Uncontrolled Type 2 (HbA1c &gt; 8.5%) or Type 1 diabetes mellitus.

          -  Other severe acute or chronic medical or psychiatric condition or laboratory
             abnormality that may increase the risk associated with trial participation or
             investigational product administration or may interfere with the interpretation of
             trial results and, in the judgment of the investigator, would make the subject
             inappropriate for entry into this trial.
