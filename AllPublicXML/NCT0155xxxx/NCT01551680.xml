  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Recent pre-clinical and clinical data have indicated that BSI-201 does not possess
      characteristics typical of the PARP inhibitor class. Based on the results from in vitro and
      in vivo studies, this trial aims to evaluate the combination of BSI-201 concomitantly with
      radiotherapy in patients who present with multiple non operable brain metastases. As
      radiotherapy is a local treatment targeting only the tumor, and because the molecule BSI-201
      has shown no major toxicity against tissues without DNA alterations, the proposed combination
      is expected to provide tumor-selective therapy and leading to a clinical benefit improvement.

      Primary objective is to determine the recommended phase II dose (RP2D) and evaluate acute
      toxicity (CTC-AE v4.0 grading scale) of concurrent administration of whole brain radiotherapy
      (WBR) and a small molecule BSI-201 in non operable brain metastases.

    <intervention_name>Radiation combined with iniparib (BSI-201)</intervention_name>
    <description>Dose escalation of iniparib is implemented according to the CRML method. Three patients will be included at the first dose level (2.8 mg/kg). As long as no DLT is observed, escalation will proceed in cohorts of three patients at least included at the next dose levels (4, 5.6, 8, 11.2 mg/kg). Once a DLT is observed, the CRML will be activated and will be used until the MTD has been found or until six patients have been treated at the highest dose level (11.2 mg/kg). A dose level of 2.0 mg/kg (dose level -1) is included in case the first dose level at 2.8 mg/kg is found to be the MTD.
Iniparib is given by iv infusion over 1 hour twice weekly. BSI 201 will start the week before the beginning of radiotherapy (W1) and will be continued during the entire irradiation (W2, W3, W4). It will be stopped after 8 injections.
RT is delivered five days a week over 3 weeks (W2, W3, W4) up to a total dose of 37.5 Gy. Each fraction delivers 2.5 Gy by two opposed tangential fields.</description>
