    <textblock>
      This project is the first comprehensive prospective study of clinically non-functioning
      pituitary adenomas (CNFAs). Two groups of subjects will be studied: Group I will consist of
      100 patients with clinically non-functioning (CNF) pituitary lesions who are asymptomatic and
      do not require surgery; Group II will consist of 250 patients who have pituitary lesions that
      are symptomatic and require surgery. Patients will be followed with a series of endocrine
      laboratory testing, physical examinations, testing of quality of life and neurocognitive
      function before and serially over time either during non-surgical management or after surgery
      and in some patients before and after radiotherapy (RT). Data on pituitary magnetic resonance
      imaging (MRI) studies and visual field testing being done over time during follow up as part
      of clinical care will be collected.

      PROTOCOL I: Prospective Study of the outcome of conservative non-surgical management of
      patients with asymptomatic, clinically non-functioning (CNF) pituitary lesions. This protocol
      will evaluate prospectively the outcome of non-surgical management of clinically
      non-functioning pituitary lesions that do not appear to need surgery as their initial
      therapy. The overall design consists of an initial baseline evaluation and then serial
      prospective follow up studies over time for up to 5 years of follow up. The study will
      evaluate laboratory testing, clinical examinations, quality of life and neurocognitive
      function in these patients. We will also collect data on visual fields and MRI studies of the
      pituitary tumor that are done prospectively as part of clinical care to evaluate these
      patients. Data to be collected will include the prevalence of pituitary dysfunction at
      presentation, the safety of conservative non-surgical management of patients with
      asymptomatic, clinically nonfunctioning pituitary lesions with respect to the development of
      symptomatic tumor enlargement and pituitary dysfunction, the prevalence of the silent
      corticotroph tumor type that is characterized by elevated plasma levels of
      adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) or its precursor, pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC), and if it
      is associated with an increased tumor recurrence rate and prospectively assess quality of
      life and neurocognitive function in patients with clinically non-functioning pituitary
      lesions treated without surgery.

      PROTOCOL II : Prospective study of the outcome of patients with symptomatic, clinically
      non-functioning pituitary tumors who are treated with transsphenoidal surgery and in some
      cases also radiotherapy. This protocol will evaluate prospectively the outcome of surgical
      management of asymptomatic clinically nonfunctioning pituitary lesions. The overall design
      consists of an initial baseline evaluation and then serial prospective follow up studies over
      time with up to 5 years of follow up. The study will evaluate laboratory testing, clinical
      examinations, quality of life and neurocognitive function in these patients. We will also
      collect data on visual fields and MRI studies of the pituitary tumor that are done
      prospectively as part of clinical care to evaluate these patients. Data to be collected will
      be analyzed to determine the safety of observation alone following surgery for patients who
      do not have a clinically significant tumor remnant, if the silent corticotroph tumor type is
      characterized by elevated plasma levels of ACTH or its precursor, POMC, and if it is
      associated with an increased tumor recurrence rate. A group of patients who are planning RT
      will also be studied by these same procedures before and after RT in order to determine if
      the outcomes of patients who receive RT for treatment of tumor re-growth to that of those who
      do not receive RT with respect to further tumor growth, endocrine or neurological
      dysfunction. We will also prospectively assess quality of life and neurocognitive function in
      patients with clinically non-functioning pituitary lesions treated with surgery alone or
      those who also receive radiotherapy.
