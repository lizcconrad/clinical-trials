  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this study is to use magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) to measure
      the levels of several brain chemicals including, but not limited to, glutamate, glutamine,
      and N-acetylaspartate, before and after treatment with ECT. In addition to MRS, the
      investigators will use several other MRI techniques including structural MRI, resting state
      functional MRI (fMRI), and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) to measure how the structure and
      function of the brain changes with ECT.

      The investigators hypothesize that the Gln/Glu ratio is increased in the anterior cingulate
      cortex (ACC), but not the parieto-occipital cortex (POC), following the first ECT treatment.

        Twelve study participants between the ages of 18-55 with will be recruited from inpatient

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Male or female age 18-55

          -  Meets DSM-IV criteria for Bipolar Disorder Type I, II, or NOS with current episode
             depressed

          -  Has been scheduled to be evaluated by an ECT consultant from the McLean Hospital ECT
             service

          -  Current score of greater than or equal to 24 on the Montgomery-Asberg Depression
             Rating Scale (MADRS)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Unwillingness or inability to provide informed consent

          -  Lifetime history of schizophrenia

          -  DSM-IV diagnosis of alcohol or substance dependence, with the exception of nicotine
             dependence, within three months prior to screening

          -  Positive urine toxicology screen at screening (NOTE: Participants with a positive
             urine toxicology screen who are prescribed benzodiazepine, stimulant, or opiate
             medications by their physician will be permitted to enroll in the study as long as
             they do not meet abuse or dependence criteria for these substances)

          -  Female participants with a positive urine pregnancy test at screening

          -  Pregnancy. Females of childbearing potential must be using an effective contraceptive
             method (e.g., abstinence, prescription oral contraceptives, contraceptive injections,
             MRI-safe intrauterine device, double-barrier method, male partner sterilization)

          -  Any contraindications to having an MRI scan, including cardiac pacemakers, metal
             vascular clips or stents, artificial heart valves, certain kinds of prostheses, brain
             stimulator devices, implanted drug pumps, ear implants, eye implants or known metal
             fragments in eyes, exposure to shrapnel or metal filings (wounded in military combat,
             sheetmetal workers, welders, and others), transdermal drug delivery systems, and
             certain tattoos with metallic ink. NOTE: Participants will be screened for these
             conditions at screening, and will be required to fill out a standard MRI screening
             form at the Brain Imaging Center, which will be reviewed by an MRI technician prior to
             each MRI scan
