  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Aerobic interval training is shown to be superior in increasing oxygen uptake in both healthy
      and patients with coronary artery disease (CAD), compared to moderate continuous training.
      However, in cardiac rehabilitation exercise groups, exercise intensity is usually controlled
      with perceived exertion (Borg scale). The investigators will investigate degree of agreement
      between target heart rate and perceived exertion during interval training in cardiac
      rehabilitation.
