    <textblock>
      This is a single site, randomized, placebo-controlled, cross-over trial of sub-cutaneous
      injections of placebo and Stelara™ (ustekinumab) in subjects with scalp psoriasis.The purpose
      of the study is to assess the effectiveness of Stelara™ (ustekinumab)in the treatment of
      scalp psoriasis by determining the proportion of subjects who clear or almost clear in scalp
      specific physician assessments. The study will include approximately 30 subjects.
