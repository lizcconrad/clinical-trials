    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety profile, tolerability, pharmacokinetics
      (PK), pharmacodynamics, pharmacogenomic (PGX) and preliminary efficacy following daily oral
      doses of cabozantinib (XL184) in Japanese patients with advanced or metastatic solid tumors.
      Also, the effect of XL184 in the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients
      with various activating mutations will be evaluated at the recommended Phase 2 dose.

        Select Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects with advanced or metastatic solid tumors for whom the standard of care is
             ineffective or inappropriate.

          -  NSCLC expansion cohort subjects must have confirmed NSCLC (Stage IIIb or IV) and
             documented activating mutations.

          -  At least 4 weeks must have elapsed from the last anti-cancer therapy. At least 6 weeks
             for nitrosoureas, mitomycin C and liposomal doxorubicin.

          -  Have adequate bone marrow function, adequate liver function, and adequate renal
             function.

          -  Sexually active subjects (men and women of child-bearing potential (WOCBP)) must agree
             to use medically accepted barrier methods of contraception (eg, male or female condom)
             during the course of the study and for 4 months after the last dose of study drug(s),
             even if oral contraceptives are also used. All subjects of reproductive potential must
             agree to use both a barrier method and a second method of birth control. Women of
             childbearing potential (WOCBP) must have a negative pregnancy test at screening.
