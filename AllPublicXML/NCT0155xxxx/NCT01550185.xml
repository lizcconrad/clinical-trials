      The purpose of this study is to find out the highest safe dose and examine the side effects
      and effectiveness of eltrombopag olamine in patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML)
      treated with chemotherapy that have not responded to previous therapy or have suffered a
      relapse

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To estimate the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and examine the tolerability of daily oral
      eltrombopag (eltrombopag olamine) (14 days +/- 2 days after initiation of cytarabine) in
      patients receiving high dose cytarabine and mitoxantrone for the treatment of acute myeloid
      leukemia patients with hypoplastic bone marrow 14 days +/- 2 days from initiation of
      cytarabine.

      II. To examine platelet count recovery to &gt;= 100 x 10^9/L when eltrombopag is administered
      following high dose cytarabine and mitoxantrone for the treatment of acute myeloid leukemic
      patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.

      Patients receive eltrombopag olamine orally (PO) once daily (QD) from day 1 up to day 62.
      Treatment continues for up to 9 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days.
