  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main purpose of this study is to establish that etoricoxib 30 mg is safe and not inferior
      to celecoxib 200 mg in the treatment of the signs and symptoms of osteoarthritis in Korean
      patients. Given that the efficacy of etoricoxib vs. placebo in the treatment of
      osteoarthritis has been established, and that prescription drugs, such as celecoxib, are
      available for the treatment of pain associated with osteoarthritis in Korea, it would be
      inappropriate to subject patients with a flare of osteoarthritic pain to the placebo
      treatment for 12 weeks, and thus the study is designed as an active-comparator study.

    <measure>Time-Weighted Mean Change From Baseline in Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) Pain Subscale</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 2, Week 6, Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The WOMAC osteoarthritis scale consists of 24 items in 3 subscales: pain, stiffness, and physical function. The pain subscale rates participant pain during walking, using stairs, in bed, sitting or lying, and standing using a visual analog scale (VAS) from 0-100mm where 0 is the best possible level of pain and 100 is the highest level of pain. The pain subscale is calculated as the average of the responses to the 5 questions related to pain. The calculation of the time-weighted average was done by taking the time between adjacent observations divided by the time from the randomization visit to the last observation in the period of interest, and using it as the weight for computation of the average.</description>

    <measure>Time-Weighted Mean Change From Baseline in the WOMAC Physical Function Subscale</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 2, Week 6, Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The WOMAC osteoarthritis scale consists of 24 items in 3 subscales: pain, stiffness, and physical function. The physical function subscale rates participant pain during stair use, rising from sitting, standing, bending, walking, getting in/out of a car, shopping, putting on/taking off socks, rising from bed, lying in bed, getting in/out of the bath, sitting, getting on/off the toilet, heavy household duties, and light household duties using a visual analog scale (VAS) from 0-100mm where 0 is the best possible level of functioning and 100 is the highest level of functioning. The physical function subscale was calculated as the average of the responses to the 17 questions related to functional status. The calculation of the time-weighted average was done by taking the time between adjacent observations divided by the time from the randomization visit to the last observation in the period of interest, and using it as the weight for computation of the average.</description>

    <measure>Time-Weighted Mean Change From Baseline in the Participant Global Assessment of Disease Status</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 2, Week 6, Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The Participant Global Assessmet of Disease was a one item questionnaire that asked participants to answer the following question, &quot;Considering all the ways your arthritis affects you, mark (X) on the scale for how well you are doing.&quot; The questionnaire employed a 0-100 mm visual analog scale (VAS) to record participant responses, with 0 representing the best possible assessment and 100 representing the worst possible assessment. The calculation of the time-weighted average was done by taking the time between adjacent observations divided by the time from the randomization visit to the last observation in the period of interest, and using it as the weight for computation of the average.</description>

    <measure>Time-Weighted Mean Response in the Participant Global Assessment of Response to Therapy</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 2, Week 6, Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>Participants were asked to rate their global assessment of response to therapy on a Likert scale from 0 to 4, with 0 = excellent, 1 = good, 2 = fair, 3 = poor, 4 = none. The calculation of the time-weighted average was done by taking the time between adjacent observations divided by the time from the randomization visit to the last observation in the period of interest, and using it as the weight for computation of the average.</description>

    <measure>Time-Weighted Mean Change From Baseline in the Investigator Global Assessment of Disease Status</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 2, Week 6, Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>Study investigators were asked to rate the global assessment of participant disease status on a Likert scale from 0 to 4, with 0 = very well, 1 = good, 2 = fair, 3 = poor and 4 = very poor. The calculation of the time-weighted average was done by taking the time between adjacent observations divided by the time from the randomization visit to the last observation in the period of interest, and using it as the weight for computation of the average.</description>

    <measure>Time-Weighted Mean Change From Baseline in the WOMAC Stiffness Subscale</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 2, Week 6, Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The WOMAC osteoarthritis scale consists of 24 items in 3 subscales: pain, stiffness, and physical function. The stiffness subscale rates stiffness after first waking and later in the day using a visual analog scale (VAS) from 0-100mm where 0 is the best possible level of stiffness and 100 is the highest level of stiffness. The stiffness subscale is calculated as the average of the responses to the 2 questions related to stiffness. The calculation of the time-weighted average was done by taking the time between adjacent observations divided by the time from the randomization visit to the last observation in the period of interest, and using it as the weight for computation of the average.</description>

        <title>Time-Weighted Mean Change From Baseline in Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) Pain Subscale</title>
        <description>The WOMAC osteoarthritis scale consists of 24 items in 3 subscales: pain, stiffness, and physical function. The pain subscale rates participant pain during walking, using stairs, in bed, sitting or lying, and standing using a visual analog scale (VAS) from 0-100mm where 0 is the best possible level of pain and 100 is the highest level of pain. The pain subscale is calculated as the average of the responses to the 5 questions related to pain. The calculation of the time-weighted average was done by taking the time between adjacent observations divided by the time from the randomization visit to the last observation in the period of interest, and using it as the weight for computation of the average.</description>

        <description>The WOMAC osteoarthritis scale consists of 24 items in 3 subscales: pain, stiffness, and physical function. The physical function subscale rates participant pain during stair use, rising from sitting, standing, bending, walking, getting in/out of a car, shopping, putting on/taking off socks, rising from bed, lying in bed, getting in/out of the bath, sitting, getting on/off the toilet, heavy household duties, and light household duties using a visual analog scale (VAS) from 0-100mm where 0 is the best possible level of functioning and 100 is the highest level of functioning. The physical function subscale was calculated as the average of the responses to the 17 questions related to functional status.

        <title>Time-Weighted Mean Change From Baseline in the Participant Global Assessment of Disease Status</title>
        <description>The Participant Global Assessmet of Disease was a one item questionnaire that asked participants to answer the following question, “Considering all the ways your arthritis affects you, mark (X) on the scale for how well you are doing.” The questionnaire employed a 0-100 mm visual analog scale (VAS) to record participant responses, with 0 representing the best possible assessment and 100 representing the worst possible assessment. The calculation of the time-weighted average was done by taking the time between adjacent observations divided by the time from the randomization visit to the last observation in the period of interest, and using it as the weight for computation of the average.</description>

          <title>Time-Weighted Mean Change From Baseline in the Participant Global Assessment of Disease Status</title>
          <description>The Participant Global Assessmet of Disease was a one item questionnaire that asked participants to answer the following question, “Considering all the ways your arthritis affects you, mark (X) on the scale for how well you are doing.” The questionnaire employed a 0-100 mm visual analog scale (VAS) to record participant responses, with 0 representing the best possible assessment and 100 representing the worst possible assessment. The calculation of the time-weighted average was done by taking the time between adjacent observations divided by the time from the randomization visit to the last observation in the period of interest, and using it as the weight for computation of the average.</description>

        <title>Time-Weighted Mean Change From Baseline in the WOMAC Stiffness Subscale</title>
        <description>The WOMAC osteoarthritis scale consists of 24 items in 3 subscales: pain, stiffness, and physical function. The stiffness subscale rates stiffness after first waking and later in the day using a visual analog scale (VAS) from 0-100mm where 0 is the best possible level of stiffness and 100 is the highest level of stiffness. The stiffness subscale is calculated as the average of the responses to the 2 questions related to stiffness. The calculation of the time-weighted average was done by taking the time between adjacent observations divided by the time from the randomization visit to the last observation in the period of interest, and using it as the weight for computation of the average.</description>
