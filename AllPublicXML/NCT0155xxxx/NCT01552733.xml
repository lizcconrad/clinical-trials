  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Weakness and impairment of the upper limb is a common contributing factor to post stroke
      disability. Specially designed robotic systems have been developed to try to improve this.
      The investigators already know that their use helps improve limb function after stroke when
      it has been present for many months. The investigators do not know whether they can help
      early after stroke and enhance recovery of limb function, and perhaps prevent weakness
      becoming chronic.

      The investigators plan a randomised controlled blinded study to explore the benefits of robot
      assisted therapy early after stroke in 80 stroke survivors. Participants will be randomised
      by 7 days after stroke to standard care or to robotic therapy (40 participants per study
      group).

      Standard of care will be rehabilitation therapy according to local guidelines delivered by
      NHS multidisciplinary team.

      Robotic therapy sessions lasts approximately one hour and consists of a series of tasks in
      first the unimpaired then impaired limb. The robotic-assisted therapy will consist of a
      series of taks including circle-drawing, reaching targets and holding/moving against moderate
      resistance. Twelve sessions of therapy within the first 4 weeks after randomisation will be
      delivered. This study will take 3 years to complete.
