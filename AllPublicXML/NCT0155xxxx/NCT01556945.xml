  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to see if two new malaria vaccines called FMP1 and RTSS,
      combined with an adjuvant (called SBAS2) which helps stimulate the body's immune system, are
      safe, demonstrate an immune response through blood tests, and lastly, to see if the vaccines
      can prevent malaria infection.

      The RTS,S vaccine contains a malaria protein in combination with a portion of the
      commercially available hepatitis B vaccine. The FMP1 vaccine also contains a malaria protein.
      The adjuvant called SBAS2, is a special oil in water emulsion. Vaccinations are done at study
      days 0, 28 and 84, followed by a malaria challenge approximately 14 days after the 3rd
      vaccination.

    <description>The vaccine antigen FMP1 consists of a recombinant histidine-tagged (His6) fusion protein expressed in E. coli. The lyophilized pellet contained per vaccine vial 62.5 μg merozoite surface protein-142 (MSP-142) with 3.1% lactose as cryoprotectant in each 3 ml monodose vial. The pellet was reconstituted with AS02.</description>

    <description>Experimental challenge homologous strain of P.falciparum sporozoites. Mosquitoes infected with malaria approximately 17 to 19 days earlier and that contained sporozoites in their salivary glands.
