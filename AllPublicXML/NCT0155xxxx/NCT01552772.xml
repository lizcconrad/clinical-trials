    <textblock>
      This study will test the safety of an aripiprazole injection in subjects with schizophrenia
      that are currently taking oral antipsychotic medication other than aripiprazole. Subjects in
      this study will receive one injection of aripiprazole and will need to stop taking their
      other antipsychotic medication two weeks after the injection. The study will last one month.
      Subjects will be required to come to a clinic for evaluations and drug and urine collection
      five times during the course of the study.

    <measure>Number of Participants With Adverse Events (AE).</measure>
    <time_frame>From the time the informed consent (ICF) was signed until follow-up at 30 days after the last trial visit (Day 28).</time_frame>
    <description>An AE was defined as any new medical problem, or exacerbation of an existing problem, experienced by a participant while enrolled in the trial, whether or not it was considered drug related by the study physician. A serious adverse event (SAE) was any untoward medical occurrence that resulted in death or was life-threatening or required inpatient hospitalization or prolonged hospitalization. TEAE stands for treatment emergent adverse events.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Total Score of Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) for Observed Cases (OC) Data.</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 1, 2, 4 and Last visit (Day 28).</time_frame>
    <description>The PANSS consisted of three subscales: a total of 30 symptom constructs. For each symptom construct, severity was rated on a 7-point scale, with a score of 1 (absence of symptoms) and a score of 7 (extremely severe symptoms). The PANSS total score was the sum of the rating scores for 7 positive scale items, 7 negative scale items, and 16 general psychopathology scale items from the PANSS panel. The PANSS total score ranged from 30 (best possible outcome) to 210 (worst possible outcome).</description>

The PANSS positive subscale score was the sum of the rating scores for the 7 positive scale items from the PANSS panel. The 7 positive symptom constructs are delusions, conceptual disorganization, hallucinatory behavior, excitement, grandiosity, suspiciousness/persecution, and hostility.

Concomitant to the aripiprazole IM depot injection, participants continued to receive their current atypical antipsychotic medication for 14 days.</description>

          <title>Change From Baseline in PANSS Positive Sub-scale Score for OC Data.</title>
          <description>The Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) consisted of three subscales: a total of 30 symptom constructs. For each symptom construct, severity was rated on a 7-point scale, with a score of 1 (absence of symptoms) and a score of 7 (extremely severe symptoms). The PANSS positive subscale score was the sum of the rating scores for the 7 positive scale items from the PANSS panel. The 7 positive symptom constructs are delusions, conceptual disorganization, hallucinatory behavior, excitement, grandiosity, suspiciousness/persecution, and hostility. The PANSS total score ranged from 30 (best possible outcome) to 210 (worst possible outcome).</description>
          <population>The efficacy analyses dataset consisted of enrolled participants who had at least one efficacy measurement. The OC dataset are participants who were evaluated at that visit on the efficacy variable under analysis (i.e. participants who had missing data due to drop out or other reasons were not included in the OC dataset).</population>
