      Study population: 1) mutation carriers without the hypertrophic phenotype (pre-clinical
      Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy (HCM)) and in 2) patients with clinically overt HCM (clinical
      HCM).

      Hypothesis: Cardiac troponin release after exercise can be demonstrated in both clinical and
      pre-clinical HCM patients.

        The study population will consist of clinical or pre-clinical HCM patients that are
        registered in the HCM database of the HCM outpatient clinic of University Medical Center
        St. Radboud. This database will be screened for eligible patients according to the in- and
        exclusion criteria described below.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with an echocardiographically proven hypertrophic cardiomyopathy according to
             the ESC guidelines or individuals with a HCM associated mutation without the clinical
             characteristics of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (pre-clinical HCM patients);

          -  Age â‰¥ 18 years;

          -  Able to comply with the protocol;

          -  Written informed consent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Known significant epicardial coronary artery disease;

          -  Patients with LVH in the clinical setting of other disorders that explain the
             myocardial hypertrophy (amyloidosis, MELAS, Anderson-Fabry, WPW etc.);

          -  Heart failure NYHA class III-IV;

          -  Patients with known hemodynamic instability or syncope during exercise due to left
             ventricular outflow gradient or occurrence of ventricular arrhythmia;

          -  History of PTSMA (percutaneous transluminal septal myocardial ablation) or Morrow
             myectomy;

          -  Patients not able to complete a bicycle test;

          -  Any contraindication to MR imaging (MR imaging is not obligatory for assessment of the
             primary objective, therefore relative exclusion criterion);

          -  Recent (within 30 days) admittance to the hospital for any cardiac reason (myocardial
             infarction, heart failure, cardiac arrhythmia, etc.);

          -  Severe renal insufficiency (eGFR &lt; 30 ml/min);

          -  Any other condition which, in the opinion of the investigator, may pose a significant
             hazard to the subject if he or she participates in the present study.
