      Background

      It is commonly believed that a heart attack is caused by rupture of a plaque in the wall of
      the coronary artery, resulting in blood clots which impede blood flow. Currently, the
      investigators do not know whether heart attacks in patients who had a recent surgery are
      caused by the same disease process as those who did not have any surgery. This study will
      inform the investigators of very vital information about the cause of surgery-related heart
      attacks by taking images of coronary arteries using Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT).
      Images will also be taken from heart attack patients who did not have recent surgery, and the
      two groups will be compared.

      OCT imaging

      OCT is a relatively new imaging technology which is much better at taking images of the
      inside of the artery. OCT imaging procedure is carried out at the time of scheduled coronary
      angiogram, where a catheter with a mini-camera at its tip is advanced into the coronary
      artery, it will record video images of a length of the artery. These images will take
      approximately 3-4 seconds to obtain. Besides the OCT imaging being performed, the rest of the
      angiogram procedure is carried out in exactly the same way as it would normally proceed.

      The OCT study will provide doctors with new information about the cause of surgery-related
      heart attacks, and will guide doctors in treating and preventing heart attacks in patients
      who undergo surgery.

      Hypothesis

      The investigators hypothesize that features of acute plaque rupture will be more common in
      patients with non-surgery related heart attacks compared to those which occur following
      surgery.

      Design

      Two groups of patients will be recruited(&gt;20 in each group):

        1. non-surgery related heart attack patients

        2. patients who suffered from a heart attack following an operation.

      Outcome measures

      Using OCT, plaque features in coronary arteries of patients with heart attacks from both the
      surgical and non-surgical groups at the time of coronary angiogram will be compared.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The majority of spontaneous non-ST segment elevation myocardial infarctions (NSTEMI) are
      attributed to rupture of an unstable atherosclerotic plaque in an epicardial coronary artery
      with thrombus formation. On the other hand, the pathophysiology underlying myocardial
      infarction following non-cardiac surgery is not well understood. The literature suggests that
      a significant proportion of myocardial infarctions following surgery may result from
      decreased myocardial perfusion in the presence of stable coronary artery disease without
      plaque rupture or thrombus formation.

      Intra-coronary Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) provides superior visualisation of the
      vascular lumen and structures close to the arterial lumen compared to IVUS, including
      features of plaque instability, including atherosclerotic plaque contents, fibrous cap
      thickness, thin cap fibroatheromas (TCFA), macrophage infiltration and calcium (2-10). OCT is
      therefore an ideal imaging technique to examine the pathophysiology involved in POMI, where
      features of plaque rupture and thrombus formation can be clearly distinguished from stable
      plaques.

      An improved understanding of the pathophysiology of MI following non-cardiac surgery will
      guide management more appropriately.

      Primary objective

        1. To identify features of acute plaque rupture in peri-operative myocardial infarction
           (POMI)

        2. To compare frequency of acute plaque rupture imaging findings between POMI and
           non-operative non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI)

      Hypothesis

      The investigators hypothesize that features of acute plaque rupture will be more common in
      patients with non-operative NSTEMI compared to POMI.

      Outcome measures

      1. OCT features of coronary plaque rupture will be obtained at the time of coronary
      angiography, these features include thin cap fibroatheroma, intramural thrombus and plaque
      fissuring. OCT data from NSTEMI and POMI patient groups will be compared. Data on other
      plaque features, including fibrous cap thickness, lipid core, minimum luminal cross-sectional
      area (CSA), ruptured cavity CSA will also be collected, and compared between the two patient
      groups.

      There will be no clinical follow-up in this study.
