      The goal of the study is to determine if patients who are being treated for pneumonia in the
      intensive care unit can be safely treated with five days of antibiotics (the current standard
      is seven to eight days). The goal is to determine if the investigators can minimize
      antibiotic complications while still treating the infection. Patients in the study are
      randomly assigned to either receive antibiotics for a goal of five days or a goal of seven
      days. Every patient is followed daily, and if they are not responding to the antibiotics, the
      treating team in the intensive care unit care can continue the antibiotics for a longer
      course regardless of what group the patient is assigned. The investigator's hypothesis is
      that patients in the five day treatment goal will be able to receive less antibiotics than
      patients in the seven day treatment goal without any adverse effects.

      This is a pilot study to determine if patients with pneumonia in the intensive care unit can
      safely receive five days of antibiotics. All patients admitted to the medical and surgical
      intensive care units at Barnes-Jewish Hospital with pneumonia will be screened for the
      inclusion and exclusion criteria. Patients will be randomized by sealed envelopes in groups
      of six to a five or seven day course of antibiotics. The choice of the antibiotic to be used
      is determined by the intensive care unit treating team. The patients will NOT be randomized
      to a specific antibiotic. The patients will be followed for a clinical response by
      improvement in maximum daily temperature, white blood cell count, and PaO2 to FiO2 ratio.
      Antibiotics can continue past the goal duration for patients in either group if the above
      criteria are not met or if the attending physician in the intensive care unit feels that a
      longer course is needed. The treating team in the intensive care unit will not be blinded to
      the patient's treatment assignment.

    <description>Patients will not receive routine follow-up respiratory cultures as part of the protocol. However, if a culture is obtained on a clinical basis and the culture grows a new multi-drug resistant bacteria, then this outcome is met. The outcome does NOT have a specific unit of measure as it is a measure of whether a multi-drug resistant bacteria is present or not. The definition for a multi-drug resistant bacteria is based on the definition provided by the European Centers for Disease Control.</description>

    <description>The choice of the specific antibiotic is made by the treating intensive care unit attending physician. The patients will be randomized to two separate groups based on length of antibiotic therapy not specific antibiotics. Therefore, the actual antibiotic that will be given is not determined by the study. The patients all will receive antibiotics for pneumonia chosen by the intensive care unit team, and those in this group receive a goal of 5 days.</description>
