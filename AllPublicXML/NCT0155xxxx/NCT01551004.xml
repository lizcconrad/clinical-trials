  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled Phase I Trial to determine the safety and
      pharmokinetics of a single dose of CRS3123 in healthy adult volunteers. Forty healthy male
      and female subjects 18 to 45 years will be admitted in 5 dosing Cohorts, 8 subjects per
      Cohort. Up to two alternates may be used per dosing Cohorts for study subjects that drop out.
      The primary objective of the study is to determine the safety and tolerability of escalating
      doses of CRS3123 following oral administration to healthy subjects.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase I, multi-center, placebo-controlled, double-blind, dose-escalation study to
      evaluate the safety and tolerability of CRS3123, a methionyl-tRNA synthetase inhibitor. Since
      this is a FIH study of a new class of drugs, the maximum safe starting dose was estimated
      from the NOAEL from preclinical studies in accordance with FDA guidance documents (FDA
      Guidance for Industry, July 2005). A very low starting dose has been chosen. In the initial
      Cohorts, doses of 100, 200 and 400 will be given; all are below the estimated human starting
      dose. If any significant safety signals are encountered, the investigators will notify the
      SMC and call for a review. Dose escalation to Cohorts D and E will require a full SMC review
      of all safety data obtained through Day 7 for the preceding Cohorts. Forty healthy male and
      female subjects 18 to 45 years, inclusive, will be admitted for an inpatient study. Each
      subject will receive a single oral dose of CRS3123 or placebo. There will be 8 patients for
      each cohort (6 active, 2 placebo). The ascending doses are 100, 200, 400, 800 and 1200 mg
      respectively for cohorts A through E. The primary objective is the safety and tolerability of
      escalating doses of CRS3123 following oral administration to healthy subjects. The secondary
      objective is to assess whether there is measurable systemic exposure and if so, to determine
      the plasma pharmacokinetic characteristics of CRS3123 after a single oral dose.

        use at least one of the above listed contraceptive methods. -If the subject uses abstinence
        and becomes sexually active during the study, they must agree to use TWO if female and one
        if male, of the above listed contraceptive methods.
