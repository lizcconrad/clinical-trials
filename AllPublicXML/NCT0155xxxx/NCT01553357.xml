    <textblock>
      This is an open label, multicenter, exploratory, single arm, two-stage study aiming to
      explore efficacy and safety of lenalidomide and dexamethasone combination (LD) as first line
      therapy in previously untreated patients with primary Plasma Cell leukemia (PPCL).

    <textblock>
      The primary endpoint was response rate according to International Uniform Criteria; secondary
      endpoints were: i) time to progression (TTP), progression free survival (PFS, and overall
      survival (OS); ii) percentage of eligible PPCL patients able to mobilize and collect
      peripheral blood stem cells after LD treatment; iii) percentage of eligible PPCL patients
      able to undergo autologous or allogeneic stem cells transplantation after LD treatment; iv)
      serious/severe adverse event (SAEs) rate.

    <intervention_name>Lenalidomide, dexamethasone</intervention_name>
    <description>Enrolled patients received lenalidomide at a dose of 25 mg/d for 21 days and oral dexamethasone at a dose of 40 mg on days 1, 8, 15, and 22 for each 28-day cycle. After 4 cycles, responding patients not eligible for SCT continued until 8 cycles of full-dose LD, if tolerated, followed by a maintenance dose of single agent lenalidomide equal to 10 mg/d on days 1-21 of each 28-day cycle.
Patients responding after 4 cycles and eligible for SCT proceeded according to single Centre transplant policy. Patients not responding after 4 cycles or progressing during this treatment were considered off-study.</description>
