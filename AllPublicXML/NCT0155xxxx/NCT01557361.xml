      The objectives of this trial are to determine whether, in critically ill patients with severe
      acute kidney injury (AKI), randomization to accelerated initiation of renal replacement
      therapy (RRT), compared with standard initiation, is:

        1. Feasible, in terms of adherence to the protocol (primary outcome), recruitment rates,
           and achievement of follow-up; and

        2. Safe, from the perspective of potential adverse events associated with earlier
           initiation of RRT

    <textblock>
      Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a common and devastating complication of critical illness. Once
      AKI is established, treatment is largely supportive and no intervention has been found to
      restore kidney function or improve overall survival. Renal replacement therapy (RRT), usually
      in the form of hemodialysis, is frequently needed to manage patients with severe AKI. Such
      patients have an in-hospital mortality that consistently exceeds 50%. Delay in the initiation
      of RRT has been implicated as a possible contributor to this poor outcome. A recent
      meta-analysis suggested that earlier initiation of RRT may improve survival. However,
      completed trials to date have been small, single centre, limited by study quality, and have
      shown considerable heterogeneity in terms of definitions used for &quot;early&quot; RRT initiation.

      The objectives of this trial are to determine whether, in critically ill patients with severe
      acute kidney injury (AKI), randomization to accelerated initiation of renal replacement
      therapy (RRT), compared with standard initiation, is:

        1. Feasible, in terms of adherence to the protocol (primary outcome), recruitment rates,
           and achievement of follow-up; and

        2. Safe, from the perspective of potential adverse events associated with the earlier or
           later initiation of RRT

      This pilot trial is intended to guide and inform the design of a phase III multicentre
      randomized trial of accelerated versus standard initiation of RRT in critically ill patients
      that will evaluate the impact of the intervention on 90-day all-cause mortality and recovery
      of kidney function.

    <description>Patients will be carefully followed over a period of 7 days to identify potential indications for RRT. The trial team will ask that the clinical team consider RRT initiation if there are:
I. Criteria for persistent AKI (serum creatinine has not declined by more than 50% from value recorded at time of eligibility) AND
II. At least one of the following indications for RRT initiation:
Serum potassium ≥6.0 mmol/L, or
Serum bicarbonate ≤ 10 mmol/L, or
Evidence of severe respiratory failure, based on a PaO2/FiO2 &lt;200 and bilateral infiltrates on the chest x-ray, or
By 72 hours after randomization, creatinine has not declined by more than 50% from that recorded at the time of randomization</description>
