  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 3-part study will assess the safety,
      tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of orally administered ALS-002158 in healthy volunteers
      (HV) and subjects with chronic hepatitis C (CHC) genotype 1 infection.

      Part 1 will assess single ascending dosing pharmacokinetics and safety in HV. Part 2 will
      assess food effects on pharmacokinetics in HV.

      Part 3 will assess multiple ascending dosing pharmacokinetics and safety in subjects with CHC
      genotype 1 infection.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject has provided written consent.

          -  Subject is in good health as deemed by the investigator

          -  Creatinine clearance of greater than 50 mL/min (Cockcroft- Gault).

          -  Male or female, 18-55 years of age for HV and 18-65 years of age for subjects with
             CHC.

          -  Body mass index (BMI) 18-32 kg/m2 inclusive for HV and 18-36 kg/m2 for subjects with
             CHC, minimum weight 50 kg in both populations.

          -  A female is eligible to participate in this study if she is of non-childbearing
             potential.
