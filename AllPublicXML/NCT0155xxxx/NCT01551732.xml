      game to anger control cognitive behavioral therapy is an effective and feasible treatment.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Current treatments for pathological anger and aggression in youth are lacking in their
      effectiveness to motivate and engage patients in treatment. As a result, mental health
      providers encounter challenges due to the limited generalizability of treatment effects to
      real-world situations outside of the therapist's office. When behavioral treatments fail to
      show lasting results, children and adolescents are often placed on antipsychotic medication
      to control their behaviors, which may result in significant toxicity levels and for which
      there is limited knowledge of the long-term effects on pediatric growth and development. This
      study tests an interactive biofeedback video game called RAGE-Control (for Regulate and Gain
      Emotional-Control) as a treatment for youth exhibiting anger and aggression. Treatment with
      RAGE-Control seeks to motivate children and adolescents to learn and practice coping skills
      taught in therapy within the environment of a fun and enjoyable video game. The game provides
      patients a venue to practice self-regulation techniques in response to the increasing stress
      of the game. Providing patients with the opportunity to refine their self-regulation skills
      in a fast-paced challenging game is hypothesized to result in greater generalization of
      therapeutic skills to situations outside of the therapist's office. The goal of the treatment
      is to decrease patients' feelings of anger, and to increase the patients' levels of control
      in their emotional and behavioral responses.
