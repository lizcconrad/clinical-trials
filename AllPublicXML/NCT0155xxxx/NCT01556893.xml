  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This will be a prospective, single-center clinical trial of up to 50 eyes of subjects
      scheduled to undergo LASIK surgery requiring an initial corneal flap. Subjects will be
      screened for eligibility.

      Subjects will undergo LASIK surgery using the LenSx Laser to create the corneal flap prior to
      excimer laser treatment.

      Subjects will be evaluated intraoperatively to assess the ease of lifting the flaps, the
      stromal bed quality, and the amount of opaque bubble layer. All patients will be followed
      with routine vision exams for 3 months postoperatively to evaluate changes in visual acuity,
      manifest refraction, slit lamp examination, and endothelial cell counts.

    <description>The LenSx laser system is a femtosecond laser that has received 510(k) clearance for anterior capsulotomy during cataract surgery (K082947), laser phacofragmentation during cataract surgery (K094052) and for use in the creation of a single and multi-plane arc cut/incisions in the cornea (K092647).</description>

          4. If subject is a contact lens wearer, discontinuation of contact lens wear prior to
             preoperative exam (2 weeks prior for soft contact lenses, 4 weeks prior for rigid gas
             permeable contact lenses, and 8 weeks prior for hard contact lenses)

          5. Must be willing and able to return for scheduled follow up examinations through 3
             months after surgery

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Known sensitivity to planned study concomitant medications

          2. Participation in any other ophthalmic drug or device clinical trial during the time of
             this clinical investigation

          3. Presenting any contraindications to femtosecond initiated LASIK

          4. Corneal thickness values that will result in residual bed less than 280 microns when
             flap resection and excimer ablation are calculated

          5. Irregular astigmatism, based on Investigator's judgment

          6. Undergoing monovision LASIK

          7. Pregnant, lactating or plan to become pregnant during the course of this study

          8. For bilateral second study eyes only: The surgeon shall not proceed with the second
             eye until the 1 week exam of the first eye shows no vision threatening complications.
