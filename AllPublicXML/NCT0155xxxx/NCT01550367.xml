  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main goal of the research study is to determine whether treating renal cell cancer
      patients with the study drug, hydroxychloroquine, along with IL-2, a standard treatment of
      kidney cancer that has spread to other parts of the body, can make the cancer easier to kill
      and eliminate. Another goal is to see how the study drug affects the body's immune cells
      which fight cancer cells.

      The rationale for combining the high dose bolus aldesleukin with hydroxychloroquine includes
      potential positive interactions on the immune regulatory side, non-overlapping toxicities,
      and potential for prolongation and increased number of responses based on murine studies
      conducted at the University of Pittsburgh. This study is a multi-center phase II study
      designed to estimate the efficacy of combination therapy of standard high dose bolus IL-2 and
      various doses of hydroxychloroquine therapy in metastatic RCC patients.

          -  Have measurable disease by RECIST 1.1 criteria. For example, this would include tumor
             in the lung, liver, and retroperitoneum. Bone disease is difficult to follow and
             quantify and as a sole site would not be acceptable.

             effects.

             nervous system or brain metastases.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients who have previously received IL-2 are NOT eligible. Patients on HCQ in
             neoadjuvant protocols or in the past for clinical indications ARE eligible, as are

          -  Use of corticosteroids or other immunosuppression (if patient had been taking
             steroids, at least 2 weeks must have passed since the last dose).
