  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study investigates if applying a special ventilatory strategy during anesthesia for
      laparoscopic gastric by pass, produces less atelectasis and better oxygenation in spite of
      using 100 % oxygen during pre oxygenation and induction of anesthesia. The study investigates
      oxygenation with blood gas samples but also with a new method that might give more
      information without the use of blood gas samples.

      Primary: Oxygenation in patients with morbid obesity improves if preoxygenation, induction
      and maintenance of anesthesia is performed with either a continuous positive airway pressure
      (CPAP) or a positive end expiratory pressure (PEEP), respectively, of 10 cm H2O, in
      comparison to a technique without CPAP but with a PEEP of 10 cm H2O.

      Secondary: The improved oxygenation during anesthesia can be prolonged inte the postoperative
      period if emergence from anesthesia is performed without high levels of oxygen.

    <description>This arm describes some aspects of ventilation during anesthesia for laparoscopic gastric bypass. Pre-oxygenation is with an inspiratory oxygen fraction(FIO2) of 1.0, supplied by a continuous positive airway pressure of 10 centimeters of water(cmH2O), during anesthesia a positive end-expiratory pressure of 10 cmH2O is used and during emergence from anesthesia a FIO2 of 1.0 is used. The intervention associated with this arm is labeled CPAP and 100% oxygen.</description>
