      The need exists for alternatives to 99mTc based perfusion radiotracers for cardiac patient
      management. An alternative radiotracer, I123-CMICE-013, has been developed at the Canadian
      Molecular Imaging Center of Excellence (C-MICE) at the University of Ottawa Heart Institute.
      Initial testing results in rats and pigs suggest that in addition to being a
      cyclotron-produced alternative to 99mTc tracers, I-123-CMICE-013 may be a superior tracer for
      measuring myocardial perfusion.This Phase 1 study will study the safety and tolerability,
      biodistribution, pharmacokinetics and radiation dosimetry, and distribution and localization
      of I123-CMICE-013in healthy adult volunteers.

    <textblock>
      Single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI) is an
      established, cost effective tool for the risk stratification and management of patients
      suspected or known to have coronary artery disease (CAD)Myocardial perfusion imaging is
      significantly affected by interruptions in the supply of 99mMo, the parent isotope of 99mTc
      used for the majority of MPI. An alternative radiotracer, I123-CMICE-013,developed at the
      Canadian Molecular Imaging Center of Excellence (C-MICE) at the University of Ottawa Heart
      Institute, has completed pre-clinical trial testing and is ready for Phase 1 human trials.

      This Phase I study will be a single centre, open label study. Subjects will receive 2 doses
      of study drug. One rest dose and one stress dose will be administered on separate days, one
      week apart. Subjects will undergo a standard clinical exercise stress protocol for the stress
      dose. Gamma camera imaging following each administration will be done over 2 days.

      Biodistribution, pharmacokinetics, dosimetry and safety variables will be analyzed.

    <description>Quantitative in vivo biodistribution will be determined through whole-body planar imaging immediately and at 90 mins, 4 hrs, 6 hrs and 24 hrs post injection. Venous blood samples of 10 ml volume each will be taken at nominal times of 5, 10, 15, 30, 60, 90 and 180 minutes post administration and at 6 and 24 hours and activity measured. Urine and faeces as voided up to 24 hrs post administration will be assayed.
Internal radiation dose, Effective Dose Equivalent (ICRP 30), Effective Dose (ICRP 60) and organ residence times will be calculated.</description>
