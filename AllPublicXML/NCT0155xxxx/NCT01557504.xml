    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess:

        1. the safety and tolerability of two sitagliptin 50 mg/metformin 1000 mg XR tablets in
           pediatric participants with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), aged 10 to 17 years

        2. the ability of pediatric participants with T2DM, aged 10 to 17 years, to swallow two
           sitagliptin 50 mg/metformin 1000 mg XR tablets or two matching placebo tablets
           (excluding marking)

        3. the pharmacokinetics of sitagliptin and metformin following the administration of two
           sitagliptin 50 mg/metformin 1000 mg XR tablets to pediatric participants with T2DM, aged
           10 to 17 years.

    <measure>Number of Participants Who Successfully Swallowed Study Medication (Med) on Day 2</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 2</time_frame>
    <description>The Swallowing Ability Questionnaire was completed on Day 2 after the participant received two matching placebo tablets (excluding marking) following consumption of a low- to moderate-fat meal in pediatric participants aged 10 to 17 years. The questionnaire consisted of five parts: could only swallow study med with help, easy to start swallowing study med, easy to swallow study med, felt like study med got stuck in throat, and had to swallow study med more than once. The number of participants who strongly agreed or agreed in each of the five parts is reported.</description>

    <description>In this study, metformin products were withheld 24 hours (hrs) prior to sitagliptin/metformin XR administration and were permitted to re-initiate 24 hrs post study drug administration. Owing to resumption of therapeutic metformin administration 24 hrs after sitagliptin/metformin XR administration for all participants, metformin pharmacokinetic analyses were restricted to maximum plasma concentration (Cmax), time to maximum plasma concentration (Tmax) and area under the curve 0 to 24 hrs (AUC0-24hr).

        <description>The Swallowing Ability Questionnaire was completed on Day 2 after the participant received two matching placebo tablets (excluding marking) following consumption of a low- to moderate-fat meal in pediatric participants aged 10 to 17 years. The questionnaire consisted of five parts: could only swallow study med with help, easy to start swallowing study med, easy to swallow study med, felt like study med got stuck in throat, and had to swallow study med more than once. The number of participants who strongly agreed or agreed in each of the five parts is reported.</description>

        <population>Per protocol population defined as all participants who completed at least one period of treatment and had available data. On Day 2, all participants received matching placebo, so the two treatment groups were pooled on Day 2.</population>

          <description>The Swallowing Ability Questionnaire was completed on Day 6 after the participant received two matching placebo tablets (excluding marking) following consumption of a low- to moderate-fat meal in pediatric participants aged 10 to 17 years. The questionnaire consisted of five parts: could only swallow study med with help, easy to start swallowing study med, easy to swallow study med, felt like study med got stuck in throat, and had to swallow study med more than once. The number of participants who strongly agreed or agreed in each of the five parts is reported.</description>

        <description>In this study, metformin products were withheld 24 hours (hrs) prior to sitagliptin/metformin XR administration and were permitted to re-initiate 24 hrs post study drug administration. Owing to resumption of therapeutic metformin administration 24 hrs after sitagliptin/metformin XR administration for all participants, metformin pharmacokinetic analyses were restricted to maximum plasma concentration (Cmax), time to maximum plasma concentration (Tmax) and area under the curve 0 to 24 hrs (AUC0-24hr).
