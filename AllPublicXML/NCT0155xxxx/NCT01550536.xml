  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this study is to expand research on the effects of physical activity
      on basal metabolic rate (BMR) in healthy postmenopausal women, and to further compare the
      effects of long-term habitual exercise to the results of a shorter-term (16 weeks) training
      program. The investigators will measure BMR by indirect calorimetry and normalize it across
      subjects for body size (fat free mass) and level of aerobic fitness (VO2MAX). Two groups will
      be compared: an intervention group (no previous participation in regular exercise, newly
      enrolled in this study's 16 week training program), and a long-term athlete group (have
      engaged in at least 5 hours of exercise per week for the past 10 years or longer). A
      secondary aim is to generate an equation for the prediction of BMR from fat free mass in
      physically active postmenopausal women, to be applied to hypotheses in biological
      anthropology. The investigators expect to find at baseline that, controlling for fat free
      mass and VO2MAX, the long-term group will have significantly higher BMR than the intervention
      group. At 16 weeks the investigators expect no change in BMR for the long-term group, while
      BMR will have increased in the intervention group. At the same time, the investigators expect
      to find that after completing the training regimen, the intervention group will have BMR
      similar to that of the long-term athletes.

    <description>Following baseline measurements, sedentary women were enrolled in a 16-week exercise training program at the YMCA in La Jolla, CA. Exercise occurred 3 times per week, for 1.5 hours each time. Exercise consisted of stretching, 20 minutes of aerobic exercise on elliptical machines, and 3 sets of 10-12 repetitions to failure for each of ten weight lifting exercises: abdominal crunch, arm curl, arm extension, chest press, lat pull-down, leg curl, leg extension, leg press, seated row, and trunk extension. Women started at 65-75% of 1-repetition-maximum, and resistance was increased as necessary to maintain the number of sets and reps and to continue to work to failure. Exercise was monitored by a TechnoGym electronic key system, and trainers instructed and supervised subjects in the gym.</description>
