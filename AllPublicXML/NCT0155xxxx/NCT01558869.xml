      This is an open-label, single centre, single-arm phase II study which aims to assess the
      efficacy and tolerability of triplet combination of capecitabine, oxaliplatin and irinotecan
      (Xeloxiri regimen) in treating patients with advanced unresectable pancreatic carcinoma.
      Clinical data from patients diagnosed with pancreatic adenocarcinoma will be collected and
      analyzed in this study. The patients' data will be collected and maintained in the Division
      of Medical Oncology of the University Department of Medicine, Queen Mary Hospital, Hong Kong.
