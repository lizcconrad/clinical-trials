  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The majority of the acute coronary events are caused by coronary artery segments with minimal
      luminal disease, but with potentially significant vascular wall inflammation and oxidative
      stress leading to plaque vulnerability. It has become apparent that an initial injury at the
      endothelial surface, is the primary site of the mechanisms involved and a role for vascular
      inflammation and the interaction with oxidative stress continues to emerge.
      Lipoprotein-associated phospholipase A2 (Lp-PLA2) is a novel biomarker for vascular wall
      inflammation that circulates in the blood bound to both low density (LDL) and high density
      (HDL) lipoprotein and promotes vascular inflammation. Circulating levels of Lp-PLA2 mass and
      activity are an independent risk factor for cardiovascular events. Recent studies,
      demonstrating that Lp-PLA2 is also associated with coronary endothelial dysfunction. However,
      the relationship between Lp-PLA2 and early atherosclerotic changes in the coronary arteries,
      and the contribution of lipoprotein binding to the deleterious potential of Lp- PLA2 have not
      been elucidated. Our working hypothesis is that the endogenous local activation of the
      Lp-PLA2 pathway plays an integral role in early coronary atherosclerosis and contributes to
      the mechanism of coronary endothelial dysfunction and the structural and mechanical
      properties reflecting plaque vulnerability. Thus, the current application will characterize
      prospectively the correlation between the functional, mechanical, and structural vascular
      wall properties, and the systemic as well as the coronary activity of the Lp-PLA2 pathway.

      Aim I: Hypothesis: The extent of endothelial dysfunction will correlate with production of
      Lp-PLA2 and oxidative stress and correlates with the tissue characteristics of plaque
      vulnerability. The investigators will define the systemic and coronary gradient and
      production of markers of inflammation and oxidative stress and the presence of coronary
      endothelial dysfunction in patients with early coronary atherosclerosis.

      Aim II: Hypothesis: The distribution of Lp-PLA2 on the LDL is associated with greater
      coronary endothelial dysfunction and correlates with the degree coronary atherosclerosis and
      plaque vulnerability. The investigators will define the distribution of Lp-PLA2 in patients
      with early coronary atherosclerosis and endothelial dysfunction.

    <description>AIM 1: To assess the relationship between the 3 inflammatory measures of the Lp-PLA2 pathway (Lp-PLA2 mass, Lp-PLA2 activity and LysoPC) with endothelial function (as measured by the percent change in CAD (coronary artery disease) [Ach] and by the length of segments with endothelial dysfunction and plaque vulnerability (as measured by the necrotic core percent volume). AIM II: To assess the association between the percent of Lp-PLA2 residing on LDL and endothelial function (again measured by percent change in CAD [Ach], percent change in CBF (coronary blood flow)[Ach], and the length of endothelial dysfunction).</description>
