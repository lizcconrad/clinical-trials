  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      PBL 1427 is a Dipeptidyl peptidase (DPP)-IV inhibitor being developed for treatment of type 2
      diabetes. Although a number of DPP-IV inhibitors have been described, there still exists a
      need for new DPP-IV inhibitors that have better half-life, advantageous potency, stability
      and selectivity, less toxicity and/or better pharmacodynamic properties.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      As per the randomization schedule, capsule(s) of A or B will be administered to each subject
      with 240 mL of water at ambient temperature. Subjects will be instructed not to chew or crush
      the capsule(s) but to consume it as a whole. Compliance for dosing will be assessed by a
      thorough check of the oral cavity immediately after dosing. Administration of investigational
      products will be carried out while the subjects are in sitting posture and they will be
      instructed to remain seated for two hours after dosing except when clinically indicated to
      change the posture or in case of any natural exigency. Thereafter, the subjects will be
      allowed to engage in normal activities while avoiding severe physical exertion.

      The following treatments in the below cohorts will be followed as given below:

      Cohort 1: A single oral dose of 20 mg of PBL 1427 (n=6) or placebo (n=2) Cohort 2: A single
      oral dose of 40 mg (20 mg X 2 capsules) of PBL 1427 (n=6) or placebo (n=2) Cohort 3: A single
      oral dose of 80 mg (20 mg X 4 capsules) of PBL 1427 (n=6) or placebo (n=2) Cohort 4: A single
      oral dose of 150 mg of PBL 1427 (n=6) or placebo (n=2) Cohort 5: A single oral dose of 300 mg
      (150 mg X 2 capsules) of PBL 1427 (n=6) or placebo (n=2) Cohort 6: A single oral dose of 600
      mg (150 mg X 4 capsules) of PBL 1427 (n=6) or placebo (n=2)

      Dose levels may be modified and intermediate dose levels might be tested to determine the
      maximum tolerated dose (MTD)

      The number of cohorts, dose levels, frequency and conditions of administration for the
      subsequent cohort may be altered by the Principal investigator and Sponsor after evaluation
      of the results of the previous group.
