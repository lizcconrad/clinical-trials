      Study the quality of the relationship in couples affected by Urge Urinary Incontinence (UUI)
      and identify how treatment may improve the relationship.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The importance of this study is to characterize, using validated, quantifiable methods the
      quality of the relationship in couples affected by UUI and to identify the role that
      treatment plays in improving this relationship. Our central hypothesis is that UUI has a
      negative impact upon the emotional and physical well-being of a relationship and that
      effective treatment will result in improvement in areas of the relationship that have been
      detrimentally affected by UUI. Understanding of UUI in the context of a couple, particularly
      from the perspective of the male partner, will improve our ability to holistically treat UUI,
      thus improving patient outcomes and satisfaction.
