      This study is an open label, multicenter study with a dose escalation of Asparec®
      administered once every two to four weeks for two administrations. The primary objective of
      this study is to determine the Maximum Tolerated Dose following one single dose of Asparec
      when administered in a population of patients with relapsed or refractory hematological
      malignancies, as measured by Dose Limiting toxicities. There are secondary objectives which
      are to evaluate the safety of Asparec and to determine the PK profile as assessed by
      measurement of plasma L-asparaginase enzymatic activity following single and repeated doses
      of Asparec. Patients response rate will be evaluated and Anti-Asparec antibodies will be
      measured.

      Planned sample size: Up to 36 evaluable subjects will be enrolled in the study: a maximum of
      30 subjects for the dose escalation phase and up to a maximum of 12 patients in the expansion
      phase.

      Inclusion criteria consists of:

      Patients with any relapsed or refractory hematological malignancy, for which standard
      curative or life prolonging treatment does not exist, or is no longer effective or tolerable.

      For the following hematological malignancies, patients must have received at least: Low rade
      NHL: 3 prior lines of therapy, ALL, aggressive NHL and other hematological malignancies: 2
      prior lines of therapy, Aged 18 to 50 years and ECOG performance status of 1, 1 or 2.

      All patients will be treated with Asparec once every two to four weeks for two IV
      administrations infused in 60 minutes. Patients without Disease Progression may receive
      additional administrations, each administration starting at least 14 days but no later than
      28 days after the previous Asparec administration.
