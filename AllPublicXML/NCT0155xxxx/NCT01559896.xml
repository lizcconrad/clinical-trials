  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The incidence of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is rapidly growing. Patients with T2DM are
      at increased risk of developing long term micro- and macrovascular complications. Subjects
      with impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) show increased blood glucose levels after an oral
      glucose load. These subjects have a markedly increased risk of later T2DM development.

      T2DM development can be prevented or delayed by lifestyle modifications. To support lifestyle
      changes and reduce the risk of T2DM development, foods containing functional ingredients are
      being developed. An interesting functional ingredient is protein hydrolysate. An egg protein
      hydrolysate has been experimentally shown to improve endothelial function, to inhibit plasma
      angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) and to reduce blood pressure in rats. Egg protein
      hydrolysate could thus be a interesting ingredient to treat the cardiovascular dysfunction
      associated with T2DM. In the present study, the effects of egg protein hydrolysate will be
      evaluated in subjects with overweight or moderate obesity and IGT or T2DM.
