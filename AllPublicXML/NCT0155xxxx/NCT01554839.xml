      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of a unique web based educational
      tool called &quot;Family of Heroes,&quot; which is designed to educate families about Post Traumatic
      Stress Disorder (PTSD) and provide them with practical tools for interacting with affected
      veteran family members. The study includes veterans and a family member of their choosing.
      Participants are randomly assigned to a group which takes the online training or a group that
      does not take the training. Both groups complete a baseline questionnaire and a follow up
      questionaire 60 days later. The study will examine the number of Veteran Affairs (VA) mental
      health visits.
