      The study hypothesize that parameters of new function machine---'forced oscillation
      technique' (FOT) can correlate well with the conventional lung function data for measurement
      of airway resistance and airtrapping in elderly COPD patients.

      INTRODUCTION:

      Forced oscillation technique (FOT) may be a good supplementary tool to assess lung function
      in elderly since it is a simple and fast tool requiring minimal patients' cooperation.

      AIMS:

      To investigate the accuracy of forced oscillation test FOT in assessment of airway resistance
      and airtrapping in elderly COPD patients by comparing FOT parameters to various conventional
      lung function parameters including FEV1, FEF 25-75, RV/TLC ratio, IC etc. The best FOT
      parameter for airway resistance and airtrapping is also determined.

      STUDY DESIGN:

      A cross-sectional study conducted in Kwong Wah Hospital, Hong Kong, SAR

      METHODS:

      COPD patients were recruited from 1st Jan, 2010 to 31st Dec 2011. Both of the lung function
      tests (forced oscillation technique (FOT) and conventional lung function test) were
      performed. Parameters of FOT (FRes FDep, RAvr, XAvr, were compared with conventional lung
      function test for assessment of both airway resistance and airtrapping in COPD subjects.
      Adjusted FOT parameters (FResRatio and FDep) were also compared with %FEV1 and different GOLD
      stages.

      Statistics:

      Comparison between FOT parameters and spirometric parameters was done by correlation test and
      expressed as Spearman coefficient. ANOVA test is used to compare FOT parameters among
      different groups of GOLD stages (stage 1 to 4) and groups with various degree of airtrapping
      (stage 1 to 3). Post hoc analysis was estimated by Bonferroni test.
