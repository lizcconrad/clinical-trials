    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to elucidate the value of dual-time-point PET/CT in the
      recurrence of breast cancer and to determine whether the method is better than the modalities
      used in the standard work up.

      150 patients with suspected breast cancer recurrence will be included. All patients will
      undergo dual-time-point PET/CT, CT of thorax and upper abdomen and bone scintigraphy. After
      completion of the examinations the early and the late PET/CT scan will be compared with each
      other, the diagnostic CT-scan and the bone scintigraphy. A verification of suspicious
      findings will be done by biopsy, if the area is accessible. If a biopsy cannot be obtained,
      the presence of recurrence will be verified with additional imaging follow-up to ensure the
      highest possible confidence. Sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, negative and positive
      predictive value (NPV/PPV) will be calculated for each modality (incl. early and late
      PET/CT).
