          -  Documented history of trunk and/or limb pain of at least 180 days

          -  Average back pain intensity of 5 or greater on a 0-10 numerical rating scale during
             the 7-day period prior to the Screening Visit

          -  Pass study site's routine psychological/psychiatric evaluation within 180 days of the
             Trial Lead Insertion Visit

          -  If taking any medications for chronic pain, must be on a stable prescription during
             the 14-day period prior to the Trial Lead Insertion Visit and agree to continue on the
             same prescription throughout study participation

          -  Subject requires Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) while implanted with lead(s).

          -  Subject is participating (or intends to participate) in another investigational drug
             or device clinical trial that may influence the data that will be collected for this
             study

          -  Subject has previously undergone a spinal cord stimulation trial or is already
             implanted with an active implantable device(s) to treat their pain (IPGs, implantable
             drug pump, etc) or pacemaker or implantable cardiac defibrillator
