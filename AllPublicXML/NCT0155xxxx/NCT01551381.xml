    <textblock>
      The principal objective of this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of repeated
      doses of EV-077-3201-2TBS given to diabetic subjects over a 4 week treatment period. The
      secondary aim of this initial Phase IIa study is to evaluate the effect of multiple oral
      doses of EV-077-3201-2TBS on platelet function, vascular function, vascular inflammation,
      vascular oxidative stress, renal function and a selection of exploratory parameters and
      biomarkers in type 2 diabetic subjects, as well as multiple dose pharmacokinetics in diabetic
      subjects.

      In order to ensure the safety of the diabetic subjects, initial parts of the study will
      evaluate the safety and tolerability of EV-077-3201-2TBS. In Part A, the safety of different
      doses EV-077-3201-2TBS will be investigated in healthy subjects treated for 4 weeks. In
      parallel, Part B will investigate potential interactions between EV-077-3201-2TBS and ASA in
      healthy subjects. Part C will then investigate the safety, pharmacokinetics and
      pharmacodynamics of EV-077-3201-2TBS in type 2 diabetic subjects with and without concomitant
      ASA therapy.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Male or female subjects aged 18 to 70 years inclusive. (NB. All females must be of
             non-reproductive potential, i.e. post-menopausal, post-hysterectomy, bilateral tubal
             ligation or bilateral oophorectomy).

          -  Body mass index (BMI) between 25.0 and 40.0 kg/m2 (both inclusive).

          -  Subjects with type 2 diabetes mellitus according to American Diabetes Association
             (ADA) definition for a duration of at least 3 years, on a stable therapy with oral
             anti-diabetic drugs (OAD) or with insulin, with or without one or two OADs or a
             glucagon like peptide-1 (GLP-1) agonist, or glitazones. Stable baseline therapy is
             defined as unchanged dose regimen for at least 3 months before administration of the
             study drug.

          -  HbA1c ≥ 6.0 and ≤ 9.0 %.

          -  History of hyperlipidaemia, with either elevated LDL cholesterol (&gt;140 mg/dL) without
             therapy, or treatment with statins (NB. Patients on statin therapy must have a 2 week
             wash-out before they can enter the study).

          -  History of hypertension, either with systolic blood pressure levels between 140 to 160
             mmHg without treatment, or treatment with ACE inhibitors or ARB, which should be
             stable over the previous 3 months.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Abnormal and clinically significant ECG at screening.

          -  Donation of any blood or plasma in the past month or in excess of 500 mL within the 12
             weeks preceding screening.

          -  Intake of paracetamol within 7 days before start of treatment.

          -  Clinically significant abnormal laboratory test results during the screening as judged
             by the Investigator (one retest within a week is permitted, the last result being
             conclusive).

          -  Increased risk of bleeding, e.g. subjects with a history of deep cerebral bleeding or
             known defects of haemostasis with increased risk of bleeding, as judged by the
             Investigator.

          -  History of or presence of clinically significant diseases such as cancer, clinically
             significant cardiovascular, respiratory, metabolic, renal, hepatic, gastrointestinal,
             endocrinological, haematological, dermatological, venereal, neurological, psychiatric
             diseases, other major disorders as judged by the Investigator, or significant
             secondary diabetic complications, such as but not limited to clinically relevant
             peripheral neuropathy, retinopathy, diabetic foot ulcers, as judged by the
             Investigator.

          -  Supine blood pressure at screening, after resting for 5 min, of &gt; 160 mmHg systolic or
             &gt; 95 mmHg diastolic (excluding white-coat hypertension; therefore, if a repeat
             measurement on a second screening visit shows values within the range, the subject can
             be included in the trial).

          -  Type 1 diabetes mellitus.

          -  Intake of anti-inflammatory drugs except ASA (dose 75-125mg/day stable for the
             previous 3 months) within 14 days before start of treatment. Steroid therapy other
             than topical application is not allowed.

          -  Any treatment with diuretics (hydrochlorothiazide is allowed)

          -  Liver enzymes (ALT and AST) more than 1.5 times the upper limit of normal.

          -  Any contraindication for a therapy with ASA such as allergy to ASA, including asthma,
             acute gastric ulcers, haemorrhagic diathesis, renal or liver insufficiency, or heart
             failure.
