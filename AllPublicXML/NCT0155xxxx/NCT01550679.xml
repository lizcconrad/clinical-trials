  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Even though the main risk factor for the development of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
      (COPD) is smoking only in less than one third of the smokers the clinically manifest COPD
      will develop. The disease progressive nature with high disability and mortality especially in
      the final stages makes it plausible to detect the disease as early as possible thus allowing
      for the early intervention. Major intervention trials in COPD, &quot;Towards a Revolution in COPD
      Health&quot; (TORCH), &quot;Investigating New Standards for Prophylaxis in Reducing Exacerbations&quot;
      (INSPIRE), and &quot;Understanding Potential Long-term Impacts on Function with Tiotropium&quot;
      (UPLIFT) have recently shown that the beneficial impact of intervention was larger in
      patients being treated in earlier stages of the disease development. Till now the only tool
      for an early diagnosis and early intervention that could be used on the global scale was
      spirometry even though symptoms and deprivation of quality of life (QoL) precedes clinically
      relevant spirometric changes. So there is a need for a new simple tool that would allow
      detection of patients in a very early stage of COPD.

      So the aim of this study is the development of diagnostic tools for an early detection of
      COPD, even before the significant change in spirometry.

    <description>MARKO questionnaire will be tested for inner consistency, repeatability, intelligibility, applicability after the patient is diagnosed as having COPD and staged for severity of COPD by pulmologist. Patients will be tested twice using the same MARKO QoL questionnaire: first time at the recruitment at the primary health clinic and the second time at pulmologist office. It will be tested for it's potential to differentiate between patients with different stages of COPD.</description>

    <description>The percentage of patients progressing from GOLD 0 stage to GOLD I stage or higher will be assessed based on two evaluation by pulmologist: the first one 4 weeks after recruitment when diagnosis and staging of COPD will be made and the second one after 2 (3,5) years of follow up of patient in stages GOLD 0 and I. Patients will be characterized as GOLD 0 on the first visit if they are eligible for the study and have the lung function within the normal range or as GOLD I if they have FEV1/FVC &lt;0.7 and FEV1 &gt;80% of normal.</description>

Patients will be characterized as GOLD 0 if they have the lung function within the normal range or as GOLD I if they have FEV1/FVC &lt;0.7 and FEV1 &gt;80% of normal.</description>
