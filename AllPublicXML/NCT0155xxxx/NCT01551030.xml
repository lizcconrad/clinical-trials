  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to learn what effects, good and/or bad, Buparlisib has on
      advanced urothelial cancer. Buparlisib is a pill that works by shutting down some of the
      signals in cancer cells that make tumors grow. It is being tested in patients in research
      studies such as this one. As of 2010, more than 80 patients with various types of cancer have
      received treatment with Buparlisib in research studies.

      This clinical research study is divided into two parts. The goal of the first part of this
      study is to learn if the study drug Buparlisib can shrink or slow the growth of cancer in
      patients with urothelial tumors. The goal of the second part of this study is to learn if the
      study drug Buparlisib can shrink or slow the growth of urothelial tumors in patients known to
      have certain genetic alterations that cause these types of tumors. The study doctor will
      inform the patient which part of the study is currently enrolling participants. Participants
      in both parts of the study will receive the same treatment and tests.

      The safety of this drug will also be studied in both parts. The physical state, changes in
      the size of the tumor, and laboratory findings taken while on-study will help us decide if
      Buparlisib is safe and effective.

    <description>Patient samples will be sequenced for mutations in PTEN and PIK3CA as well as for reduced or absent PTEN expression. Patients will be categorized on the basis of PTEN expression levels into three categories: no expression, low expression, or high expression. PTEN levels and PTEN and PIK3CA mutation status (present/absent) will be correlated with PFS using a log rank test, and with response to treatment (complete response/partial response versus no response) using Fisher's exact test.</description>

    <description>Buparlisib will be administered at a dose of 100 mg orally once daily (two 50 mg capsules) continuously. Intra-patient dose reduction may be required depending on the type and severity of the individual toxicity encountered. Re-staging imaging studies will be performed after every two cycles of treatment (one cycle = 4 weeks). Patients may continue on study as long as they are tolerating therapy and are free of disease progression.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Age ≥ 18 years

          -  Karnofsky Performance Status (KPS) ≥60%

          -  Urothelial carcinoma of the bladder, urethra, ureter or renal pelvis, with histologic
             confirmation at MSKCC. Patients with unresected primary tumors may be enrolled as long
             as evidence of metastatic disease is also present.

          -  Patients must have progressive metastatic disease. Progressive disease will be defined
             as new or progressive lesions on cross-sectional imaging (RECIST Version 1.1).

          -  Patients must have been previously treated, as defined by the following:

               -  Patients must have received treatment with at least one prior cytotoxic
                  chemotherapy agent but not more than four prior cytotoxic chemotherapy agents for
                  urothelial carcinoma. Up to four prior chemotherapy agents are allowed, since
                  conventional chemotherapy ranges from just one drug (e.g., gemcitabine) to
                  regimens that contain four agents (e.g., M-VAC is a four-drug regimen containing
                  methotrexate, vinblastine, doxorubicin, and cisplatin).

        The prior therapy must have consisted of at least one of the following: cisplatin,
        carboplatin, paclitaxel, docetaxel, or gemcitabine.

        o The prior cytotoxic agents may have been administered in the perioperative or metastatic
        setting and may have been administered sequentially (e.g., first-line treatment followed by
        second-line treatment at time of progression) or as part of a single regimen.

          -  Patients must have at least one site of measurable disease per RECIST 1.1 criteria
             that has not been previously irradiated. If the patient has had previous radiation to
             the marker lesion(s), there must be evidence of progression since the radiation.

          -  Patients enrolling in the Phase II study must have pre-treatment tumor tissue
             available for PI3K/Akt pathway marker analysis: One paraffin block, frozen curls or 10
             freshly-prepared unstained slides from the most representative single paraffinembedded
             tumor tissue block should be submitted. Slides from the primary tumor are preferred.
             If both the primary and metastatic tumor blocks are available, 10 slides from each of
             the sites should be submitted. If tissue from the primary tumor is not available, a
             paraffin block or unstained slides from a metastatic site are acceptable. Fine needle
             aspirates (FNAs) have insufficient tumor tissue and are not permitted.

          -  Patients enrolling in the Expansion Cohort must have prior mutational testing
             demonstrating alterations within the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway predicted to result in
             pathway activation.
