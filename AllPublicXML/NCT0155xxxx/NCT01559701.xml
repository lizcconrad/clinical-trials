      This study will evaluate: (a) the long-term safety of PTI-821 during a 12-month period; and
      (b) the long-term efficacy of PTI-821 by assessing pain intensity (PI), the quality of
      analgesia, and the global assessment of study medication.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Males and females who are ≥ 18 and ≤ 75 years of age with moderate to severe pain in
             one or more hip or knee joint(s) caused by osteoarthritis for at least three months
             prior to the Baseline Visit or persistent moderate to severe low back pain for at
             least six months while regularly taking one or more of the following types of oral
             analgesic medication(s) prior to the Baseline Visit.

          -  Patient agrees to refrain from taking any opioid medications other than study drug
             during the study period. Patients must agree to report all non-opioid analgesic
             medications taken.

          -  Females who are postmenopausal, physically incapable of childbearing, or practicing an
             acceptable method of birth control. Acceptable methods of birth control include
             surgical sterilization, hormonal contraceptives, or double-barrier methods (condom or
             diaphragm with a spermicidal agent or IUD). If practicing an acceptable method of
             birth control, a negative urine pregnancy test result has been obtained at the
             Baseline Visit.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patient has a positive urine drug screen at the Baseline Visit.

          -  Patient currently is on an opioid regimen with a daily opioid dose equivalent of
             oxycodone &gt; 160 mg.

          -  Patient has major surgery planned during the proposed study period.
