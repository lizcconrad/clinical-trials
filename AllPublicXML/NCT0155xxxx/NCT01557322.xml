      1. To assess the baseline (i.e. RA therapy initiation) characteristics in a real-world
           setting across two moderate RA cohorts: a Test Group of patients newly exposed to
           etanercept (Enbrel) therapy and a Control Group of patients with similar disease
           characteristics newly exposed to other, non-biologic therapies.

        2. To assess the change over time (from baseline to the most recent follow-up) in the
           characteristics described at baseline in 2 British Society for Rheumatology Biologics
           Register (BSRBR) cohorts (i.e. moderate RA patients treated with Disease modifying
           anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) alone versus moderate RA patients treated with Enbrel).

        <title>Change From Baseline in Health Assessment Questionnaire Disability Index (HAQ-DI) Score at Month 60</title>
        <description>Health Assessment Questionnaire-Disability Index (HAQ-DI): participant-reported assessment of ability to perform tasks in 8 categories of daily living activities: dress/groom; arise; eat; walk; reach; grip; hygiene; and common activities over past week. Each item scored on 4-point scale from 0 to 3: 0 = no difficulty; 1 = some difficulty; 2 = much difficulty; 3 = unable to do. Overall score was computed as the sum of domain scores and divided by the number of domains answered. Total possible score range 0 to 3 where 0 = least difficulty and 3 = extreme difficulty.</description>

        <description>EQ-5D: participant rated questionnaire to assess health-related quality of life in terms of a single utility score. Health State Profile component assesses level of current health for 5 domains: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain and discomfort, and anxiety and depression; 1 indicates better health state (no problems); 3 indicates worst health state (confined to bed). Scoring formula developed by EuroQoL Group assigns a utility value for each domain in the profile. Score is transformed and results in a total score range -0.594 to 1.000; higher score indicates a better health state.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Health Assessment Questionnaire Disability Index (HAQ-DI) Score at Month 6</title>
        <description>Health Assessment Questionnaire-Disability Index (HAQ-DI): participant-reported assessment of ability to perform tasks in 8 categories of daily living activities: dress/groom; arise; eat; walk; reach; grip; hygiene; and common activities over past week. Each item scored on 4-point scale from 0 to 3: 0 = no difficulty; 1 = some difficulty; 2 = much difficulty; 3 = unable to do. Overall score was computed as the sum of domain scores and divided by the number of domains answered. Total possible score range 0 to 3 where 0 = least difficulty and 3 = extreme difficulty.</description>

        <description>EQ-5D: participant rated questionnaire to assess health-related quality of life in terms of a single utility score. Health State Profile component assesses level of current health for 5 domains: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain and discomfort, and anxiety and depression; 1 indicates better health state (no problems); 3 indicates worst health state (confined to bed). Scoring formula developed by EuroQoL Group assigns a utility value for each domain in the profile. Score is transformed and results in a total score range -0.594 to 1.000; higher score indicates a better health state.</description>
