  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Abdominal pain resulting from chronic pancreatitis (CP) is often recurrent, intense and
      long-lasting, and is extremely difficult to treat. Medical analgesic therapy is considered as
      first choice in pain management of CP, resulting in regularly prescription of opioids. The
      adverse consequences of prolonged opioid use, including addiction, tolerance and opioid
      induced hyperalgesia, call for an alternative medical treatment. Cannabis has been used to
      treat pain for many centuries. Delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (Δ9-THC), the psychoactive
      substance of the cannabis plant, has been shown in previous studies to be a promising
      analgesic. The development of Namisol®, a tablet containing purified Δ9-THC showing an
      improved pharmacokinetic profile, provides the opportunity to test the analgesic potential of
      Δ9-THC in favourable conditions. The current study aims to investigate the analgesic efficacy
      of Namisol® as add-on analgesic during a long-term treatment (52 days) of abdominal pain
      resulting from CP.
