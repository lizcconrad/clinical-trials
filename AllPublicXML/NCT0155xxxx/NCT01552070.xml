  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the change of extravascular lung water (EVLW),
      cytokine and oxygenation parameters in patients with acute lung injury (ALI) or acute
      respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) after alveolar recruitment maneuver.

      This investigation is a prospective randomized control study. Informed consents will be
      obtained from all patients or their surrogates prior to the procedure of alveolar recruitment
      maneuver and PiCCO monitoring system.

      Patients and methods:

      From September 2010 to September 2012, consecutive patients with ALI/ARDS undergo alveolar
      recruitment maneuver will be enrolled at Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, a
      university-affiliated hospital in Taiwan. EVLW will be measured by PiCCO monitoring system,
      alveolar recruitment maneuver will be setting by protocol under supervision of chest
      physicians and respiratory therapists. Serum cytokine such as endothelin-1, TNF-, IL-6,
      Tie-1, Tie-2, angiopoietin-1, angiopoietin-2,VEGF and thrombomodulin will be measured.

    <description>The Extrvascular lung water (EVLW) measurement will be based on transpulmonary thermodilution method. This method was recently introduced as part of the PiCCO plus system (Pulsion Medical System, Munich, Germany). EVLW were recorded and compared between patients with and without recruitment manevuer.</description>
