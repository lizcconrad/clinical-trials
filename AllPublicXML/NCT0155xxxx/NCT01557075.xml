      The purpose of this study is to determine whether high dose statin therapy in patients with
      aspirin mono antiplatelet therapy who had received drug-eluting stent (DES) previously and
      were free of the adverse cardiac events during the first 12 months could be superior over
      pravastatin therapy in the prevention of late adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events
      during the additional 12 months.

      Objective: To determine whether high dose statin therapy in patients with aspirin mono
      antiplatelet therapy who had received drug-eluting stent (DES) previously and were free of
      the adverse cardiac events during the first 12 months could be superior over pravastatin
      therapy in the prevention of late adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events during the
      additional 12 months.

      Study Design

        -  Prospective, randomized, multi-center study of each 1000 subjects enrolled.

        -  Eligible subjects will be randomized 1:1 to a) atorvastatin 40 mg (n=1000) vs. b)
           pravastatin 20 mg/day (n=1000). All subjects will be followed for 1 year after
           randomization. Additional long-term follow-up (2- or 3-year) will be preceded in the
           next plan after 1-year study period.

        -  Subjects with coronary artery diseases who meet all inclusion and exclusion criteria
           will be included Clinical and laboratory follow-up should be performed.
