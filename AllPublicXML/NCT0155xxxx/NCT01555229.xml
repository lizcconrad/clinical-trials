  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Endotracheal tubes with subglottic secretion drainage (incorporating a suction port above the
      cuff) have been shown to reduce the incidence of ventilator-associated pneumonia. Subglottic
      secretion drainage can be either continuous or intermittent. However, concerns about the
      safety of continuous subglottic secretion drainage were raised in an experimental study in
      sheep, which found widespread injuries to tracheal mucosa and/or submucosa. Our objective is
      therefore to compare intermittent versus continuous subglottic secretion drainage on tracheal
      mucosa damages in patients requiring mechanical ventilation for an expected duration of more
      than 24 hours.

      secretion drainage can be either continuous or intermittent. However, concerns about the

      therefore to compare intermittent versus continuous subglottic secretion drainage on tracheal
      mucosa damages in patients requiring mechanical ventilation for an expected duration of more
      than 24 hours. Tracheal mucosa injuries will be assessed by tracheal fibroscopy. Secondary
      endpoints are the volume of daily secretions suctioned, the occurrence of difficulties or
      impossibilities of secretion drainage, and the occurrence of ventilator-associated pneumonia.
