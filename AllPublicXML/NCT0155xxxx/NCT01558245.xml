    <textblock>
      The study aims to determine whether tissue kallikrein (TK) is efficacy for preventing the
      long-term in-stent restenosis (ISR) after stenting of symptomatic atherosclerotic stenosis of
      the middle cerebral artery (MCA) M1 segment

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A series of studies have confirmed the kallikrein-kinin system (KKS), including kallikrein,
      kininogen and kinin, plays an important role in the regulation of inflammation secondary to
      acute and chronic ischemic brain injury. Some researchers found that hTK gene delivery can
      inhibit the formation of neointimal induced by the common carotid artery ligation in mice.
      Further study revealed hTK gene transfection in VSMC lead to increased secretion of TK and
      inhibition of VSMC proliferation. In addition, it was also observed that the serum TK levels
      were coincident with the carotid artery stenosis. The more severe the stenosis is, the higher
      the serum TK level is, and the serum TK decreased after carotid artery angioplasty and stent
      placement. These results suggest that KKS play an important regulatory role in vascular
      remodeling and TK may exert a beneficial influence in the process of ISR

    <description>Patients in this group will be prescribed with intravenous infusion of TK (0.15 PNAU/d, dissolved in 100ml saline) for 7 days after stenting and then oral administration of pancreatic kallikrein enteric-coated tablet (240U, 3/d) to the end of study. As the foundation treatment, all the enrolled patients will receive aspirin (100 mg/d), clopidogrel (75 mg/d), and atorvastatin (20 mg/d) for the first 6 months and continue with the combination of aspirin and atorvastatin at the previous dosage.</description>
