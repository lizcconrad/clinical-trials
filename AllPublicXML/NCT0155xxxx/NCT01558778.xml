    <textblock>
      This pilot clinical trial studies mechanical stimulation in preventing bone density loss in
      patients undergoing donor stem cell transplant. Mechanical stimulation may limit, prevent, or
      reverse bone loss, increase muscle and cardiac performance, and improve overall health

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the feasibility of a mechanical stimulation regimen in hematopoietic cell
      transplant (HCT) patients.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the data collection tools to prepare for a larger phase II trial.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients undergo mechanical stimulation over 20 minutes once daily (QD) beginning on date of
      hospital admission and continuing through day 100 post-HCT, except for day 0 (date of
      transplant).
