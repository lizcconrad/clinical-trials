      This is a randomized, double blinded, placebo-controlled trial on the routine use of
      preoperative antibiotic prophylaxis in modified radical mastectomy to evaluate the efficacy
      of preoperative prophylactic antibiotics in the prevention of surgical site infection (SSI)
      in patients undergoing modified radical mastectomy (MRM) for breast care.

      A randomized, double blinded, placebo-controlled trial on the routine use of preoperative
      antibiotic prophylaxis in modified radical mastectomy to evaluate the efficacy of
      preoperative prophylactic antibiotics in the prevention of surgical site infection (SSI) in
      patients undergoing modified radical mastectomy (MRM) for breast care.

      Women with breast cancer who will undergo elective MRM were recruited for the study. Excluded
      were patients with significant co-morbid factors, for simultaneous breast reconstruction or
      bilateral oophorectomy, with intake of antibiotics within one week, with known allergy to
      cephalosporins, and those with local infection. Patients were randomized to receive either
      transvenous cefazolin 1 gram or sterile water only within 30 minutes prior to skin incision.
      Standard skin preparation and operative technique for MRM were carried out. Wounds were
      assessed for the presence of SSI and other complications weekly for 30 days.
