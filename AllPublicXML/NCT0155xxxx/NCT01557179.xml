  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This multicenter, randomized, controlled, open-label, parallel-group, 30-day study took place
      at four centers in China. The primary objective of this study was to assess the efficacy and
      safety of hyaluronic acid vaginal gel in treating vaginal dryness. In the current study we
      tested the hypothesis that the efficacy of hyaluronic acid vaginal gel was not inferior to
      that of estriol cream, with no clinically significant difference between them, in the
      treatment of vaginal dryness symptoms.
