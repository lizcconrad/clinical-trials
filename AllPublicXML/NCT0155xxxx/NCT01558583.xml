  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Participants will be recruited from the United States and Australia to take an online survey
      about colon cancer screening or prostate cancer screening. Individuals selected for both the
      prostate cancer survey and the colon cancer study will be randomized to take one of three
      survey types - balance sheet, rating and ranking or conjoint analysis. These surveys will
      help participants clarify their values and opinions about screening options for colon cancer
      or prostate cancer. Participants' responses to the online survey are measured at one point in
      time - the time at which the participant takes the survey.

      This study will compare effect of a conjoint analysis based values clarification exercise,
      ranking and rating, and a balance sheet on screening test preferences for colorectal cancer
      screening and prostate cancer screening using online surveys. Recruitment will be conducted
      through Survey Sampling International (SSI), an online survey research firm. Participants
      will be randomized to one of three arms to take online surveys. Patients will complete either
      a conjoint analysis task, in which they will be asked to make a series of choices between
      hypothetical screening testing strategies with different attributes; a rating and ranking
      task for these same attributes; or they will make a choice after viewing a balance sheet of
      attributes.

    <description>The single most important colon cancer or prostate cancer screening attribute indicated by the participant surveys. Each participant will be randomly assigned to take one of three survey versions: either (1) a conjoint analysis task wherein they will be asked to make a series of choices between hypothetical screening testing strategies with different attributes; (2) a rating and ranking task for these same attributes; or (3) they will make a choice after viewing a balance sheet of attributes.</description>
