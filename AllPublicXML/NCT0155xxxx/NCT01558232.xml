    <textblock>
      The objective of this clinical study is to examine acute changes in stability, force
      allocation, work, and mobility from using a wearable, portable, battery-operated robotic
      orthosis (the Tibion Bionic Leg) in subacute post-stroke persons undergoing lower extremity
      physical therapy.

    <description>The Tibion Bionic Leg is used as an adjunct in post-stroke and post-operative rehabilitative physical therapy. The leg is a lightweight, wearable, portable, battery-powered, motorized leg orthosis that provides active assistance and resistance to lower limb movement during walking, stair ascent and descent, and transfers from sitting to standing (and standing to sitting).</description>
