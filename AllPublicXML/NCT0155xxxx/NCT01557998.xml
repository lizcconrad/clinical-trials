  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Interventions for injecting drug users (IDUs) in sub-Saharan African have been almost
      entirely absent, despite the fact that in countries like Kenya they contribute a growing
      proportion of incident HIV infections. This study will leverage a historic decision in Kenya
      to launch needle exchange program (NSP) and related services for this most-at-risk population
      (MARP). The investigators will use this NSP/MARP platform to seek out IDUs, deliver rapid HIV
      testing, point of care CD4 count and link to ART using peer case managers, and evaluate
      community viral load impact using a stepped wedge cluster-randomized design. Lessons learned
      will have important applicability throughout sub-Saharan African.

  <detailed_description>

      The purpose of the study will be to leverage the GoK's first-ever needle and syringe program,
      to implement the HIV seek, test, treat, and retain paradigm among IDUs, whose parenteral and
      sexual transmission networks amplify HIV epidemics. Study innovations include: (1) use of a
      stepped wedge trial design; (2) intent to track community viral load in a low-income country
      setting; (3) use of rapid CD4 assays to reduce time from HIV diagnosis to ART initiation; and
      (4) use of conditional cash transfers to support peer case management of participant HIV
      treatment retention.

      Aim 1: Evaluate seek test treat retain using a stepped wedge cluster-randomized design.
      Clusters will be the planned NSP service sites. The investigators will initiate
      respondent-driven sampling (RDS) to reach IDUs in Nairobi and coastal Mombasa (including
      Malindi) for baseline HIV-1 prevalence determination, then collect waves of study data as
      service sites roll out, including behavioral data. Teams will do rapid HIV testing and refer
      for addiction/mental health and other services (e.g., OST). HIV-positives will receive
      prevention with positives (PwP) counseling and point of care CD4 counts. Those with CD4
      &lt;500/μL will be assigned a peer case manager to link the person to ART at study-participating
      HIV clinics, support ART and PwP adherence and care retention. Both peer case managers and
      subjects will receive small conditional cash transfers for subject's adherence to HIV care
      visits. Primary study outcomes will include time to successful linkage to care, time to ART,
      and community viral load before and after TLC-IDU initiation. 'Community viral load' will be
      ascertained by collecting specimens from randomly-selected HIV-positives at each of the
      NASCOP NSP-IDU service sites. This sampling will be done in waves over time, to document
      changes in infectivity (median viral load). With individual viral loads collected per site
      per time step (for a n= of at least 1800 viral loads in total across all sites and timewaves)
      the investigators will have good power to detect log10 viral load changes of 0.23 and hazard
      ratios of ~1.5 when comparing pre- and post-intervention period using linear mixed effects
      analysis.

      Aim 1: Research hypothesis: Staggered rollout of a planned NSP/MARP program can be utilized
      to collect pre- and post intervention data that will allow assessment of impact on community
      viral load. Linkage to care will be higher, time to ART initiation will be reduced, and
      retention in care will be higher during time periods with the TLC-IDU services as compared to
      time periods with standard of care.

      Aim 2: Conduct mathematical modeling to estimate community viral load in IDU injecting and
      sexual networks, and to assess potential population-level impact of the TLC-IDU intervention
      on Ro, numbers of infections averted, and quality-adjusted life expectancy.

      Aim 2: Research hypothesis: HIV transmission dynamics models can use parameters from Aim 1
      data waves, with sensitivity analyses identifying those parameters with largest impact on
      effect estimation and stability.

      Aim 3: Assess the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of the TLC-IDU model, using a national
      payer perspective. This study will provide among the world's first data regarding
      implementation of the seek, test, treat and retain paradigm with IDUs in sub-Saharan Africa.
      It will demonstrate the degree to which a combination of structural, biomedical and
      behavioral interventions can reduce infectivity. Partnership with Kenya's national HIV
      program will allow lessons learned from this study to inform other countries considering how
      best to address the growing IDU contribution to the HIV epidemic in this high-HIV-burden
      region.

      Aim 3: Research hypothesis: Utilizing MARP/NSP services will result in a reduction in median
      community viral load and in forward HIV transmission. Cost per quality adjusted life year
      saved and HIV infection averted will be favorable as compared with the alternative of no
      specific seek, test, treat and retain program directed to IDUs.
