          -  Have a diagnosis of idiopathic or heritable PAH, PAH associated with connective tissue
             disease (CTD), PAH associated with repaired congenital systemic-to-pulmonary shunts
             (at least 1 year since repair) or human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, or PAH
             associated with appetite suppressant or toxin use.

          -  Be treatment na√Øve, or receiving background PAH therapies (e.g., phosphodiesterase
             type-5 inhibitor (PDE-5i)and / or endothelin receptor antagonist (ERA)) for less than
             1 year prior to Screening.

          -  Have a 6MWD at Baseline (as measured by the mean value of two 6MWT separated by at
             least 24 hours, but no more than 14 days) that is between 150 - 500 meters, inclusive.
