  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an investigatory study to determine whether high levels of pre-operative
      psychological distress predict worse outcomes after hip preservation. This is a low risk
      study and does not alter the treatment or course of care for patients undergoing this
      procedure

      The correlation between increasing psychological distress and worsening surgical outcomes has
      been extensively documented in patients undergoing spine surgery. However, we have no reason
      to believe that patients with hip pathology are uniquely exempt from the influence of
      psychosocial factors. To our knowledge, no study has been done to evaluate the effect of
      pre-operative psychological distress on outcomes after hip preservation surgery. We therefore
      propose to use the DRAM to measure pre-operative distress in patients undergoing open or
      arthroscopic hip preservation surgery and to compare these pre-operative distress scores with
      post-operative outcomes. We hope the information we gain will allow clinicians to
      comprehensively evaluate the patient with hip pain and to make more informed choices about
      operative treatment.

    <description>Distress and Risk Assessment Method (DRAM) questionaire to screen for psychological distress. The instrument defines four categories based on patients responses: Type N (normal; lower scores, no evidence of distress); Type R (at risk; higher scores, primarily in symptoms of depression); Type DD (distressed-depressive; higher scores on all variables, but very high on depressive symptomatology); and Type DS (distressed-somatic; higher scores on all variables, but very high on somatic awareness).</description>
