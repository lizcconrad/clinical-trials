      screening program for patients at risk in community pharmacies.

      Background: The sleep apnea syndrome (SAS) is a common disease but unknown. According to
      epidemiological studies, approximately 5% to 10% of the general population is living with
      SAS. Untreated sleep apnea has an important individual impact: it is accompanied by sleep
      disturbances and vigilance and frequent co-morbidities such as hypertension, diabetes or
      other cardiovascular diseases. Also, it has a cost to the community due to significant
      traffic accidents and work accidents more frequent in this population and weight for health
      insurance for cardiovascular diseases. However, its screening and its management remain
      largely insufficient. The report of the Ministry of Health in 2006 estimated that only 15% of
      subjects with a SAS would be diagnosed.

      The Law &quot;Hospital, Patients, Health and Territories&quot; (HPST) in 2009 provides pharmacists with
      new responsibilities in the health screening, care coordination, or in therapeutic education
      (Article 38 of Law HPST).

      Objective: In this dual context, this study aims to assess the feasibility and effectiveness
      of an information campaign and screening of SAS in patients at risk in the community
      pharmacies. The investigators analyze whether the involvement of community pharmacists in the
      care pathway of a patient at risk is effective, that is to say if it improves the detection
      rate and diagnostic the disease in this population.

      Project Description: 400 patients at risk of SAS will be recruited by the participating
      pharmacists. Screening intervention consists in 2 validated questionnaires which evaluate SAS
      risk (Berlin Questionnaire, Epworth Sleepiness Scale). Pharmacist distributes also an
      information leaflet about SAS, and refers patient to general practitioner with questionnaires
      results. Patients are followed by the pharmacists for 6 months.
