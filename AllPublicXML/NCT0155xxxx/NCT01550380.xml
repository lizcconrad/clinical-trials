      This is a phase II open label fixed dose study in subjects with advanced, metastatic, or
      refractory endometrial or ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer with PI3
      kinase pathway activation as demonstrated by PIK3CA gene mutation, PTEN gene mutation, or
      PTEN null/low protein expression.

      Given the mechanisms of action and the safety profiles and tolerability of BKM120
      (NVP-BKM120), the use of this agent may provide benefit to patients with endometrial and
      ovarian cancer. Endometrial and ovarian cancer are leading causes of cancer death in women
      and there are limited treatment options for those with metastatic or refractory disease.
      Alterations of the PI3K/PTEN/Akt pathway have been identified in many cancers, including
      endometrial and ovarian cancers. Tumors with PI3K mutations have demonstrated sensitivity to
      this compound therefore justifying use of this agent in subjects with endometrial or ovarian,
      fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer. Therefore use of this agent in cancer patients
      with PI3 kinase pathway activation offers a reasonable treatment option.

      Patients will be initially treated with single agent BKM120 for 28 days at a dose of 100mg
      per day. CT response will be adjudged post BKM120 therapy at day 28. If there is no
      significant progression on CT scan, patients will be continued on BKM120 for another two
      cycles (28 days per cycle [+/- 3 days]). Response assessments will then be done at that time
      (after the third 28 day cycle). If there is no significant progression on CT scan, then the
      patients will continue BKM120 with response assessments using standard CT criteria every two
      cycles (28 days per cycle [+/- 3 days]) thereafter.

      If disease progression is observed, patient will have completed the study. Patient will be
      seen within 30 days for end of treatment visit.

          -  Patients who have received any continuous or intermittent small molecule therapeutics
             (excluding monoclonal antibodies) ≤ 5 effective half lives prior to starting study

             coumadin-derivative anticoagulant.

          -  Women who are pregnant or breast feeding or adults of reproductive potential not
             employing an effective method of birth control. Double barrier contraceptives must be
             used through the trial by both sexes. Oral, implantable, or injectable contraceptives
             may be affected by cytochrome P450 interactions, and are therefore not considered
             effective for this study. Women of child-bearing potential, defined as sexually mature
             women who have not undergone a hysterectomy or who have not been naturally
             postmenopausal for at least 12 consecutive months (i.e., who has had menses any time
             in the preceding 12 consecutive months), must have a negative serum pregnancy test ≤
             72 hours prior to initiating treatment.

               -  Women are considered post-menopausal and not of child bearing potential if they
                  have had 12 months of natural (spontaneous) amenorrhea with an appropriate
                  clinical profile (e.g. age appropriate, history of vasomotor symptoms) or six
                  months of spontaneous amenorrhea with serum FSH levels &gt; 40 mIU/mL and estradiol
                  &lt; 20 pg/mL or have had surgical bilateral oophorectomy (with or without
                  hysterectomy) at least six weeks ago. In the case of oophorectomy alone, only
                  when the reproductive status of the woman has been confirmed by follow up hormone
                  level assessment is she considered not of child bearing potential.

               -  Women of child-bearing potential, defined as all women physiologically capable of
                  becoming pregnant, must use highly effective contraception during the treatment
                  for 5 T1/2 (8 days) after stopping treatment and for additional 12 weeks (3
                  months in total after study drug discontinuation). The highly effective
                  contraception is defined as either:

                    1. True abstinence: When this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle
                       of the subject. Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation,
                       symptothermal, post-ovulation methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable
                       methods of contraception.

                    2. Sterilization: have had surgical bilateral oophorectomy (with or without
                       hysterectomy) or tubal ligation at least six weeks ago. In case of
                       oophorectomy alone, only when the reproductive status of the woman has been
                       confirmed by follow up hormone level assessment.

                    3. Male partner sterilization (with the appropriate post-vasectomy
                       documentation of the absence of sperm in the ejaculate). For female subjects
                       on the study, the vasectomised male partner should be the sole partner for
                       that patient.

                    4. Use of a combination of any two of the following (a+b):

                         -  Placement of an intrauterine device (IUD) or intrauterine system (IUS)

                         -  Barrier methods of contraception: Condom or Occlusive cap (diaphragm or
                            cervical/vault caps) with spermicidal foam/gel/film/cream/vaginal
                            suppository

               -  Oral contraception, injected or implanted hormonal methods are not allowed as
                  BKM120 potentially decreases the effectiveness of hormonal contraceptives.

               -  Fertile males, defined as all males physiologically capable of conceiving
                  offspring must use condom during treatment, for 5 T1/2 (8 days) after stopping
                  treatment and for additional 12 weeks (3 months in total after study drug
                  discontinuation) and should not father a child in this period.

          -  Known diagnosis of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection

          -  History of another malignancy within 3 years, except cured basal cell carcinoma of the
             skin or excised carcinoma in situ of the cervix

          -  Patient is unable or unwilling to abide by the study protocol or cooperate fully with
             the investigator
