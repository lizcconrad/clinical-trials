  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study will assess the safety and efficacy of QGE031 in the treatment of moderate to
      severe atopic dermatitis patients. In addition, QGE031 levels in the blood will be measured
      and the effect of QGE031 on markers in the blood and skin will be evaluated. Comparisons of
      the effect of QGE31 will be made with placebo and also cyclosporine, a treatment already
      established as being effective in atopic dermatitis.
