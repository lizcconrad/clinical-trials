  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Variations in participation to the colorectal cancer screening seems to reveal social and
      geographical inequalities. Our study will investigate whether patient navigation could
      increase the participation to the colorectal cancer screening and in the same time, reduce
      the social inequalities.
