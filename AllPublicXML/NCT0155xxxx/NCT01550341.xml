  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      As of July, 2014 the study aims have changed. The revised project, called STRIDE2, is a
      longitudinal, non-randomized, observational study of individuals living with HIV who are
      dependent on opioids. This study is funded by the National Institute on Drug Abuse
      (R01DA030768, Altice, PI; Taxman &amp; Lawson, Co-PIs) and is being conducted by George Mason
      University, Yale University, and Howard University. Those individuals originally enrolled in
      the STRIDE RCT will be followed for 12 months.

      STRIDE2 will assist in identifying and monitoring individuals' HIV risk behaviors and provide
      resources to seek treatment for their HIV care and substance use. The goal of STRIDE2 is to
      examine if there are differences in HIV, drug use, and other outcomes between individuals
      receiving treatment versus individuals actively using, not actively using and not in
      treatment, and individuals on Methadone, Suboxone, or in some other treatment.
