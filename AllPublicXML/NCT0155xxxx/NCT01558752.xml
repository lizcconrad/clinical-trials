  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main goal is to prospectively evaluate bone mineral density adjacent to the femoral
      component and femoral bone remodeling of two different designs: CORAIL impaction broach
      titanium stem compared to a modular titanium femoral stem (Tri-lock). Patients will be
      randomized to one of the two treatment groups prior to surgery. Each patient will be
      evaluated at their regularly scheduled 10-14 days, 3, 6, 12 and 24 month visits following
      surgery. Patients will be asked to have bilateral DEXA bone mineral density tests (10-14 days
      post-surgery, and 6, 12 and 24 months post-operatively). Urine and serum samples (measures of
      bone turnover) will be collected at 3, 6 and 12 months post-operatively after an overnight
      fast. Patient reported questionnaires will be completed preoperatively and at the 3, 6, 12,
      and 24 month visits.

      The main goal is to prospectively evaluate bone mineral density adjacent to the femoral
      component and femoral bone remodeling of two different designs: CORAIL impaction broach
      titanium stem compared to a modular titanium femoral stem (Tri-lock). The investigators
      expect the CORAIL femoral stem group to show significantly less bone loss on the femoral side
      as compared to the Tri-lock group. The primary outcome is percent change in bone mineral
      density (BMD) (g/cm2) from baseline (10-14 days post-op) to the one year post-operative
      interval, as measured radiographically in zones 1 and 7.

      Patients will be randomized to one of the two treatment groups prior to surgery. Each patient
      will be evaluated at their regularly scheduled 10-14 days, 3, 6, 12 and 24 month visits
      following surgery.

      Bilateral DEXA bone mineral density tests will be performed at 10-14 days following surgery
      (baseline assessment) and at 6, 12, and 24 months post-operatively.

      Urine and serum samples (measures of bone turnover) will be collected at 3, 6 and 12 months
      post-operatively after an overnight fast.

      The Harris Hip Score will be completed at each post-operative visit except the immediate
      (10-14 days), when risk of dislocation precludes a determination of range of motion. At the
      3, 6, 12 and 24 month post-operative visits, the patient will complete the RAND-36 Item
      Health Survey, WOMAC and UCLA activity scale.
