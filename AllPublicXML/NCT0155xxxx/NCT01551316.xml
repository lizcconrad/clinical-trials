  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In MediciNova's clinical development plan for MN-221, it was recognized that treatment of
      COPD exacerbations may necessitate more than one single i.v. infusion and that patients in
      this population may have more co-morbidities (and concomitant medications) than has been
      generally studied so far. Thus, the primary objective of this clinical study is to determine
      the repeated administration safety and tolerability of intravenous (i.v.) MN-221 compared to
      placebo with repeated administration over several days in moderate to severe COPD patients
      who may also have co-morbidities and concomitant medications (CM) common in this population.
      Secondary outcomes include pharmacokinetics (PK) and preliminary efficacy (FEV1).

      This Phase 1b trial follows naturally upon a Phase 1b COPD trial completed last year
      (MN-221-CL-010) and is additionally well-supported by relevant animal safety data and human
      clinical trial information.
