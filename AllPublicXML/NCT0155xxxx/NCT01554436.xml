  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The low overall effectiveness of available smoking cessation treatment so far, indicate the
      need for new and more efficacious ways to help smokers maintain abstinence. Smokers are a
      highly heterogeneous population. Identification of individual characteristics that predict
      success in smoking cessation is highly desirable to allow designing more specific strategies
      in order to enhance success in quitting tobacco.The main objective of this study is to assess
      whether the presence of certain neuropsychological deficits found before the initiation of
      smoking cessation is associated with a greater relapse rate.The secondary objectives concern
      how neuropsychological performance are involved in motivation and craving in the whole sample
      of smokers or in subsample. Long-term perspective is to define clinical or neuropsychological
      factors associated with agood or poor prognosis for success and provived more specific and
      therefore more effective care.

      This is a prospective multicenter study. Patients will be recruited to anti tobacco
      consultations in the Montpellier and Clermont-Ferrand University Hospitals. The initial
      assessment includes a clinical assessment of smoking history, Axis I disorders history,
      motivation to quit and craving, a neuropsychological assessment : NART, RVIP task, trail
      Making Test, Stroop, Iowa gambling task, Hayling test, N back, verbal fluency. Then patients
      will be reviewed 3 times in 6 months. These visits include: CO level and cigarette
      consumption since the last visit, cessation strategy (medication, observance … ), tobacco
      craving questionnary, withdrawal symptoms, abstinence.

      The primary endpoint will be smoking abstinence objectified by the rate of carbon monoxide
      measured at each visit. Subjects who emerge from the study prematurely, especially patients
      lost to follow will be considered as failures in the statistical analysis.

    <description>The main criterion of evaluation of the smoking abstinence will be made by the measure of the rate of carbon monoxide (CO) in the expired air between the study start and during the study until 6 months after inclusion.
The secondary criteria of evaluation are criteria of neuropsychological order, namely the performances in the tests listed: result of NART test,Continuous Performance Test (CPT), Trail Making test, Stroop test, Iowa gambling task. (IGT), Hayling test, N back test, fluence verbal test</description>
