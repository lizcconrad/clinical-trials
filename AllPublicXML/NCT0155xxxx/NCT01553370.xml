  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Maintaining a healthy body weight is a major challenge for the majority of Canadians. A
      lifestyle strategy that promotes maintenance of a healthy body weight and, perhaps most
      importantly, can be incorporated into daily life with relative ease is essential. This study
      will determine if an effective strategy includes increased physical activity in conjunction
      with higher intakes of dairy products immediately following exercise. Fifty-six overweight
      adult males who do not regularly exercise will be assigned to one of four groups for 12
      weeks. All groups will preform 12 weeks of exercise training (1 hour of cycling per day, 5
      times per week). Two groups will consume supplemental low fat milk (3 servings per day) with
      one these groups consuming it immediately after exercise while the other will consume it
      either well before or long after the exercise session. The other two groups will consume a
      carbohydrate drink that has the same amount of energy as the low fat milk, with one of these
      groups consuming the drink right after exercise and the other another group will consume it
      either well before or long after the exercise session. Markers of health status including
      body weight, muscle mass, and bone mass will be measured at the start and after the 12- week
      intervention. The investigators anticipate that providing the low fat milk immediately after
      exercise will result in the most favorable changes in health outcomes, and provide a
      realistic lifestyle intervention for overweight individuals to attain a healthy body weight,
      and by doing so, optimize their ability to prevent chronic disease.
