      The purpose of this study is to compare a standard chemotherapy regimen of cyclophosphamide,
      dexamethasone plus thalidomide with a newer regimen of cyclophosphamide, dexamethasone plus
      lenalidomide with or without carfilzomib.

      Patients who do not have the best response to their initial treatment may then also be given
      a combination of cyclophosphamide, dexamethasone plus bortezomib.

      Patients who are relatively fit may, on their doctor's advice, go on to receive more
      intensive chemotherapy, supported with a transplant of their own blood cells. This is
      standard treatment which patients may be offered anyway even if they didn't take part in this
      study.

      After maximal response has been achieved with the treatment described above, and as long as
      the myeloma has not got worse, patients will be treated with either long-term lenalidomide,
      lenalidomide with vorinostat, or receive no further treatment, with close observation.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The last ten years has seen the introduction of a number of effective new anti-myeloma agents
      into the clinical arena. These agents have been shown to be highly effective in the relapse
      setting and now are being introduced as treatment earlier in the disease course.

      This study aims to address in the randomised setting some of the key questions concerning the
      use of thalidomide, bortezomib, lenalidomide, carfilzomib and vorinostat in the initial
      treatment of multiple myeloma patients.

      Newly diagnosed patients of all ages with symptomatic myeloma requiring treatment are
      eligible.

      For initial treatment, thalidomide in combination with cyclophosphamide and dexamethasone,
      the UK gold standard, will be compared with the newer combination of lenalidomide,
      cyclophosphamide and dexamethasone with or without carfilzomib.

      For patients with a sub-optimal response to initial therapy, the response to the proteasome
      inhibitor bortezomib will be assessed, as previous studies have demonstrated that it is able
      to induce responses and improve progression-free and overall survival in patients resistant
      to standard chemotherapy. Patients young and fit enough to tolerate an autologous transplant
      will then proceed to high dose melphalan with peripheral blood stem cell rescue and then on
      to maintenance randomisation. Older or less fit patients will go directly to a maintenance
      randomisation.

      The value of lenalidomide and lenalidomide combined with vorinostat maintenance will then be
      assessed by randomising eligible patients to receive either lenalidomide, lenalidomide
      combined with vorinostat maintenance therapy, or close observation.

      The primary end points of the study are overall and progression-free survival (OS and PFS).
      Secondary end points include response and toxicity.

      A number of laboratory based studies will also be performed in order to determine patient
      specific factors predicting overall and progression-free survival and response to treatment.

    <description>The intensive pathway is aimed at younger and fitter patients who will receive the standard dose of chemotherapy. The initial treatments will be followed by high-dose chemotherapy with a stem cell transplant which is generally standard practice.
Participants receive one treatment from each following stage in intensive pathway, depending on what they are randomised to (Protocol v6.0):
Induction treatment:
CRD regimen - cyclophosphamide, lenalidomide, dexamethasone
CTD regimen - cyclophosphamide, thalidomide, dexamethasone
CCRD regimen - carfilzomib, cyclophosphamide, lenalidomide, dexamethasone
Consolidation treatment (depending on response to induction treatment):
VCD regimen - bortezomib, cyclosphosphamide, dexamethasone
No consolidation treatment
High-dose therapy and stem cell transplant
Maintenance treatment:
Lenalidomide maintenance
No maintenance
Lenalidomide plus vorinostat maintenance (Protocol v5.0 only)</description>

    <description>The non-intensive pathway is aimed at participants who are not deemed suitable for the stem cell transplant, and will receive lower doses of some of the drugs.
Interventions in each stage of non-intensive pathway (depending on what the participant has been randomised to) - from Protocol v6.0:
Induction treatment
CRDa regimen - cyclophosphamide, lenalidomide, dexamethasone attenuated
CTDa regimen - cyclophosphamide, thalidomide, dexamethasone attenuated
Consolidation treatment (depending on participant's response to induction treatment):
VCD regimen - bortezomib, cyclosphosphamide, dexamethasone
No consolidation treatment
Maintenance treatment
Lenalidomide maintenance
No maintenance
Lenalidomide plus vorinostat maintenance (*for participants recruited under Protocol v5.0 only*)</description>
