      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and effect on the body of LY2127399 in
      combination with bortezomib and dexamethasone in Japanese patients with relapsed or
      refractory multiple myeloma (MM).

    <textblock>
      The study has 3 cohorts. Participants will only enroll in one cohort. Cohort 2 and cohort
      2-SC will be conducted in parallel.

      Cohort 1 - Participants will receive 100 mg LY2127399 intravenously (IV), 1.3 milligram per
      square meter (mg/m^2) bortezomib IV, and 20 mg dexamethasone orally.

      Cohort 2 - Participants will receive 300 mg LY2127399 IV, 1.3 mg/m^2 bortezomib IV, and 20 mg
      dexamethasone orally.

      Cohort 2-SC - Participants will receive 300 mg LY2127399 IV, 1.3 mg/m^2 bortezomib
      subcutaneously (SC), and 20 mg dexamethasone orally.

      Cohort 2-SC was added per protocol amendment in February 2013.

          -  Have ≥ Grade 2 peripheral neuropathy or any grade with pain as assessed using the
             Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, version 4.03 (CTCAE v 4.03).
