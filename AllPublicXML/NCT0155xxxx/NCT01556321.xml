      Green tea may have positive effects for weight control and on body composition via several
      approaches such as a positive effect on the gut flora, a decrease in fat absorption from the
      intestines and an increase in resting energy expenditure. We would like to investigate the
      long-term effects of green tea on gut flora, fat absorption, resting energy expenditure and
      body composition.

      The study will be conducted in a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind parallel design
      with four groups consisting of control groups and green tea groups with normal weight
      subjects and obese subjects. At three time points (baseline, 6 weeks and 12 weeks) faeces are
      collected for analyzing the gut flora composition and fat content. Furthermore, measurements
      of resting energy expenditure and body composition will be conducted. Activity will be
      measured during three weeks (baseline, week 6 and week 12).

      a hundred healthy subjects (50 males and 50 females) with a BMI between 18.5-25 kg/m2 and ≥30
      kg/m2 and aged between 18-50 years will be included in the study. All subjects will be
      non-smoking, non tea-drinkers, weight stable, dietary unrestraint, and at most moderate
      alcohol and caffeine consumers. Subjects will be free of medication except for oral
      contraceptives use in women.

      Intervention (if applicable):

      Subjects will receive either green tea or placebo in capsule form after their baseline
      measurement, which they have to consume three times daily for a period of twelve weeks.
