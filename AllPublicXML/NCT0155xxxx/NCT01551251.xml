    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the effects of tumor associated macrophage (TAM)
      in advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients on the treatment response and outcome
      of these subjects. Pathologic specimens from tissue bank will be stained by immunostaining
      methods with CD68 antibody. The clinical treatment response and outcomes will be analyzed
      between high or low TAM.

    <time_frame>2-3 months</time_frame>
    <description>All patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who had been treated were included. The decision of advanced NSCLC treatment was a consensus by the patient and clinician, and approved by team conference (including the oncologists, pulmonologists, pathologists, radiologists, surgeons, radiation oncologists, and nuclear medicine specialists). The tumor response was evaluated using computerized tomography according to the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST). The treatment response of advanced between high and low TAM patients were compared.</description>

    <measure>Outcomes of advanced NSCLC with high and low TAM.</measure>
    <time_frame>12-24 months</time_frame>
    <description>The outcomes of advanced NSCLC with high and low TAM will be compared. The outcomes include overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS). Survival curves were estimated by the Kaplan-Meier method while the log-rank test was used to compare the patient survival times per groups.</description>

      All specimens were fixed in 10% buffered formalin and embedded in paraffin according to
      standard procedures. All of the tissues were fixed immediately after biopsy, with time from
      tissue acquisition to fixation as short as possible. Serial sections (4 Î¼m thickness) placed
      on positively charged slides (Menzel-Glasser, German) were used for immuno-histochemistry.
