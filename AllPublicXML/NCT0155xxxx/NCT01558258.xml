  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Younger women with breast cancer experience substantially greater distress and depressive
      symptoms than older women. These symptoms can hamper recovery and healthy behaviors that can
      reduce the risk of recurrence and/or other chronic diseases. The primary objective of this
      study is to evaluate the feasibility and preliminary efficacy of a mindfulness
      meditation-based intervention for this at-risk group of women. The investigators hypothesize
      that a structured program of mindfulness meditation will lead to significant improvements in
      psychological well-being (i.e., depression, stress), with corresponding improvements in
      health behaviors and biomarkers of cancer risk, in women diagnosed with breast cancer, prior
      to age 50. The investigators will also examine mechanisms for intervention effects, including
      increased mindfulness and ability to relax.

    <description>Participants meet for 6 weekly, 2hr group sessions that include presentation of theoretical materials on mindfulness,relaxation,and mind-body connection;experiential practice of meditation and gentle yoga;psycho-educational component for cancer survivors,and group process focused on solving problems concerning impediments to effective practice.Participants will be instructed to practice mindfulness techniques on a daily basis. Daily diaries will be kept by participants to record practice time, mood assessments, and self-reported questions on benefits and barriers to practicing.</description>
