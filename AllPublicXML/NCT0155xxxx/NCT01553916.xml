  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase I/II trial studies the effects and safety of giving lithium carbonate (lithium) to
      patients with small cell lung cancer (SCLC) undergoing radiation therapy to the brain (PCI;
      prophylactic cranial irradiation). PCI is used to prevent cancer metastases from returning in
      the brain. This treatment can cause short-term memory problems by damaging the hippocampus.
      Lithium may help prevent or lessen memory problems caused by PCI by protecting the
      hippocampus.

    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>The HVLT is a word learning test measuring episodic visual memory
The immediate recall memory deterioration test portion consists of 36 words split into 3 sections (animals, gemstones, places of shelter, types of birds, tools, items of clothing, kitchen utensils,weapons, and alcoholic beverages)
The words were read aloud and the participants was asked to freely recall them immediately. The list was read a second time followed by a second free recall trial. This was followed by a third reading and third free recall.
The words recalled for each trial were recorded and a total recall score tallied (range: 0-36).

        <description>The HVLT is a word learning test measuring episodic visual memory
The immediate recall memory deterioration test portion consists of 36 words split into 3 sections (animals, gemstones, places of shelter, types of birds, tools, items of clothing, kitchen utensils,weapons, and alcoholic beverages)
The words were read aloud and the participants was asked to freely recall them immediately. The list was read a second time followed by a second free recall trial. This was followed by a third reading and third free recall.
The words recalled for each trial were recorded and a total recall score tallied (range: 0–36).

          <title>Delayed Recall Memory Deterioration as Measured by the Hopkins Verbal Learning Test - Delayed Recall (HVLT-DR) Total Score</title>
          <description>The HVLT is a word learning test measuring episodic visual memory
The delayed recall memory deterioration test portion consists of 36 words split into 3 sections (animals, gemstones, places of shelter, types of birds, tools, items of clothing, kitchen utensils,weapons, and alcoholic beverages)
The words were read aloud and the participants was asked to freely recall them 20-25 minutes later.
The words recalled were recorded and a total recall score tallied (range: 0–36).
The higher the score the better the recall</description>
