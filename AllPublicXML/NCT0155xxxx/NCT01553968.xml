  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It has been suggested that imbalance between TCA-cycle flux and β-oxidation may underlie
      insulin resistance, a predisposing factor for the development of type 2 diabetes mellitus.
      Acetylcarnitine concentration is suggested to be a marker of such imbalance. It is expected
      that when TCA-cycle capacity is high (a high oxidative capacity), less acetylcarnitine will
      accumulate, because of an improved balance between supply and demand of lipids.

      The major research objective is to examine if acute exercise results in a more pronounced
      increase in acetylcarnitine concentration in sedentary subjects compared to endurance-trained
      subjects and if the exercise-induced increase in acetylcarnitine is restored more quickly in
      endurance-trained subjects when compared to sedentary subjects.

      The investigators hypothesize that the increase in acetylcarnitine levels will be lower in
      trained subjects when compared to sedentary subjects, due to a better balance between lipid
      supply and utilization by the TCA-cycle. Furthermore it is expected that acetylcarnitine
      concentrations will be restored faster in these trained subjects, because of a tighter
      regulation of influx of fatty acids.

      To test this hypothesis the investigators want to compare the acetylcarnitine response to
      exercise in a group of sedentary subjects and a group of endurance trained subjects. This
      response will be measured for 30 minutes after exercise with the use of 1H-MRS.
