      This study will be executed according to a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial
      with two parallel groups, treated over the period of 6 months with escitalopram or placebo.

      Hypotheses: Escitalopram is more effective than placebo in the control of gastrointestinal
      symptoms, in irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) patients with panic disorder. Escitalopram is
      more effective than placebo in the control of psychiatric symptoms, in IBS patients with
      panic disorder.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. IBS will be diagnosed according to the Rome III criteria by a gastroenterologist.

          2. Subtyping of IBS patients will be performed using the following classification
             according to the Rome III criteria: IBS with constipation (IBS-C), IBS with diarrhea
             (IBS-D), mixed IBS (IBS-M) or not subtyped IBS (IBS-U).

          3. Based on the medical history and previous examination, no other causes for the
             abdominal complaints can be defined.

          4. A panic disorder will be diagnosed based on DSM IV criteria by a psychiatrist.

          5. Age above 18 years and under 70 years.

          6. Given written informed consent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Inability to stop medication that can influence gastrointestinal motility or
             perception (like loperamide, butylscopolamine, duspatalin, metoclopramide, domperidon,
             erytromycin), serotonin metabolism (like carbidopa, food supplementation), or
             epigenetics (like valproic acid), or containing perforated St. John's wort (Hypericum
             perforatum). In general this medication can be stopped without problems. However, this
             can increase symptoms. When the increase in symptoms will be to high, this medication
             will be restarted and the patient excluded form the study.

          2. Administration of investigational drugs in the 180 days prior to the study.

          3. Major abdominal surgery interfering with gastrointestinal function (uncomplicated
             appendectomy, cholecystectomy and hysterectomy allowed, and other surgery upon
             judgement of the principle investigator), epilepsy or (hypo)manic episodes.

          4. Pregnancy and lactation.

          5. Excessive alcohol consumption (&gt; 20 alcoholic consumptions per week) or drug abuse.

          6. Co-intervention or other treatment for IBS or anxiety, with the exception of initial
             co-intervention with benzodiazepines (alprazolam) contrasting side effects due to
             SSRI's during the first two weeks of dose elevation.

          7. Known prolongation of QT-interval or long-QT-syndrome, other cardiac disease, or use
             of medication with known prolongation of QT-interval.
