  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study aims at describing the acute and subacute changes after Roux-en-Y (RYGB) gastric
      bypass in insulin secretion from the beta cell and glucagon secretion from the alpha cell as
      well as the stimulatory effect of the incretins on the pancreatic islets. RYGB is a bariatric
      procedure that changes the gastrointestinal anatomy and has been demonstrated to cause
      remission of type 2 diabetes shortly after the operation, before any significant weight loss.
      The altered transit of nutrient through the gastrointestinal tract after the operation is
      thought to play a key role in this remission and studies have shown significant changes in
      the secretion of gut hormones, namely the incretin hormone glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1).
      However it is unknown whether the secretory function of the pancreatic islets as well as the
      stimulatory effect of the incretin hormones is changes postoperatively.
