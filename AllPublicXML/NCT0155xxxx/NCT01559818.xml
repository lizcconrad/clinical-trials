      Patients who were previously enrolled in Study IMM-101-001 and who provide informed consent
      will be eligible to participate in this study.

      Once eligibility is confirmed, a full medical history covering the period from their
      completion of Study IMM-101-001 to date will be taken.

      The treatment regimen with IMM-101 will be one dose given every 4 weeks or as close to this
      interval as permitted due to practical or logistic considerations. The dose interval may be
      modified at the discretion of the Investigator provided the minimum period between doses in
      no less than 14 days.

      The overall objective is to determine the long term safety profile of IMM-101 administered
      intradermally for extended use.

    <textblock>
      This is an open-label long term follow up study. The study will consist of two phases:

        1. Screening and enrolment Patients, who provide informed consent, will participate in a
           screening period of up to 28 days to establish eligibility. Once eligibility is
           confirmed a full disease and treatment history covering the period from their completion
           of Study IMM-101 001 to date will be taken.

        2. Treatment Patients can receive ongoing treatment every 4 weeks or as close to this
           interval as permitted due to practical or logistic considerations until death or
           withdrawal, unless such therapy is contraindicated, the patient does not wish to
           continue or the study is terminated by the Sponsor. At no point should the elapsed
           period between IMM-101 doses be less than 14 days.

      Patients may choose to withdraw from the study at any time and for any reason. IMM-101 should
      be stopped or the dosing regimen reduced if felt to be necessary by the Investigator and/or
      patient (e.g., intolerable injection site reactions).

      In the event of an injection site reaction of Grade 3 and above, and/or if significant
      ulceration, tenderness or lymphadenopathy is observed, at the discretion of the Investigator,
      patients may be administered a half dose of the study drug (i.e., a single 0.05 mL
      intradermal injection of IMM-101) or the timing of the injection may be delayed. If the
      dosing interval is increased, the patient should still attend the study site for safety
      assessments preferably every 3 months but, if this is not possible, every 6 months at a
      minimum. The blood sample for exploratory analysis should continue to be taken every 6
      months.

      Any change in the dose of study drug administered or the frequency of dose administration
      should be recorded in the patient's case report form (CRF). In the case of withdrawal,
      separate consent will be sought to allow the continued collection on patient status.
