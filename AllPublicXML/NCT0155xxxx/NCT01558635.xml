      Studies have shown that taking drugs to stay out of AF has limited success. This research is
      designed to study heart rhythm after surgical therapy, namely by measuring if there are
      benefits to having surgery to treat Atrial Fibrillation (AF) with the Cardioblate CryoFlex
      Surgical Ablation System. The system is approved and commercially available with CE mark. The
      purpose of this study is to support evidence that the Cardioblate System is safe and
      effective to treat AF.

      Introduction: Among the cardiac arrhythmias, Atrial Fibrillation (AF) is the most common
      sustained cardiac arrhythmia in the general population and represents an increasing problem
      worldwide. Management strategies for AF include combinations of various treatments, including
      surgery. Cox et al. developed the surgical Maze procedure to restore sinus conduction to the
      AV node and to restore effective, synchronized bi-atrial contraction. In an effort to address
      the observed challenges and make this treatment available to more subjects, modifications of
      the Maze pattern and new lesion patterns have being developed and tested. Devices using new
      technologies, like cryothermia, were developed in an effort to reduce the time required to
      make the lesion pattern.The Cardioblate® CryoFlex™ Surgical Ablation System has been
      successfully used for the surgical ablation of cardiac arrhythmias including atrial
      fibrillation. The system utilizes cryothermia to create the linear lesions of the surgical
      Maze-III procedure.

      Purpose: To provide clinical evidence showing that the Cox Cryo Maze III procedure is
      effective and safe in subjects with longstanding persistent AF undergoing mitral valve repair
      or replacement.

      Study objective: The study objectives were to characterize the safety and efficacy of the
      Medtronic Cardioblate CryoFlex Surgical Ablation System when used to treat subjects with
      longstanding persistent AF requiring concomitant mitral valve repair or replacement.
