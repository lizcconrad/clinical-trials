  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study main objective is investigating impulsivity on cocaine or crack addicts. The
      investigators main hypothesis is that different measures (such as scales or behavioral tasks,
      for example) of impulsivity may produce distinct outcomes, and they might also differ among
      cocaine (sniffed) and crack users. Thus, it would be of great value to compare such measures
      once these data are often interpreted as the same phenomenon.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Drug dependence is characterized by a sum of cognitive, behavioral and physiological
      symptoms. Among these symptoms are the lack of control over ones own behavior and substance
      use even in face of significant issues related to it. Impulsivity (expressed as impulsive
      choice or fail on behavioral inhibition) is important in crucial phases of drug dependence
      development. Both behavioral and neurobiological studies have confirmed the association
      between impulsivity and addictive behaviors. Thus a high impulsivity level might have
      influence on patients' treatment. Even though, several questions on this matter remain
      unclear for humans, such as the differences on impulsivity between users of different forms
      of cocaine (either sniffed or smoked). This kind of difference could establish distinct ways
      of treatment and then enable developing better treatments for drug users. For this study it
      will be recruited 60 non-treated dependent patients, among them 30 cocaine users and 30 crack
      users. These individuals will be selected based on DSM-IV dependence criteria. The
      instruments used will be scales to measure compulsion and consumption of cocaine/crack, a
      pharmacological screening for psychotropic drugs and a cognitive evaluation. As impulsivity
      measures are Barratt Impulsivity Scale (BIS 11), a reward discounting questionnaire and a
      computer-based behavioral test on &quot;ProgRef v3&quot; software. For data analysis the impulsivity
      measures will be compared with the behavioral and cognitive instruments through the Pearson's
      correlation matrix. An ANOVA will be also performed to verify any differences between cocaine
      and crack dependents on the impulsivity and compulsion tests. When it is appropriate
      subsequent Newman-Keuls post-hoc test will be performed. Significance level adopted is 0.05.
