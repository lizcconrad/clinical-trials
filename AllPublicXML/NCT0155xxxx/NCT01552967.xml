        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Signed written informed consent;

             adenocarcinoma whose ECOG performance status are 0-2;

          -  Presence of measurable disease by radiographic study (including CT or MRI scan, or
             chest x-ray) or physical examination;

          -  At least 3 weeks since last major surgery;

          -  At least 12 months since last adjuvant chemotherapy;

             radiotherapy fields are such that marked bone marrow suppression is NOT expected;

          -  Patients who have received palliative radiotherapy must have recovered from any
             reversible toxic effects e.g. nausea and vomiting caused by radiation of fields;

          -  Patients with reproductive potential must use effective BC;

          -  Active infection;

          -  Concurrent severe medical problems unrelated to the malignancy, which would

             risk;

          -  Sexually active patients refusing to practice adequate contraception;

          -  Patients with conditions which might affect absorption of an oral drug (for example
