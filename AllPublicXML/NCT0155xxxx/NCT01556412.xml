  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) is a rare chronic cholestatic liver disease, typically
      affecting middle aged men and is frequently associated with inflammatory bowel disease.
      Establishing diagnosis in early stages of cholestatic hepatopathy is still a clinical
      challenge and based on invasive diagnostic procedures: endoscopic retrograde cholangiography
      (ERC) or percutaneous liver biopsy are needed when magnetic resonance
      cholangiopancreaticography remains inconclusive. As these procedures are associated with
      significant risks for the patient, the goal of this study is to evaluate, if endoscopic
      ultrasound (EUS) of the biliary tract is a useful diagnostic tool in suspected PSC.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Different parameters of the common bile duct (wall thickness and irregularity, irregularity
      of the common bile duct and enlarged lymph nodes) are measured in patients with cholestatic
      hepatopathy of unknown causes via endoscopic ultrasound (EUS).

      This EUS of the CBD is performed from the bulbar position in the duodenum and at least 5 cm
      of bile duct had to be visualized to correctly analyze bile duct structure.

      Further diagnostic work-up of these patients is performed following current guidelines, and
      definite diagnosis is compared with results of EUS parameters measured. Thus, diagnostic
      yield of EUS in patients with suspected PSC is further evaluated.

    <description>Endosonographic ultrasound of the common bile duct
Four different diagnostic parameters evaluated during endosonographic ultrasound are evaluated in predicting primary sclerosing cholangitis:
Wall thickening â‰¥ 1.5 mm
Irregular wall structure of the common bile duct
Irregular caliber of the common bile duct
Lymph nodes proven in the perihilar region of at least 10 mm diameter were defined as enlarged.
With 2 of 4 criteria positive, patients were classified as suspected diagnostic PSC by means of EUS.</description>

    <arm_group_label>Chronic hepatopathy suspicious of PSC</arm_group_label>
    <description>All patients with chronic hepatopathy of unknown origin and a high risk of primary sclerosing cholangitis as the underlying disease for chronic hepatopathy.
This group includes all patients with cholestatic hepatopathy (predominantly elevated gamma-glutamyltransferase and alkalic phosphatase) and positive ANCAs (Anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies) and/or inflammatory bowel disease in medical history.
Other explanations of cholestatic hepatopathy (like pancreatic tumor or cholelithiasis) must not be apparent in patients eligible for this study.
Furthermore, infection oder extrahepatic cholestasis already proven by laboratory results or percutaneous ultrasound, which make endoscopic retrograde cholangiography necessary, are exclusion criteria in this study.</description>
