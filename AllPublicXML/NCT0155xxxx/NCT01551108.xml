      This study is designed to determine if parents can deliver an intervention that will help
      increase physical activity in their children. The parents will be given the intervention
      through their mobile phones.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Most children engage in insufficient amounts of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity. These
      low levels of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity are associated with adverse health
      consequences including increased risk for obesity, and cardiovascular and diabetes risk
      factors. Therefore, there is a need for studies that can increase physical activity levels in
      children. Mobile phones are a way to deliver behavioral interventions. Mobile phones are
      portable, allow for real-time data collection, and can potentially reach large numbers of
      people. Text messages can also be utilized to promote behavior change. Few mobile phone based
      interventions have specifically targeted child physical activity.

      The aims of this pilot study were to determine the feasibility and efficacy of a physical
      activity promotion program targeting 6-10 year old children that is delivered to parents
      through mobile phones.

    <description>Parents are given access to a website, formatted for a mobile phone. The website provides parents with a target steps/day goal for their child and parents are instructed to use their mobile phone to access the study website to record their child's step count each night. Parents are also sent monthly healthy nutrition tips via text message targeting the child in order to provide these families with potentially health promoting information.</description>

    <description>Parents are given access to a website, formatted for a mobile phone. The website provides parents with a target steps/day goal for their child and parents are instructed to use their mobile phone to access the study website to record their child's step count each night. Parents also receive additional behavioral strategies based on the Social Cognitive Theory. The strategies are delivered through weekly articles posted on the website. Text messages are designed to prompt parents to encourage their child's physical activity, remind parents of behavioral concepts presented in the articles (article tip), and motivate parents to foster behavioral change in their child.</description>
