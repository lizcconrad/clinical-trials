      The purpose of this study within Caring sciences is to identify women with breast cancer who
      have stress symptoms and to offer these women appropriate care to reduce stress and increase
      well-being. This will be achieved by

        1. Studying the prevalence of stress related symptoms in female patients with breast cancer

        2. Testing the use of two short screening instruments to identify women at risk for
           developing long-standing stress symptoms

        3. Studying the level and intensity of stress management interventions required to achieve
           increased well-being, using a stepped-care approach.

        4. Studying the effects of interventions based on cognitive behavior therapy, delivered
           individually or in a group format.

      The hypothesis is that half of the individuals assigned to a low intensity intervention will
      be significantly improved after treatment. For individuals who continue to have symptoms
      after low intensity treatment it is hypothesized that continued treatment in a group setting
      with high intensity interventions will be more cost-effective. In addition the assumption is
      that reduction of stress symptoms in women with breast cancer will lead to a reduction in
      socio-economic costs.

    <description>The methods and techniques will be the same as those used in the group intervention. The first session will be used for a detailed assessment of the individual's psychosocial problems, as used in earlier studies. The sessions will last 45 - 60 minutes. The number of sessions will depend on the individual patient's problems and the joint assessment made by the patient and nurse together. The total number of sessions will be at least 4, with a maximum of 8. The contents of the sessions are Session 1: Assessment, Session 2: Analysis of diary (self-registration) and suggestions for problem management, Session 3: Evaluation of problem management skills Session 4: Follow-up and conclusion of the intervention. When necessary Sessions 5 -8 will address specific obstacles and continued practice.</description>

    <description>Participants will meet for 2 hours every week for a total of 20 hours. In the intervals between the group meetings patients will be asked to do homework. Homework entails practicing problem-solving techniques, keeping a diary, practicing relaxation or physical activities. Each group meeting has a specific subject, i.e. What is stress and stress behaviors, Stress related symptoms, How to manage anger and negative thoughts, Self-registrations and behavioral changes, Future perspectives, Cancer, stress and relations, Expectations and demands, Body, pleasure and sexuality.</description>

    <intervention_type>Behavioral</intervention_type>
    <intervention_name>Stress management, in two steps</intervention_name>
    <description>All patients start at the first step of the intervention program with a two hours psychoeducation in stress management. Patients, who don't report a decrease in stress related symptoms, after the first step will be offered an intensive stress management, either in individual or group format. Components included in the intervention concern 1) basic knowledge about cancer, treatment, healthy living and stress reactions, 2) self-awareness with help of diary for thoughts, feelings and behavior 3) instruction in various techniques on how to express negative feelings, how to communicate with others more effectively, how to change behaviors related to stress 4) training these techniques in real-life situations 5) cognitive restructuring 6) spirituality, derived from cognitive behavior therapy.</description>
