  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of filorexant (MK-6096)
      versus placebo as adjunctive treatment for major depressive disorder (MDD), in participants
      who are partial responders to antidepressant monotherapy with one of identified selective
      serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) or serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors
      (SNRIs), or bupropion. The primary hypothesis of the study is that filorexant is superior to
      placebo as augmentation therapy with respect to change from baseline to Week 6 in the
      Montgomery Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) total score.

    <textblock>
      Participants will continue to take their pretrial antidepressant medication as prescribed
      throughout the trial. Participants will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive filorexant or
      placebo for a 6-week treatment period. Following completion of the treatment period,
      participants will enter a 2-week double-blind run-out period. During the run-out period,
      participants who received placebo in the 6-week treatment period will continue to receive
      placebo and participants who received filorexant in the 6-week treatment period will be
      randomized to receive either filorexant or placebo in a 1:1 ratio.

    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 6</time_frame>
    <description>The MADRS is a 10-item clinician-rated instrument for evaluating severity of symptoms of depression. Each item is rated on a scale from 0 to 6, with total scores ranging from 0 to 60; higher scores correspond to greater symptom severity. The reported measure is the mean change from baseline to Week 6 of the Treatment Phase; improvement in symptoms is represented by negative values.</description>

    <description>An AE is any unfavorable and unintended change in the structure, function or chemistry of the body temporally associated with study drug administration, whether or not considered related to the study drug. Any worsening (i.e., any clinically significant adverse change in frequency and/or intensity) of a preexisting condition which is temporally associated with study drug administration, is also an AE. Participants with one or more AEs during the treatment phase (up to study Week 6) are counted once in this summary.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline to Week 6 in MADRS Total Score Excluding the Sleep Item</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 6</time_frame>
    <description>The MADRS is a 10-item clinician-rated instrument for evaluating severity of symptoms of depression. Each item is rated on a scale from 0 to 6, with higher scores indicating greater symptom severity. The total score ranged from 0 to 54, with higher scores corresponding to greater symptom severity. This measure considered 9 of the 10 MADRS items: apparent sadness, reported sadness, inner tension, reduced appetite, concentration difficulties, lassitude, inability to feel, pessimistic thoughts, and suicidal thoughts. It excluded &quot;reduced sleep.&quot; The reported measure is the mean change from baseline to Week 6 of the Treatment Phase; improvement in symptoms is represented by negative values.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline to Week 6 in the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale, 17-item Version (HAM-D17) Bech Subscale Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 6</time_frame>
    <description>The HAM-D, an instrument for evaluating severity of symptoms of depression, was completed by the participant. The instrument used in this study was the 17-item version (HAM-D17). The Bech subscale of the HAM-D17 is composed of 6 identified items out of the 17 items rated. Each item is rated on either a 3-point scale (0 to 2) or a 5-point scale (0 to 4). Total score ranged from 0 to 22, with a higher score indicating greater symptom severity. The following symptoms were rated on a 5-point scale (0-4): depressed mood, low self-esteem (guilt), work and interests, psychomotor retardation, and anxiety (psychic). The following symptom was rated on a 3-point scale (0-2): somatic symptoms (general). The reported measure is the change from baseline to Week 6 of the Treatment Phase; improvement in symptoms is represented by negative values.</description>

Each item is rated on either a 3-point scale (0 to 2) or a 5-point scale (0 to 4), with higher scores indicating greater symptom severity. Total score ranged from 0 to 54. The following symptoms were rated on a 5-point scale (0-4): depressed mood, low self-esteem (guilt), suicidal thoughts, work and interests, psychomotor retardation, psychomotor agitation, anxiety (psychic), anxiety (somatic), and hypochondriasis (somatization). The following symptoms were rated on a 3-point scale (0-2): insomnia (initial), insomnia (middle), insomnia (late), gastrointestinal symptoms (appetite), somatic symptoms (general), sexual disturbances, insight, and weight loss. A participant with HAM-D17 total score ≤7 at Week 6 of the Treatment Phase was defined to have achieved HAM-D17 remission.</description>

        <description>The MADRS is a 10-item clinician-rated instrument for evaluating severity of symptoms of depression. Each item is rated on a scale from 0 to 6, with higher scores indicating greater symptom severity. The total score ranged from 0 to 54, with higher scores corresponding to greater symptom severity. This measure considered 9 of the 10 MADRS items: apparent sadness, reported sadness, inner tension, reduced appetite, concentration difficulties, lassitude, inability to feel, pessimistic thoughts, and suicidal thoughts. It excluded &quot;reduced sleep.&quot; The reported measure is the mean change from baseline to Week 6 of the Treatment Phase; improvement in symptoms is represented by negative values.</description>

        <description>The HAM-D, an instrument for evaluating severity of symptoms of depression, was completed by the participant. The instrument used in this study was the 17-item version (HAM-D17). The Bech subscale of the HAM-D17 is composed of 6 identified items out of the 17 items rated. Each item is rated on either a 3-point scale (0 to 2) or a 5-point scale (0 to 4). Total score ranged from 0 to 22, with a higher score indicating greater symptom severity. The following symptoms were rated on a 5-point scale (0-4): depressed mood, low self-esteem (guilt), work and interests, psychomotor retardation, and anxiety (psychic). The following symptom was rated on a 3-point scale (0-2): somatic symptoms (general). The reported measure is the change from baseline to Week 6 of the Treatment Phase; improvement in symptoms is represented by negative values.</description>

The following symptoms were rated on a 5-point scale (0-4): depressed mood, low self-esteem (guilt), suicidal thoughts, work and interests, psychomotor retardation, psychomotor agitation, anxiety (psychic), anxiety (somatic), and hypochondriasis (somatization). The following symptoms were rated on a 3-point scale (0-2): insomnia (initial), insomnia (middle), insomnia (late), gastrointestinal symptoms (appetite), somatic symptoms (general), sexual disturbances, insight, and weight loss. A participant with HAM-D17 total score ≤7 at Week 6 of the Treatment Phase was defined to have achieved HAM-D17 remission.</description>

        <description>An AE is any unfavorable and unintended change in the structure, function or chemistry of the body temporally associated with study drug administration, whether or not considered related to the study drug. Any worsening (i.e., any clinically significant adverse change in frequency and/or intensity) of a preexisting condition which is temporally associated with study drug administration, is also an AE. Participants with one or more AEs during the 2-week run-out phase and/or during the 2-week follow up after the last dose of study drug, are counted once in this summary.</description>
