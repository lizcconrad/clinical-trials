    <textblock>
      Vitamin A deficiency remains a major public health problem in developing country worldwide.
      Young Children are considered to be at greatest risk of deficiency. However, there is little
      information on the vitamin A requirement of Chinese children. In the present study, about 400
      children aged between 4 and 9 years old in a kindergarten and an elementary school of Shiyan
      City were screened before admission by questionnaire and anthropometric measurement. The
      vitamin A status of children was assessed by serum vitamin A level, relative dosage reaction
      and stable-isotope dilution technique. At the same time, their dietary vitamin A intakes were
      estimated by weighted-food dietary survey. The dietary vitamin A requirement in young
      children was determined on the basis of dietary vitamin A intakes in Children with adequate
      vitamin A level.

        The study was carried out in a kindergarten and an elementary school in Shiyan city, Hubei
        province of China. Initially, 201 kindergarten children (4-6 years old) and 202 grade
        children (7-9 years old) were subjected to a questionnaire survey on personal information,
        medical history and dietary habits including dietary supplements.ongoing or previous
        illnesses, having taken nutritional supplements within 3 months, positive results in the
        fat absorption test or parasite test, increased level of CRP (&gt; 8 mg/L), or lower serum
        level of retinol (&lt;1.40 umol/L), and higher ratio in relative dosage reaction test(&gt;20%)
        .After the screening, 123 children were selected and completed the study, but 60 subjects
        were randomly selected for the DRD test to evaluate liver vitamin A storage.
