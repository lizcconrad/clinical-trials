      The objectives of the study are to document device performance with respect to the primary
      and secondary endpoints.

      The purpose of the current study is proposed to prospectively validate the BrainScope Ahead®
      M-100 device design, performance, and labeling with respect to the device's target intended
      use and indications for use:

        -  Primary Endpoint:

             -  Structural Injury Assessment

             -  There are four co-primary endpoints in this study: two sets of sensitivity and
                specificity to divide the data into three classes.

             -  Using a BrainScope classification algorithm, the Ahead® M100 will identify subjects
                showing sensitivities among 3 classes: Green-normal, nonhead injured
                controls,Yellow-head injured subjects who do not exhibit brain electrical activity
                that is consistent with a structural brain injury observable on CT or for whom CT
                was not deemed necessary,Red-head injured subjects who exhibit brain electrical
                activity consistent with a structural brain injury observable by CT.

        -  Secondary Endpoint:

             -  Functional Injury Assessment

             -  There are two co-secondary endpoints for the secondary objective, the sensitivity
                and specificity to split Yellow from the primary endpoint into two sub groups
                depending on degree of brain functional impairment observable by an evaluation of
                the clinical findings on a clinical charter used as the assessment of truth.

    <description>Using a BrainScope classification algorithm, the Ahead® M-100 will identify subjects showing sensitivities among 3 classes:
Green - brain electrical activity that is consistent with patients without head injuries (Ahead® M-100 output = 1), Yellow - brain electrical activity that is consistent with head injured subjects who are abnormal, but do not have a structural brain injury (Ahead® M-100 output = 2 or 3), Red - brain electrical activity consistent with a structural brain injury observable on CT (Ahead® M-100 output = 4).</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Males and females ages 18 to 80 (the entire age range), who are admitted to the
             Emergency Department (ED), who are suspected of a traumatically induced structural
             brain injury and/or clinical manifestations of functional brain injury, as a result of
             insult to the head from an external force, e.g., the head being struck by an object,
             the head striking an object, the head being exposed to forces generated from a blast
             or explosion, and/or the brain undergoing an acceleration/deceleration movement
             without direct external trauma to the head with a Glasgow Coma Scale of &gt; 8.

               -  The acute, suspected traumatically induced structural brain injury and/or
                  clinical manifestations of functional brain injury will have occurred within the
                  past 24 hours upon admission to the ED.

          -  The ED normal control group will be males and females ages 18 to 80 (the entire age
             range), who are admitted to the ED for presenting complaints that do not involve the

             visit or TBI within the past one (1) year, and no primary complaint of syncope

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects will be excluded who have forehead, scalp, or skull abnormalities or other
             conditions that would prevent correct application of the electrode headset on the
             skin.

          -  In addition, subjects with dementia, Parkinson's Disease, multiple sclerosis, seizure
             disorder, brain tumors, history of brain surgery, mentally retarded, psychiatric
             disorder for which there is a prescribed psychiatric medication taken on a daily
             basis, substance dependence, history of TIA or stroke within the last year, currently
             receiving dialysis or in end-stage renal disease, active fever defined as greater than
             100oF or 37.7oC, current condition is listed as &quot;critical&quot; in the opinion of the
             investigator, subject is suffering from an open head injury, subject requires advanced
             airway management (i.e. mechanical ventilation), currently receiving procedural
             sedation medications (e.g. benzodiazepine, anesthetic, NMDA receptor antagonist, or
             opioid agonist), subjects below the age of 18 years, pregnant women, and prisoners
             will not be eligible for study.

          -  ED normal control subjects will be excluded if there is a suspected neck injury or
             trauma above the clavicles, a primary complaint of generalized weakness, or a primary
             complaint of headache or migraine
