  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Genital ureaplasmas (Ureaplasma urealyticum and Ureaplasma parvum) and genital mycoplasmas
      (Mycoplasma hominis and Mycoplasma genitalium) are natural inhabitants of the male urethra
      contaminating the semen during ejaculation. However, these microorganisms, especially
      Ureaplasma urealyticum (Uu) and Mycoplasma hominis (Mh), are potentially pathogenic species
      playing an etiologic role in both genital infections and male infertility. Despite there are
      many consentaneous opinions about its relationship with infertility, its correlation with
      sperm regular parameters is still controversially. Sperm DNA damage can negatively influence
      fertilization rate, embryo cleavage rate, implantation rate, pregnancy and live birth rate,
      and is a novel indicator for intrauterine insemination (IUI) pregnancy rate and IVF or ICSI
      pregnancy loss rate. Until now, there were fewer clinical researches about the relationship
      among Uu and/or Mh infection, sperm DNA damage, and the IUI pregnancy rate. Thus, the
      investigators conduct this prospective study to investigate the relationship among them.
