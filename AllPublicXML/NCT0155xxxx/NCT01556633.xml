  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This open-label, prospective, single dose study will evaluate the pharmacokinetics and safety
      of Tamiflu (oseltamivir) in volunteers on dialysis and in volunteers with a creatinine
      clearance from 10 to 30 mL/min. Volunteers will receive a single oral dose of Tamiflu.

    <description>CLDAPD is the total dialysate clearance for automated peritoneal dialysis, attributable to both continuous cycler-assisted peritoneal dialysis (CCPD) and continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD), which was calculated with the recovery method over the dense blood sampling collection interval from 0 to 48 hours post-dose.
CLDAPD = the amount excreted into dialysate from 0 to 48 hours (Aed[0-48])/ plasma area under the concentration-time curve from time zero through 48 hours (AUC[0-48])
CLDCCPD = mean of CLDCCPD from the 2 CCPD sessions, calculated as CLDCCPD = (Aed[0-8]/AUC[0-8] + Aed[24-32]/AUC[24-32]) / 2
CLDCAPD = mean of CLDCAPD from the 3 CAPD sessions, calculated as CLDCAPD = (Aed[8-16]/AUC[8-16] + Aed[16-24]/AUC[16-24] + Aed[32-48]/AUC[32-48]) / 3</description>

    <description>Vital signs included pulse rate, systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), and body temperature.
Vital sign with abnormal shifts from normal at baseline to high or low at post-baseline time points were recorded. Blood pressure was recorded in millimeter of mercury (mmHg), and temperature in degrees Celsius. Low blood pressure defined as &lt;=70 mmHg (SBP) and &lt;=40 mmHg (DBP); high blood pressure defined as &gt;=140 mmHg (SBP) and &gt;=90 mmHg (DBP); low temperature defined as &lt;=36.5 degrees Celsius and high temperature defined as &gt;=37.5 degrees Celsius.</description>

        <title>Total Dialysate Clearance for Automated Peritoneal Dialysis (CLDAPD) of Oseltamivir and Oseltamivir Carboxylate for 75 mg Dose</title>
        <description>CLDAPD is the total dialysate clearance for automated peritoneal dialysis, attributable to both continuous cycler-assisted peritoneal dialysis (CCPD) and continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD), which was calculated with the recovery method over the dense blood sampling collection interval from 0 to 48 hours post-dose.
CLDAPD = the amount excreted into dialysate from 0 to 48 hours (Aed[0-48])/ plasma area under the concentration-time curve from time zero through 48 hours (AUC[0-48])
CLDCCPD = mean of CLDCCPD from the 2 CCPD sessions, calculated as CLDCCPD = (Aed[0-8]/AUC[0-8] + Aed[24-32]/AUC[24-32]) / 2
CLDCAPD = mean of CLDCAPD from the 3 CAPD sessions, calculated as CLDCAPD = (Aed[8-16]/AUC[8-16] + Aed[16-24]/AUC[16-24] + Aed[32-48]/AUC[32-48]) / 3</description>

Laboratory test result values falling outside of the marked abnormality range that also represent a defined change from baseline were considered as marked laboratory abnormalities.
