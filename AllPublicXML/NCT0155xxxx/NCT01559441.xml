  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Increased postprandial lipemia may increase the risk for cardiovascular diseases. An
      important mechanistic link between lipemia following a high-fat meal and adverse
      cardiovascular events is lipid-mediated endothelial activation. Therefore, it is important to
      identify nutrients that can neutralize this acute vascular disturbance.

      The investigators hypothesize that beetroot juice, a food rich in inorganic nitrate, could
      improve vascular activity during the postprandial phase.
