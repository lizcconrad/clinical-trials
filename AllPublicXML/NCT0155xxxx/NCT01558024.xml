  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main objective of this study is to obtain data to determine, in each individual with and
      without wearing compression stockings of different strengths and during different postures,
      the relationship between interface pressure and the area and circumference of the great
      saphenous vein and posterior tibial veins in the calf and ankle.

        The study will be conducted on adult men and women divided into a group of subjects with
        chronic venous insufficiency defined by the CEAP classification (Hawaii), stages:

          -  C1S (telangiectasias or reticular veins and symptoms of chronic venous insufficiency),

          -  C3 (varicose veins: superficial veins of diameter greater than or equal to 3 mm)

          -  And C5 (healed venous ulcer)

        and a control group of healthy subjects without venous disease (sedentary, active, and
        athletic subjects), matched for age, sex, and body mass index.
