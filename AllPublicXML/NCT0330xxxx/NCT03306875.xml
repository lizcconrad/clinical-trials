  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to apply baseline MRI and neuropsychological measures to predict patient
      responses to behavioral cognitive rehabilitation. Training will take place over 12 weeks, 1
      hour per day, 5 days per week.

      The investigator hypothesizes the following:

      [1a] The investigator expects that individuals with low baseline Conscientiousness will
      experience a lower magnitude of overall cognitive improvement following rehabilitation

        1. b] The investigator expects the impact of Conscientiousness on fidelity of
           rehabilitation will in part be moderated by individual differences in program adherence
           and executive function

        2. a] The investigator expects that individual differences in structural and functional
           connectome disturbances will in part explain differences in participant responses to
           cognitive rehabilitation.

      This study will also serve to supplement the sample of participants for the current IRB
      approved study ((IRB: 603069, Title: A case-control, 5-year follow-up study of
      cardiovascular, environmental and genetic risk factors for disease progression in patients
      with multiple sclerosis.

      The participant will be asked to make a total of two (2) visits, approximately 90 days apart.
      Each visit will involve: neuro-performance testing, and self-report questionnaires. Each
      study visit is expected to take approximately 1-2 hours. Between the two visits, the
      participant will be asked to complete a 12 week, computer-based cognitive training program.
      This includes 1 hour of training each day for 5 days each week.

      On Visit 1, the participants will undergo a full battery of neuro-performance tasks including
      tests and questionnaires that will measure their memory, thinking speed, fatigue, and
      personality. This visit is expected to take approximately 1-2 hours. The participants will be
      also asked to have a close friend or family member to complete similar surveys. A
      self-addressed envelope containing these questionnaires will be provided to take home with
      them. The participant will need to pass it onto a close friend or family member to be
      completed and mailed back.

      In addition, the participant will be asked to take part in the 12 week computerized cognitive
      training program. This can be done at home, or anywhere the participant has access to a
      computer and internet. This cognitive training has been shown to improve cognitive
      performance in people with multiple sclerosis. The training involves a variety of interactive
      exercises which adapt to their abilities. The participants will need complete 1 hour of
      training each day, for 5 days each week.

      At 90 days, the participant will return for the 1-2 hours' follow-up visit where they will
      complete the same cognitive testing and questionnaires which they had completed during visit
      1.

      All study visits will take place at Buffalo General Hospital. All of the procedures described
      above will be performed by a trained member of the research team as part of the research
      study.

      If an individual is ineligible for participation, their screening information will be
      discarded (i.e., shredded). If participants are deemed eligible (either in person or over the
      phone), they will be scheduled to come in to the hospital for neuropsychological testing.
      Written consent will be obtained prior to administration of tests. As part of the consent
      process, participants will be asked for permission to use any data collected as part of the
      screening process as well.

    <time_frame>This outcome will be measured according to changes from baseline cognition to follow-up measures, 12 weeks later (following cognitive rehabilitation)</time_frame>
    <description>The investigator expects baseline Conscientiousness to correlate positively with cognitive gains following rehabilitation.
Conscientiousness will be measured using the NEO-Five Factor Inventory (NEOFFI). All scores for personality testing will be converted to age-corrected t-scores for final analysis. These are therefore standardized values without units.</description>

    <description>Cognitive gains will be measured according to differences between baseline and followup testing for the following tests of cognition.
Brief Visuospatial Memory Test (BVMT). This is a test of visual and spatial learning and memory.
California Verbal Learning Test (CVLT). This is a test of verbal learning and memory.
Symbol Digit Modalities Test (SDMT). This is a test of visual information processing speed.
All scores for cognitive testing will be converted to age-corrected t-scores for final analysis. These are therefore standardized values without units.</description>

Executive function will be reported according to scores on the following tests.
Delis-Kaplan Executive Function System (D-KEFS) Tower Test.
D-KEFS Sorting Test.
Elithorn Perceptual Maze Test (EPMT). All scores for executive function will be converted to age-corrected t-scores for final analysis. These are therefore standardized values without units.</description>

In order to address outcome number 5, white matter tract disruption will be characterized in order to determine how structural networks are impacted by white matter lesions. Tract disruption will be reported as the proportion of tracts normally connecting pairs of gray matter brain regions which are disrupted by lesions. These will therefore be reported as percent values.</description>
