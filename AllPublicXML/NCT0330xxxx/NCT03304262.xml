  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall objective is to validate the methodology of a metaplasticity experimental design
      by assessing change in motor excitability after administration of priming transcranial direct
      current stimulation (tDCS) followed by repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) in
      healthy human participants.

      The overall objective is to validate the methodology of a metaplasticity experimental design
      by assessing change in motor excitability after administration of priming transcranial direct
      current stimulation (tDCS) followed by repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) in
      healthy human participants. Our primary objective is to compare pre- and post-measures of
      cortical excitability before priming tDCS (anodal, cathodal or sham) [M1], directly after
      priming tDCS [M2], directly after inhibitory rTMS [M3], and 10 minutes after inhibitory rTMS
      [M4]. Our secondary objective is to evaluate the sensitivity of motor excitability outcome
      measures response to the noninvasive neurostimulation (e.g. rTMS and tDCS). We also aim to
      compare pre- and post- measures of cortical excitability after inhibitory and excitatory
      priming of the motor cortex, and to evaluate the sensitivity of motor outcome measures to
      changes in cortical plasticity.
