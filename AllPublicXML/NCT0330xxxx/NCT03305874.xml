  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Contrast agent is typically used during routine cardiac intervention in order to enhance the
      imaging necessary to perform the procedure. Using this contrast agent could lead to kidney
      injury, called contrast induced nephropathy (CIN). Currently, the methods used to reduce the
      risk of CIN include reducing the amount of contrast agent used and using a hydration strategy
      during procedure. A computer-based risk tool has been developed which reports a risk score
      for the likelihood a person undergoing cardiac intervention gets CIN and a proposed
      corresponding hydration strategy to reduce the risk of CIN. The purpose of this study is to
      determine whether the rate of CIN decreases when the treating physician has access to this
      risk tool during the procedure.

      This is a case-control series comparing a strategy using a computer-based contrast induced
      nephropathy (CBCIN) risk tool in patients undergoing PCI versus usual care. Only inpatients
      will be included in this study. These inpatients will be compared to historical controls
      obtained using the medical record of age- and gender-matched inpatients who underwent cardiac
      catheterization with at least two consecutive daily post-procedure creatinine values. The
      percentage PCI will be matched in the retrospective series.

      In the prospective group, the operator will be exposed to the CBCIN risk tool before and
      during care delivery with estimated CIN risk. The CBCIN risk tool estimates CIN risk based on
      the status of known risk factors (and suggests an associated standard hydration strategy
      based on left-ventricular end-diastolic pressure), which are automatically prepared from the
      patient's Electronic Medical Record and presented to the operator for review. This
      functionality has been evaluated in previous research and was found to be stable and
      reliable. Based on the data presented by and reviewed in the CBCIN risk tool, the operator
      may use the information and adjust therapy as clinically indicated (i.e. the risk tool is not
      the basis for clinical decisions). Following the PCI, serum creatinine will be measured as
      per treating physician, but those who undergo at least two consecutive daily serum creatinine
      measurements starting the day after the procedure will be included in the study. These
      patients will be called 6 months and 12 months post-procedure to determine mortality and
      re-hospitalization status.

    <description>Prospectively, inpatients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) will be consented, and the computer-based contrast induced nephropathy (CBCIN) risk score will be calculated and displayed to the operator, along with suggested standard CIN-avoidance strategies during the PCI. Following the PCI, serum creatinine will be measured as per treating physician, but those who undergo at least two consecutive daily serum creatinine measurements starting the day after the procedure will be included in the study. These patients will be called 6 months and 12 months post-procedure to determine mortality and re-hospitalization status.</description>

    <description>The computer-based contrast induced nephropathy (CBCIN) risk score and associated standard hydration strategy will be displayed on a monitor in front of the treating interventional cardiologist during the entirety of the PCI case. Since this scoring system and hydration strategy are both available in the peer-reviewed literature, clinical use of these data and implementation of a CIN-avoidance strategy is not experimental; however, the display of these data to interventional cardiologists is experimental. Based on exposure to these data, the treating interventional cardiologist may use the information as clinically appropriate (i.e. it is not the basis for clinical decisions).</description>

        A prospective patient may be considered for the study if they are referred to the
        University of Chicago Cardiac Catheterization Laboratory as an inpatient for either a
        planned PCI or a diagnostic angiogram with high likelihood for PCI. For the retrospective
        control series, subjects will be selected from the electronic medical record starting from
        the date of the study protocol submission backwards until January 1, 2010 if they meet
        inclusion and exclusion criteria.

        must have at least two consecutive daily creatinine measurements starting the day after the

             starting the day after the PCI.

          -  Patients undergoing emergency primary percutaneous coronary intervention for
             ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction.
