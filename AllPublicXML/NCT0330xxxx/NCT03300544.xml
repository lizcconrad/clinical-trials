      This phase I trial studies the best dose and side effects of talimogene laherparepvec in
      combination with capecitabine and chemoradiation before surgery in treating patients with
      rectal cancer that has spread from where it started to nearby tissue and lymph nodes. Drugs
      used in immunotherapy, such as talimogene laherparepvec, may stimulate the body's immune
      system to fight tumor cells. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as capecitabine, fluorouracil
      and oxaliplatin, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing
      the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Radiation
      therapy uses high-energy x-rays to kill tumor cells and shrink tumors. Giving talimogene
      laherparepvec, capecitabine, and chemoradiation before surgery may make the tumor smaller and
      reduce the amount of normal tissue that needs to be removed.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the dose limiting toxicities (DLTs) and maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of
      talimogene laherparepvec in combination with capecitabine and radiation in rectal cancer.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To establish safety and feasibility of the combination including complications from
      surgical resection II. To determine the neoadjuvant rectal (NAR) score of talimogene
      laherparepvec with chemotherapy and radiation.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To correlate genomic information including RAS, RAF mutation status with response, disease
      free survival (DFS) and/or overall survival (OS).

      II. To determine immunodulatory changes following talimogene laherparepvec, chemotherapy and
      radiation treatment including proportions of immune cell infiltrates in serially collected
      peripheral blood and/or frozen tumor samples (pre-, on treatment, and at post progression).

      III. To identify magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-based features including MRI
      circumferential margin (mrCRM) at baseline or post-therapy mrCRM, MRI tumor regression grade
      (mrTRG) to define determinants of response, DFS and OS.

      IV. To determine the disease free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) of talimogene
      laherparepvec with chemotherapy and radiation in patients undergoing curative resection.

      V. To determine the pathological complete response (pCR) rate of talimogene laherparepvec
      with chemotherapy and radiation.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of talimogene laherparepvec.

      Patients receive talimogene laherparepvec intralesionally via endoscopy on weeks 1, 2-4, and
      8-9. Patients receive capecitabine orally (PO) twice daily (BID), fluorouracil intravenously
      (IV) over 46 hours, oxaliplatin IV over 2 hours followed by radiation therapy for 28
      fractions on weeks 2-5 and 8-13. Patients undergo resection surgery on weeks 21-25.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 30 days and up to 5 years
      thereafter.
