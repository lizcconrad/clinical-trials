  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study was to pilot test the potential for improvement in antiretroviral
      medication adherence of a an adapted group-based, multi-session, community-based
      Antiretroviral Therapy (ART) adherence and risk reduction intervention, Project ADHerence
      Education and Risk Evaluation (ADHERE). Project ADHERE was compared to a single-session
      group-based medication adherence intervention, Medication Adherence and Care Engagement
      (MACE).

      A secondary aim was to examine the impact of Project ADHERE on HIV risk behaviors (i.e.,
      illicit drug use and unprotected sexual behavior).

      This study was designed to inform, design, and pilot test the two antiretroviral medication
      adherence interventions for HIV-infected formerly incarcerated individuals.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Formerly incarcerated Black drug offenders are at an elevated risk for HIV infection. Despite
      substantial research expressing the need for HIV prevention services for ex-offenders
      postrelease, this population has limited access to quality programming and services related
      to HIV risk reduction. This K01 application seeks to inform and adapt an HIV risk reduction
      intervention to address the needs of formerly incarcerated Black drug offenders who are being
      released from prisons in the New York City metropolitan area.The study will utilize
      qualitative and quantitative methods to inform and adapt an HIV prevention intervention for
      this study population.

    <description>This is a 3-session ART medication adherence and risk reduction intervention. Participants are educated about the importance of staying healthy and taking their medication as prescribed; to discuss importance of improved immune functioning and what their &quot;viral load&quot; means; reminded that they can still infect others with HIV, and that there currently is no cure for HIV; expected to generate strategies to overcome adherence barriers; educated about sexually transmitted infections (STI)/HIV transmission modes; assisted in devising an appropriate medication adherence and risk reduction plan. Participants will report their progress and discuss challenges experienced when implementing their medication adherence and risk reduction plans while establishing short- and long-term goals.</description>
