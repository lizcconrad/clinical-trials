    <textblock>
      The present study seeks to evaluate the clinical utility of repeated transcranial alternating
      current stimulation (tACS) by assessing long-term, lasting changes in oscillatory activity
      and subsequent changes in related behavioral processes of anxious arousal and sensory
      sensitivity. To date, only transient effects of tACS have been reported, lasting no longer
      than 30 to 70 minutes. In order to be truly impactful within a clinical setting, however,
      evidence for long-term effects of tACS is needed.

    <textblock>
      Recent years have witnessed increasing recognition of &quot;oscillopathies&quot;, neuropsychiatric
      disorders characterized by aberrations in the neural oscillations that orchestrate various
      mental activities. Transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) provides an effective
      way to directly modulate these oscillations in a non-invasive and frequency-specific manner,
      offering groundbreaking insights into the workings of the brain and, importantly, the
      development of novel treatments for these oscillopathies. However, evidence is lacking for
      the ability of tACS to induce long-term neural plasticity and lasting behavioral changes,
      which is critical for establishing the clinical utility of this novel intervention.

      Here, we are administering 30 minutes of alpha-frequency tACS over occipitoparietal sites for
      four consecutive days to evaluate both transient and long-term changes in alpha oscillatory
      power and long-range, directed oscillatory connectivity. As both anxious arousal and sensory
      sensitivity are highly related to alpha oscillations, as well as numerous neuropsychiatric
      disorders, changes in these behavioral outcomes were subsequently evaluated to assess
      clinically-relevant outcomes of the repeated tACS protocol.

    <description>Occipitoparietal alpha power and long-range, directed oscillatory connectivity within the alpha frequency will be assessed from 2 minutes of eyes-open, resting-state electroencephalogram (EEG) activity. Oscillatory power will be estimated using the multitaper spectral estimation technique, averaging over the alpha frequency bin of 8-12 Hz. Directed connectivity will be assessed using spectral Granger causality within the 8-12 Hz range. Specifically, long-range, posterior-frontal connectivity with be assessed.</description>

    <description>Self-report ratings of subjective units of anxious arousal are acquired using a visual analog scale, ranging from 0 (not at all anxiously aroused) to 100 (extremely anxiously aroused).</description>

    <description>Pleasantness ratings of neutral and negative olfactory and auditory stimuli are acquired on a visual analog scale, ranging from 0 (extremely unpleasant) to 100 (extremely pleasant). Auditory stimuli consist of a simple tone (neutral) and scream (negative) at three different intensities (quiet, medium, and loud), each presented once for 2 seconds through headphones. Olfactory stimuli consist of a neutral odor (acetophenone) and negative odor (burning rubber), diluted in mineral oil for three different intensities (weak, medium, strong). Approximately 3 mL of each odor are presented in 30 mL amber bottles, upon which participants are asked to take one steady sniff.</description>

    <description>Participants within the Active condition receive 30 minutes of alpha-frequency Transcranial Alternating Current Stimulation (tACS) stimulation for four consecutive days. Participants are stimulated at their baseline peak alpha frequency, or the frequency at which they exhibit maximal power within the 8 to 12 Hz range. Stimulation was administered over occipitoparietal sites, where tACS current models showed maximal effect over the dorsal extrastriate.</description>

    <description>Participants within the Sham condition receive 30 minutes of sham Transcranial Alternating Current Stimulation for four consecutive days, during which no current was passed. To control for awareness of the Sham stimulation, all Sham control participants receive a brief, 10 second pulse of random noise stimulation at the beginning and end of the 30 minutes.</description>

    <description>Transcranial Alternating Current Stimulation passes a weak, 2 mA sinusoidal current through the scalp to the cortex at a specified frequency. Previous evidence suggests this exogenous sinusoidal stimulation interacts with the endogenous, cortical sinusoidal oscillatory activity, resulting in modulations of cortical oscillations. The intervention is non-invasive and virtually painless with no lasting adverse side-effects.</description>
