  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Ketamine for Acute Pain in Burns study is a randomized, double-blind, parallel group
      trial (RCT) with active control (usual care) contrasting the efficacy and safety of &quot;Ketamine
      Plus Opiate-based usual care&quot; (O+K) with the safety and efficacy of the &quot;Current Standard of
      Care&quot;. THe current standard of care is an opiate medication alone, Fentanyl (Usual
      Care-Opiate (UC-O), dose/timing as per Burn Center protocol).

      Department of Defense (DoD) and the U.S. Army Medical Research and Materiel Command (USAMRMC)
      are funding this RCT for the following reasons:

      Primary Aims:

        1. To evaluate the safety and efficacy of fentanyl (usual care) + placebo versus fentanyl +
           ketamine (low-dose, sub-anesthetic, slow-infusion) during twice daily burn wound care
           across a 7-day study period and 30 day outcome period.

        2. To evaluate the opiate sparing effect of fentanyl (usual care) + placebo versus fentanyl
           + ketamine (low-dose, sub-anesthetic, slow-infusion) during the 7-day study period and
           30 day outcome period.

      and

      Secondary Aims:

        1. To determine the short and long term effect of the Ketamine Augmentation Condition
           versus the Usual Care Condition on symptoms and syndromes of posttraumatic stress
           disorder and of depression,

        2. To evaluate several established and hypothesized moderators of the relationship between
           the Ketamine Augmentation Condition versus the Usual Care Condition on: 1) pain severity
           reported during wound care, 2) opiate use during wound care, 3) posttraumatic stress and
           4) depression.

    <description>STUDY GROUP (USUAL CARE/FENTANYL PLUS KETAMINE - &quot;study drug&quot;)
i. Fentanyl Loading Dose = 1 mcg / kg (0.07 mg in a 70 kg individual). This is given to participants in both Groups 1&amp; 2 starting at initiation of wound care.
ii. Ketamine Loading Dose = 0.3 mg/kg (approx. 20 mg of ketamine in a 70 kg patient). Dose to be initiated 10 minutes prior to initiating wound care &amp; infused over 3 minutes.
iii. Ketamine Continuous Infusion = 2.5 mcg/kg/min (approximately 10 mg/hr in a 70 kg patient).
Will start immediately after completion of ketamine loading dose &amp; will continue throughout dressing change.
*FENTANYL PRN DOSE* = 1 mcg / kg. Provided to participants in both Groups 1 &amp; 2 when participant requires additional pain medication.</description>

    <description>USUAL CARE GROUP (USUAL CARE FENTANYL PLUS SALINE)
i . Fentanyl Loading Dose = 1 mcg / kg (0.07 mg in a 70 kg individual) This is given to participants in both Group 1 and Group 2 starting at initiation of wound care.
ii. Saline Loading Dose (Placebo, Infusion) = An identical volume of saline as that in 0.3 mg/kg of &quot;study drug&quot;. This will be initiated in the Usual Care group 10 minutes before the wound care is set to begin and infused over 3 minutes (i.e., during the same time that the &quot;study drug&quot; group receives with the &quot;study drug&quot; loading dose).
iii. Saline (Placebo, Infusion) = identical volume of fluid as that in 2.5 mcg/kg/min of ketamine, initiated immediately following the Saline Loading Dose and continued for the duration of the session.
*FENTANYL PRN DOSE* = 1 mcg / kg. Provided to participants in both Groups 1 &amp; 2 when participant requires additional pain medication.</description>
