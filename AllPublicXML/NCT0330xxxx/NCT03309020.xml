  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Objective: Zaire ebolavirus is a single-stranded RNA virus associated with high morbidity and
      mortality. The most recent epidemic of Ebola virus disease (EVD) in West Africa resulted in
      over 11,000 deaths and disabling sequelae among survivors, among which eye complications are
      highly represented. Chronic intraocular inflammation and viral persistence may result in
      posterior synechiae and cataract formation, resulting in loss of visual acuity and requiring
      surgical intervention to resolve. Approximately one out of ten Ebola survivors present with
      cataract, most of whom will require intraocular surgery during their lifetime, and many of
      whom require intervention in the near future to regain quality of life. For survivors who are
      blind from cataract, cataract extraction is necessary to restore visual function, allow
      reintegration into society and facilitate performance of activities of daily living.

      However, surgical parameters among Ebola survivors are unknown, including whether Ebola viral
      RNA persists in aqueous humor, whether additional anti-inflammatory medication is needed, and
      the expected degree of improvement in visual function. Moreover, sites of viral persistence
      are unknown, and it is unclear if lens tissues removed during cataract surgery may harbor
      virus in Ebola-affected eyes. We propose following EVD survivors and control subjects
      undergoing cataract surgery to determine visual outcomes among Ebola survivors and explore
      detection of the presence of virus in lens tissues. The data will inform both future surgical
      intervention and aid in the understanding of the pathophysiology of Ebola-associated eye
      disease.

      Study Population: Up to 60 Ebola survivors and up to 60 controls will be enrolled. The
      accrual ceiling is 120 participants.

      Design: This is a prospective, natural history study to evaluate the persistence of Ebola
      viral RNA in the eyes of Ebola survivors and assess the response to cataract surgery in
      survivors as compared to controls. EVD survivors will first undergo assessment of aqueous
      humor for the presence of viral RNA. Survivors testing negative for viral RNA and control
      subjects will undergo clinically indicated cataract surgery. Subjects will be evaluated 1
      day, 1 week, 1 month, 3 months, and 6 months after surgery for safety and visual outcome
      assessments, and more often as clinically indicated.

      Outcome Measures: The primary outcomes are: 1) the proportion of EVD survivors with evidence
      of persistence of Ebola viral RNA in ocular tissue and 2) the comparison of amount of
      intraocular inflammation, as measured by average grade of anterior chamber cell by SUN
      criteria, between EVD survivors and controls at 1 month and 3 months following cataract
      surgery. Secondary outcomes include: 1) the proportion of survivors with at least 20/40 best
      corrected visual acuity (BCVA) after cataract surgery, relative to controls; 2) significance
      of covariates, age and gender, in logistic regression assessment of viral persistence and
      cataract outcomes; 3) post-operative optical coherence tomography results in EVD survivors.

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:

        To be eligible, the following inclusion criteria must be met, where applicable.

          1. Participant must be 14 years of age or older.

          2. Participant must be able to understand and sign an informed consent or have a
             parent/legal guardian do so if they are minor children or a legally authorized
             representative to provide consent for adults without consent capacity.

          3. Participant must be either:

               -  an Ebola virus disease (EVD) seropositive survivor or seropositive control OR

               -  an EVD seronegative survivor or seronegative control (Serology confirmation is
                  available for PREVAIL participants and will be conducted for non-PREVAIL
                  participants.).

          4. Participant must have visually significant cataract(s) consistent with level of visual
             deficit.

          5. Participant must have corrected visual acuity worse than 20/40 in affected eye and
             vision loss believed to be primarily the result of the cataract.

          6. Any participant of childbearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test at
             screening and must be willing to undergo pregnancy testing prior to the cataract
             surgery.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

        A participant is not eligible if any of the following exclusion criteria are present.

          1. Concurrent life-threatening illness or other condition that compromises a participant
             s ability to safely undergo surgery, as determined by the surgical and medical team,
             including any condition that prevents the participant from lying down supine or
             remaining still, such as severe lung disease, or a known life-threatening, untreated
             or unstable cardiac or pulmonary condition.

          2. Active uveitis at time of surgery or within the past three months, if documented.

          3. Participant is pregnant, as surgery is elective and no adequate data regarding the use
             of postoperative topical antibiotic-steroid combination drops exists in pregnant
             women.

          4. Any condition that poses a risk to the participant having a safe surgical or
             post-operative experience, including known inability or unwillingness to follow up for
             the full duration of the protocol.
