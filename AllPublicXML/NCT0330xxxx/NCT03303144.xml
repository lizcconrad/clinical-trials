    <description>Triferic will be mixed with the liquid bicarbonate concentrate used in the preparation of the hemodialysate solution. This will result in a final Triferic iron concentration in the dialysate of 2 µM (110 µg/L). The patients will receive Triferic over 4 hrs at one hemodialysis session.</description>

    <criteria>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. The patient must be able to provide informed consent and have personally signed and
             dated the written informed consent document before completing any study-related
             procedures.

          2. The patient must be 18-80 years of age inclusive at the time of consent.

          3. The patient must have been undergoing chronic hemodialysis for chronic kidney disease
             for at least 3 months, and be expected to remain on hemodialysis and be able to
             complete the study.

          4. The patient must have a Screening ferritin level of ≥100µg/L.

          5. The patient must have a Screening transferrin saturation (TSAT) of 15-45%, inclusive.

          6. The patient must have a Screening hemoglobin (Hgb) concentration ≥9.0 g/dL.

          7. The patient must be undergoing hemodialysis at least 3x/week.

          8. The patient must have at least a minimally adequate measured dialysis dose defined as
             single-pool Kt/V (dialyzer clearance of urea multiplied by dialysis time, divided by
             patient's total body water) ≥1.2, or KIDt/V (online dialyzer clearance measured using
             ionic dialysance multiplied by dialysis time, divided by patient's total body water)
             ≥1.2 measured within the 90 days prior to HD #1.

          9. Patient is receiving, or can receive anticoagulation for dialysis by a single dose of
             unfractionated heparin or low molecular weight heparin pre-dialysis; or by
             intermittent IV heparin bolus.

         10. The patient's vascular access for dialysis that will be used during the study must
             have stable function in the judgment of the Investigator.

         11. The patient must agree to discontinue all iron preparations (oral and IV) for 14 days
             prior to the start of HD#1 and throughout the study.

         12. Female patients must not be pregnant or breastfeeding. They must have been amenorrheic
             for the past year or be surgically sterile or agree to not become pregnant by
             continuous use of an effective birth control method acceptable to the Investigator for
             the duration of their participation in the study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. The patient has had an RBC or whole blood transfusion within 4 weeks prior to
             Screening.

          2. The patient requires a continuous infusion of heparin during standard hemodialysis.

          3. The patient has had administration of IV or oral iron supplements (including
             multivitamins with iron or iron based phosphate binders) within 14 days prior to the
             start of HD #1. (The patient may subsequently become eligible if additional time
             elapses and all other eligibility criteria are met.).

          4. The patient has known active bleeding from any site other than AV fistula or graft
             (e.g., gastrointestinal, hemorrhoidal, nasal, pulmonary, etc.).

          5. The patient has a living kidney donor identified or living-donor kidney transplant
             scheduled to occur during study participation. (Note: Patients awaiting deceased-donor
             transplant need not be excluded.)

          6. The patient is scheduled to have a surgical procedure during the study.

          7. The patient has had a hospitalization within the 4 weeks prior to Screening (except
             for vascular access surgery) that, in the opinion of the Investigator, confers a
             significant risk of hospitalization during the course of the study.

          8. The patient has a history of noncompliance with the dialysis regimen in the opinion of
             the Investigator.

          9. The patient has a known ongoing active inflammatory disorder (other than CKD), such as
             systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis, or other collagen-vascular
             disease, that currently requires systemic anti-inflammatory or immunomodulatory
             therapy.
