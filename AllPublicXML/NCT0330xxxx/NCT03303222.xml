      Measure trimethylamine oxide in the breath.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Organic compounds such as trimethylamine oxide (TMAO) accumulate in the blood of patients
      with kidney disease, and volatile compounds such as TMAO can be detected in the breath.

      The investigators wish to develop a breath analyser to measure volatile compounds, such as
      TMAO in the breath in patients with kidney disease.
