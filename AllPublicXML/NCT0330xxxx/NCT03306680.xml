      This multi-centre phase I dose-escalation study will use a time-to-event continual
      reassessment method (TIT-CRM).

      Accrual will start at level 1 (60 Gy in 8 fractions). Patients will be assigned to treatment
      doses using the TITE-CRM model. The model will use all available information from previously
      accrued patients to assign the highest dose with a predicted risk of grade 3 toxicity of 30%
      or less.

    <textblock>
      This study will use a time-to-event continual reassessment method (TITE-CRM). The study
      design is based on RTOG 0813 (described above), but with a more cautious approach, since the
      patients herein may constitute a high-risk subset of the patients enrolled in RTOG 0813. The
      modifications include a starting dose (60 Gy in 8 fractions) herein that is lower than the
      safe dose for central tumors as determined by RTOG 0813 (60 Gy in 5 fractions), and longer
      follow-up period during which patients are considered at-risk for toxicity, (i.e. two years
      herein vs. one year in RTOG 0813).

      The primary endpoint of this study is the maximally tolerated dose (MTD) of radiotherapy for
      ultracentral tumors. The MTD is the dose of radiotherapy associated with a &lt;30% rate of grade
      3-5 toxicity occurring within 2 years of treatment.

      Local Progression, Regional nodal progression, Distant metastases, Progression-Free Survival,
      Overall survival, patient reported outcomes and quality of life.

      The correlative objectives of this study are to determine the prognostic value of ctDNA
      levels measured pre-treatment, at the end of treatment and 3- and 12-months after treatment.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Pathologically (histologically or cytologically) proven diagnosis of non-small cell
             lung cancer (NSCLC); if the risk of biopsy is unacceptable, pathologic confirmation is
             not required providing there is serial growth on serial (&gt;=2) CT imaging and/or FDG
             avidity that is strongly suggestive of a primary NSCLC.

          2. Stage T1-3, N0, M0 (UICC/AJCC Staging, 8th Ed.), tumor size &lt; 6 cm, prior to
             registration, based upon the following minimum diagnostic workup:

               1. History/physical examination within 4 weeks prior to registration

               2. CT scan with contrast (unless medically contraindicated) within 12 weeks of
                  registration. The CT scan will include the entirety of both lungs, the
                  mediastinum, liver and adrenal glands; the primary tumor dimensions will be
                  measured on CT. Note: Patients with lesions that cannot be visualized by CT scan
                  are not eligible for the study.

               3. Whole body positron emission tomography (PET) scan within 12 weeks of
                  registration, using FDG with adequate visualization of the primary tumor and
                  draining lymph node basins in the hilar and mediastinal regions.

               4. Mediastinal lymph node sampling by any technique is encouraged but not required.
                  Patients with hilar or mediastinal lymph nodes &lt;1 cm and no abnormal hilar or
                  mediastinal uptake on PET will be considered N0. Patients with &gt; 1 cm hilar or
                  mediastinal lymph nodes on CT or abnormal PET (including suspicious but
                  nondiagnostic uptake) may still be eligible if directed tissue biopsies of all
                  abnormally identified areas are negative for cancer.

          3. ECOG performance status 0-2;

          4. age &gt;18;

          5. Ultra-central tumor location: tumours whose planning target volume (PTV) is expected
             to touch or overlaps the central bronchial tree, esophagus, pulmonary vein, or
             pulmonary artery as determined at the time of consultation.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Prior invasive malignancy (except non-melanomatous skin cancer) unless disease free
             for a minimum of 2 years (e.g. carcinomas in situ of the breast, oral cavity, or
             cervix are permissible); previous lung cancer, if the patient is disease-free for a
             minimum of 2 years is permitted.

          2. Any prior thoracic radiotherapy.

          3. Any prior chemotherapy for the study cancer (cancer proposed to be treated on the
             study).

          4. Prior surgery for the study cancer.

          5. Plans for the patient to receive other local therapy (including standard fractionated
             radiotherapy and/or surgery) while on this study, except at disease progression;

          6. Plans for the patient to receive systemic therapy (including standard chemotherapy or
             biologic targeted agents), while on this study, except at disease progression.

          7. Pregnancy.

          8. The following autoimmune and connective tissue diseases will be excluded: Scleroderma
             and Systemic lupus erythematosus

          9. patients with interstitial lung disease (ILD).
