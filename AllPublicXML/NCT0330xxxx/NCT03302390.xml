  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to elucidate the role of Chemokine and chemokine receptor in the pathogenesis
      of Psoriasis by using human psoriasis skin xenograft SCID mouse model. The hypothesis is that
      chemokine and chemokine receptor play important roles in psoriasis and establishment of human
      skin xenograft mouse model provide excellent platform to test the hypothesis.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Chemokines belongs to a large group of small chemotactic proteins (8-11 kilodaltons in size).
      Upon engagement of chemokine, chemokine receptor can activate downstream intracellular
      signaling pathways and results in diverse cellular processing such as cytoskeleton
      reorganization and cell locomotion. Chemokines are chemoattractant factors and can stimulate
      directional migration of all classes of leukocytes such as T cells. Epidermal keratinocytes
      in the skin are able to express multiple chemokines that can attract certain leukocytes, such
      as T cells or dendritic cells (DCs), to migrate to the epidermis. Psoriasis is a type of skin
      inflammatory diseases that results in misregulated immune system including immune cell
      infiltration. Keratinocyte secreted chemokine and chemokine receptor on leukocytes have been
      known to involve in the pathogenesis of psoriasis. However, it is not very clear how
      chemokines are regulated in keratinocytes and the binding of chemokine to receptor on
      leukocytes controls the pathogenesis of psoriasis. To better understand the immune regulation
      of chemokine and chemokine receptor in the molecular mechanism and pathogenesis of psoriasis,
      the investigators plan to establish human psoriasis skin xenograft mouse model that involves
      graft of human skin onto immune deficient mice. The human skin, including lesional and
      non-lesional skins, has been proven to be acceptable to the SCID mice and the phenotype can
      maintain for a number of months. The advantage of the xenograft model is to that it can
      preserve the full complexity of human diseases and thus resembles the pathogenesis of human
      diseases. This model has also been shown with constant efficacy of anti-psoriasis drug in
      comparison with clinical practice. Thus, this mouse model has great value to help the
      investigators understand how chemokine and immune cells are regulated in psoriasis. Of
      particular note is that this model can be used to test therapeutic drug before introduce them
      into clinical trial.

    <description>The purpose of this human clinical trial is to harvest psoriatic skin for engraftment onto immunocompromised mice. The primary outcome measure is to identify a 0.75 x 0.75 square inch piece of skin with psoriasis on study subjects to be biopsied. specific outcome measure that will be obtained in the patients other than ensuring that their graft sites heal appropriately. Their skin, once placed on immunocompromised mice, will be used to test new therapeutic drugs which might have a beneficial outcome in psoriasis, as measured in this mouse model.</description>

    <description>The investigator will take about 0.5x0.5 inch square section of skin from the psoriasis lesion. To numb the skin, the subject will receive a small injection of 0.5% lidocaine HCl 5mg/mL with 1:200,000 mcg/mL epinephrine solution as per standard shave biopsy protocol. The shaving instrument has a blade that will shave off a superficial piece of skin that is less than &lt;3mm in thickness. After 14 days, the subject will return to make sure that the skin biopsy site has healed properly. The piece of skin that is removed will be grafted onto the back of an immunocompromised SCID mouse. An approved IACUC protocol covering this procedure will be in place prior to engraftment.</description>
