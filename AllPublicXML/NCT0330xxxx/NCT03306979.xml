  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a 24-week randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled parallel group design study
      involving Vascular cognitive impairment-no dementia (VCIND) patients to evaluate the efficacy
      and safety of oral NAC supplementation (2,400 mg daily) as an add-on therapy to improve
      cognitive function in patients undergoing cardiac rehabilitation (CR). The CR program
      consists of a harmonized aerobic and resistance training in a supervised group setting.
      Eligible patients will be randomized to receive NAC (four 600 mg capsules given as 2 capsules
      in the morning and 2 capsules in the evening) or matching placebo capsules. The initial NAC
      dosage will be 600mg/day (one 600mg capsule in the morning) for the first week, followed by
      1,200 mg/day (one 600 mg capsule in the morning, one 600mg capsule in the evening) for the
      second week, followed by 1,800 mg/day (two 600mg capsules in the morning, one 600mg capsule
      in the evening) for third week, followed by 2,400mg/day (two 600mg capsules in the morning,
      two 600mg capsules in the evening) for the following 21 weeks.
