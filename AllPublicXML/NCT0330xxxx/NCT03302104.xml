  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In our study, we used data from 4,758 healthy adults from the 1999-2002 National Health and
      Nutrition Examination Surveys to examine the associations between evidence-based diet quality
      indices and leukocyte telomere length. Our study assessed the four most widely recognized and
      commonly used diet quality indices in nutritional epidemiology: the USDA-developed Healthy
      Eating Index-2010, the Alternate Healthy Eating Index-2010, the Mediterranean Diet Score, and
      the DASH diet score. Analyses were adjusted for sociodemographic and health variables known
      to influence dietary intake and cellular aging.

        The study population was comprised of 4,758 healthy adults, aged 20 to 65 years, who had
        complete dietary and leukocyte telomere length (LTL) data measured in 1999-2002 National
        Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys (NHANES), without a prior diagnosis of major
        chronic disease (coronary heart disease, angina, myocardial infarction, stroke, diabetes,
        congestive heart failure, and cancer).
