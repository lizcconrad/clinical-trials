  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, single ascending oral dose and food
      effect study conducted at one study center in the United States. Safety and tolerability will
      be assessed throughout the study and serial blood samples and urine samples will be collected
      for the safety and pharmacokinetic assessment of SXC-2023.
