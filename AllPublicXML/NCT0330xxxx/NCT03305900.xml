  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Formate is an important metabolite, serving as a donor of one-carbon groups to the
      intracellular tetrahydrofolate pool. However, little is known of its circulating
      concentrations or of their determinants. This study seeks to define formate levels and their
      determinants in a young, healthy population.

      Serum formate will be measured in 1701 subjects from the Trinity Student Study. The subjects,
      males and females, aged 18 to 28 years, were enrolled at Trinity College, Dublin. Formate
      levels will be compared with other one-carbon metabolites, vitamin status, potential formate
      precursors, genetic polymorphisms, and lifestyle factors.
