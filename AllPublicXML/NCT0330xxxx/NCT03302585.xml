  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase II randomized double-blind placebo/standard of care trial to determine if
      rapidly inducing vitamin D sufficiency in patients with acute optic neuritis results in less
      damage/greater recovery at 12 months as measured by optical coherence tomography, visual
      evoked potentials, visual acuity and radiological measures. Our hypothesis, based on earlier
      observational studies, is that acute optic neuritis in the context of vitamin D sufficiency
      results in better visual outcomes compared to those that are not sufficient acutely,
      regardless of such interventions as steroid therapy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The present trial is based on the observation that vitamin D sufficiency appears to provide
      some degree of neuroprotection and/or repair in the context of an acute optic neuritis when
      followed over several months using optical coherence tomography measures. Based on these
      findings, this randomized double-blinded placebo/standard of care controlled trial has been
      designed to to see if rapidly inducing vitamin D sufficiency (defined in this trial as a
      serum 25(OH)D value =&gt; 80 nmol/L) results in relatively less reduction in neuroaxonal injury
      and/or improved recovery chronically (at month 12) versus those patients who do not achieve
      vitamin D sufficiency in the acute optic neuritis period. of Vitamin D. In this trial, 66
      patients in total will be randomized to either &quot;high-dose vitamin D induction&quot; treatment
      group or the &quot;placebo/followed by standard of care vitamin D&quot; group and followed over 12
      months.The primary measure of neuroaxonal integrity in this trial is optical coherence
      tomography outcomes including ganglion cell layer thickness, retinal nerve fiber layer
      thickness and macular volume. Other vision metrics and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
      measures will provide secondary outcome indicators of this as well.
