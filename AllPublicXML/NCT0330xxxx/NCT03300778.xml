  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will investigate the effects of aerobic exercise on mental states, cognition, and
      long-term outcomes in adolescents with subthreshold depressive and/or hypomanic syndromes and
      in non-clinical school children
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Subthreshold depressive and hypomanic symptoms are common in adolescents, increasing the risk
      of developping into depression or bipolar disorder. Preliminary evidence shows that aerobic
      exercise might have positive effects in enhancing cognition and improving clinical symptoms
      in non-clinical and preclinical population and patients with mood disorders. This randomized
      controlled trial will investigate short-term (3 months) effects of aerobic exercise on
      cognition and clinical symptoms as well as the long-term (18 months) effects on the clinical
      outcomes of high-risk states.
