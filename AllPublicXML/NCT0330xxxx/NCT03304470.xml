  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 2, 3-week, single-center, double-blind, randomized, two-arm, vehicle
      controlled study, with each individual receiving both active and vehicle treatment.
      Approximately 30 subjects with moderate atopic dermatitis will receive topically applied
      ATx201 CREAM 2% and matching vehicle once daily for 3 weeks (5 mg/cm2/day), without
      occlusion. ATx201 and vehicle will be applied on two separate target lesions of moderate
      atopic dermatitis (lesions of at least 3 × 3 cm, excluding the face, scalp, genitals, hands,
      and feet, ideally from the same anatomical location).

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  clinically confirmed diagnosis of active atopic dermatitis

          -  at least a 6-month history of atopic dermatitis and had no significant flares in
             atopic dermatitis for at least 4 weeks before screening

          -  ≥2 areas of atopic dermatitis (excluding face, scalp, genitals, hands, and feet) of at
             least 3 × 3 cm; with a lesional TSS of ≥5 at Day 1 for each treatment area

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  breastfeeding, pregnant, or is planning to become pregnant during the study.

          -  clinically infected atopic dermatitis

          -  Fitzpatrick's Skin Phototype ≥5

          -  Presence of any tattoos, scratches, open sores, excessive hair, or skin damages in the
             target lesion areas

          -  known to have immune deficiency or is immunocompromised.

             study.

          -  clinically significant medical condition or physical/laboratory/vital signs
             abnormality that would, in the opinion of the investigator, put the subject at undue
             risk or interfere with interpretation of study results.

          -  known history of chronic infectious disease (e.g., hepatitis B, hepatitis C, or
             infection with human immunodeficiency virus).

          -  used hydroxyzine or diphenhydramine within 1 week prior to Day 1.

          -  used dupilumab within 12 weeks prior to Day 1.

             tars, bleach, antimicrobials, medical devices, and bleach baths.

          -  used systemic treatments (other than biologics) that could affect atopic dermatitis
             less than 4 weeks prior to Day 1 (e.g., retinoids, calcineurin inhibitors,
             methotrexate, cyclosporine, hydroxycarbamide [hydroxyurea], azathioprine,
             oral/injectable corticosteroids).

          -  received any marketed or investigational biological agent within 12 weeks or 5
             half-lives (whichever is longer) prior to Day 1.

          -  excessive sun exposure, is planning a trip to a sunny climate, has received

          -  taking anticoagulant medication, such as heparin, low molecular weight-heparin,
             warfarin, or antiplatelets (nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and aspirin ≤81 mg
             will not be considered antiplatelets) within 2 weeks prior to Day 1, or has a
             contraindication to skin biopsies.
