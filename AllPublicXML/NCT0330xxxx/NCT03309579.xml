  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The SAHaRA trial will clarify the role of treating anemia with Red Blood Cell (RBC)
      transfusion in a unique and vulnerable patient population, and determine whether that impacts
      on functional outcomes and mortality. It will guide best practice standards and clarify the
      optimal RBC transfusion strategy in patients with aSAH.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      We hypothesize that in adult patients suffering from aSAH and anemia, a liberal RBC
      transfusion strategy as compared to a restrictive RBC transfusion strategy decreases the
      combined rate of death and severe disability at 12 months (using the modified Rankin Scale)

    <measure>Modified Rankin Scale (mRS)</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months post</time_frame>
    <description>The Modified Rankin Scale (mRS) is a functional outcome measure in stroke. The interview consists of five sections: Constant Care, Assistance to Attend to Bodily Needs/For Walking, Assistance to Look After Own Affairs, Usual Duties and Activities and Symptoms as a Result of Stroke.
The scale is scored from 0 reporting no symptoms at all, to 5 reporting severe disability. Death is indicated by a score of 6.</description>

    <measure>Functional Independence Measure (FIM)</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months post</time_frame>
    <description>The Functional Independence Measure (FIM) assesses the level of a patient's disability considering the amount of support needed to care for them.Items are scored on the basis of how much assistance is required for the individual to carry out activities of daily living.
The FIM is comprised of 18 items, grouped into 2 subscales - motor and cognition.
Each item is scored on a 7 point ordinal scale, ranging from 1 to 7. The 2 subscales are then added to give a total FIM score between 18 and 126. The higher the score, the more independent the patient is in performing activities of daily living.</description>

    <measure>EuroQOL Quality of Life Scale (EQ5D)</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months post</time_frame>
    <description>The EQ-5D measures generic health status. There are 5 dimensions: Mobility, Self-care, Usual Activities, Pain/Discomfort and Anxiety/Depression which are answered by 5 Problem Levels: None, Slight, Moderate, Severe and Unable. The result is a 5 digit number, 11111 indicating no problem in any dimension to 55555 indicating unable to complete in all dimensions.
Quality of life is also assessed on a visual analog scale reported from 0 being the worst imaginable health status to 100 as the best imaginable health status.</description>
