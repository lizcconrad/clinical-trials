        Inclusion Criteria:Eligible patients are those who present to an ED for treatment of acute
        abdominal pain. Acute will be defined as pain for no more than seven days. At the time of

        Exclusion Criteria: Patients will be excluded from participation if they have cardiac
        conduction system impairment (QTc duration &gt; 0.5s, QRS duration &gt; 0.12s, or PR interval
        duration &gt; 0.2s), known renal (CKD &gt;2) or liver disease (Childs-Pugh B or greater), are
        hemodynamically unstable, as determined by the attending physician, are pregnant or
        breastfeeding, or have a known allergy to either medication. Patients will also be excluded
        if they have used prescription or illicit opioids within the previous week, or if they have
        a chronic pain disorder, defined as use of any analgesic medication on more days than not
        during the month preceding the acute episode of pain. Patients weighing &lt; 60kg or &gt; 120kg
