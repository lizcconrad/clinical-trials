  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cystectomy with urinary diversion (ileal conduit, orthotopic ileal bladder substitute,
      continent catheterizable pouch) is the best treatment option for patients with
      muscle-invasive bladder cancer. This intervention is one of the most challenging in urology
      and has a high rate of postoperative complications including around 30% of postoperative
      infections.

      Perioperative antibiotic prophylaxis (PAP) is widely accepted as a crucial preventive measure
      to reduce the incidence of surgical site infections (SSI). The rationale for PAP is the
      reduction of the local bacterial load at the site and time of intervention, and therefore a
      short duration of PAP of 24 to maximal 48 hours is recommended for all clean to
      clean-contaminated procedures..

      Evidence supporting the optimal duration of PAP for radical cystectomy with urinary diversion
      is lacking. Based on data extrapolated from abdominal surgery, current guidelines recommend
      short-term PAP (â‰¤24h) for all clean-contaminated procedures including radical cystectomy.

      However, a recent evaluation revealed a significant inter-hospital variability of PAP and
      showed that extended use (&gt;48h) was common in patients undergoing radical cystectomy.
      Importantly, this study also demonstrated that longer duration of PAP incurred higher costs
      and was associated with an increased rate of C. difficile colitis. A small, prospective,
      non-randomized study showed equal efficacy of short-term PAP in preventing postoperative
      infections in patients undergoing radical cystectomy with ileum conduit compared to extended
      PAP. Nonetheless, larger randomized clinical trials supporting these findings are lacking.

      The unwarranted extended use of antibiotics is a major concern as exposure to antibiotics is
      a driving force for the development of (multi-) resistant bacteria and will lead to an
      increasing number of difficult-to-treat infections. This has been recognized on both national
      and international levels and is addressed within antimicrobial stewardship frameworks.

      This study will compare current practice (&gt;48h PAP, &quot;extended PAP&quot;) with the guideline
      recommended approach (24h PAP, &quot;short term PAP&quot;) in a single-centre, prospective, randomised
      clinical non-inferiority trial. The primary outcome is the rate of SSI within 90 days post
      surgery. The aim of the study is to generate currently lacking evidence allowing for an
      optimised PAP strategy in a challenging surgical setting.
