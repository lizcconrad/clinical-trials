  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purposes of this study are to assess the safety, tolerability of combining Hemay022 with
      exemestane in the treatment of ER and HER2-positive metastatic or advanced breast cancer, and
      to establish OTR( Optimal Tolerated Regimen). The secondary purpose of this study is to
      assess the pharmacokinetics and efficacy of combining Hemay022 with exemestane.

      The study will be conducted in two parts. Part one, trial will be conducted in 15-24 subjects
      to determine safety and tolerability of combining Hemay022 with exemestane in patients with
      HER2-positive advanced breast cancer. Part two, approximately 24 additional subjects with ER
      and HER2-positive advanced breast cancer, are included to better define the tolerability and
      preliminary efficacy of Hemay022.
