  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Stroke survivors demonstrate high levels of sedentary behavior, placing them at risk for
      exacerbation of chronic health conditions. This may lead to recurrent stroke. Subtle
      cognitive impairments are common after stroke and can lead to difficulty self-monitoring and
      problem solving to overcome barriers to physical activity. Investigators developed the
      Activating Behavior for Lasting Engagement (ABLE) intervention to promote activity
      scheduling, self-monitoring, and problem solving activity over the full day. This study
      examines the effects of the ABLE intervention on sedentary behavior after stroke.
