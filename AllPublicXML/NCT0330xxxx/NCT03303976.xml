    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Male or female between 60 and 70 (inclusive) years of age at the time of vaccination.

          -  Subject who is willing and able to comply with the requirements of the protocol (e.g.
             completion of the diary cards, return for follow-up visits).

          -  Signed informed consent obtained from the subject.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Health condition that, in the opinion of the investigator, may interfere with optimal
             participation in the study or place the volunteer at increased risk of adverse events
             (AEs). Study clinicians, in consultation with the principal investigator, will use
             clinical judgment on a case-by-case basis to assess safety risks under this criterion.
             The PI will consult with the medical monitor as appropriate. • Clinically significant

             disease or cardiac insufficiency, uncontrolled hypertension, clinically significant
             history of myocardial infarction, atrial fibrillation, uncontrolled or clinically

             immunoglobulins within the 3 months preceding the injection, or is scheduled to
             receive them within 30 days after vaccination.

          -  Use of any investigational or non-registered product (drug or vaccine) other than the
             study vaccine(s) within 3 months preceding the administration of study vaccine, or
             planned use during the study period.

          -  BMI (Body Mass Index) &lt;19 or ≥35.
