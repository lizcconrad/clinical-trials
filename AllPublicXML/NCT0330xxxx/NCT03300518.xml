    <textblock>
      The purpose of study is to assess the efficacy of add-on estrogen pretreatment in GnRH
      antagonist protocol on oocyte retrieval as compared with GnRH antagonist protocol for
      patients with poor ovarian response Add-on estrogen pretreatment protocol is superior to none
      pretreatment GnRH antagonist protocol for the number of oocytes retrieval

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Women of advanced maternal age seeking ART treatment are characterized as poor ovarian
      responders in the process of ovarian simulation. Poor response to ovarian stimulation causes
      high cycle cancellation rate and extremely low pregnancy rate.

      More attention has been paid to the potential interest of steroid pretreatments in GnRH
      antagonist cycles; not only for scheduling the GnRH antagonist cycles, but also for
      synchronizing the follicular growth which may result in more oocytes retrieved. But available
      clinical results are controversial.

      Previous studies have shown that utilizing the natural negative feedback of the
      hypothalamus-pituitary-ovary axis induced by estradiol valerate pretreatment effectively
      prevented inter-cycle increases in follicle-stimulating hormone, improved follicle
      synchronization, and resulted in a more coordinated follicular development, leading to the
      recovery of more mature oocytes. However none of the randomized controlled studies compared
      estradiol valerate pretreatment or not on treatment outcomes, ongoing pregnancy rate,
      directly on poor response patients using estradiol valerate pretreatment in GnRH antagonist
      protocol.

    <description>the pretreatment group underwent a modified treatment protocol with pretreatment with estogen administering during the cycle preceding the IVF/ICSI cycle. daily dose of 4 mg (2 mg twice a day) estradiol valerate was given orally in the middle luteal phase which is confirmed seven days after ovulation monitoring by the ultrasound up to 2 days of the next menstrual cycle.Recombinant FSH (Puregon) was initiated on menstrual cycle day 2- 3 at an initial dose of 300 IU/day.A daily administration of ganirelix (0.25 mg Orgalutran; Organon) was introduced when the leading follicle is near 13mm, and was repeated up to the time of hCG administration.Ovulation was triggered when the leading follicles reach 18-20mm and at least two follicles 17-18mm , HCG 10000 IU is used to trigger.</description>
