    <measure>Change in transition readiness score, as measured by transition readiness survey</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The transition readiness survey is used to measure a participant's self-reported knowledge about their health and readiness to take charge of their healthcare. Each item is scored from 1 to 5, where 1 means &quot;No, I do not know how&quot; and 5 means &quot;Yes, I always do this when I need to.&quot; The overall score is determined by calculating the sum of all questions on a 100 point scale. A higher score indicates greater readiness for transition.</description>
