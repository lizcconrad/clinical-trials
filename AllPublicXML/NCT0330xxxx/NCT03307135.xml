  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Spasticity is a disorder of the muscular tonus that occurs in disease including the upper
      motor neuron (strokes, spinal cord injuries, multiple sclerosis, traumatic brain injuries or
      cerebral palsies). It begins few hours after the neural aggression and last until the grave.

      The most accepted definition refers to a velocity-dependent increase in stretch reflexes
      elicited by passive stretch (Lance definition) but new approaches prefers to distinguish
      neural (reflex) and non-neural (soft tissues alterations) components of the increase
      resistance to a passive stretch. This deficiency is a major cause of complications as walking
      impairment, pain or bone deformities and may require intensive therapies (intrathecal
      baclofen infusion, intramuscular toxin botulinium injection, surgery, etc). Despite its high
      frequency and the potential complications, only clinical scales (modified Ashworth scale and
      modified Tardieu scale essentially) with criticized metrological properties are available for
      daily assessment. The SPASM Consortium has published on 2005 recommendations for developing
      devices using both mechanical and electrophysiological parameters. The principle challenge
      was to ally parameters accuracy and utilization facility allowing quickly evaluation to the
      patient's bed. Few research team works on this topic but mostly on specific population and
      nowadays, no device has really crossed the door of laboratories.

      This kind of tool would help us to improve the quality of the follow-up and to guide us
      between the choices of specific therapies.

      The MSPMI has been created following these recommendations in the University of Technology of
      Compiègne, thanks to the collaboration between researchers of the UMR 7338 CNRS and a brain
      surgeon of the Nantes University Hospital. The patent was obtained on 2012. This device
      allows the assessment of the ankle plantar extensor (triceps surae) during a manually applied
      stretch movement. This muscle was selected as it is frequently involved and treated for
      spasticity.

      This study aims to evaluate the metrological properties of the MSPMI (reliabilities,
      responsiveness, known group validity, construct validity, measurement errors and internal
      consistency) among a large cohort of patients with no restriction of etiologies recruited in
      the Nantes University Hospital.

      Evaluation will include medical histories and specific information about spasticity
      management and consequences. The patient will be assessed by two evaluators with the MSPMI
      installed on the foot and the shank. MSPMI allows the record of angular movement of the ankle
      (position, speed and acceleration), of biomechanics (stiffness, torque, work and power) and
      electromyography (root mean squared and integrated electromyography signals) of two chiefs of
      the triceps surae (medial gastrocnemius and soleus). Electromyography data will be recorded
      on a maximum voluntary contraction when the deficiency will permit it. After that, data will
      be recorded at 3 velocities (with respect to the clinical scale recommendations) on two
      different positions (knee flexed and extended), according to our clinical practice. The
      evaluation on day 0 will allow the assessment of inter-rater intra-session reproductibility,
      internal consistency, construct validity, measurement error and known group validity. If the
      patient is hospitalized, he will be included on the &quot;hospitalization group&quot; and a second
      evaluation following the same protocol will be done 7 days later (assessment of inter and
      intra-rater inter-session reproductibility). If a specific therapy (selective tibial
      neurotomy, anesthetic block or botulinum toxin intramuscular injection) is proposed, the
      patient will be included on the &quot;treatment group&quot; and a new evaluation will be done after the
      therapy (30 minutes - 2 hours after an anesthetic block, 2-3 months after neurotomy or
      botulinium toxin injection) allowing assessment of the responsiveness of the MSPMI. If the
      patient is not on these two situations, he will be included on the &quot;simple evaluation group&quot;
      and his participation will end.
