  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Around 75% of breast cancers are defined and driven by Oestrogen receptor alpha (ERα)
      transcriptional activity. Standard treatment is endocrine therapy however clinical outcomes
      vary considerably, and a proportion of women with early breast cancer driven by ERα
      transcriptional activity develop drug resistance, and relapse with incurable, metastatic
      disease.

      Historically, PR-positivity was viewed as just a passive consequence of a functional
      oestrogen receptor, and PR was established as a biomarker of ER functionality in breast
      cancer. However, recent preclinical discoveries have provided an alternative explanation to
      the previous over-simplistic assumption, providing new insights into progestogen action and
      functional 'cross-talk' between ER and PR in breast cancer. In the presence of agonist
      ligands, progesterone-activated PR causes rapid sequestration of ERa chromatin binding sites
      in breast cancer cells, resulting in a unique gene expression program that is associated with
      a good clinical outcomes. This highlights a potential therapeutic opportunity.

      The PIONEER trial will investigate the effect of combining megestrol acetate (a progesterone
      receptor agonist) and letrozole (an aromatase inhibitor) in post menopausal women with early
      breast cancer. This is a 'window of opportunity' study treating and observing patients in the
      two weeks prior to definitive surgery. Patients are randomised into one of three arms; one in
      which the patients receive Letrozole alone; one in which they will receive a combination of
      Letrozole and low dose Megestrol acetate and the third arm will receive Letrozole and high
      dose Megestrol acetate. This trial will be open to postmenopausal women with newly diagnosed,
      untreated ER-positive, HER2-negative, invasive primary breast cancer.

    <description>Tumour-cell Ki67 antigen labeling index will be recorded following the recommendations from the International Ki67 working group. Ki67 will be scored as the percentage of tumour nuclei staining. The investigators analyzing Ki67 will be blinded as to treatment allocation.

    <description>ChIP-seq allows mapping of the genomic location of transcription factor binding and histone modifications.
