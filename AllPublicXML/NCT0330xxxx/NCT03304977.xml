  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Oral antigoagulant are used more than 60 years in thrombotic diseases. Even they are
      indispensable, the haemorragic risk is high.That's why it's the main reason of
      hospitalization for iatrogeny.The complication's reasons are mainly linked to errors of drug
      intake, drugs interaction and the lack of understanding the treatment.Moreover, the
      antiplatelet agglutening treatment is frequently added to anticoagulant treatment.This
      increases the haemorragic risk.Different means were used to minimize the risk , like INR
      follow up.

      The purpose of the study is to evaluate smartphone use to follow the patients'treatment.
