  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study examines the application of expanded natural killer cells (NK cells) following
      haploidentical allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (haplo-HSCT) for AML or
      MDS. Haplo-HSCT is a preferred treatment option for patients with AML or MDS without a
      HLA-matched donor. With administration of cyclophosphamide post-transplant , the safety of
      the procedure is similar to a HSCT from a HLA-identical donor. Relapse of AML/MDS represents
      a serious problem following haplo-HSCT. NK cells are immune cells able to destroy tumor
      cells. Their potency has been established particularly in the setting of a haplo-HSCT. In the
      current study, study participants undergoing haplo-HSCT will receive expanded NK cells from
      their respective stem-cell donors following haplo-HSCT. The primary goal of the study is to
      establish the safety and feasibility of this approach. In addition, the activity of the NK
      cells will be examined.
