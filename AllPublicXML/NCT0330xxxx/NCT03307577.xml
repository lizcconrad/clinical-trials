  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      UHE-101 cream, 1% (&quot;UHE-101&quot;) is being developed for the topical treatment of acne vulgaris.
      The purpose of this study is to compare the safety and efficacy of twice daily topical
      application of UHE-101 cream for 12 weeks to its vehicle cream in subjects with facial acne
      vulgaris.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test a topical cream (UHE-101) containing 1.0% of active
      drug, for 12 weeks, in boys and girls, men and women, in the treatment of facial acne.

      Patients who qualify for this study will apply the study cream twice daily (once in the
      morning and once in the evening) for 12 weeks.

      Half of the patients in this study will receive UHE-101 cream and half will receive a vehicle
      cream that does not include an active drug (i.e., placebo). This is a double-blind study,
      which means that neither the patient nor the investigator will know which cream the patient
      is using. The study will last about 12 weeks and will involve 5 clinic visits.
