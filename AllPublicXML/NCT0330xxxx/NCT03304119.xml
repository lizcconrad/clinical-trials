  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patellar instability (recurrent patellar dislocation) can occur at any age. It is most often
      seen in young subjects, especially among adolescents. It is commonly accompanied by
      anatomical factors. A new factor not described in bibliographic sources and characterized by
      an external toggle of the tibial tuberosity is frequently found in patients with patellar
      instability thanks to MRIs. This does not seem to be the case when there is no patellar
      pathology. A statistical study is needed to assess this rotary anomaly. Validate the
      predictive benefits when measuring the torsion of tibial tuberosity in cases with recurrent
      patellar dislocation.

    <textblock>
      Patellar instability (recurrent patellar dislocation) can occur at any age. It is most often
      seen in young subjects, especially among adolescents. It is commonly accompanied by
      anatomical factors known to be driving: Dysplasia of the trochlea, patella alta,
      lateralisation of the tibial tuberosity, patellar torsion and misalignment, tearing of the
      medial femoro-patellar ligament... The assessment of these factors is essential to evaluate
      the instability and guide the procedures of the surgical treatment. MRIs have become an
      important test for the analysis and measurement of these factors. A new factor not described
      in bibliographic sources and characterized by an external toggle of the tibial tuberosity is
      frequently found in patients with patellar instability thanks to MRIs. This does not seem to
      be the case when there is no patellar pathology. A statistical study is needed to assess this
      rotary anomaly. It will be necessary to take it into account in the future regarding
      indications and techniques for tibial tuberosity osteotomies, often used to correct patellar
      instability.
