  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Fabry disease (FD) is a genetic disorder that leads to progressive accumulation of fat or
      'sphingolipid' within the tissues, including the heart muscle and conductive tissue.
      Improvements in the detection of FD, together with more organised clinical services for rare
      diseases, has led to a rapid growth in the disease prevalence. Earlier and more frequent
      diagnosis of asymptomatic individuals before development of the disease itself has focused
      attention on early detection of organ involvement and closer monitoring of disease
      progression. Moreover, the introduction of enzyme replacement therapy within the last two
      decades has changed the natural history of FD as follows: a) increased life expectancy; b)
      improved morbidity; c) modification of the main cause of morbidity and mortality from renal
      (kidney) to cardiovascular (heart) events, including heart failure, abnormal heart rhythms,
      stroke and sudden death. Although symptoms such as palpitations and blackouts are extremely
      common, information on the frequency of proven abnormal heart rhythms is limited. In
      addition, the rate and appropriateness of implantation of life-saving devices is very
      variable, including pacemakers to boost the heart when too slow and cardio-defibrillators
      that stop the heart when too fast. The main markers of risk in similar diseases such as
      hypertrophic cardiomyopathy cannot be used in FD. While patients are routinely followed up in
      clinic with heart tracings and echocardiography (ultrasound of the heart), a recent small
      study has emphasised that these tests under-estimate the burden of abnormal heart rhythms in
      patients with advanced FD. The use of continuous heart monitoring with an implantable loop
      recorder (ILR) has led to a significant change in treatment in 13 out of 15 of FD patients.
      The investigators believe that more frequent use of ILRs will identify a greater need for
      change in therapy in many more patients than currently treated, with the aim of reducing
      morbidity and mortality in this patient cohort. In addition this will provide valuable data
      to inform an estimate of future risk for these patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a 3-year open-label multicentre randomised controlled trial assessing arrhythmia
      burden in patients with Fabry cardiac disease. This is an observational study, but with
      implantable loop recorder (ILR) insertion at recruitment and removal at end of trial for the
      intervention arm.

      Null hypothesis: There will be no difference in the identification of arrhythmia between
      patients following standard care compared to patients following standard care but with the
      addition of ILR monitoring.

      Beyond the proposed hypothesis, data collected will be used to inform whether ILR in FD will:

        1. Reveal a high burden of unrecognised arrhythmia

        2. Lead to frequent treatment modification (anti-coagulation, pacemaker and ICD
           implantation, ablation)

        3. Enable the development of FD specific risk prediction algorithms

        4. Identify predictive power of new (Troponin, BNP, lysoGB3, T1 and T2 mapping) and
           traditional biomarkers

    <description>An implantable loop recorder (ILR), also known as an insertable cardiac monitor, is a small device (smaller than a AAA battery) that is inserted under the skin on the front of the chest. The ILR is inserted using local anesthetic as an out-patient procedure and lasts approximately 30 minutes. The ILR captures a continuous ECG of your heart activity, which allows doctors to detect any abnormal heart rhythms at any point. If you have the ILR, you will have the device for 3 years, after which it will be removed under local anesthetic during an out-patient procedure, again lasting approximately 30 minutes. The ILR device is completely safe and shouldn't affect your day to day living.</description>
