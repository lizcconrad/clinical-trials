  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Prospective, randomised, controlled, single-surgeon, single-center clinical study to compare
      the clinical outcomes of two trifocal IOLs with different material (hydrophobic and
      hydrophilic) from the same manufacturer. Implantation of the IOLs is bilaterally.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, randomised, controlled, single-surgeon, single-center clinical study
      whereby patients undergoing routine cataract surgery will have bilateral implantation of
      trifocal intraocular lenses. The patients will either be implanted with the hydrophobic IOL
      FineVision POD F GF or the hydrophilic IOL FineVision POD F (both lenses: (PhysIOL, Li√®ge,
      Belgium).

      The devices under investigation (FineVision POD F GF and POD F) are trifocal glistening-free
      acrylic intraocular lenses (IOLs) manufactured by the sponsor of this study PhysIOL sa/nv.
      The main difference between the lenses is the material (hydrophobic and hydrophilic). The
      IOLs will be implanted as part of the routine cataract surgery on patients suffering from
      cataract development.

      Subjects participating in the trial will attend a total of 9 study visits (1 preoperative, 2
      operative and 6 postoperative) over a period of 3 months. Subjects would have the option for
      unscheduled visits if required medically.

      Primary and secondary endpoint data will be collected at the 3 months follow up visit. Data
      analyses will be done after the last patient finished the final examination to support the
      study publication plan.
