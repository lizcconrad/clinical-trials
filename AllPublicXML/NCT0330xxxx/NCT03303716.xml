  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A registry focused on the natural history, management and treatment of patients with
      Bohring-Opitz Syndrome (ASXL1), Shashi-Pena Syndrome(ASXL2) and Bainbridge-Ropers Syndrome
      (ASXL3).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Study participants will be asked to complete a series of brief surveys over time about their
      medical condition. The researchers will also attain primary medical records.The registry is
      run by clinical geneticists at Cincinnati Children's and Boston Children's Hospitals in a
      partnership with the Bohring-Opitz Syndrome (BOS) Foundation. The BOS Foundation is a
      non-profit organization run by families of patients with BOS that is focused on supporting
      research. The data is co-managed by the researchers and the Foundation. Aggregate data from
      the Registry will be shared with the participants as well as used for publication. The
      Registry is HIPPA compliant and follows all the IRB requirements regarding securing and
      managing patient data.
