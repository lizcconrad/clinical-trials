  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Gestational diabetes (GDM) is the most common hormonal complication during pregnancy. Its
      occurrence implies an increased risk of maternal and fetal complications and, therefore, its
      diagnosis and treatment are extremely important. Since the adoption of the new diagnostic
      criteria proposed by the International Association of Diabetes and Pregnancy Study Groups
      (IADPSG) in 2010, an increasing number of cases of mild hyperglycemia have demanded follow-up
      and treatment. The need and benefit of treatment in these cases of mild hyperglycemia has
      been discussed worldwide. Women who have been diagnosed with GDM are at increased risk for
      type 2 DM in the years following gestation. Other factors (such as lipid profile, obesity,
      adipokine dosage) may also be related to the repercussions of GDM on the maternal-fetal
      binomial, since gestations with satisfactory glycemic control can also present complications
      related to the disease and increased risk of type 2 DM in the long term. The present study
      aims to investigate factors associated with the need for insulin use, the occurrence of
      perinatal complications, nutritional status, physical activity and weight retention one year
      after delivery and the postpartum diagnosis of type 2 DM 10 years after delivery in women
      diagnosed with GDM according to the current criteria suggested by the IADPSG.
