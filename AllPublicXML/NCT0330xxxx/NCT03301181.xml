      Phase 1 study in healthy subjects to determine the effect of rifampin (Part A) or
      itraconazole (Part B) on the pharmacokinetics of BGB-3111

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1 open-label, parallel-group study in healthy subjects. Subjects in Part A
      will receive a single dose of BGB-3111 before and during consecutive daily doses of strong
      cytochrome P450 CYP3A inducer, rifampin, to investigate its effect on the pharmacokinetics of
      BGB-3111. Following an interim data analysis, subjects in Part B will receive a single dose
      of BGB-3111 before and during consecutive daily doses of strong CYP3A inhibitor,
      itraconazole, to investigate its effect on the pharmacokinetics of BGB-3111.
