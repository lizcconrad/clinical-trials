    <textblock>
      PRECISE is a study to discover new detection, prognosis and treatment biomarkers for cancer.
      This is a prospective, multi-center, observational study designed to collect de-identified
      biospecimens and clinical data from a large cohort of participants from clinical research
      networks in the United States. In this study, the investigators propose creating a
      large-scale normalized panomics dataset specifically designed for deep learning-based in
      silico analysis for biomarker discovery.

      This study will enroll all subjects who are eligible and willing to participate with a goal
      of enrolling at least 10,000 in several categories: (i) Patients with Family History of
      Cancer, (ii) Patients with Clinical and Environmental Risk Factors for Cancer, and (iii)
      Patients with a Suspected or Confirmed Diagnosis of Cancer.
