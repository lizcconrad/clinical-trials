    <textblock>
      The present study included 57 patients ≥18 years who met diagnostic criteria for PE including
      intravaginal ejaculatory latency time (IELT) of ≤2 minutes and had a Premature Ejaculation
      Diagnostic Tool (PEDT) score ≥11.

      Subjects were randomized to an experimental group that used the device with exercise
      programme (n=18) a first control group that only used the exercise programme (n=17) and a
      wait-list control group (n=22).

      As a main outcome measure used stopwatch-measured average IELT, Premature Ejaculation Profile
      (PEP), and the Golombok-Rust Inventory of Sexual Satisfaction (GRISS).

    <description>A first line treatment for the PE of a new 7 weeks exercise programme to control male orgasm using a masturbation aid device in a variation of the classical stop-start technique first introduced by Semans in 1956.
Four exercise:
Exercise of Masturbation that intends to raise awareness of the ejaculatory response and identify the tension on the muscles of the genital area .
Star and Stop to identify the tension and try to reduce this tension, on the pelvic floor muscles pay special attention to the anal sphincter.
Delay the ejaculatory response on four different occasions, by loosening the tension in the genital area and relaxing the anal sphincter not stop masturbating
Practice the ability to delay ejaculation as in previous exercises, but this time performing hip movements similar to penetration not stop masturbating</description>
