  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The incidence of postpartum depression in Europe and the United States is about 10%, while in
      China the incidence rate of 15.7-39.8%. Postpartum depression is one of the most common
      diseases of perinatal distress, but the current research of high-quality prevention and
      treatment of postpartum depression is still very lack. The study suggests that the risk of
      postpartum depression in cesarean delivery is significantly higher than that in vaginal
      delivery. Therefore, postpartum depression in cesarean delivery may require more attention
      and treatment.Tramadol is a non-opioid central analgesic that relieves common to severe pain,
      and tramadol has an inhibitory effect on norepinephrine and serotonin systems and has the
      potential to reduce depression and anxiety. Therefore, for the analgesic demand and
      antidepressant demand for maternal who undergoing cesarean section, tramadol may be an
      optimized and effective analgesic for the prevention and treatment of postpartum depression.

      This study was designed according to a prospective, randomized, controlled clinical trial.
      Randomized subjects were randomly assigned to different analgesic drug-treated groups
      according to the random number induced by SPSS software. All three analgesic treatments were
      routinely used for clinical analgesia; Anesthesia, surgery, postoperative treatment are in
      accordance with clinical practice. The investigators conducted a postoperative questionnaire
      survey and psychological diagnosis for all patients. And blood sample was collected from
      patients before and 48 hours after the surgery.
