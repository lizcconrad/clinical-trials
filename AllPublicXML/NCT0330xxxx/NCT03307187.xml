  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study tested the effectiveness of the Group Lifestyle Balance™ (GLB) program adapted
      specifically for people with impaired mobility using standard behavioral approaches for
      weight loss. The overarching aim of this study was to promote health and reduce chronic
      disease risk among people with mobility impairment by building an evidence base for weight
      loss. The central hypothesis was that participants randomized to the intervention arm of the
      adapted GLB would show significant improvements on primary outcomes of weight and PA compared
      to a 6-month wait-list control group at 3 and 6 months, and show improvements on several
      secondary health outcomes.

      The following are the specific study aims and hypotheses:

      Aim 1: To create an appropriate and usable adaptation of the GLB program for people with
      mobility impairment.

      Hypothesis 1.1: Advisory board participants will identify key adaptations to make the GLB
      materials appropriate and usable for individuals with impaired mobility.

      Aim 2: To establish whether the adapted GLB program for people with mobility impairment is a
      feasible intervention.

      Hypothesis 2.1: Intervention participants will rate the program satisfactorily and attend at
      least 2/3rd of the weekly group-based meetings and monthly individualized phone calls.
      Lifestyle coaches will also rate the adapted program satisfactorily.

      Aim 3: To determine if the GLB intervention adapted for those with mobility impairment is
      effective as determined by significant improvement in the primary and secondary outcomes in
      the intervention group compared to the wait-list control group at 3 and 6 months from
      baseline.

      Hypothesis 3.1: The intervention group will demonstrate significantly greater improvements in
      our primary outcomes (weight and PA) than the wait list control group at 3 and at 6 months
      and will show significant improvements in secondary outcomes at 6 months. Hypothesis 3.2:
      Both groups combined will demonstrate significantly greater improvements in the primary
      outcomes (weight and PA) after 3, 6 and 12 months of intervention and secondary outcomes
      after 6 and 12 months of intervention.

    <description>GLB-AIM (Group Lifestyle Balance program, Adapted for individuals with Impaired Mobility) is a 12-month intervention that promotes 5% weight loss by reducing calories and increasing exercise (150 minutes of moderate physical activity). The 23 GLB-AIM sessions were delivered through monthly in-person and teleconference calls and participants were encouraged to self-monitor daily caloric/fat intake and physical activity using materials to accurately measure daily calories and exercise, which included a food scale, measuring cups and spoons and a loaned Garmin vívofit® activity tracker and heart rate monitor. Participants shared their logs with lifestyle coaches over the 13 core sessions and lifestyle coaches provided positive reinforcement, feedback, and problem solving techniques as needed.</description>

    <description>The 12-month Group Lifestyle Balance program, Adapted for individuals with Impaired Mobility (GLB-AIM) promotes 5% - 7% weight loss by reducing calories and increasing energy expenditure to 150 minutes of weekly activity. The 23 GLB-AIM sessions were delivered through monthly in-person and teleconference calls. Participants were encouraged to self-monitor daily caloric/fat intake and physical activity using materials to accurately measure daily calories and exercise, which included a food scale, measuring cups and spoons and a loaned Garmin vívofit® activity tracker and heart rate monitor. Participants shared their logs with lifestyle coaches over the 13 core sessions and lifestyle coaches provided positive reinforcement, feedback, and problem solving techniques as needed.</description>

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  being over 18 years old,

          -  having a permanent mobility impairment for at least 1 year,

          -  being overweight as evidenced by BMI &gt; 25 or the equivalent value recommended for
             spinal cord injury and amputee populations,

          -  having sufficient upper arm mobility to engage in exercise, having access to a
             telephone, and

          -  obtaining physician signed clearance to participate in the weight management
             intervention.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  disabilities for which cognitive impairment substantially impairs autonomy (e.g.
             mental retardation), as determined by a 5-item everyday autonomy scale,

          -  medical issues for which exercise is contraindicated such as uncontrolled hypertension
             or coronary heart disease,

          -  age 75 or older,

          -  pregnancy, and

          -  not fluent in English language.

        The upper age cut off is intended to ensure that the sample consists of a population whose
        permanent mobility impairment is unrelated to aging. Pregnancy is excluded because it is
        directly related to weight gain.
