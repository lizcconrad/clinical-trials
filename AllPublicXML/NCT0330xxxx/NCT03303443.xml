      Bispectral index (BIS), a standard monitor for perioperative monitor of patient's conscious
      level, is a noninvasive medical technique for monitoring and recording the electrical
      activity of brain.

      The electroencephalogram and BIS data have lots of information. Fourier transformation to
      decompose EEG was first applied on the EEG signaling until now. The disadvantages of Fourier
      transformation is hard to deal with physical signals, which was modulated by autonomic system
      and factors. The Hilbert-Huang transform (HHT) was proposed to decompose EEG signal into
      intrinsic mode functions (IMF) since 2004. HHT can obtain instantaneous frequency data and
      work well for data that is nonstationary and nonlinear. HHT have been applied for wild
      ranges, not only in the analysis of arrhythmia for medical and public health fields, but also
      in the earthquake detection and earth physics detectionâ€¦etc.

      The relationship between frontal EEG patterns and general anesthesia remain poorly
      understood. It can only say that the increase in frontal EEG power and shift power to lower
      frequencies during general anesthesia from publications. The investigators are going to
      compare the EEG signal between generations, try to find the difference in aging using
      empirical mode decomposition method.
