  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      the objective of this study is to :

      -Determinate wether the circulating levels of iFGF23 and klotho can be a predictor biomarker
      of HF in patients with CKD-MBD.

      The disorders of mineral metabolism and bone disease are common complications in CKD patients
      and they are associated with increased morbidity and mortality.

      Abnormalities of the vasculature are seen in early CKD, producing vascular stiffness
      contributing to left ventricular hypertrophy and its pathophysiology involves newly
      discovered hormones, such as the fibroblast Growth factor 23 (FGF23) and α- klotho.

      The FGF receptor and its co-receptor klotho moderate these effects. FGF23 levels inflate
      early in in the advancement of CKD stage to attain levels in CKD stage 5D.

      But we still have few knoweledges if these markers can have some drawbacks for predicting CVD
      in early stage CKD.
