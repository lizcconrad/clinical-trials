      The purpose of this study is to determine whether a 20- herb formulation, as a well
      characterised extract, is efficacious in treating irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and also to
      identify efficacious and safe dosage of the formulation in treating IBS.

      The Specific aims of the project are:

        1. To determine whether a 20- herb formulation improves pain/ discomfort and disturbed
           bowel frequency in patients with Irritable Bowel Syndrome who have been disappointed
           with current conventional Western medicine.

        2. To identify an optimal dosage of the 20- herb formulation that is safe and well
           tolerated for up to 8 weeks of treatment, among 2 dosages. This is determined by relief
           of symptoms of IBS in a dose escalation, placebo-controlled double- blind randomized
           clinical trial, in conjunction with indices of safety and tolerability.
