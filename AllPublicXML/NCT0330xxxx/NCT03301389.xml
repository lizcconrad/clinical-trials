  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chemotherapy or radiation therapy-induced cardiotoxicity are well-recognized side effects in
      patients with cancer. The clinical significance of cardiotoxicity is growing with increasing
      cancer survivor-ship.

      Left ventricular (LV) functional assessment is the standard of reference to diagnose
      chemotherapy- or radiation therapy-induced cardiotoxicity. The investigators will investigate
      the usefulness of T1 mapping parameters for early detection and prediction of chemotherapy-,
      radiation therapy-, or other therapy-induced cardiotoxicity in breast cancer patients This
      study aimed to achieve early detection of chemotherapy- or radiation therapy-induced
      cardiotoxicity using T1 mapping magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and determine a prognostic
      imaging factor of chemotherapy- or radiation therapy-induced cardiotoxicity in patients
      treated for breast cancer.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Screening and follow-up cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMR) protocols for diagnosis of
      cardiotoxicity will be conducted in patients with breast cancer who have received or are
      planned to receive treatment for breast cancer. The protocol will include T1 and T2 mapping
      and cine imaging of the LV myocardium.

    <description>The cardiac imaging protocol will include pre-contrast T1, post-contrast T1, and T2 mapping images acquired of the mid ventricle with the short axis plane for the analysis of native T1, T2, and extracellular volume (ECV) values of the myocardium. It will also include cine imaging covering the whole LV myocardium in the short axis plane for a functional analysis of the LV myocardium.</description>
