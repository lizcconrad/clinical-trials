  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is investigating the combination of Brentuximab vedotin and lenalidomide in the
      treatment of relapsed/refractory peripheral T cell lymphoma or cutaneous T cell lymphoma or
      Hodgkin lymphoma.

      It is hypothesised that lenalidomide may augment the actions of Brentuximab vedotin in these
      patient groups. The primary objective of the study is to determine the maximum tolerated dose
      of the combination treatment, which can be used in subsequent studies. The study will also
      investigate disease response and survival.

      Participants will receive Brentuximab vedotin (once every 21 days i.e. 1 cycle) and
      lenalidomide (daily from day 1 -14 of each cycle) for a maximum of 48 weeks and will be
      followed for a subsequent 6 months after the end of treatment.

    <intervention_model_description>This is a single arm dose escalation study. There are four dose levels for the combination of Brentuximab vedotin and Lenalidomide considered during the dose escalation.
Starting Dose Level 1: Brentuximab vedotin 1.8mg/kg q21 days &amp; Lenalidomide 15 mg daily (D1-14)
The dose can be decreased as follows:
Level -2 Brentuximab vedotin 1.2mg/kg q21 days &amp; Lenalidomide 5 mg daily (D1-14)
Level -1 Brentuximab vedotin 1.2mg/kg q21 days &amp; Lenalidomide 10 mg daily (D1-14)
or the dose can be escalated as follows:
Level 2 Brentuximab vedotin 1.8mg/kg q21 days &amp; Lenalidomide 25 mg daily (D1-14)
Patients will be assigned a starting dose by the safety committee; this will be communicated by the PI and/or their designated sub-investigator prior to planned Cycle1 Day 1 for each patient.</intervention_model_description>

             HBsAg negative/ negative hepatitis B viral load, will still be considered eligible for
             inclusion, but must receive viral suppressive therapy for the duration of the trial.
