    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the pharmacokinetics and bioequivalence of Ritonavir
      tablet 100 mg versus NORVIR 100 mg tablet in healthy Chinese adult participants under fasting
      or fed condition.

    <textblock>
      The study design is an Open-Label Randomized, Single-Dose, 2-way Crossover Bioequivalence
      Study with a washout period of 6 days. During each session, the subjects will be administered
      a single dose of 100mg Ritonavir (one Ritonavir Tablet 100mg or one NORVIR Tablet 100mg)
      under fasting or fed condition.
