  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Female patients with USI will be evaluated for vaginal elasticity using vaginal tactile
      imaging both before and after surgery for the repair of the USI. Surgical repair will be
      performed by a single surgeon who will perform a tension free vaginal tape obturator (TVT-O)
      repair.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients will be recruited and sign a consent form. The patients included are patients with
      USI that are candidates for a TVT-O repair.

      Assessment of vaginal elasticity via vaginal tactile imaging will be performed at 3 different
      points:

        -  The day of surgery before surgery.

        -  The day after surgery.

        -  3 months post-operational. Every patient will serve as her own control. Demographic,
           gynecologic and obstetric history will be obtained from patients` electronic files.
