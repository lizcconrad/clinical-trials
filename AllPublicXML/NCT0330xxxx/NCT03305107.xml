    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the separate and combined effects of high-intensity
      interval exercise and chocolate milk on glycemic response, cognitive function, subjective
      appetite, and salivary cortisol among children aged 9-13 year old children.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Twenty children 9-13 years of age will be recruited for this study. On four separate
      mornings, after a 10 hour overnight fast, each child will consume a standardized breakfast
      (including orange juice, a strawberry breakfast bar and a pear fruit cup) at home. Using a
      2x2 factorial design, 2 hours after breakfast consumption, each participant will arrive in
      the lab (T=-20 min) and participate in high-intensity interval exercise or sit quietly for 20
      min, followed by a treatment drink of chocolate milk or water (control) consumption in 10
      min. During high-intensity interval exercise treatment, children will exercise on a cycle
      ergometer with a 3-min warm-up, 7 repeated bouts of 60-sec exercise at 90% of peak power
      output and 60-second recovery, and a 3-min cool down. Blood glucose will be measured via
      finger-prick at baseline (-20 min), 10, 30, 60, and 90 min. Cognitive functions will be
      measured using a battery of cognitive tests which assess verbal declarative memory, working
      memory, and executive functioning, and will be measured at baseline, 10. 30. 60, and 90 min.
      Subjective appetite and emotions will be measured using a 100-mm visual analogue scale (VAS)
      at baseline, 10, 30, 60, and 90 min. Salivary cortisol will be assessed from saliva samples
      collected using the passive drool method, and will be collected at baseline, 10 and 30 min.

    <description>The n-back test consists of 2 levels, 1-back and 2-back, where letters are presented on the screen one at a time. During the 1-back level, participants need to determine if the presented letter is the same as the one letter presented 1 before it or not (by selected 'match' or 'no match' on the side of the screen) and during 2-back need to do determine if it is the same letter as the one presented 2 letters prior.</description>

    <description>The Stroop test consists of one word appearing on the screen written in either blue, red, yellow or green. There are 24 congruent trials where the presented word is the name of the colour it is written it (i.e. 'red' appearing in the colour red), 24 incongruent trials where the word written is a colour word different from the one it is written in (i.e. 'red' appearing in the colour green), and 10 neutral trials where non-colour words appear (i.e. 'tape' appearing in yellow). The participant is asked to tap the corresponding colour that the word is written in as quickly as possible.</description>
