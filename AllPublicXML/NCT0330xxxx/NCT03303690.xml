  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Ankle sprains can result in talar osteochondral defects (OCDs) which have a significant
      impact on the quality of life of patients. When these OCDs are of large nature
      (anterior-posterior or medial-lateral diameter &gt;1.5cm in diameter), cystic, have failed prior
      surgical treatment, or when there are multiple present on the talar articular surface,
      surgical care by means of fixation or bone marrow stimulation is contra-indicated. An ankle
      arthrodesis or fusion can be considered, but this results in functional limitation due to a
      decreased range of motion (ROM). In order to serve for a bone sparing prosthesis procedure,
      preserve range of motion, optimize physical functioning and to resurface the talus, the Ankle
      Spacer has been developed. It is a one-piece implant system that replaces the articulating
      upper talus surface of the tibio-talar joint, and offers several implant sizes in order to
      fit to the different talus sizes. It is anatomically designed to the native upper talus
      surface to provide an optimal fit to the distal articular surface. It has a rough titanium
      plasma spray (TPS) coated under surface with two posts and spikes for implant fixation. The
      rough surface enables secondary fixation by means of bone ingrowth and the spikes at the
      posterior part of the prosthesis allowing for optimal adherence of the implant and for
      minimal iatrogenic damage upon fixation. By these means, the anatomical situation and the
      natural congruency of the ankle joint are mirrored to a optimal extent. Despite the fact that
      no clinical trials have been published on this specific implant, it is hypothesized that the
      5-year postoperative clinical outcomes concerning pain and prosthesis survival will be
      considered good.
