  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Bone quality is one of the major factors influencing the dental implant survival rate. Bone
      quality is believed to have effects on initial implant stability and success of
      osseointegration. Different implant designs and surgical protocols were developed for
      improving the survival rate in different bone quality. Although bone quality can be partly
      diagnosed by radiographic images, lots of experienced surgeons also evaluate bone quality
      with tactile sensation when they drill the bone. However, variations in evaluation of bone
      density maybe exist among different surgeons. For less experienced dentists, it is difficult
      to diagnose bone quality with tactile sensation in the beginning. This purpose of this study
      is to evaluate a training protocol in using tactile sensation to classify bone quality during
      implant surgery. Saw bones of variant densities are used as training materials. The outcomes
      before and after training will be compared. The effect of training frequency before surgery
      will also be evaluated.

      Twenty-five dentists will be enrolled into the study. Tests will be performed using visual
      analog scale to score bone quality of test blocks.
