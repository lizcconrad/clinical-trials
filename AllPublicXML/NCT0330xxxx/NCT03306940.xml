  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hemifacial spasm patients who received botulinum toxin A injection were divided into two
      groups. Group A received unilateral injection while group B received bilateral injection.
      Patients completed follow-up A researcher record facial videos and analyzed facial symmetry
      and completed 3 scales.

    <textblock>
      Hemifacial spasm patients who received botulinum toxin A injection were divided into two
      groups.Patients of unilateral group were injected to the affected side and the dose of
      botulinum toxin A was 2.5-3.75 units/per site. Patients of bilateral group were injected to
      the affected side with dose of 2.5-3.75 units/per site and the normal side was injected with
      dose of 1.25 units/per site.

      3 scales for measurement were used.
