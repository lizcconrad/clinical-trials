  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Growth hormone secreting pituitary adenomas(GHomas) produce excessive GH, stimulating
      excessive insulin like growth factor 1(IGF-1) synthesis in the liver, thus causing multiple
      systemic complications. The life expectancy of patients with untreated GHomas is shortened by
      ten years. The treatment goal of GHomas is to shrink the tumor volume and normalize GH and
      IGF-1. Under current treatment, only 50-70% of patients get remission. Rosiglitazone is a
      widely used oral antidiabetic medicine. The investigator's preliminary data showed that
      rosiglitazone decreased the synthesis of GH and IGF-1 in rat pituitary tumor cells GH3 and
      hepatocytes respectively. The investigator plan to investigate the efficacy of rosiglitazone
      in the treatment of patients with GHomas who have not been alleviated by other therapies.
