  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      90 genes related to Monogenic Stone Disease will be determined via DNA analysis by the Mayo
      Rare Kidney Stone Consortium (RKSC) research staff.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Have a blood test (about 2 teaspoons; ½ to 1 teaspoons for children) or buccal cell
      collection for DNA or RNA isolation • Complete a kidney stone history questionnaire

      In addition to the above testing, family members may be asked to participate in the
      following:

      • Complete a 24 hr. urine collection Your samples will undergo genetic testing. We will share
      the results with your local doctor. All family members, of a patient whose genetic testing
      showed no known mutations, will not be tested. These samples will be stored for future
      research.
