  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To study of a novel, therapeutic Human Cells, Tissues, and Cellular and Tissue-Based Product
      (HCT/P) in the treatment of severe dry eye disease that is failing conventional treatments.
      This pilot study will carefully observe and monitor each qualifying and willing individual
      for response to treatment, signs of toxicity and adverse effects from the treatment, and for
      ability of the treatment to improve comfort and restore vision.

      Eligible patients presenting with severe dry eye disease that have failed treatment with
      conventional measures will be screened for inclusion into the study. The treatment will
      consist of administration of formulated topical eye drops containing cadaveric epithelial
      stem cell-derived product. These eye drops will be transplanted by topical
      self-administration by the patient four times daily in both eyes for a three month interval.
