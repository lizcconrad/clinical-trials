  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a family based genotype-phenotype study designed to assess genetic and environmental
      influences on obesity, insulin resistance and beta cell function in the context of
      gestational diabetes.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Mexican American women with prior gestational diabetes and their first degree relatives and
      Mexican American women with prior normal glucose tolerance in pregnancy are studied with
      detailed phenotyping consisting of oral and intravenous glucose tolerance tests, body
      composition studies, diet and physical activity assessments, and circulating biomarkers
      potentially related to obesity, insulin resistance, pancreatic beta cell function,
      gestational diabetes and type 2 diabetes. Spouses of the gestational diabetic and control
      probands are studied with oral glucose tolerance tests. Offspring of the gestational and
      control probands have fasting glucose determinations. All participants provide DNA for
      genetics testing. A subset of the gestational diabetic probands and their first degree
      relatives return 3-5 years after baseline testing for repeat phenotyping.
