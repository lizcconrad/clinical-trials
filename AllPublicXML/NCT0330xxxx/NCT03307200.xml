  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Nowadays, high-quality cancer care is more than just diagnosis and treatment of cancer.
      Healthcare must respond to the specific needs of the patients to provide patient-centered
      care. To date, research on the unmet supportive care needs in bladder cancer patients
      undergoing radical cystectomy is scarce. Because the needs of the patients may differ
      according to the phase in the illness trajectory, it is important that prospective research
      is carried out. Research in other cancer populations shows that unmet supportive care needs
      are negatively associated with health-related quality of life, psychological distress,
      physical activity and the health literacy of the patient. By incorporating the above factors
      into this study, we can not only map the unmet supportive care needs of the patient, but also
      explore possible associations between the variables. Since this is the first prospective
      study on supportive care needs in bladder cancer, this is a hypothesis-generating study.
