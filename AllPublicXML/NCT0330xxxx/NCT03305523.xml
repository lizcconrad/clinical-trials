    <textblock>
      Since circumcision is a significant workload for surgeons working at the rural state
      hospitals in Turkey, the use of circumcision techniques that are easy to implement and have
      low complications is becoming widespread. This research will examine short and long-term
      complications of male circumcisions using thermocautery technique in light of current
      literature.

      Patients who were circumcised between May 2014 and May 2016 at the Pediatric Surgery and
      Urology Clinics at Yuksekova State Hospital were retrospectively analyzed through the
      hospital registry system. Patients who underwent circumcision with thermocautery technique
      were examined in terms of age, duration of circumcision and complication rates. Complications
      were classified as perioperative (bleeding during the circumcision or under observation at
      the hospital after circumcision that required knotting or cauterization, scrotum or penile
      injury), early postoperative (first 10 days after being discharged) and long-term (late
      postoperative = after 10 days) (skin-mucosal bridge, delayed wound healing, secondary
      phimosis, meatitis).

      Patients were discharged after being kept under observation for 1 hour after circumcision.
      Patients were suggested to apply routine warm sitting bath, daily dressing and the patients
      with phimosis opening were suggested to apply epithelizing cream. On the 10th postoperative
      day, all patients were called for control. Patients who developed complications were included
      in long-term follow-up. Complications were treated.

      Statistical analysis: The data obtained from the study were transferred to a computer
      environment and evaluated with the help of Statistical Package for Social Sciences Version
      19.0. Chi-square test was used to evaluate categorical data and Mann-Whitney U test was used
      to evaluate quantitative variables. P &lt; 0.05 was considered statistically significant.

    <description>In the thermocautery method, a digital thermocautery device (Thermo-Med TM 802-B, Thermo Medical, Adana, Turkey) with 6 different temperature settings was used. Circumcision was performed in the same way as the surgical circumcision. Only cutting and bleeding intervention was done by using a thermocautery device. Cutting was performed by making the appropriate heat adjustment according to the age of the child and the thickness of the glans. Hemorrhage control was performed with a thermocautery device and then the skin-mucosa integrity was ensured by using a 5/0 absorbable suture</description>
