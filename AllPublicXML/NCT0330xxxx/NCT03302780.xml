  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study looks at the effect of combined breathing-controlled electrical stimulation
      (BreEStim) and transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) on neuropathic pain after
      spinal cord injury, amputation, or brain injury. The hypothesis is that a single session of
      combined BreEStim and tDCS will produce an additive analgesic effect. This record covers the
      study in a population of healthy volunteers. Note that this study will also enroll spinal
      cord injury patients, brain injury patients, and amputation patients and that this study as
      applied to these other populations will be covered in separate ClinicalTrials.gov records.

          -  healthy subjects (i.e., no recent injuries or pain)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  recent injuries or pain

          -  have a pacemaker, or other metal and/or implanted devices

          -  have amputation in their arm(s)

          -  have spinal cord injury (SCI) involving impairment of arms

          -  have cognitive impairment from brain injury or are not able to follow commands, or to
             give consent

          -  have asthma or other pulmonary disease

          -  are not medically stable

          -  Mini-mental state examination (MMSE), a brief 30-point questionnaire test that is
             commonly used in the literature, will be used to screen for cognitive impairment. A
             brain injury patient with a score of 24 or lower on MMSE will be excluded.
