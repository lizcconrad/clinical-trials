  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Veterans seeking compensation for musculoskeletal (MSD) conditions often develop chronic pain
      and are at high risk for substance misuse. The Investigators propose to test the
      effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of Screening, Brief Intervention and Referral to
      Treatment for Pain Management (SBIRT-PM), designed to reduce pain and reduce risky substance
      use, in part by helping Veterans get comprehensive pain treatment. The study will involve a
      2-year period to arrange for clinicians at a single site to counsel Veterans throughout New
      England by phone with SBIRT-PM as part of a clinical trial, and a 4-year period to conduct
      the trial and disseminate its findings.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In 2015 alone, 97,223 new Veterans under age 35 began receiving compensation for injuries
      related to their military service. In total, there are 559,999 post-9/11 Veterans being
      compensated for back or neck conditions, and a partially overlapping 596,250 for limitation
      of flexion in joints. Veterans seeking compensation for musculoskeletal conditions often
      develop chronic pain and are at high risk for substance misuse. Early intervention is needed
      to arrest worsening pain and risky substance use, particularly among post-9/11 Veterans for
      whom engagement in non-pharmacological pain treatment has the potential to improve their
      overall quality of life and spare them the complications of opioid treatments. The
      service-connection application is an ideal point-of-contact for initiating early intervention
      treatments for these at-risk Veterans. The Investigators propose to test the effectiveness
      and cost-effectiveness of Screening, Brief Intervention and Referral to Treatment for Pain
      Management (SBIRT-PM), designed to reduce pain and risky substance use. In brief, the
      counselor explains that treating both physical and psychological aspects of pain leads to the
      best outcomes, outlines what VA (and non-VA if preferred) services are available to Veterans,
      explains that substances are sometimes used for pain relief, and segues into traditional
      SBIRT. SBIRT-PM's efficacy is supported by a completed clinical trial of 101 Veterans
      applying for service-connection for MSD, and by studies showing the efficacy of SBIRT for
      people with risky substance use and of Motivational Interviewing for engagement in
      non-pharmacological pain care. The study will involve a two-year period to arrange for
      clinicians at a single &quot;hub&quot; site to counsel Veterans throughout New England by phone with
      SBIRT-PM, and a four-year period to conduct the clinical trial and disseminate its findings.
      During the two-years of preparation for the clinical trial, the team will prepare SBIRT-PM
      for implementation by establishing communication (Relational Coordination is the theoretical
      framework) between the &quot;hub&quot; where the SBIRT-PM clinician is sited and the &quot;spoke&quot; sites,
      establishing study-related procedures, and piloting the intervention at each of the eight VA
      medical centers in New England. For the full clinical trial, investigators will randomize
      1200 Veterans applying for compensation related to MSD to either SBIRT-PM or Usual Care (UC)
      across eight VA medical centers in New England. Outcome assessment by phone will occur at 12
      and 36-week follow-ups, and will be corroborated with other sources of information ---the
      electronic health record and toxicology testing of nail clippings. Investigators hypothesize
      that, compared to Usual Care, SBIRT-PM will be more effective and cost-effective in improving
      Veterans' pain and substance use. Investigators further hypothesize that a mediator of these
      improvements will be use of non-pharmacological services, as extracted from VA records from
      structured data fields and from narrative text in the medical record using an innovative
      natural language processing algorithm. Screening and referral to treatment at
      service-connection examinations can transform a widely-used point of entry to VA into a
      health-promoting encounter.

    <description>Screening, Brief Intervention and Referral to Treatment for Pain Management (SBIRT-PM) was developed to promote engagement in multi-modal non-pharmacological pain management among compensation-seeking Veterans with chronic pain. In SBIRT-PM, a clinician meets with the Veteran after the compensation examination to address the presenting MSD complaint. The clinician addresses Veterans' motivation for multi-modal pain care, and explains how pain can be managed using a variety of non-pharmacological pain management services. The clinician spells out how those services can be accessed at VA. Using permissive language about how pain is commonly self-medicated with substances, the clinician transitions to inquiries about use of prescription and non-prescription substances. The clinician then attempts to motivate Veterans to change their behavior if they are misusing substances. Thus, SBIRT-PM addresses the Veteran's presenting pain complaint first and nascent substance use subsequently.</description>

    <description>SBIRT-PM involves an initial telephone-delivered session followed by up to three calls to Veterans in a 12-week period to support Veteran engagement in multi-modal non-pharmacological pain care and to motivate those who misuse substances to change this problematic behavior. SBIRT-PM also includes coordination between the SBIRT-PM clinicians and the PACT nurse case manager after the initial session to support these patient outcomes.</description>
