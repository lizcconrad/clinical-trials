  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A series of N-of-1 trials will be used to determine the effectiveness of a specific
      carbohydrate diet (SCD) versus a modified SCD in patients in reducing symptoms and
      inflammatory burden at both the individual and population level. This is a three-year study.
      The study staff will recruit 120 patients (goal sample size of 100, accounting for attrition)
      across up to 12 sites in patients aged 7-17 with mild to moderate disease activity.

    <description>The short Crohn's disease activity index (sCDAI) will be used to assess disease activity based on self-report via the study app. For the sCDAI, items assess general well-being, abdominal pain, and liquid stools. Respondents are asked to report on symptoms for the previous 24 hour period. Scores are calculated based on a published algorithm.</description>

    <description>A self-reported version of the Pediatric Ulcerative Colitis Activity Index (PUCAI) will be used to assess disease activity based on self-report via the study app. For the PUCAI, respondents are asked to report on abdominal pain, bloody stools, stool consistency, stool frequency, nocturnal stools, and activity level over the prior 24-hours. A weighted, summed score is calculated with higher scores indicating worse disease (score range 0-85).</description>

Data plans, analysis plans, data dictionaries, study manuals and annotated case report forms will be made available, upon request, in a read-only format (PDF). Each dataset will be accompanied by appropriate documentation listing each variable, variable definition, decode values (if appropriate), an indication of the variable as a source collected or derived variable, and derivation algorithms for any derived values.
Datasets will be available as SAS, SAS transport, XML or CSV with labels. Other formats may be created if requested. All necessary security measures will be taken to ensure patient privacy and confidentiality, and details on how data may be used, including the use of de-identified data sets, will be included in the informed consent.</ipd_description>
