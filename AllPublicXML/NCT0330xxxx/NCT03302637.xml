  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective population based study to examine the relationship of oral and
      pancreatic microbiome, and their functions, to pancreatic cancer risk.

      The identification of specific oral bacteria and their functional relationship to pancreatic
      cancer will advance scientific knowledge on the etiology of pancreatic cancer. This could
      provide a new microbially-based research paradigm, possibly leading to new drug targets for
      this disease. Second, the oral bacteria may serve as a readily accessible, non-invasive
      biomarker for subsequent pancreatic cancer risk, which help to identify people at high risk
      of this disease. Finally, the identified oral bacteria may lead to microbial prophylactic
      preventions, with antibiotic therapy aimed at eradicating the specific species associated
      with increased cancer risk or, alternatively, combined with probiotics to introduce species
      that are associated with a decreased cancer risk. Thus, the study outcomes will lead to
      actionable means for pancreatic cancer prevention.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A history of periodontal disease and the presence of circulating antibodies to selected oral
      pathogens have been associated with increased risk of pancreatic cancer; however, direct
      relationships of oral microbes with pancreatic cancer have not been evaluated in prospective
      studies. Investigators examine the relationship of oral microbiota with subsequent risk of
      pancreatic cancer in a large nested case-control study.

    <description>extraction of genomic DNA from oral samples using the Mobio DNA Isolation Kit. 16S rRNA amplicons covering variable regions V3 to V4 will be generated using primers (347F-5'GGAGGCAGCAGTRRGGAAT'-3' and 803R 5'-CTACCRGGGTATCTAATCC-3')66 incorporating adapters and a sample barcode sequence at PI's lab. Amplicons will be sequenced with the Roche 454 FLX Titanium sequencing system at the NYU genome technology center, following the manufacturer's specifications.</description>
