      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To identify the ability of Aspirin 80mg, when administered as a single daily dose to
      induce a direct pharmacological effect on cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) levels, based
      on biopsy samples from the rectum obtained pre- and post-intervention, as compared to
      placebo.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the pharmacodynamic (PD) response rate between arms Aspirin 80mg versus
      placebo).

      II. To confirm the safety and tolerability of Aspirin 80mg, as compared to placebo.

      OUTLINE: Participants are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.

      ARM A: Participants receive Aspirin 80mg orally (PO) once daily (QD) for 7 days.

      ARM B: Participants receive placebo PO QD for 7 days.

      After completion of study, participants are followed up at 21, 30, and 51 days.

    <measure>Pharmacological effect on cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) levels for Aspirin 80mg arm versus (vs.) placebo</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 7 days</time_frame>
    <description>Arithmetic difference in mean cGMP levels before and after 7 days of Aspirin 80mg from subject biopsies. This represents the increase in cGMP stimulated by 7 days of Aspirin 80mg in an individual subject. The mean cGMP value will be calculated based on 8 biopsies from the rectum assessed at each time point. With a sample size of 12 per arm, will have 80% power to detect a significantly increased pharmacological effect of the continuous cGMP results for the active arm vs. placebo, assuming a 1-sided significance level of 5%. The study would be powered to detect an effect</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Pharmacodynamic (PD) response rate across all patients and compared between arms</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Each participant will be assessed for PD response. The calculation is based on the standardized difference in means for the pharmacological effect on cGMP levels at the participant level, where a subject with a z &gt;= 1.645 will be considered a PD responder. A participant with a z &lt; 1.645 will be considered a non-responder. If the cGMP values are not normally distributed, a transformation to a variable with a normal distribution will be performed. The PD response rate will be compared between the 2 arms using a standard Chi-square or Fisher's exact test. A Bonferroni correction will be included</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Safety and tolerability of Aspirin 80mg, defined as incidence of adverse events per National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 4.0</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Summary statistics and frequency tables will be used to describe the data in an exploratory fashion. All adverse events will be summarized by treatment arm and compared between arms using the Fisher's exact test. All eligible participants initiating study intervention will be considered evaluable for this endpoint. A Bonferroni correction will be included for multiple comparisons.</description>
