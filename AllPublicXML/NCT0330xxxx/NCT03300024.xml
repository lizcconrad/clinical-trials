  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators propose a randomized study to compare bovine carotid artery (BCA) biologic
      grafts and expanded polytetrafluoroethylene grafts (ePTFE) for permanent hemodialysis access.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Arteriovenous grafts (AVG) remain reliable substitutes for permanent hemodialysis access in
      scenarios that preclude the placement of arteriovenous fistulae. There is scarcity of
      evidence to support the current preference of synthetic conduits over biologic grafts in
      clinical practice. Advances in the design of AVG's warrant contemporary comparisons between
      synthetic and biologic AVG options. This is especially important as biologic conduits may
      confer an advantage by virtue of their inherent similarity to the native human vasculature.

      The overall goal of this project is to compare one and two year patency (functional, primary,
      primary assisted and secondary), complication rates and re-intervention rates between BCA and
      standard ePTFE grafts. The investigators hypothesize that vascular patient who will receive
      the BCA graft will have improved patency as well as lower complication and re-intervention
      rates compared to the standard ePTFE graft.

    <description>The ePTFE grafts used are the Flixene (Maquet-Atrium Medical, Hudson, NH), Advanta VXT (Maquet-Atrium), GORE-TEXStretch Vascular Graft For Vascular Access (W. L. Gore and Associates, Flagstaff, Ariz), or Venaflo (Bard Peripheral Vascular, Tempe, Ariz). The choice of graft used is at the surgeons' discretion. The graft it is offered in both large and small diameters, as well as thin-wall and rapidly-tapering designs for cases where arterial steal syndrome is a potential complication. A 6 mm graft featuring external supporting rings in 5 cm centered or 7 cm offset sections enables tight loop configurations and crossing the cubitus. A 4-7 mm tapered graft with 10 or 15 cm of removable rings allows for tailoring or exact placement of the ringed section.</description>
