  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Physician recommendation has been shown to be one of the most significant predictors for
      colorectal cancer (CRC) screening. This study aims to identify the amount of parents of
      internal medicine residents at NYU who are eligible for CRC screening but have not received
      it. Investigators will perform an intervention and quantify the amount of parents eligible
      for CRC screening after the intervention. This study will entail sending 2 brief surveys (one
      before the intervention and one after) which determine if the parents of the residents are
      eligible for CRC screening. The intervention will be asking the residents with eligible
      parents to have a discussion with their parents about CRC screening options and to address
      their concerns. Investigators will provide a one page document the residents can give their
      parents as a reference as part of the intervention.
