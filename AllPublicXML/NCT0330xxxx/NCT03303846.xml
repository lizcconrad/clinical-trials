    <textblock>
      This clinical trial studies normal breast tissue changes combined with breast magnetic
      resonance imaging (MRI) that may suggest the beginnings of cancer development. Using breast
      tissue markers in combination with breast imaging such as MRI may help to more accurately
      assess a woman's risk of developing breast cancer.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the number of high risk women with abnormal screening breast MRI and
      morphologically normal biopsy over 7 years.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine if WNT10B/mutant p53 expression as measured in the 0-month biopsy predicts
      women with an abnormal MRI/non-cancerous biopsy who will progress to cancer over 7 years.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the predictive accuracy of WNT10B with MRI, of which will be compared with
      MRI alone using the C-index.

      OUTLINE:

      Participants undergo standard of care high risk breast cancer screening MRIs at baseline and
      follow-up and blood sample collection at baseline. Participants undergo collection of breast
      tissue samples at any breast biopsy or breast surgery.

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Expression of WNT10B/mutant p53 in morphologically normal breast tissue</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Biopsy tissue will be assessed for 1) activated WNT10B (measured by presence of high phospho-beta-catenin; present vs. absent) and 2) loss of p53 function (measured by the loss of p21 expression; present versus [vs.] absent). The optimal cut for the WNT10B to differentiate progression vs. non-progression women will be carried out by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis, and hence WNT10B expression will be dichotomized to high vs. low expression. Chi-square test 12-month progression. Adjusted association will be further explored by logistic regression incorporating subject characteristics, such as age, body mass index (BMI), race, and BRCA1.</description>

    <measure>Predictive accuracy of WNT10B with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The specificity for MRI combined with WNT10B and/or p53 based biomarkers to detect triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) will be calculated with 95% confidence interval (CI). Its prediction accuracy will be described by C-index and compared to that by diagnosis by MRI alone.</description>
