  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized parallel controlled double-blind phase 2 clinical study.All subjects are
      recruited from the patients of rotator cuff tear, lateral epicondylitis or chronic achilles
      tendonitis. Patients will be randomly divided into three groups. Autologous pure platlet-rich
      plasma (P-PRP) and platlet-rich plasma (PRP) are purified from the peripheral blood .Patients
      of case groups will receive P-PRP or PRP injection once a week for three times while the
      control group received the same dose compound betamethasone injection. Follow up visit will
      occur at 1 month,3 months, 6 months,12 months after the last injection. Clinical quantitative
      assessment will measure by the visual analogue scale(VAS). The secondary outcomes are the
      constant-murley score(CMS) and the rating scale of the American shoulder and elbow
      surgeons(ASES) and the disability of arm shoulder and hand(DASH). The objective evaluation
      methods is that the examination of MRI or ultrasound were accomplished before the first
      injection and at 6 and 12 months afterwards.
