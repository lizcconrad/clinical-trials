  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to conduct a pilot trial of a Precision Dosing approach to
      alemtuzumab dosing for allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation of patients with
      non-malignant diseases. The investigators will measure the ability to use a population PK
      model of alemtuzumab to target patient Day 0 alemtuzumab levels to 0.15-0.6ug/mL in a pilot
      study of 20 patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The hypothesis is that the model-informed dosing regimen will prospectively allow the
      precision dosing of alemtuzumab to target Day 0 levels to fall between 0.15-0.6ug/mL in
      greater than 80% of patients. The investigators have chosen a conservative pilot study
      approach, and the aim is to achieve Day 0 alemtuzumab levels between 0.15-0.6ug/mL in greater
      than 60% of 20 patients enrolled in this pilot study based on a Simon two-stage design as
      detailed below.

      A Simon two-stage design (Simon, 1989) is being used. The null hypothesis that 30% of
      patients will achieve a Day 0 alemtuzumab level between 0.15-0.6ug/mL will be tested against
      a one-sided alternative that the alemtuzumab dose modification will result in 60% of patients
      achieving a Day 0 alemtuzumab level between 0.15-0.6ug/mL. In the first stage, 7 patients
      will be accrued. If there are 2 or fewer patients that achieve Day 0 alemtuzumab levels
      within the range of 0.15-0.6ug/mL, the study will be stopped. Otherwise, 13 additional
      patients will be accrued for a total of 20. The null hypothesis will be rejected if 11 or
      more patients achieve a Day 0 level of 0.15-0.6ug/mL within the total 20 patients. This
      design yields a type I error rate of 0.04 and power of 0.82 when the true response rate is
      0.60. The investigators will enroll up to 30 patients in order allow for subject withdrawal,
      but will stop enrollment once 20 patients reach Day 0.

    <description>Patients less than 15kg will be given 0.6mg/kg alemtuzumab divided over days -14, -13, and -12 (0.2mg/kg/dose).
Patients greater than 15kg will be given a 3mg &quot;test&quot; dose on day -14 in order to limit the first dose to no more than 3 mg per the manufacturer's recommendation. This will be followed by 0.23mg/kg/dose on days -13 and -12 (to equal a total dose of approximately 0.5-0.6mg/kg).
Alemtuzumab will be drawn into a sterile syringe and given to patients subcutaneously.</description>

    <description>Alemtuzumab (Campath®) is a recombinant DNA-derived humanized monoclonal antibody directed against CD52. Alemtuzumab is produced in mammalian cell (Chinese hamster ovary) suspension culture in a medium containing neomycin. Neomycin is not detectable in the final product. Alemtuzumab is a sterile, clear, colorless, isotonic pH 6.8-7.4 solution for injection. Alemtuzumab is supplied in single-use clear glass ampules containing 30 mg of Alemtuzumab in 3 mL of solution. Single use vial of alemtuzumab contains 30 mg alemtuzumab, 8 mg sodium chloride, 1.44 mg dibasic sodium phosphate, 0.2 mg potassium chloride, 0.2 mg monobasic potassium phosphate, 0.1 mg polysorbate 80, and 0.0187 mg disodium edetate dihydrate.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients who are undergoing RIC HCT with alemtuzumab, fludarabine, and melphalan at
             CCHMC for treatment of a non-malignant disease.

          2. Age ≥ 6 weeks to ≤ 30 years (at time of enrollment).

             stem cell donor, or be receiving a CD34+ selected stem cell product. After the first 7
             patients, any donor match may be allowed after data review by the PI and medical
             monitor.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients with a history of anaphylaxis to alemtuzumab.

             prior to the start of the preparative regimen.

          3. Life expectancy less than 2 weeks.

          4. Patients receiving dialysis.

          5. Failure to sign informed consent and/or assent, or inability to undergo informed
             consent process.
