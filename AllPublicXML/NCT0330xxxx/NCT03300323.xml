  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Administration of intravenous fluids is a key step in the management of the post-operative
      patient. Fluid management has been identified as one area that can affect rates of
      post-operative complications and outcomes. It is important to give the right amount of fluid,
      enough to optimise cardiovascular function, but not so much that we flood the cells. To guide
      this, we use a fluid challenge, administration of a small amount of fluid to test the
      cardiovascular response. At present there is significant inter-user variability in the method
      of administration of a fluid challenge. To ensure accuracy and reliability in assessing the
      response to a fluid challenge, the optimal method of administration needs to be determined.

      The aim of this study is to investigate the optimal rate to give a fluid challenge over.
      Patients will be randomised to receive a fluid challenge over either 5 or 20 minutes. Both of
      these rates are within the currently accepted range. All patients will receive a dose of
      4ml/kg of intravenous fluid. Previous work has shown this to be the optimal dose to reliably
      stress the system.

      Measurement of the mean pressure in the cardiovascular system (mean systemic filling pressure
      or Pmsf) during the administration of a fluid challenge will be used to assess which rate of
      administration effectively challenges the cardiovascular system. Pmsf is measured using a
      pneumatic tourniquet inflated for sixty seconds, above an arterial line. The invasive
      arterial pressure is observed to then determine Pmsf. Cardiac output will also be monitored
      during and after administration of the fluid challenge. Since the microcirculation may remain
      impaired despite stabilisation of the macrocirculation, we will also observe this at
      baseline, on completion of the fluid challenge, and at 5 minute intervals for 15 minutes.
      This is observed using a handheld camera placed under the tongue.

      The hypothesis is that administration of a fluid challenge at a faster rate, over 5 minutes
      as opposed to 20 minutes, will be a more effective test of the cardiovascular response. An
      effective fluid challenge is defined as one that causes a significant rise in mean systemic
      filling pressure. As such, a higher proportion of responders will be seen in response to the
      faster rate of fluid challenge. A responder is defined by an increase in cardiac output or
      stroke volume of more than 10% from baseline in response to a fluid challenge.
