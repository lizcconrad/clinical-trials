  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-center, phase I study consisting of 2 parts. The first part is a multiple
      ascending dose (MAD) part with a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled design in 3
      treatment groups of 8 subjects (6 active; 2 placebo). The second part is a food effect (FE)
      part with a randomized, open-label, 2-period, 2-way crossover, single dose design in 8
      subjects.

      MAD part (Part 1)

      After assessing eligibility during a 4-week screening period, subjects will be randomized to
      1 of the 3 treatments as follows:

        -  Treatment A: 14 oral doses of 100 mg FP-025 (n=6) or placebo (n=2) in 8 days.

        -  Treatment B: 14 oral doses of 200 mg FP-025 (n=6) or placebo (n=2) in 8 days.

        -  Treatment C: 14 oral doses of 400 mg FP-025 (n=6) or placebo (n=2) in 8 days.

      FE part (Part 2)

      After assessing eligibility during a 4-week screening period, 1 treatment group of 8 subjects
      (8 active; 0 placebo) will be randomized to a treatment sequence (D followed by E, or E
      followed by D):

        -  Treatment D: single oral dose of 200 mg FP-025 under fasted conditions, and

        -  Treatment E: single oral dose of 200 mg FP-025 after intake of a high-fat, high-calorie
           breakfast (fed condition).

      The total study planned duration for each part, Part 1 and Part 2 of the study, is
      approximately 6 weeks, including screening period.

    <description>Safety evaluation will study the adverse event (AE) profile, clinical laboratory safety tests, vital signs, and ECG monitoring. The ECG parameter QTc will be calculated according to Fridericia's correction using the ECG parameters QT interval (QT) and RR recorded. QTc (msec) = QT (msec)/RR (sec)1/3. QT msec will be calculated with RR sec to arrive at one reported value for QTc.</description>

             defined as pre-menopausal females with a documented tubal ligation or hysterectomy or
             bilateral oophorectomy; or as post-menopausal females defined as 12 months amenorrhoea

          3. A resting systolic blood pressure of ≤150 mmHg and a resting diastolic blood pressure
             of ≤95 mmHg at screening and on Day -1.

          4. Baseline laboratory test values within reference ranges based on the blood and urine
             samples taken at screening and on Day -1. Out of normal ranges values may be accepted

          5. The subject is, in the opinion of the Investigator, generally healthy based on
             assessment of medical history, physical examination, vital signs, electrocardiogram
             (ECG), and the results of the haematology, clinical chemistry, urinalysis, serology,
             and other laboratory tests.

          6. Male subjects must use adequate contraception, if applicable, during the study and
             until 3 months after completion of the study.

          7. Subjects participating in the FE part of the study must be willing and able to consume

             surface antigen (HBsAg), or hepatitis C virus antibody (anti-HCV).

         13. The subject is a current smoker or uses other nicotine containing products. Ex-smokers
             must have ceased smoking at least 6 months prior to the first dose of study product.

         14. The subject has tested positive at screening or on Day -1 for drugs of abuse or
             alcohol.

         15. A female subject who has a positive urine pregnancy test at screening or on Day -1.

         16. The subject's corrected QT interval (QTcF) (Fridericia's correction) is &gt;450 ms as
             read on the printout of the ECG produced by the ECG equipment and evaluated by the
             Investigator at screening and on Day -1. An out-of-range or abnormal ECG may be
             repeated. In total, 3 ECGs should be recorded consecutively and the Investigator must
             evaluate the triplicate ECG. If the subject's QTcF is &gt;450 ms on at least 2 ECGs, the
             subject must be excluded.

         17. In general, subjects should refrain from excessive physical exercise and strenuous
             sports activities (endurance sports) for at least 4 days before screening and Day -1.

         18. The subject is, in the opinion of the Investigator, unlikely to comply with the
             clinical study protocol or is unsuitable for any other reason.
