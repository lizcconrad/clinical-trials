    <textblock>
      This is a randomized noninferiority multicenter trial. Patients will be stratified according
      to the participating hospital. Patients will be randomized to one of the treatment arms.

      Arm A: Patients will receive surgical resection, including Ivor Lewis esophagectomy or
      McKeown esophagectomy and systematic lymphadenectomy.

      Arm B: Patients will receive 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) and cisplatin-based chemotherapy
      concurrently with radiotherapy. Patients will receive cisplatin (60mg/m2) intravenously over
      1 hour on day 1 and receive 5-FU (3,200 ~ 4,000mg/m2) intravenously for 4 to 5 days.
      Treatment will repeat every 3 weeks for 2 courses. Patients will receive a total of 45 Gy
      irradiation (5 days a week for 5 weeks).

      Patients will be followed at 3 and 6 months after randomization, then every 6 months for
      following 2 and half years (up to 3 years after randomization), and 4 and 5 years after
      randomization.

      -  Compare 3-year overall survival between concurrent chemoradiotherapy and esophagectomy
           among patients who require additional treatment for esophageal squamous cell carcinoma
           endoscopically resected but found to have pT1b (submucosal invasion) or lymphovascular
           invasion

        -  Compare disease-free survival between concurrent chemoradiotherapy and esophagectomy in
           the same study population

        -  Compare quality of life between concurrent chemoradiotherapy and esophagectomy in the
           same study population

        -  Compare treatment-related adverse event between concurrent chemoradiotherapy and
           esophagectomy in the same study population

             invasion (pT1b) or lymphovascular invasion

          2. Regional lymph node metastasis (cN+) or distant metastasis (cM1) are suspected or
             confirmed on chest CT scans or positron emission tomography (PET)/CT scans (Equivocal
             results will be regarded as no metastasis. However, it can also perform a biopsy if
             necessary (optional))

          3. Recurrent esophageal cancer

          4. Uncontrolled systemic disease which makes participants medically unfit for additional
             treatment (esophagectomy or concurrent chemoradiotherapy) such as congestive heart
             failure, interstitial lung disease, severe pulmonary emphysema or chronic renal
             failure

          5. Gastric conduit is not available for esophageal reconstruction (ex.: previous history
             of gastrectomy)

          6. Synchronous or metachronous multiple cancers (within the past 3 years) with the
             exclusion of skin cancer, well differentiated thyroid cancer, early gastric cancer
             achieving curative endoscopic resection, or low grade prostate cancer (Gleason
