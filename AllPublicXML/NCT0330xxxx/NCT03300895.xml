  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      High-intensity interval training (HIIT) is currently considered one of the most effective
      strategies to improved cardiorespiratory fitness, which is recognized as a protective factor
      for cardiovascular diseases and metabolic diseases such as overweight and obesity. However,
      current evidence is still limited and requires clarity (frequency, time per session and
      intensity) regarding to greater increases attributed to HIIT.

      The aim of this study is to compare the effect of a low-volume high-intensity interval
      training versus a moderate-intensity continuous exercise on maximal oxygen consumption in
      overweight women 18 to 44 years old.

      Thirty-six women will be randomly assigned to one of two aerobic exercise on a real-life
      setting supervised for a physical activity instructor. The interventions will performed three
      times a week for ten-weeks (on alternate days).

      The first two weeks will correspond to the conditioning period (30 minutes between 55-65% of
      maximum heart rate (HRmax). From week three, 18 participants will perform 30 minutes of
      continuous exercise at an intensity between 65-75 % of HRmax, and the remaining 18 will
      complete 21.5 minutes of interval exercise at an intensity between 90-95% of HRmax, with
      recoveries between 50-55% of HRmax.

      All Participants will be evaluated to measure their maximal oxygen consumption, total body
      fat, waist circumference, body mass index, systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure,
      prior to start the interventions and at the end of the program (week 11).
