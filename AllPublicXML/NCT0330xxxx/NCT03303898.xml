  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Leishmaniasis is considered by the WHO as emerging and uncontrolled diseases. They are the
      second leading cause of death and the fourth leading cause of morbidity in tropical diseases.
      Leishmaniasis is parasitic reticulo-endotheliosis, the pathogenic agent of which is a
      flagellated protozoan belonging to the genus Leishmania. It is estimated that there are about
      2 million new cases per year. Effective treatments against visceral leishmaniasis are few and
      resistance problems appear. To date, only a canine vaccine is available protecting dogs from
      the development of canine leishmaniasis to L. infantum. In man, in parallel clinical cases,
      leishmaniasis is characterized by a large number of asymptomatic carriers. This is the case
      in the Alpes-Maritimes where 50% of the inhabitants of the hinterland of Nice are carriers of
      the parasite.

      the investigators wish to study the protective immune response to the parasite and more
      particularly to the asymptomatic carriers. Indeed, these patients were infected with the
      parasite and did not develop the disease. Understanding the protective immune response in
      these patients against the parasite is therefore paramount in the development of a human
      leishmaniasis vaccine.

      For this purpose, the investigator wants to make an ex vivo study of the immune response of
      lymphocytes coming from asymptomatic carriers after stimulation by Leishmania vaccine
      peptides. It also wants to describe the immune response, after stimulation by these peptides,
      in the lymphocytes of subjects asymptomatic carriers and lymphocytes from subjects not
      infected with the parasite and comparing them. This study is unicentric and non-randomized.
      It wishes to recruit 20 asymptomatic carriers of L. Infantum and 10 uninfected subjects. They
      will be selected from our database. A simple blood sample will be taken. After verification
      by quantitative PCR and western blotting of their status towards leishmaniasis, the team will
      divide them into two groups (asymptomatic or healthy). Then the blood samples will be sent to
      the team of Jean Loup Lemesre of the Laboratory INTERTRYP - UMR177 of the IRD in Montpellier.
      ELISPOT analysis and assay of cytokines and proteases to describe the immune response of the
      two groups and to compare them. In addition, cell typing will be performed by flow cytometry
      to determine the type of lymphocytes involved in the immune response against Leishmania
      peptides. HLA typing will also be performed to validate the HLA coverage of the peptides
      tested. Finally, an analysis of the transcryptome will be carried out, which will allow to
      identify the differential expression of genes and metabolic pathways involved in the immune
      response and thus to understand how asymptomatic people can control the infection.

        and western blot positive to L. Infantum (these exams will be redone as part of the study).

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Presence of known immunosuppression or immunosuppressive therapy. HIV-positive people will
        be excluded because of the immunosuppressive action of HIV on the immune system. HIV status
        will be determined by interrogation.

        Pregnant women will be excluded. A urinary pregnancy test (taken from the inclusion
        proposal) will be performed for women of child-bearing age. The results will be
        communicated to the patient by a doctor of her choice.
