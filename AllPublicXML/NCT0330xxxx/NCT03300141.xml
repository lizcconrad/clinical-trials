  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this research study is to increase understanding of error augmentation by
      applying it to visual feedback during motion tracking with a Leap Motion device - a recently
      developed optical hand tracking tool - and the LookingGlass - a new, portable virtual reality
      environment.

      In conjunction with the Leap, large, three dimensional work spaces can provide an immersive
      and virtual augmented environment for rehabilitation. Previously, experiments have utilized
      the Virtual Reality Robotic and Optical Operations Machine (VRROOM) to create such visually
      immersive environments. The Robotics lab as part of the Arms and Hands Lab on the 22nd floor
      of the Shirley Ryan Abilitylab has developed a portable version of this system, which is more
      compact and clinic-compatible. Combining this visual 3D system with the Leap creates a novel,
      more capable apparatus for studying error augmentation.

      This research study will have 3 different arms: 1.) a healthy group of individuals (Healthy
      Arm), 2.) a group of stroke survivors within 8 months of stroke (Acute Arm), and 3.) a group
      of stroke survivors that had their stroke more than 8 months ago (Chronic Arm).

      Each Arm will use the Leap motion tracker and the Looking Glass to participate in a reaching
      intervention. The healthy arm will only participate in 1 visit with an intervention with and
      without error augmented visual feedback. The Acute Arm and the Chronic Arm will both have 2
      groups: 1.) Error Augmented Visual Feedback group and 2.) Non-Augmented or Veridical Visual
      Feedback group.

      The Chronic Arm will have a structured intervention and evaluation protocol: Study staff will
      administer outcome assessments at 3 time points: a.) prior to intervention, b.) post
      intervention, and c.) 2 months after the conclusion of intervention. Intervention will occur
      over the span of 6-8 weeks with the goal of 3 1-hour sessions per week.

      The Acute Arm will have a less structured intervention that will occur while the participant
      is an inpatient at Shirley Ryan AbilityLab. Study staff will administer outcome assessments
      at at least 2 time points: a.) prior to intervention, b.) post intervention just prior to
      discharge from Shirley Ryan AbilityLab. Between initial and post intervention evaluations,
      midpoint evaluations will take place at a maximum of once per week if the participant's
      schedule, activity tolerance, and length of stay allows. Intervention will consist of 1-hour
      sessions occurring according to the availability of the participant at the rate of no more
      than 2 sessions in a 24 hour period.

      Investigators hope to investigate these questions:

        1. Can the movement of healthy individuals be characterized with error augmented visual
           feedback and veridical visual feedback?

        2. Will error augmented visual feedback or veridical visual feedback result in greater
           movement ability improvement?

           Investigators hypothesize that in the Chronic Arm, those what trained with
           error-augmented visual feedback will have improved movement ability compared to those
           who trained with veridical visual feedback.

        3. Is treatment with the looking glass and leap system feasible with an inpatient
           population?

      Investigators hypothesize that this treatment will be feasible for an inpatient population.
