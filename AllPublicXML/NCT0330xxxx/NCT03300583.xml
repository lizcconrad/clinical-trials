  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Treating and caring for people with long term conditions accounts for a substantial
      proportion of health care resources. Self-management is advocated as a mechanism that can
      empower service users with long term conditions to choose healthier options and also
      transform the relationship between service user and caregivers from one in which the former
      is a passive recipient of care to one in which they are an active partner in decision-making.

      Interstitial lung disease (ILD) is one such long term condition. Patients with ILD often
      express concern about the lack of information on possible rehabilitation programmes and other
      services that could potentially improve self-management of the disease. In addition, there is
      a general perception about a lack of co-ordination between health care professionals
      especially in relation to referral to services for comprehensive management of the disease.
      Therefore, the needs of patients with ILD and their carers, and possible gaps in service
      provision need to be explored further.

      In this study, the investigators propose to explore the needs of ILD patients from all types
      of ILD and all stages of severity and to also involve carers and clinicians. The
      investigators will conduct three focus groups for patients and carers and six one-to-one
      interviews with clinicians to explore perceptions about service gaps and needs in two ILD
      centres in South and North London, UK.

      This study will provide valuable information to develop the building blocks of a
      self-management resource and will enable the investigators to make it specific to the
      different types of ILD.
