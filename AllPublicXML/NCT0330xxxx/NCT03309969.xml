          -  Patent common femoral vein and/or femoral vein of the study leg

          -  Undergoing iliofemoral venography with the intend to treat potential iliac vein

          -  Known metal allergy precluding the possibility of stent implantation

          -  Known iodine allergy or severe renal insufficient function which are unsuitable for
