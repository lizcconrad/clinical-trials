  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Epidurals are an effective means for providing neuraxial anesthesia and analgesia. Prior
      studies in labor epidurals have demonstrated that a programmed intermittent bolus application
      of local anesthesia can improve pain control by reducing the amount of local anesthetic
      required as well as improve patient satisfaction when compared to continuous epidural
      infusions. The effects of programmed intermittent bolus of epidural local anesthetics
      compared to continuous epidural infusions in a surgical setting have yet to be elucidated.
      Our goal is to evaluate the use of programmed intermittent bolus compared to continuous
      epidural infusion in a surgical patient population. We plan to enroll patients already
      undergoing abdominal surgeries including colorectal, gynecologic, surgical oncology,
      urological where epidural anesthesia can be employed. The primary endpoints of the study will
      be the total local anesthetic consumption and total opioid consumption as surrogate markers
      for the quality of epidural anesthesia. Secondary endpoints are pain scores and functional
      measurements, patient satisfaction, and incidence of hypotension.

    <description>At our institution, the most commonly utilized form of administration of medication through an epidural (our active comparator/control) is as follows:
Combination of 0.0625% bupivacaine with 2mcg/ml of fentanyl infused at a constant rate of 8ml/hr. The patient has the ability to self administer patient controlled epidural analgesia of 2ml of the epidural medication with a lock out period of 15 min. The total maximum volume of epidural medication each hour is 16ml. These settings are managed and controlled by a epidural medication pump.
Additional oral and intravenous analgesia medications are available as scheduled and pro re nata.</description>

    <description>For the programmed intermittent epidural bolus group:
Combination of 0.0625% bupivacaine with 2mcg/ml of fentanyl will be administered as a bolus of 4ml every 30 minutes. The patient has the ability to self administer patient controlled epidural analgesia of 2ml of the epidural medication with a lock out period of 10 min. The total maximum volume of epidural medication each hour is 16ml. These settings are managed and controlled by a epidural medication pump.
Additional oral and intravenous analgesia medications are available as scheduled and pro re nata.</description>
