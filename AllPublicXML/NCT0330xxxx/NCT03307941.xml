    <textblock>
      ARTemIS-Eso is a phase I-II, three-level, open-label trial with a dose-expansion cohort at
      recommended schedule in both esophageal cancer histological groups (squamous cell carcinoma
      and adenocarcinoma) of RCT and ImT administered prior to surgery.

    <textblock>
      This study is indicated to patients with adenocarcinomas of the esophagus or
      gastro-esophageal junction and squamous cell carcinoma of the esophagus.

      The study consists of 2 parts:

      Phase I of the study is composed of the 3 following levels, corresponding to changes in the
      schedule and the number of administrations of monalizumab:

      Level 1: monalizumab (ImT) administration starts 2 weeks after the end of RCT (Total of 3 ImT
      doses). A maximum of 7 days delay is allowed.

      Level 2: monalizumab administration starts directly at the end of RCT (Total of 4 ImT doses).
      The first dose of monalizumab should be given on the following working day after the last
      radiotherapy administration.

      Level 3: monalizumab administration starts 2 weeks after the start of RCT (total of 6 ImT
      doses). A maximum of 7 days delay is allowed.

      Phase II (Expansion cohort): At the recommended level determined in phase I and according to
      the number of patients already accrued, approximately 48-51 additional patients (half-SCC and
      half-ADC) are included with the aim of assessing the activity of the recommended combination.
