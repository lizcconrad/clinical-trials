      This is a single-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, single ascending dose,
      sequential-group Phase 1 study.

      The study will be conducted utilizing a cohort design, with sequential groups of 8 subjects.
      Within each dose cohort, 6 subjects will be randomized to active, and 2 will be randomized to
      placebo. The initial cohort will receive the lowest planned dose of CA-008, and sequential
      cohorts will receive escalating doses of CA-008 in a fixed volume of administration. There
      will be at least a 6-day period between cohorts, in order to ensure a minimum of 3 days to
      review safety data from the last subject in a cohort and to allow the meeting of the Data
      Monitoring Committee (DMC) to review the safety data from the entire cohort prior to a making
      decision for dose escalation. Dose escalation rules will be protocol defined.

      Subjects will be undergoing unilateral transpositional first metatarsal osteotomy for the
      correction of hallux valgus deformity (bunionectomy). In accordance with standard of care,
      subjects will receive regional anesthesia (MAYO block) with 0.5% bupivacaine. Prior to wound
      closure, 10 mL of study drug will be injected into the soft tissues and periosteum of the
      surgical site.

      After the surgery, subjects will be monitored for 48 hours at the trial site. Safety and
      efficacy evaluations will be performed as described herein. Subjects will be required to meet
      certain pre-specified criteria prior to discharge.

             study. (Use of warfarin is allowed, at the investigator's discretion, for DVT
             prophylaxis after the surgery).

         20. History of illicit drug use, or prescription medicine or alcohol abuse (regularly
             drinks &gt; 4 units of alcohol per day; 8 oz. beer, 3 oz. wine, 1 oz. spirits) within the

         21. Have positive results on the alcohol breath test indicative of alcohol abuse or urine
             drug screen indicative of illicit drug use (unless results can be explained by a
             current prescription or acceptable over-the-counter medication at screening as
             determined by the investigator) at screening, and/or prior to surgery.
