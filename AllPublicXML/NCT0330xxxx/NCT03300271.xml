      The purpose of this randomized study is to assess the efficacy of a mobile application for
      the improvement of blood pressure and insulin resistance in people with metabolic syndrome.

      This study is a 24 week follow up randomized prevention trial. Participants visit for a
      screening test, then eligible participants are randomly assigned for one of the following
      arms; 1 intervention group using a mobile application to monitor their life style behaviors,
      1 intervention group using a mobile application for personal coaching on purpose of improving
      their life style behavior, and 1 control group providing education about managing life style
      behaviors.
