      The purpose of this study is to examine cross-sectional associations between CSF markers of
      synaptic injury (Ng and SNAP-25) and functional connectivity in default and semantic memory
      networks using 3T- fMRI in individuals with MCI (i.e. the earliest clinically detectable
      stage of cognitive impairment) due to AD or mild AD dementia (CDR 0.5-1; n=15) and
      cognitively normal controls (CDR 0; n=15).

      SPECIFIC AIMS:

      Aim 1: Investigate correlations between CSF biomarkers of synaptic injury (Ng and SNAP-25)
      and functional connectivity (FC) within the default mode network (DMN) using resting-state
      fMRI (adjusting for age, gender, apolipoprotein-E4 [APOE4] genotype, task performance, and
      regional brain atrophy) in MCI/AD and controls.

      Aim 2: Examine correlations between CSF biomarkers of synaptic injury and functional
      connectivity (FC) within the semantic memory network on task-activated fMRI using the Famous
      Name Discrimination Task (FNDT) (adjusting for age, gender, APOE4 genotype, task performance,
      and regional brain atrophy) in MCI/AD and controls.

    <description>The clinical diagnoses of amnestic MCI due to AD or mild AD dementia will be made according to standard clinical criteria as described by the National Institute of Aging -Alzheimer's Association Working Group and supported by CSF biomarker data for tau, p-tau181, and AÎ²42. This includes evaluation for other systemic or neurological disorders which could account for the cognitive impairment, and inclusion of results from ancillary structural imaging (CT or structural MRI), neuro-psychometric testing, and FDG-PET imaging (when available) into the diagnostic scheme. All participants in this group will undergo clinical and cognitive evaluations, CSF analysis, and functional MRI during resting state and semantic memory tasks.</description>
  </arm_group>
  <arm_group>
    <arm_group_label>Normal controls</arm_group_label>
    <description>Normal cognition will be defined as cognitive performance on detailed neuropsychometric testing that falls within 1 SD of age-, gender-, and education-matched norms in all cognitive domains, and no subjective report of cognitive decline from an individual's baseline (i.e. CDR 0). All participants in this group will undergo clinical and cognitive evaluations, CSF analysis, and functional MRI during resting state and semantic memory tasks.</description>

        Participants will be recruited from the community and the Memory Disorders Clinic of The
        OSU Wexner Medical Center Department of Neurology. This study will include cognitively
        normal individuals (CDR 0; n=15), individuals with a clinical diagnosis of single-domain or
        multi-domain amnestic MCI due to AD or mild AD dementia (CDR 0.5 or 1; n=15).

             anomalies)

          4. Active mood disorder

          5. Active alcohol use
