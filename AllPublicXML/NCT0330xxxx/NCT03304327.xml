      the post-concussion period.

      Athletes and patients aged 15 - 60 will receive standard sports concussion evaluations at the
      Duke Sports Science Institute (SSI) and will learn about the study by the primary clinicians
      evaluating sports concussion at the SSI. Subjects will receive yoga training either at their
      home or at the Center for Living Campus at Duke. Subjects will complete their yoga
      assignments for 5 consecutive days, along with a symptom checklist. On the 6th day, subjects
      will complete the symptom checklist and mail all checklists to the study team in a stamped
      envelope. We expect to enroll 20 subjects.

      If a subject has significant worsening of their symptoms and wishes to discontinue the study,
      they are requested to contact the study PI, Joel Morgenlander, MD. At that time, Dr.
      Morgenlander will document the specific reasons for discontinuation of the protocol. All
      follow-up care for their concussion will be through the provider they are already seeing for
      concussion. There is no significant risk to the athlete for participation except possible
      transient increase in their concussion symptoms. Benefits include possible hastening of
      recovery from their concussive symptoms and receiving training in mindfulness and yoga from a
      certified yoga instructor.
