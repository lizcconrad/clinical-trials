  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main objective of this study was to evaluate the distribution of parental representations
      concerning the use of screens by preschool children, expressed in qualitative surveys:
      perceptions of screens as a source of learning, a source of appeasement, a source of
      behavioral difficulties and a source of reduction in the social interactions of young
      children.

      The hypothesis of this study was the representations expressed in the qualitative studies
      were the reflection of the opinion of a majority of parents of young children.
