  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the effects manipulating ingested fluids can have on hydration
      status and cycling performance. There will be 4 different conditions.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Being dehydrated can decrease endurance exercise performance. The investigators wish to test
      which of three drinks is most effective at re-hydrating cyclists and if this affects
      performance. Subjects will undertake 4 tests: once dehydrated, once hydrated with water, once
      hydrated with a sports-specific drink, and once with an altered sports drink. Blood samples
      will be taken and expired gasses will be sampled at various time points throughout the tests
      for later analysis. A small amount of labelled water will be consumed with each drink, a
      technique which will allow us to quantify the absorption of each of the drinks.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Absorption of fluid through the gut</measure>
    <time_frame>To begin 10 minutes after the completion of the 90 minute steady-state cycle</time_frame>
    <description>Absorption of drinks through the gut will be measured using 2 boluses of deuterated water. This will be consumed alongside 2 of the drinks, and blood samples will be used to quantify enrichment. Total body water calculations are required to provide corrections in equations related to D2O. H218O will be consumed in order to quantify total body water: this will be provided in a single bolus before each trial.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Work done (kJ) during 15 minute cycling time-trial</measure>
    <time_frame>Throughout the 90 minute steady-state cycle &amp; the 15 minute time trial.</time_frame>
    <description>Subjects will perform a cycle ergometer protocol that has been shown to be reproducible in athletes. Subjects will complete the time trial on a Lode Excalibur cycling ergometer. Software linked to this software will record work done and power output.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Substrate utilisation</measure>
    <time_frame>Throughout the 90 minute steady-state cycle</time_frame>
    <description>Substrate utilisation will be calculated from data collected through a metabolic cart and its software. It will be measured during the 90-minute steady-state cycle for 4 periods of 3 minutes. Carbohydrate and lipid oxidation rates will be calculated using equations by Jeukendrup &amp; Wallis (2005).</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Plasma metabolites</measure>
    <time_frame>Throughout the 90 minute steady-state cycle and time-trial</time_frame>
    <description>A cannula will be used to draw blood from subjects at several time points. Whole blood samples will be analysed immediately for plasma glucose, plasma lactate, haemoglobin content, haematocrit and plasma volume. Remaining whole blood will be centrifuged immediately and its plasma split into aliquots and stored in a -20°C freezer. At the end of the trial, plasma samples will be moved to a -80°C freezer for later analysis for sodium, glycerol, and NEFA.</description>

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Heart rate</measure>
    <time_frame>Throughout the 90 minute steady-state cycle and time-trial</time_frame>
    <description>Heart rate will be measured throughout with the use of a heart rate monitor.</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>RPE (rating of perceived exertion)</measure>
    <time_frame>Throughout the 90 minute steady-state cycle and time-trial</time_frame>
    <description>RPE will be measured using the Borg Scale.</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Core body temperature</measure>
    <time_frame>Throughout the 90 minute steady-state cycle and time-trial</time_frame>
    <description>Core temperature will be measured throughout with the use of an ingestible core-body temperature pill (HQ Inc, FL, USA).</description>
