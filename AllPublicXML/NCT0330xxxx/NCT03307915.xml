        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Each participant must have documented Human immunodeficiency virus type1 (HIV-1)
             infection

          -  Each participant must be on suppressive antiretroviral treatment (ART) for at least 48
             weeks prior to randomization and on stable suppressive ART for at least 24 weeks prior
             to randomization. Changes in antiretrovirals (ARVs) can be made for
             safety/tolerability reasons only until 24 weeks prior to randomization

          -  Each participant must have started ART outside of the acute or early phase of
             infection

          -  Each participant must have a plasma HIV ribonucleic acid (RNA) less than (&lt;) 50
             copies/ milliliter (mL) at screening and at least one documented evidence of plasma
             HIV RNA &lt;50 copies/mL after the last ART change. In case of ART change within the 48
             weeks prior randomization, at least one additional more recent documented plasma HIV
             RNA &lt;50 copies/mL is required. One blip of HIV RNA greater than (&gt;)50 and &lt;200
             copies/mL within 24 weeks is acceptable, provided that the most recent (before
             screening) HIV RNA is &lt;50 copies/mL

          -  Each participant must be medically stable as confirmed by medical history, physical
             examination, vital signs, 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG), and clinical laboratory
             tests performed at screening

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Anyone who is pregnant, breastfeeding, or planning to become pregnant while enrolled
             in this study, or within 3 months after the last vaccination

          -  Anyone with contraindication to intramuscular injections and blood draws example,
             bleeding disorders

          -  Anyone with acute illness (this does not include minor illnesses such as diarrhea or
             mild upper respiratory tract infection) or temperature greater than or equal to (&gt;=)
             38.0ºC (degree centigrade) within 24 hours prior to the first dose of study vaccine;
             enrollment at a later date is permitted

          -  Anyone with a history of malignancy within 5 years before screening (exceptions are
             squamous and basal cell carcinomas of the skin and carcinoma in situ of the cervix, or
             malignancy, which is considered cured with minimal risk of recurrence)

          -  Anyone with a history of an underlying clinically significant acute or uncontrolled
             chronic medical condition or physical examination findings for which, in the opinion
             of the investigator, participation would not be in the best interest of the
             participant (example, compromise the well-being) or that could prevent, limit, or
             confound the protocol-specified assessments

          -  Anyone with a history of HIV-related illness under Centres for Disease Control and
             prevention (CDC) Category C

          -  Anyone with a history of CD4+ less than (&lt;) 200 cells per millimeter cube (cells/mm^3)

          -  Anyone with chronic active hepatitis B (measured by hepatitis B surface antigen test)
             or active hepatitis C (measured by hepatitis C virus [HCV] antibody test; if positive,
             HCV RNA polymerase chain reaction test will be used to confirm active versus past HCV
             infection) or syphilis infection that has not been effectively treated. Positive
             syphilis serology due to past effectively treated infection is not exclusionary

          -  Anyone who received or plans to receive: a) licensed live attenuated vaccines - within
             28 days before or after planned administration of any of the study vaccinations; b)
             other licensed (not live) vaccines - within 14 days before or after planned
             administration of any of the study vaccinations

          -  Anyone who received an investigational drug or used an invasive investigational
             medical device within 30 days or received an investigational vaccine within 6 months
             before the planned administration of the first dose of study vaccine. Receipt of
             prophylactic or therapeutic HIV vaccine candidate at any time is always exclusionary.
             Exceptions: Participants can be included where the vaccine received was subsequently
             licensed. Participants with proof of having received only a placebo vaccine can also
             be included
