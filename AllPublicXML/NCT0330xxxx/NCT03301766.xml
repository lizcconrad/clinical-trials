    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the addition of lidocaine % transdermal patches to standard therapy
      in the treatment of acute non-radicular low back pain in patients discharged from the
      Emergency Department. In addition to standard therapy, half of the participants will receive
      medicated patches while the other half will receive non-medicated patches.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Low back pain is a common emergency department (ED) chief complaint. Multiple therapies have
      been evaluated in the treatment of ED patients with low back pain including acetaminophen,
      NSAIDS, opioids, steroids, and muscle relaxants.

      Lidocaine is a local anesthetic that can be administered by various routes. It is used in a
      transdermal patch for the treatment of pain. It is commonly used for focal causes of pain,
      including low back pain. The addition of lidocaine 5% patches to standard low back pain
      therapy has not been rigorously evaluated, although it is frequently used.
