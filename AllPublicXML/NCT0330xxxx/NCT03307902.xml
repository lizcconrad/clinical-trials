  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      During the course of chronic hepatitis B infection, patients may undergo hepatitis B surface
      antigen (HBsAg) seroclearance, resulting in undetectable circulating HBsAg. With the advance
      of sensitive nucleic acid detection techniques, HBsAg-negative subjects with detectable HBV
      DNA in sera or liver tissues can be identified. Patients who have undetectable HBsAg and yet
      detectable HBV DNA in sera or liver tissues are defined as having occult HBV infection (OBI).
      OBI as a cause of liver disease in HBsAg-negative patients remains clinically important
      [1,2]. Studies conducted by our research group had demonstrated that patients with HBsAg
      seroclearance could still develop flare of hepatitis B, advanced liver diseases and HCC
      [3-6]. Prevention of these complications in OBI patients by conventional intramuscular
      hepatitis B vaccination (HBVv) remains elusive with poor amnestic anti-HBs response [7].

      The objective of this prospective double-blind randomized controlled trial is to evaluate the
      effect and safety of topical treatment with imiquimod immediately before intradermal
      vaccination with Sci-B-Vac™ in patients with OBI. Our a priori hypothesis is that imiquimod
      pretreatment would improve immune responses to Sci-B-Vac™ further in OBI patients, resulting
      in HBsAb conversion. Thereby preventing subsequent complications including flare of
      hepatitis, cirrhosis and HCC in these patients.

      This randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial will compare the safety, immunogenicity
      and clinical efficacy of Sci-B-Vac™ with topical ointment pretreatment among 5 groups. Group
      1: Intradermal Sci-B-Vac™ with topical imiquimod ointment pretreatment; Group 2: Intradermal
      Sci-B-Vac™ with topical aqueous cream (placebo) pretreatment; Group 3: Intramuscular
      Sci-B-Vac™ with topical imiquimod ointment pretreatment.

      Vaccination Regimen and Data Collection Enrolled patients will be randomized into 3 groups
      after written informed consent. Each patient will receive a 3 doses Sci-B-Vac™ regime at 0, 1
      and 6 months. Group 1 will receive a total of 10μg intradermal HBsAg each time with topical
      imiquimod ointment pretreatment; Group 2 will receive a total of 10μg intradermal HBsAg each
      time with topical aqueous cream pretreatment. Group 3 will receive a total of 10μg
      intramuscular HBsAg each time with topical imiquimod ointment pretreatment.

      The primary outcome measurement will be the seroprotection rate of the HBVv at 12 months
      after the first dose of vaccination and the secondary outcome measurements will include the
      seroconversion rate, the GMT fold increase and the safety of the intradermal Sci-B-Vac™ with
      topical imiquimod treatment at other time points.
