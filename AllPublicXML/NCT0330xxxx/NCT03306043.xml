  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label extension study to Study 200622.In this study subjects from Study
      200622 will be continued on 4-weekly dosing with open-label mepolizumab 300 milligram (mg)
      subcutaneously (SC) for an additional 20 Weeks after completing the 32 Week study assessments
      post-randomization, while they continue with their background HES therapy per standard of
      care (SoC). Subjects from study 200622 will participate in this extension study if they had
      completed the 32-Week treatment period in study 200622 or if they were withdrawn from the
      study pre-maturely, but were continued in the study per protocol until 32 Weeks from
      randomization. Data from this study (205203) and 200622 will be combined to provide up to
      52-Week exposure data to further characterize the long-term safety profile of mepolizumab and
      provide additional data on the clinical benefit in HES subjects beyond 32 Weeks. The duration
      of the study participation will be 20 Weeks for subjects who continue with mepolizumab
      treatment via MHE104317/MHE112562 after this open-label extension study; and 28 Weeks for
      subjects who do not continue with MHE104317/MHE112562.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Age 12 years and older subjects who were enrolled in Study 200622.

          -  To be considered for Study 205203, subjects from study 200622 must have completed
             32-Week treatment period in the study or if the subject was withdrawn from study
             treatment prematurely during the 200622 study, but continued in the study per protocol
             (including HES flare-related assessments) until 32 Weeks from randomization.

             clinical benefit from mepolizumab must outweigh any potential safety or tolerability
             risk in Study 205203.

             non-biologic) within the past 30 days or 5 drug half-lives whichever is longer, prior
