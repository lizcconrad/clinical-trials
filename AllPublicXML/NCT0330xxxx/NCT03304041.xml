  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary aim of our study is to carry out a randomized trial to evaluate the efficacy of
      low-FODMAPs dietary therapy compared to conventional therapy for IBS patients recruited from
      tertiary hospitals in China. Secondary aims of this research include an analysis of clinical,
      physiological and microbiological factors that may predict IBS patient response to this
      dietary intervention.

      Visit 1：Enrollment &amp; Screening &amp; Run-in period Patients who meet the inclusion criteria will
      be asked to complete IBS Baseline Assessment Questionnaires according to Rome III and Rome
      IV.Subjects that meet the criteria will receive verbal and written information about the
      study and provide written informed consent. After meeting with the dietitian and physician
      who will provide instructions, they will be asked to complete Combined Nutrient and Lactulose
      Breath Test.[16] Additionally, a baseline food and symptom diary will be completed in a
      (minimum) 14 day run-in period after breath test (the first 48hr after the breath test will
      not be included in this analysis). This diary record prior to the intervention will document
      baseline symptom severity and capture the habitual diet of IBS patients.

      Visit 2: Randomization &amp; Intervention. After the run-in period, patients will come back to
      the clinic to receive dietary instruction ahead of starting the intervention. At the same
      visit subjects will provide fresh stool for fermentation analysis (including short chain
      fatty acids and pressure detection) and blood for cytokines analysis. Subjects will then be
      randomly assigned to either low FODMAP diet (LFD) group or standard dietary advice (SDA)
      group by computer-generated random number table. Participants will receive food instructions
      by a dietitian, according to their assignment. Throughout the study, only the dietitian will
      be aware of the assignment of the intervention given. Both diet therapy will last for 3
      weeks, and all the subjects are instructed to complete daily food and symptom diary through a
      provided booklet. IBS Symptoms Severity Scores (IBS-SSS) is evaluated every week and the
      dietitian who is not aware of the allocation will make a telephone follow-up to assess
      patient adherence.

      Visit 3: End of treatment &amp; Follow-up. After 3 weeks of intervention, the participants will
      attend a follow-up appointment and complete the IBS Post-Intervention Assessment
      Questionnaires. Fresh stools and blood are recollected at this visit to evaluate for possible
      change in gut microbiota and cytokines after diet intervention.
