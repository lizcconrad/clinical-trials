  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Depression and anxiety are prevalent and disabling conditions that often go untreated.
      Internet-delivered Cognitive Behaviour Therapy (ICBT) is a relatively new approach to
      treatment that is a convenient way for patients to access care. ICBT is typically highly
      standardized and involves patients reviewing weekly lessons over the Internet. Patients also
      receive brief weekly support from a therapist via secure emails or phone calls. Past research
      shows that ~75% of patients complete ICBT and report large symptom improvements. Although
      these results are very promising, research also suggests that ICBT could potentially be
      improved by being more personalized in terms of amount of therapist contact, especially for
      clients with more severe symptoms. The current trial will involve therapists who work in a
      clinic that specializes in ICBT. Over one year, 440 patients with depression and/or anxiety
      will be randomized to either receive standardized (5 lessons completed in 8 weeks; once week
      therapist contact) or personalized ICBT (5 lessons completed in 8 weeks; personalized
      therapist contact depending on needs of patient). Psychosocial outcomes of patients in the
      two treatment arms will be compared post-treatment and at 3-month, 6-month, and 1-year
      follow-up from enrollment. Data on intervention usage, satisfaction measures, and costs will
      also be assessed.
