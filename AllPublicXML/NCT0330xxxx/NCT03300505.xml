  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test the effectiveness (how well the drug works), safety, and
      tolerability of the investigational drug combination of ARRx (also known as AZD5312) plus
      pembrolizumab in patients with metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer.

             cell/neuroendocrine differentiation is not allowed.

          -  Progressive metastatic prostate cancer despite castrate levels of serum testosterone
             (&lt; 50 ng/dL). Patients must continue primary androgen deprivation with an LHRH
             analogue or antagonist if they have not undergone bilateral orchiectomy.

          -  Patients may have either non-measurable disease OR measurable disease per RECIST 1.1.

          -  Patients treated with first generation anti-androgen as most recent systemic therapy
             (e.g. bicalutamide, nilutamide) must have at least 4 weeks elapsed from treatment
             discontinuation to start of protocol therapy with evidence of disease progression by
             PCWG3 criteria following discontinuation of prior anti-androgen.

          -  Patients must have been previously treated with abiraterone and/or enzalutamide.

          -  Has a known history of active tuberculosis (TB) (Bacillus tuberculosis).

          -  Has an active infection requiring systemic therapy.

             cooperation with the requirements of the trial. At the time of signing informed
             consent is a known regular user of any illicit drug(s) or had a recent history of drug
             or alcohol abuse.
