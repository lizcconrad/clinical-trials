    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, open-label, active controlled, Phase 2 study designed to assess the
      safety, tolerability, efficacy, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of weekly and
      semi-monthly doses of GX-H9 in the treatment of Paediatric Growth Hormone Deficiency (PGHD)

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Pre-pubertal children with either isolated GHD, or GH insufficiency as part of
             multiple pituitary hormone insufficiency, idiopathic or organic GH insufficiency
             (e.g., due to pituitary tumor, pituitary or brain surgery):

               -  Boys: 3 years ≤ boy's age ≤ 11 years

               -  Girls: 3 years ≤ girl's age ≤ 10 years

          2. GHD confirmed by 2 different GH provocation tests with peak GH concentration below 10
             ng/mL as described in consensus guidelines. Well documented historical GH provocation
             tests can be used for study eligibility providing that the tests are performed as
             defined in Appendix 2 (e.g. the same sampling time points). Data of each historical GH
             stimulation test will be reviewed by Medical Monitor and Sponsor in order to assess
             acceptance for the study

          3. Without prior exposure to any rhGH therapy

          4. Bone age (BA) is not older than chronological age and should not be greater than 9
             years for girls and 10 years for boys

          5. Impaired height and height velocity defined as:

               -  Height (HT) of at least 2.0 standard deviations (SD) below the mean height for
                  chronological age (CA) and gender according to the standards from Prader et. al
                  1989, (HT SDS ≤ -2.0)

               -  Annualized height velocity (HV) of at least 1 SD below the mean HV for
                  chronological age and gender according to the standards of Prader et al (1989).
                  The interval between two height measurements should be at least 6 months (but not
                  longer than 18 months) before inclusion

          6. All subjects must have at least one cranial imaging study [magnetic resonance imaging
             (MRI) or computed tomography (CT)] prior to randomization:

               -  To exclude intracranial causes of GHD in subjects without history of pituitary
                  tumor [obtained within 6 months prior to informed consent signing, or

               -  Subjects with a previously treated pituitary tumor must have no tumor progression
                  for at least the past year [obtained within 3 months prior to informed consent
                  signing, compared with a previous MRI or CT performed at least 12 months earlier]

               -  If not performed within these specified time frames prior to informed consent
                  signing, may be performed as a part of the screening procedures

             sex according to the 2000 CDC standards

          8. Baseline IGF-1 level of at least 1 SD below the mean IGF-1 level standardized for age
             and sex (IGF-1 SDS≤ -1.0) according to the central laboratory reference values. One
             IGF-1 retest is allowed during the Screening period if first results were not higher
             than

             -0.85 SDS and if GH stimulation tests results and auxology parameters met eligibility
             criteria

          9. Children with normal fundoscopy (ophthalmoscopy) at screening (without signs/symptoms
             of intracranial hypertension as assessed by fundoscopy) - it is highly recommended to

             replacement therapy, as appropriate, is acceptable

         11. Normal 46 XX karyotype for girls
