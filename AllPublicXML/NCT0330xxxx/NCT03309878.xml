    <textblock>
      This randomized phase I/II trial studies the best dose and side effects of mogamulizumab in
      combination with pembrolizumab and to see how well they work in treating patients with
      lymphomas that have come back after a period of improvement or does not respond to treatment.
      Monoclonal antibodies, such as mogamulizumab and pembrolizumab, may interfere with the
      ability of cancer cells to grow and spread.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) or recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of
      mogamulizumab when administered in combination with pembrolizumab in patients with relapsed,
      refractory lymphomas. (Phase I) II. To assess the safety and tolerability of mogamulizumab
      when administered in combination with pembrolizumab in patients with relapsed, refractory
      lymphomas. (Phase I) III. To assess the 12-month progression-free survival of mogamulizumab
      when administered in combination with pembrolizumab compared to pembrolizumab alone in
      patients with relapsed and refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphomas. (Phase II)

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To observe and record anti-tumor activity. (Phase I) II. To assess the overall response
      rate, complete response rate, partial response rate, duration of response of mogamulizumab
      and pembrolizumab compared to pembrolizumab alone in patients with relapsed and refractory
      diffuse large B-cell lymphomas. (Phase II)

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine whether 12-month progression-free survival of mogamulizumab and pembrolizumab
      when administered to patients with relapsed and refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphomas
      differs based on the presence or absence of mutations in B2M or CD58 or amplifications in
      PD-L1.

      II. To determine whether 12-month progression-free survival of mogamulizumab and
      pembrolizumab when administered to patients with relapsed and refractory diffuse large B-cell
      lymphomas differs based on changes in CD8 T-cell, natural killer (NK) cell, and FoxP3+
      regulatory T cell (Treg) prevalence in response to therapy as measured by
      immunohistochemistry.

      III. To determine whether mogamulizumab and pembrolizumab alters the prevalence,
      immunophenotype and function of peripheral blood regulatory T-cells as well as effector CD4
      and CD8 T-cells by multi-parametric flow cytometry.

      IV. To determine whether differences in tumor metabolism as measured by liquid
      chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) correlate with differences in baseline immune
      infiltration as measured by ribonucleic acid sequencing (RNA-seq) or with 12-month
      progression-free survival of mogamulizumab and pembrolizumab when administered to patients
      with relapsed and refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphomas.

      OUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose-escalation study of mogamulizumab followed by a phase II
      study. Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.

      ARM I: Patients receive pembrolizumab intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on day 1 and
      mogamulizumab IV over 60 minutes on days 1, 8 and 15 of course 1, then day 1 of subsequent
      courses.

      ARM II: Patients receive pembrolizumab IV over 30 minutes on day 1.

      In both arms, courses repeat every 21 days for up to 2 years in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 4 weeks.
