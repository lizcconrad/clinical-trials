    <textblock>
      The main purpose of this study is the evaluation of the efficacy of zoledronic acid on bone
      density in children with osteoporosis caused by multiple disabilities.

      Secondary purposes are:

        1. Description of child population with osteoporosis in the context of motor impairment in
           Lorraine region

        2. Description of osteoporosis stage (level of bone mineralization and clinical
           consequences) in children with multiple disabilities

        3. Description of current osteoporosis preventive care

        4. Description of risk factors associated to bone status (drugs)

        5. Evaluation of zoledronic acid treatment on fracture numbers

        6. Evaluation of zoledronic acid on phosphocalcic profile

        7. Description of side effects of zoledronic acid in this indication

        8. Description of treatment effects in the sub-population of children with Rett syndrome.
