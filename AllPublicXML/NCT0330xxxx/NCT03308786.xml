      The purpose of this pilot study is to examine the effects of eight 5-day cycles of
      subcutaneous recombinant interleukin-2 (rIL-2) given every 8 weeks on levels of
      replication-competent HIV in CD4 cells and on the size of HIV viral reservoir in up to 20
      participants with chronically suppressed HIV infection (viral load &lt;50 copies/mL).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Interleukin-2 (IL-2) has been extensively studied in HIV infected individuals with no
      demonstrated clinical benefit as far as improving survival or decreasing risk of progression
      to AIDS. The results of the two landmark, international, multicenter, phase III, randomized
      trials of IL-2 in HIV infected participants (SILCAAT and ESPRIT) have been recently
      published. These trials, which started more than a decade ago, enrolled over 5800
      participants who were randomized to anti-retroviral therapy (ART) +/- IL-2 and showed no
      benefit to IL-2 treatment in survival or progression to AIDS. Many individuals with HIV
      infection can lead normal lives on ART but replication-competent virus remains within resting
      CD4+ cells, referred to as the &quot;HIV reservoir&quot;. There is a renewed interest in strategies to
      decrease or eliminate the viral reservoir in an attempt to provide a sterilizing or a
      functional &quot;cure&quot; for HIV that would allow the discontinuation of ART, which currently must
      be taken life-long. These therapies have long-term metabolic and cardiovascular toxicities as
      well as substantial cost. More recent data suggest that IL-2 administration may decrease the
      size of the HIV reservoir, getting ART-treated participants closer to levels of HIV
      persistence that may ultimately allow for sterilizing or functional cure.

      The purpose of this pilot study is to examine the effects of eight 5-day cycles of
      subcutaneous recombinant interleukin-2 (rIL-2) given every 8 weeks on levels of
      replication-competent HIV in CD4 cells and on the size of HIV viral reservoir in up to 20
      participants with chronically suppressed HIV infection (viral load &lt;50 copies/mL).
