  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) derived from the
      fat tissue can be safely administered into the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of patients with
      spinal cord injury. Adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (AD-MSCs) have been used in
      previous research studies at the Mayo Clinic. All subjects enrolled in this study will
      receive AD-MSC treatment, which is still experimental and is not approved by the U.S. Food
      and Drug Administration (FDA) for large scale use. However, the FDA has allowed the use of
      this agent in this research study.

      The proposed study is an open label, prospective Phase I safety and feasibility study of the
      intrathecal injection of autologous culture-expanded AD-MSCs in patients with severe
      traumatic spinal cord injury (SCI). All subjects will receive the same dosage of stem cells
      via intrathecal injection. Enrolled subjects will first undergo a minor surgical procedure in
      which a sample of the patient's adipose tissue will be harvested from a small incision in the
      patient's abdomen or thigh. The subject's adipose tissue will then be used to derive and
      culture-expand AD-MSCs for 4-6 weeks. Autologous AD-MSCs will be transplanted through
      intrathecal injection at the level of L4-5 under fluoroscopic guidance at a single dose of
      100 million cells. Patients will be evaluated at set intervals following the injection: day
      2, day 3, week 1, week 2, week 4, week 24, weeks 48, week 72 and week 96.

    <time_frame>baseline, 4 weeks post-treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Serological test: C-reactive protein (CRP) is produced by the liver. The level of CRP rises when there is inflammation throughout the body. It is one of a group of proteins called acute phase reactants that go up in response to inflammation. C-reactive protein is measured in milligrams of CRP per liter of blood (mg/L). Normal CRP levels are below 3.0 mg/dL.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate (ESR)</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 4 weeks post-treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Serological test. The erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) is the rate at which red blood cells sediment in a period of one hour.

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Blood Urea Nitrogen (BUN)</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 4 weeks post-treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Serological test - basic metabolic panel. A blood urea nitrogen (BUN) test measures the amount of nitrogen in the blood that comes from the waste product urea. Urea is made when protein is broken down in the body. Urea is made in the liver and passed out of the body in the urine. A BUN test is done to see how well the kidneys are working. Results of the blood urea nitrogen test are measured in milligrams per deciliter (mg/dL).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Creatinine</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 4 weeks post-treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Serological test - basic metabolic panel. Creatinine is a waste product produced by muscles from the breakdown of a compound called creatine. Almost all creatinine is filtered from the blood by the kidneys and released into the urine, so blood levels are usually a good indicator of how well the kidneys are working. Results are reported in mg/dL.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Sodium</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 4 weeks post-treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Serological test - basic metabolic panel. A sodium blood test allows the doctor to see how much sodium is in the subject's blood. It helps maintain normal blood pressure, supports the work of your nerves and muscles, and regulates your body's fluid balance. A normal sodium level is between 135 and 145 milliequivalents per liter (mEq/L) of sodium.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Potassium</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 4 weeks post-treatment</time_frame>

  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Aspartate Aminotransferase (AST)</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 4 weeks post-treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Serological test - basic metabolic panel. Inflamed or injured liver cells leak higher than normal amounts of certain chemicals, including liver enzymes, into the bloodstream, which can result in elevated liver enzymes on blood tests. The reference range for aspartate aminotransferase (AST) is as follows: Males: 6-34 IU/L, Females: 8-40 IU/L.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
