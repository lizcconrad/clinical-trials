      This is an open-label, phase I/II study of intra-cerebral administration of
      adenovirus-associated viral vector containing the human NAGLU cDNA to children suffering from
      Sanfilippo type B syndrome.

      Four patients, 18 months up to the 5th birthday, have been included.

      The inclusion period will be 8 to 12 months. The duration of follow-up for each patient is 1
      year post-surgery. The duration of the first extension phase is 18 months. The duration of
      the second extension phase is 36 months. Therefore, the maximum time of the follow-up will be
      66 months

        Inclusion criteria:

          -  Age: 18 months up to 60 months (5th birthday);

          -  Onset of clinical manifestations related to mucopolysaccharidosis type IIIB (MPSIIIB);

          -  NAGLU activity in peripheral blood cell and/or cultured fibroblast extracts of less
             than 10% of controls;

          -  Patient affiliated to, or covered by a French social security regimen, or European
             patients with European Health Insurance Card;

          -  Family understanding the procedure and the informed consent;

          -  Signed informed consent by both parents or legal representative;

          -  Vital laboratory parameters within normal range.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Presence of brain atrophy on baseline MRI judged on a cortico-dural distance of more
             than 0.6 cm;

          -  Any condition that would contraindicate general anesthesia;

          -  Any other permanent medical condition not related to MPSIIIB that could contraindicate
             the study participation;

          -  No independent walking (ability to walk without help);

          -  Any medication aiming at modifying the natural course of MPSIIIB given during the 6
             months before vector injection (sleep and mood regulators are accepted);

          -  Any condition that would contraindicate treatment with Modigraf®, Cellcept® and
             prednisolone (Solupred® and Solumedrol®).
