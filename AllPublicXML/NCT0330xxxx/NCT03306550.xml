  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The combination of anti-platelet medicine treatment and Chinese traditional medicine (TCM)
      promoting blood circulation to removing blood stasis is widely used in treatment for
      cardiovascular disease. However, the material foundation, effective mechanism and drug-drug
      interaction is still not clear. In order to solve the puzzle of rational use of Joint
      application by TCM and Western Medicine(WM),investigators conduct a research on mechanism of
      drug-drug interaction between salvianolate injection and aspirin based on metabolic enzyme
      and PK-PD model. This clinical trial contain three groups, aspirin group, salvianolate
      injection group and combination (salvianolate injection+aspirin) group. Investigators collect
      blood samples at special time points during post-administration.Investigators have already
      find out the Salvianolate's pharmacokinetic characteristics in vivo and establish the
      biological sample-testing analysis method in previous research. Depending on these results,
      this clinical trial aim to explore the pharmacodynamics-pharmacokinetics(PK-PD)
      characteristics of combination with Salvianolate and aspirin through biomarkers, blood
      concentration. Finally clarify the TCM and WM material basis and mutual mechanism of drug
      interaction and guide reasonable clinical prescription.
