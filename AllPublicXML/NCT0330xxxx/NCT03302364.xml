  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Risperidone is a selective monoamine receptor antagonist. It plays an antipsychotic effect by
      antagonizing 5-HT2 / D2 receptor. As a second-generation antipsychotic drug, risperidone is
      metabolized to 9-hydroxy Risperidone in the body very quickly. There are individual
      differences in the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of risperidone. For example, CYP2D6
      genotype can greatly affect the metabolism of risperidone, and provide evidence for adjusting
      the type and dose of medication to treat Schizophrenia. In this study, we will verify the
      correlation between the polymorphisms of genes related with risperidone drug metabolites,
      drug transporters, drug targets and drug metabolism, pharmacodynamics, adverse reactions in
      Chinese population, providing basis for clinical rational use of risperidone.
