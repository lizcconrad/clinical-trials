  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Undernutrition at the time of diagnosis of active tuberculosis is a risk factor for increased
      mortality, and lack of weight gain during anti-tuberculous treatment has been linked to an
      increased relapse risk. The purpose of this study is to test the effect of Lacprodan® DI-8090
      whey protein concentrate on anthropometric measures, treatment outcome and health-related
      quality of life, against standard practice during anti-tuberculous treatment on patients with
      a BMI &lt;20 living in Guinea-Bissau.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      It is hypothesized that patients with tuberculosis receiving whey protein concentrate as
      nutritional supplement will experience a greater gain in adverse anthropometric measures, and
      experience a decreased risk of relapse and death, compared with patients with tuberculosis,
      who do not receive nutritional supplement. 260 patients will be recruited from and
      included/randomized at 4 trial sites in Bissau, Guinea-Bissau (Bandim Health Center, Belem
      Health Center, Cuntum Health Center and Hospital Raoul Follereau). Patients randomized to the
      intervention arm will receive one package of whey protein concentrate (approx. 62.5g) per day
      for the duration of the 6-month long anti-tuberculous treatment. Patients will be followed
      bimonthly during the treatment period, with clinical examinations, blood sample analyses, and
      nutritional status and dietary intake assessments.
