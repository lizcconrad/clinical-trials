  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to determine whether treatment with daratumumab
      administered subcutaneously (SC) prolongs progression-free survival (PFS) compared with
      active monitoring in participants with high-risk smoldering multiple myeloma (SMM).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study consists of 3 phases: Screening Phase (up to 28 days), an Active Monitoring Phase
      or a Treatment Phase of 39 cycles or 36 months (whichever occurs first), and a Follow-up
      Phase which will continue until death, lost to follow-up, consent withdrawal, or study end
      (approximately 8 years after the first participant is randomized), whichever occurs first.
      Active monitoring cycles and treatment cycles are 4 weeks in length. For all participants,
      disease evaluations will be performed every 12 weeks until confirmed progressive disease
      (PD). After PD, survival is to be followed at least every 6 months, until the end of the
      study. Participants will undergo tumor assessments, pharmacokinetics, biomarkers and safety
      evaluations (adverse events, laboratory tests, vital sign measurements, physical
      examinations, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group [ECOG] performance status) over the time.
