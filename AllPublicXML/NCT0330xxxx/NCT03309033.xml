  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:

      HPV is the human papillomavirus. Women who get infected with it can get cervical cancer. The
      Costa Rica vaccine trial (CVT) studied an HPV vaccine for young women. A Long Term Follow Up
      (LTFU) study was done 10 years later. Researchers want to follow up with the women in these
      studies for 5 more years. This will help them learn more about the risks and benefits of the
      HPV vaccine.

      Objectives:

      To study anti-HPV-16/18 antibodies over the long term in women who got an HPV vaccinate. To
      study how antibody levels have changed depending on the dose and type of vaccine.

      Eligibility:

      Women in the original CVT LTFU study

      Design:

      Staff will contact participants from the CVT LTFU study. This will be done by phone or in
      person at home. Participants will be asked about participating in a new study.

      Participants who agree will have their first study visit and sign the informed consent
      document.

      Participants will answer questions about sexual behavior, smoking, contraceptives, and
      reproductive history.

      Participants will have blood collected.

      Study visits will be conducted either in a clinic or at home.

    <textblock>
      Human papillomavirus (HPV) infection is necessary for the development of cervical cancer.
      Worldwide, infection with HPV types 16 and 18 account for approximately 70% of cervical
      cancer cases. Currently available data suggest that prophylactic vaccination against HPV
      types-16 and 18 is nearly 100% effective in preventing persistent cervical infections and
      resultant disease from these types for at least five years following vaccination. The U.S.
      National Cancer Institute (NCI) and the ACIB (formerly PEG) conducted a community-based,
      randomized clinical trial (RCT) in Costa Rica (called the Costa Rica Vaccine Trial, CVT)
      pre-licensure to evaluate the VLP-based, bivalent HPV vaccine. One of the more unexpected and
      novel discoveries showed that, in a post-hoc analysis, protection over four years against
      HPV16/18 infections among women initially uninfected with these types was uniformly high for
      recipients of one, two, or three doses after four years of follow-up in the blinded phase of
      the CVT. Among women who received a single dose, HPV16 and HPV18 antibody titers (assessed by
      ELISA) were substantially higher than those among unvaccinated women previously exposed to
      HPV16/18; titers remained stably elevated from 6-to-48 months post-vaccination, albeit at
      lower levels than for two or three doses. These and other data have motivated a new
      undertaking to directly evaluate the protection afforded by single-dose regimens of the HPV
      vaccines in a formal RCT. Complementary to the non-inferiority data that will be generated
      over 4 years in this new RCT, it is imperative that we continue to evaluate long-term
      stability of antibody responses. To do so, the current proposal aims to extend the follow-up
      time of women in the original CVT who received one or two doses and a subset who received
      three doses of the HPV vaccine from 10 to 15 years (two additional visits from ~1000 women at
      years 13 and 15, respectively) to describe, by dose, the long-term positivity and stability
      of the antibody response to HPV vaccination. There are two main objectives to this work:

        1. Estimate the change in antibody levels between years 10 and 15 after vaccination.

        2. Estimate the proportion of individuals who become seronegative (i.e.: serorevert)
           between years 10 and 15 after vaccination.

      This research will provide invaluable data that will allow for the continued investigation
      into the risks and benefits of the prophylactic HPV vaccine; also, new serologic testing of
      banked samples from the original phases of this research will be conducted to merge data from
      years 1 and 10 with years 13 and 15 to provide a complete assessment of antibody changes over
      time. Additional immunologic assays will be conducted, including assessment of antibody
      avidity, between years 10 and 15.

      The CVT EXTEND study will be conducted by the ACIB team, which has extensive experience in
      conducting epidemiological and clinical studies with high ethical and scientific standards.
      These studies have high rates of recruitment and retention.

          -  Women aged 30-38 who participated in the CVT LTFU study.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

        -This study will exclude a random subset of the three-dose women. This exclusion is due to
        the following scientific considerations:

          -  Other global investigations are following three-dose HPV vaccine recipients from the
             initial trials, and these investigations will yield adequate information in advance of
             our study

          -  For immunological outcomes, we are well powered, and only need information from a
             subset.
