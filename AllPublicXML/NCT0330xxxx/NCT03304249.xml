  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to learn if providing a family-based group program using mobile
      health technology (iAmHealthy Healthy Lifestyles Program) is effective at improving child
      weight, nutrition, and physical activity.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a cluster-randomized study that will test the iAmHealthy Healthy Lifestyles Program
      versus a standard approach to weight loss in kids current in 2nd thru 4th grade. The
      iAmHealthy Healthy Lifestyles Program utilizes mobile tools to deliver the weight loss
      program to kids and families in rural settings. This study will include kids from schools in
      rural cities/counties, and their parents, and they will be randomly assigned to a group by
      their school.

      The iAmHealthy Healthy Lifestyles Program is a rurally tailored telemedicine intervention. It
      delivers behavioral, nutritional, and physical activity topics for kids and their families.
      The total length of the intervention will be about 8 months, which coincides with the length
      of a typical school year.
