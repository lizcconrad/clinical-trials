  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators primary objective is to conduct a randomized trial to determine the effect
      of diabetes group prenatal care on glycemic control in women with type 2 diabetes and
      gestational diabetes.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Long term, the investigator aims to test the central hypothesis that group prenatal care,
      compared to traditional prenatal care, will improve glycemic control and, ultimately,
      maternal and neonatal outcomes in women with type 2 and gestational diabetes. The objective
      of this proposal is to conduct a randomized trial to determine the effect of diabetes group
      prenatal care on glycemic control in pregnant women with type 2 diabetes and gestational
      diabetes.

    <description>Subjects randomized to routine care will receive their care in the usual diabetic clinic attended by residents and faculty. They will receive consultation with the diabetes educator at diagnosis and as needed. Patients are seen every 2 weeks (or more by provider discretion) until 37 weeks and weekly until delivery. Visits are 10-15 minutes and focus on routine screening tests and review of blood sugar logs/medication titration.</description>

    <description>Group visits will be held every 2 weeks in a continuous cycle through a six session curriculum. Women will have weekly visits beginning at 37 weeks with traditional prenatal visits on the weeks when the group does not meet. Groups of 2-12 women will meet for two hour visits and much of that time will be spent on pregnancy, behavioral health, diabetes and nutrition education. Groups will be co-facilitated by a health educator and an obstetric provider. Women may be instructed to have additional visits in the traditional clinic at the discretion of the obstetric provider.</description>
