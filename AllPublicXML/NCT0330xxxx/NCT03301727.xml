  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cognitive-behavioural therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) has been shown to be an effective
      treatment for insomnia in multiple populations, including women during pregnancy and
      postpartum. Online CBT-I has also been shown to be effective and comparable to in-person
      CBT-I, and shows promise as an accessible treatment alternative to in-person CBT-I for
      pregnant women experiencing insomnia. As the harmful consequences of insomnia or sleep
      disturbances have been well documented during late pregnancy, this randomized-controlled
      trial will compare the efficacy of both in-person and online CBT-I on pregnant women with
      insomnia to a wait-list control group.

      The primary aim of the current project is to evaluate the impact of a 6-week in-person CBT-I,
      versus online CBT-I, versus a wait-list in reducing symptoms of insomnia (assessed
      subjectively by self-report and objectively with actigraphy) experienced in pregnancy. The
      investigators hypothesize that participants who receive a 6-week program of either in-person
      CBT-I or online CBT-I (versus a wait-list) will report fewer insomnia symptoms and have
      improved objectively assessed sleep measured at one-week post-treatment. Based on previous
      research findings, the investigators do not expect that there will be a difference between
      in-person CBT-I and online CBT-I administration.

      The secondary aim is to investigate if CBT-I versus a wait-list will reduce symptoms of
      depression at one-week post-treatment. The investigators hypothesize that participants who
      receive in-person CBT-I and online CBT-I (versus a wait-list) will report fewer depressive
      symptoms measured at one-week post-treatment.

    <description>The ISI is a 7-item questionnaire designed to identify cases of insomnia and evaluate treatment outcomes. The ISI assesses severity of sleep onset, sleep maintenance and early wakening problems, sleep dissatisfaction, and perceived distress caused by sleep problems. It was found to be a clinically useful tool in assessing changes in insomnia symptoms in insomnia treatment research.</description>

    <description>The PSQI instrument is used in assessing one's sleep quality during the previous month. It consists of 19 self-rated items and 5 questions rated by the roommate or bed partner. There are seven components of the PSQI and these are subjective sleep quality, sleep latency, sleep duration, habitual sleep efficiency, sleep disturbances, use of sleeping medications, and daytime dysfunction.</description>
