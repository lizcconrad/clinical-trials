  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with hormone sensitive oligometastatic prostate cancer (≤ 5 metastatic tumours
      outside of regional pelvic nodes with no more than 3 in any organ system) and no previous
      treatment to prostate will be treated with intermittent androgen deprivation therapy +/-
      chemotherapy, stereotactic radiotherapy to all metastases, and either radical prostatectomy
      or radiotherapy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Investigators propose to do a randomized feasibility trial comparing RP vs RT to the prostate
      in the setting of hormone sensitive oligometastatic prostate cancer. SBRT will be used to
      treat all of the metastases, and this will be combined with an intermittent ADT approach.
      Adding systemic chemotherapy will be allowed. Given the past difficulties of randomizing
      patients between RP and RT in localized prostate cancer studies (like SPIRIT), investigators
      feel a small feasibility project is the first step. In the setting of metastatic disease,
      where radical treatment is not routine standard of care, we hope that patients will be more
      inclined to accept randomization. If patients do not accept their assigned randomization (ie
      they prefer RP even though they are randomized to RT, or vice versa), they will still be
      treated with their prostate intervention of choice and followed for their outcomes.
