    <textblock>
      This study will recruit from participants in the Morehouse-Emory Cardiovascular (MECA) study
      for a clinical intervention examining cardiac outcomes between participants who are
      randomized to received Health360x (a web-based and mobile-based application) or Health360x
      plus personalized health coaching. Participants will receive instruction on using the
      Health360x application and will use Health360x alone or Health360x with a health coach for 6
      months. Measures of cardiovascular health will be assessed at baseline and after the 6 month
      long intervention.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The internet can be an effective tool for driving behavior change but minority populations
      are less likely to engage or use this tool effectively. Health information technology (also
      called ehealth or e-health) can provide continuous and systematic connections to patients
      that will support their personal roles and responsibilities in their health care management.
      Ehealth technology allows for the tailoring of tools to the individual, timely information
      delivery, standardized messaging, layered content for more motivated participants, and the
      potential for greater efficiency/cost savings. Ehealth is able to provide effective and
      sustainable self-management tools for patients with chronic diseases. There is a significant
      trend towards information seeking on the internet among populations that have lower health
      literacy and are less trusting of the health system but, although minority and health
      disparities populations have increasing access to wireless and mobile technology, this has
      not translated to increased use of ehealth technologies.

      The ehealth application used in this study aims to use the internet to engage vulnerable
      populations in improving their cardiovascular health. The intervention uses an enriched
      information environment, dynamic, personalized feedback on relevant health parameters, and
      social networks to impact health literacy, optimism and other resilience factors. This study
      will test two approaches to engagement with a robust ehealth application (Health360x) for
      high risk minority patients who reside in resilient and at risk neighborhoods within metro
      Atlanta. The Health360x application is a system that frames behavior as changeable and
      adaptable in a bidirectional manner, based on the behavioral constructs of Capability,
      Opportunity, and Motivation. Capability is the psychological and physical capacity to engage
      in the activity concerned, including the necessary knowledge and skills. Opportunity refers
      to factors that lie outside the individual, that facilitate or prompt the behavior.
      Motivation is largely governed by the brain processes that energize and direct behavior,
      including goal directed conscious decision-making, habitual processes, emotional response, as
      well as analytical decision-making.

      This study is part of a larger project that is a partnership between investigators at Emory
      University and Morehouse School of Medicine who are actively involved in investigating ethnic
      disparities and incorporating the role of resilience factors in improving health status among
      black persons in metro Atlanta. The aim of this multi-disciplinary team is to establish a
      unique cohort in order to examine the associations between personal factors (psychosocial
      factors, socio-economic class, healthy behaviors and health beliefs) and environmental
      influences (neighborhood) on health behaviors and physiologic measures.

      Four hundred subjects from &quot;at risk&quot; and &quot;resilient&quot; census tracks in metro Atlanta who
      completed the population surveys will be invited to participate in the Baseline Clinical
      Study, which is part of the Morehouse-Emory Cardiovascular (MECA) Center for Health Equity
      Study. The clinical trial described here will recruit 150 participants from the MECA study
      for a clinical intervention examining cardiac outcomes between participants who are
      randomized to received Health360x (a web-based and mobile-based application) or Health360x
      plus personalized health coaching.

      Participants will receive instruction on using the Health360x application and will use
      Health360x alone or Health360x with a health coach for 6 months. Measures of cardiovascular
      health will be assessed at baseline and after the 6 month long intervention.

    <time_frame>Baseline, Month 6</time_frame>
    <description>The &quot;Life Simple 7&quot; (LS7) Cardiovascular Health Index is a public health metric by the American Heart Association (AHA) and is an index of modifiable health behaviors and cardiometabolic risk factors. The LS7 includes three health factors (blood pressure, fasting glucose, total cholesterol) and four health behaviors (body mass index (BMI), physical activity, healthy diet and smoking) and classifies each of them as &quot;ideal&quot; (score of 2), &quot;intermediate&quot; (score of 1) and &quot;poor&quot; (score of 0) levels. Total scores range from 0 to 14 and total scores between 0-4 are classified as inadequate, scores between 5-9 are considered average, and scores between 10-14 are classified as optimum cardiovascular health.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline, Month 3, Month 6</time_frame>
    <description>The Short Form-12 Health Survey Questionnaire (SF-12) is a measure of general physical and mental health. The SF-12 consists of 12 items with a Likert-type response format that measures quality of life with a Physical Component Summary (PCS) and Mental Component Summary (MCS). Subscales associated with the PCS include physical functioning, role limitations due to physical problems, bodily pain, and general health perceptions. Subscales associated with the MCS include vitality (energy and fatigue), social functioning, role limitations due to emotional problems, and mental health. The total score for each subscale ranges from 0 to 100 and low values represent a poor health state while high values represent a good health state.</description>

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Plasma Cysteine</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Month 6</time_frame>
    <description>Plasma cysteine is a biomarker of oxidative stress, which is implicated in the pathophysiology of multiple conditions including cardiovascular disease (CVD). Higher levels of cysteine are associated with increased risk of CVD.</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Cystine</measure>

    <measure>Change in CD34+ Cell Count</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Month 6</time_frame>
    <description>Cells expressing CD34 antigen (a protein encoded by the CD34 gene) are called CD34+ cells and can be isolated from blood samples. CD34+ cell count is a biomarker of regenerative capacity and reduced counts of CD34+ is associated with increased cardiovascular risk.</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Pulse Wave Velocity (PWV)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Month 6</time_frame>
    <description>Carotid-femoral artery pulse wave velocity (PWV) will be determined using transcutaneous Doppler flow velocity recordings simultaneously over the common carotid artery and the femoral artery. Aortic pulse wave velocity (PWV) estimates of the speed of the pressure wave traveling along the aorta and is regarded as a direct measure of large artery stiffness. Normal ranges for PWV are age based (PWV increases with age) and standardized thresholds for CVD risk have not been established. This study will assess the change in PWV in participants between baseline and after the 6 month intervention.</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Reactive Hyperemia Index (RHI)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Month 6</time_frame>
    <description>Reactive Hyperemia Index (RHI) is a measure of microvascular endothelial function that is calculated as a ratio of preocclusion to postocclusion pulse signal amplitude. RHI will be estimated using digital pulse amplitude tonometry (EndoPAT). Greater RHI indicates better endothelial function.</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Glutathione</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Month 6</time_frame>
    <description>Glutathione is a major antioxidant that helps eliminate peroxides and maintain cellular redox. Lower levels of glutathione are associated with cardiovascular disease.</description>

    <measure>Change in circulating progenitor cells (CPC) CD34+/CD133+</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Month 6</time_frame>
    <description>Progenitor cells (PCs), including CD34+/CD133+ cells, are part of the mechanisms underlying regeneration, and the pivotal role they play in vascular repair has only recently been appreciated. Endogenous PCs contribute to re-endothelialization of tissues after endothelial injury, attenuating progression to frank atherosclerosis. Endothelial dysfunction correlates with PC number and function and a low PC count appears to be an independent predictor of poor outcome in patients with CAD, stroke or acute lung injury. CD34+/CD133+ cell counts improved risk prediction metrics beyond standard risk factors.</description>

    <measure>Change in Augmentation Index</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Month 6</time_frame>
    <description>Augmentation index (AIx) is a composite measure of the magnitude of arterial wave reflections and systemic arterial stiffness and increases as the aortic pulse wave velocity (PWV) increases. Impaired arterial elastic properties, measured as the aortic AIx and/or PWV, are increasingly recognized as independent predictors of incident CVD events (myocardial infarction, stroke, revascularization), as well as all-cause mortality.</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Carotid Intima Media Thickness (CIMT)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Month 6</time_frame>
    <description>A CIMT scan is performed by using ultrasound determine the presence and severity of vascular disease. Presence of carotid plaque is associated with a 2-3-fold increased risk of future CVD events, and increased CIMT is associated with prevalent cardiovascular disease and an increased risk of myocardial infarction and stroke. Progression of CIMT has been used as a surrogate marker of change in CVD risk.</description>
