  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Veterans of the most recent wars in Afghanistan and Iraq (collectively, post 9/11 Veterans)
      have notable sleep problems including chronic insomnia. Here, the investigators plan to
      compare two groups of veterans with insomnia: (1) one group that completes a 6 week
      self-management-guided use of a mobile app based on cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia
      (CBTI alone) and (2) one group that completes a 6 week combined self-management-guided use of
      the mobile CBTI app in addition to a physical activity (PA) intervention (CBTI + PA). The
      investigators hypothesize that the group receiving the adjunctive 6-week PA intervention will
      have better subjective and objective sleep, higher step counts, and better functional health
      and social and community integration than those receiving CBTI alone. This pilot work will
      provide evidence to guide the design of a future randomized controlled trial.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      To determine if the addition of physical activity (PA) to (CBTI) can further enhance sleep,
      physical activity, functioning, or social engagement over and above self-management use of a
      CBTI app alone, the investigators will randomly assign post-9/11 veteran participants with
      chronic, functionally impairing insomnia to either (1) a self-management-based use of an app
      based on cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBTI; CBTI alone arm) or to (2) a
      self-management-based use of the CBTI app + a physical activity (PA) intervention (CBTI + PA)
      that includes PA monitoring (via a Fitbit device) with individualized goal-setting to
      encourage increased daily steps across the 6 weeks. For the PA goal, the investigators will
      attempt to get all participants to at least the typical 10,000 daily steps goal cited as a
      strong predictor of positive health outcomes (Choi, Pak, &amp; Choi, 2007). The investigators
      will tailor the step goals based on the person's initial level of daily steps, and increment
      step goals weekly to maximize motivation and enhance the likelihood that the participant can
      meet the goal.
