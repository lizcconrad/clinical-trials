  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The respiratory rate is an important parameter in clinical medicine. It is defined as the
      number of breaths per minute. Currently this is measured at the bedside in clinical practice
      by counting the breaths, however the gold standard for measuring this vital sign is the
      capnograph. For the patient, this involves wearing a tube in their nose and around their ears
      while trying to minimise their movement and talking so that the measurements can be taken.

      A new respiratory rate monitor, RespiraSense, is non-invasive and measures the respiratory
      rate by measuring the displacement between the ribs and abdomen. This research study is
      intended to validate that this technology is effective and accurate on people with a bigger
      body mass.

      Subjects with a BMI &gt; 35 will be invited to participate should they meet all of the
      eligibility criteria. If patients agree to participate, following informed consent, subjects
      will be monitored for one hour with both the capnograph and RespiraSense measuring at the
      same time so their results can be compared
