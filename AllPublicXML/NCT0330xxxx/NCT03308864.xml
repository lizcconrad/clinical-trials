  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Interpersonal Psychotherapy for Adolescents (IPT-A) is a manualized short-term therapeutic
      intervention that has been shown to be efficacious in a number of randomized control trials
      for adolescent depression. The primary aim of the present study is to evaluate the
      feasibility of incorporating Interpersonal Psychotherapy for Adolescents (IPT-A) into routine
      psychotherapeutic treatment at Strong Behavioral Health: Child and Adolescent Outpatient. The
      second aim of the present investigation is to examine changes in adolescent symptomatology,
      interpersonal functioning, perceived stress, and social support throughout the course of
      treatment. The third aim of the present study is to compare the effectiveness of IPT-A versus
      treatment as usual (TAU) at reducing depressive symptoms among adolescents.

    <description>Experimental: Interpersonal Psychotherapy for Adolescents (IPT-A) IPT-A is a manualized intervention for depression that targets adolescents' interpersonal context and social supports as mechanisms of change. It will be provided in accordance with the treatment manual by Child and Adolescent Outpatient Service clinicians over the course of 12-16 50-minute sessions.</description>

    <description>Treatment as usual will consist of the standard care for adolescent depressive symptoms at CAOS. TAU is not manualized; it is consistent with care typically provided in community settings. Therapists establish a working alliance, are empathetic, reflect expressed affect, and discuss options for coping with concerns as initiated by the adolescent.</description>
