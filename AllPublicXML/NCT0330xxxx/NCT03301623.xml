  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Investigators will compare Clinical Decision Support (CDS) versus Patient Education and
      Activation Tools (PEATs) in patients with an opioid prescription of six weeks or longer to
      measure outcomes that are important to patients. Primary outcomes are pain interference and
      satisfaction with patient-physician communication. Secondary outcomes are overall
      Health-Related Quality of Life and high-risk prescribing, including prescriptions over 90
      morphine milligram equivalents and coprescribing of benzodiazepines and opioids.

      Patients in the PEAT arm will receive patient materials during the intervention, developed to
      engage patients in chronic pain treatment, prior to Primary Care Physician office visits. In
      the provider-facing CDS arm, PCPs will receive computerized reminders about appropriate
      opioid use during office visits for enrolled patients. Patients in both groups will receive
      questionnaires about pain interference, quality of life, and physician-patient communication
      through the patient portal one month after each visit to their Primary Care Physician.
      Investigators will use multi-level regression models to compare the effectiveness of these
      two communication strategies.

  <detailed_description>

      Investigators will compare two strategies: (1) Engage PCPs with Clinical Decision Support at
      the point of care, raising active alerts through the Electronic Health Record (EHR) when
      there is risk of inappropriate opioid prescribing, thus leading to informed decision-making
      with the patient about alternative treatments; versus (2) Engage patients prior to their PCP
      visit using Patient Education and Activation Tools (PEATs) administered via REDCap, helping
      patients to prepare for their visit and encouraging discussion about treatment preferences,
      values and treatment goals at the time of the visit, thus leading to shared decision-making
      with the provider. Our CDS intervention will use &quot;Choosing Wisely, &quot; and CDC guidelines, and
      our Patient Education and Activation Tool intervention will use widely disseminated material
      developed by Consumer Reports and the ACPA. Informed Decision-Making (IDM) using EHR-based
      &quot;Choosing Wisely&quot; CDS alerts about appropriate opioid use, and (2) Shared Decision Making
      (SDM) using PEATs developed by the ACPA and Consumer Reports and delivered via REDCap.
      Investigators will assess whether improved communication and patient activation through these
      strategies improve patient-reported outcomes related to pain interference and HRQOL. To
      assess these outcomes, investigators will use NIH Patient Reported Outcome Measurement
      Information System (PROMISÂ®) questionnaires to capture health domains identified by our
      patient partners as most important. Using PROs will also help capture whether the use of
      either of these strategies leads to unintended consequences for patients when opioids are
      reduced and other pain management strategies - including non-pharmacological strategies - are
      not substituted.

      Recruitment procedures: Once the study is approved, the study team will send emails to
      eligible study participants with consent form so they can enroll in the study and obtain
      informed consent. Participants who consent to be part of the study can then fill out the
      first study questionnaires.

      Data collection: Upon enrollment, investigators will send eligible patients an enrollment
      questionnaire, which includes questions on: chronic pain condition, length of time in chronic
      pain, race and ethnicity, language proficiency, marital and cohabitation status,
      socioeconomic status, employment, history of pharmacologic and non-pharmacologic treatment,
      family history of addiction, surgical history related to chronic pain condition, past
      injuries related to chronic pain condition, diet, exercise, length of time with current
      primary care provider, health literacy, and knowledge about opioid medications. Investigators
      will also at this point send the five PROMIS questionnaires via REDCap. The study team will
      program the surveys to be sent via automatic email in REDCap. The email will contain a link
      where participants can access the questionnaires. The total time to take this questionnaire
      is 20 minutes.

      All patients will take the PROMIS questionnaires before and after the intervention period for
      a total of 3-4 months pre-intervention and 1-year post-intervention. When the intervention
      period is initiated, all eligible patients who have any follow-up visits during this 12-month
      period in both study arms will be sent the questionnaires via REDCap one day after each
      office visit with their PCP the Communication Questionnaire (COMRADE).

Patients within the physicians randomized to SDM will receive the PEAT materials via REDCap two days before their PCP office visit.
