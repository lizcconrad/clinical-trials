    <textblock>
      This is a phase IIa, open label, single arm, and prospective study of hormone therapy-naïve
      men with oligometastatic prostate cancer to the bone. The study will test if treating the
      primary tumor sites and 5 or fewer sites of bone-only metastasis with external beam radiation
      with concomitant systemic Radium-223 will reduce the utilization of androgen deprivation
      therapy, improve QOL and improve OS over a the comparator cohort of SWOG intermittent ADT
      historic cohort.

                  note, however, that HIV testing is not required for entry into this protocol. The
                  need to exclude patients with AIDS from this protocol is necessary because the
                  treatments involved in this protocol may be significantly immunosuppressive.
