  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the phase 1b/2 study is to determine whether PCM-075 given orally daily for 5
      consecutive days every 28 days is safe and tolerable in adult patients who have
      relapsed/refractory Acute Myeloid Leukemia, or are ineligible for intensive induction
      therapy, and to determine the maximum tolerated dose or recommended phase 2 dose of PCM-075
      in combination with decitabine or and PCM-075 in combination with low-dose cytarabine. In the
      phase 2 portion of the study, one regimen (either PCM-075 in combination with decitabine or
      PCM-075 in combination with low-dose cytarabine) will be studied to provide further data on
      the safety profile of the combination and to preliminarily assess the activity of the chosen
      combination in patients with untreated AML who are not candidates for aggressive induction
      therapy, or who have received one prior treatment for their AML.

             judged not to be candidates for re-induction therapy that includes hematopoietic cell
             transplantation. Participants who have received prior cytarabine or decitabine are not
             excluded.

             OR

             ii. Participants with newly diagnosed, untreated AML ineligible for, or who have
             refused, standard intensive induction therapy

          2. Age ≥18 years

          3. ECOG performance status ≤2

          4. Participants must be willing and able to review, understand, and provide written
             consent before starting any study-specific procedures or therapy.

          5. All men and women must agree to practice effective contraception during the entire
             study period and after discontinuing study drug, unless documentation of infertility
             exists

               1. Sexually active, fertile women must use two effective forms of contraception
                  (abstinence, intrauterine device, oral contraceptive, or double barrier device)
                  from the time of informed consent and until at least 6 months after discontinuing
                  study drug

               2. Sexually active men and their sexual partners must use effective contraceptive
                  methods from the time of participant informed consent and until at least 3 months
                  after discontinuing study drug

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Treatment-related AML or acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL)

          2. Active malignancies within 12 months with the exception of those with a negligible
             risk of metastasis or death

          4. Alanine aminotransferase and/or aspartate aminotransferase ≥2.5 x upper limit of
             normal (ULN)

          5. Total bilirubin &gt; 2.0 mg/dL (or &gt; 3.0 mg/dL in participants with documented Gilbert
             syndrome)

          6. Serum creatinine ≥2.0 mg/dL

          7. New York Heart Association Class III or IV heart disease, active ischemia or any other
             uncontrolled cardiac condition, or hypertensive or metabolic condition

          8. Myocardial infarction in the previous 12 weeks (from the start of treatment)

          9. Resting left ventricular ejection fraction &lt;50% at the time of screening

         10. QT (Interval from the beginning of the QRS complex to the end of the T wave on an
             electrocardiogram) interval with Fridericia's correction [QTcF] &gt;450 milliseconds. The
             QTcF should be calculated as the arithmetic mean of the QTcF on triplicate ECGs. In
             the case of potentially correctible causes of QT prolongation (e.g., medications,
             hypokalemia), the triplicate ECG may be repeated once during screening and that result
             may be used to determine eligibility.

         11. Planned concomitant use of medications known to prolong the QT/QTc interval

         12. Presence of risk factors for torsade de pointes, including family history of Long QT
             Syndrome or uncorrected hypokalemia

         13. Active and uncontrolled disease (other than AML) or infection as judged by the
             treating physician

         14. Treatment with systemic therapy for the primary disease within 14 days (except for
             hydroxyurea or isolated doses of cytarabine or decitabine for white blood cell
             control)

         15. Grade 2 or greater toxicities from prior therapy, except for Grade 2 toxicities that
             are not expected to resolve and that in the judgment of the Investigator do not pose a
             significant safety risk to subject participation.

         16. Participants with any other medical condition, including mental illness or substance
             abuse, deemed by the Investigator to be likely to interfere with the participant's
             ability to sign the informed consent form or his/her ability to cooperate and
             participate in the study, or to interfere with the interpretation of the results
