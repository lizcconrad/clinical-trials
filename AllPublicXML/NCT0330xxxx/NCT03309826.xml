  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to conduct a pilot randomized, controlled trial to evaluate the
      feasibility and obtain pilot outcome data for a subsequent definitive trial evaluating the
      effects of postitive airway pressure (PAP) treatment of obstructive sleep-disordered
      breathing (OSDB) on blood pressure control and maternal and fetal outcomes in hypertensive
      disorders of pregnancy. The primary aim of the pilot study is to assess feasibility measured
      as the rates of subject recruitment, adequate (&gt;4h/night) PAP adherence (primary outcome
      measure) and protocol completion. Secondary aims will be to obtain preliminary data on the
      effects of PAP on maternal blood pressure, complications of hypertension, arterial stiffness
      and vascular biomarkers, course of labor and delivery and fetal outcomes including growth
      restriction, prematurity, and neonatal distress.
