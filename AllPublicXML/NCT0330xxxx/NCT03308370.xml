  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Melasma is a common acquired disorder characterized by symmetric, hyperpigmented patches with
      an irregular outline, occurring most commonly on the face. The therapy for melasma has always
      been challenging and discouraging. Platelet rich plasma has been used over the last several
      years as an effective treatment in various surgical and medical ﬁelds. In recent years,
      Platelet rich plasma has also started to be used in the field of cosmetology. This study is
      designed to evaluate the therapeutic effect of platelet rich plasma in melasma.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Melasma is a pigmentary disorder that can be disfiguring and can cause to significant
      emotional stresses for sufferers, for which a universally effective treatment is still
      lacking. Platelet rich plasma is commonly used in dermatology and plastic surgery, especially
      for treating chronic wounds, ulcers, and burns. The most important contents of platelets are
      contained in the α-granules. Some of the bioactive substances present in the α-granules
      include platelet-derived growth factor, transforming growth factor -β1 and -β2epidermal
      growth factor, and mitogenic growth factors such as platelet-derived angiogenesis factor and
      fibrinogen.

      transforming growth factor -β1 decreases melanogenesis via delayed extracellular
      signal-regulated kinase activation. The regression of melasma in a 27-years-old woman after
      injecting platelet rich plasma for skin rejuvenation was observed, but controlled clinical
      trials are still lacking to confirm this preliminary observation.
