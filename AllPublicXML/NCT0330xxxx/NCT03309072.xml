  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate whether we can accelerate learning and improve
      associative memory performance in healthy subjects by applying transcranial Direct Current
      Stimulation (tDCS) during a Face Name memory task.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Associative memory refers to remembering the association between two items, such as a face
      and a name or a word in English and the same word in another language. It is not only
      important for learning, but it is also one of the first aspects of memory performance that is
      impacted by aging and by Alzheimer×³s disease. For decades, neuroscientists have investigated
      associative learning and memory and ways to accelerate and enhance associative learning and
      memory.

      Transcranial Direct Current stimulation (tDCS) is a non-invasive and painless electrical
      stimulation technique that has demonstrated to accelerate learning and improve memory in some
      studies. To investigate whether we can accelerate learning and improve associative memory
      using tDCS, we will compare the performance in a Face Name Associate memory task from 2
      groups. The first group will get active tDCS during the study phase of the Face Name Memory
      task, whereas the second group will get sham tDCS during the study phase of the task.
