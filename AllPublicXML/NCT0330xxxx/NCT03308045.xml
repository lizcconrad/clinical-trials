      Primary objective: safety and tolerability

      Secondary objectives: additional indicators of long term safety and indicators of clinical
      activity

      Exploratory objectives: to characterize EYS606 biodistribution, immunogenicity and biomarkers

      The maximum study duration per patient is 27 Weeks (including an up to 3 week screening
      period + 24 weeks follow-up after treatment).

      The study is conducted in 2 parts. Part 1 is a dose escalation phase which will investigate 3
      pEYS606 doses levels (lower, intermediate and higher dose) over 3 cohorts. Part 2, the
      extension phase will confirm to safety of the maximum tolerated dose from Part 1 and allow a
      preliminary assessment of efficacy.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patient must be 18 years of age or older

          -  Both female patients of childbearing potential and male patients able to father a
             child must agree to practice at least one effective method of birth control for six
             months following administration of study medication. Acceptable methods of birth
             control for this study include hormonal contraception (birth control pills, injected
             hormones, dermal patch or vaginal ring), intrauterine device, barrier methods
             (diaphragm, condom) with spermicide or surgical sterilization (hysterectomy, tubal
             ligation or vasectomy). Patients with a hysterectomy or vasectomy (or have a partner
             with a hysterectomy or vasectomy) are exempt from using these methods of birth
             control.

          -  Female patients of childbearing potential must not be pregnant or breast-feeding and
             must have a negative urine pregnancy test at baseline and throughout the study.

          -  Voluntary written informed consent before performance of any study related procedure
             not part of normal medical care, with the understanding that consent may be withdrawn
             by the subject at any time without prejudice to future medical care.

          -  Patient has only one eligible eye with the following criteria:

          -  non-infectious intermediate, posterior, or panuveitis,

          -  media clarity, pupillary dilation, and individual cooperation sufficient for adequate
             fundus imaging,

          -  macular atrophy, AND/OR degenerative macular edema, AND/OR advanced optic neuropathy,
             AND/OR macular scar,

          -  Patients must maintain regiment of local and/or systemic corticosteroids between
             screening and baseline (if applicable).

        Visual Criteria - Part 1 - BCVA of 0.1 (ETDRS of 35) or worse at screening in the treated
        eye, and BCVA of 0.32 or higher in the fellow eye.

        Visual Criteria - Part 2

        - BCVA ≤ 0.32 (EDTRS of 60) at screening in the treated eye, and BCVA of 0.32 or higher in
        the fellow eye.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Medical History and Concurrent Diseases

             appropriate care.

          -  An eye should not be considered eligible if: the macular oedema is considered related
             to ocular surgery such as cataract extraction or a non-inflammatory cause.

          -  Patient with media opacity that precludes visualization of the fundus or that likely
             requires cataract surgery during the duration of the trial.

          -  Patient who has uncontrolled intraocular pressure of ≥ 25 mmHg at screening

          -  Patient who has severe intraocular hypotension, based on the investigator's opinion.

          -  Patient who has a history of or current evidence of any other unstable medical
             conditions (such as heart disease, acute or chronic liver diseases, etc.) that, in the
             investigator's opinion, would expose the subject to undue risk of a significant
             Adverse Event (AE) or interfere with the assessments for safety and efficacy during
             the course of the trial.

          -  Heart disease that can impair the follow-up or any electric cardiac stimulation

             therapy such as Lucentis® (ranibizumab) or Avastin® (bevacizumab) or anti-Vascular
             Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF) Trap (aflibercept) within 3 months prior to Baseline
             visit.

          -  Patient has received intravitreal methotrexate within 3 months prior to Baseline
             visit.

             having an Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) evaluation.

          -  History of alcohol or drug abuse.

          -  Legal incapacity or limited legal capacity.
