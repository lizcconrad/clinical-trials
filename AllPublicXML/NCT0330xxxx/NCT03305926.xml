  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cardiovascular rehabilitation (CVR) has major beneficial effects by improving physical
      capacity, accelerating return to activities and reinsertion and reducing mortality. It
      associates reconditioning to effort and therapeutic education for the optimal control of &quot;
      risk factors &quot;. It corresponds to a global approach to patients, thus counterbalancing the
      tendency to hyperspecialise in medicine. However, because of the lack of specialised centres,
      only a small proportion of patients (≈30%) are able to benefit. Numerical tools used in
      e-health, the deployment of the Internet and certain &quot; connected &quot; devices may provide
      alternatives outside hospital, by enabling the follow-up of patients and their physiological
      parameters (heart rate, blood pressure, weigh, physical activity…), and the adaptation -
      using an interactive web platform - of the physical activity programme, nutrition, compliance
      with medication and weaning from smoking. This project proposes to evaluate the effects of a
      so-called &quot; connected &quot; CVR programme, and to show its non-inferiority compared with a
      conventional CVR.
