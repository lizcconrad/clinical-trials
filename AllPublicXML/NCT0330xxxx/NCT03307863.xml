  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Data on the interaction between the etonogestrel (ENG) implant and antiepileptic drug (AED)
      regimen are scarce. We will evaluated the effect of 2 AED regimens (1 including carbamazepine
      and the other topiramate) on the pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters of an ENG-releasing implant
      in women with epilepsy.
