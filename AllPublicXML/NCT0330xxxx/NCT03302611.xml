  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study uses a randomized controlled trial design to compare the psychological effects of
      surf therapy to hike therapy in active duty service members who have been diagnosed with
      major depressive disorder.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This prospective, longitudinal randomized controlled trial will enroll up to 86 active duty
      service members with major depressive disorder who are seeking surf or hike therapy as part
      of their standard medical care. Participants will be randomly assigned to receive 6 weeks of
      either surf or hike therapy. Assessor-administered and self-report measures will be completed
      at pre- and post-program, as well as three months following program completion. Participants
      also will complete brief, self-report assessments before and after each program activity
      session.

    <description>Participants randomized to surf therapy will receive 6 sessions (i.e., once per week for 6 weeks). Each surf therapy session is 1.5 to 3 hours in duration and occurs in a group setting. Each service member is paired with a surf instructor who typically works with them each week for the length of the 6-week program. Participant goals are individually-tailored to the service member (based on participant's level of comfort in the water, etc.) and can incorporate both physical and psychological objectives</description>

    <description>Participants randomized to hike therapy will receive 6 sessions (i.e., once per week for 6 weeks). Each hike therapy session is 1.5 to 3 hours in duration and occurs in a group setting. During hike therapy, service members may hike together or at a self-selected pace. Participant goals are individually-tailored to the service member (based on participant's limitations for hiking, etc.) and can incorporate both physical and psychological objectives</description>
