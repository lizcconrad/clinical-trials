      Background:

      TMS stands for transcranial magnetic stimulation. It is a non-invasive way to stimulate the
      brain. It helps researchers study the nervous system. TMS can assess central motor conduction
      time (CMCT). That can be used to diagnose some diseases. It can also show how well treatments
      are working. Researchers want to study the records of people who have already had TMS. They
      want to see how it relates to the results of diagnostic studies.

      Objectives:

      To study the results of transcranial magnetic stimulation in certain neurological disorders.
      To create a descriptive analysis of the results.

      Eligibility:

      Records that are already in the NINDS database

      Design:

      The study will not enroll any participants.

      Researchers will search the database for certain terms. These include TMS, CMTC, and motor
      evoked potentials. This will identify records of people who had TMS for diagnosis.

      Using data from the records, researchers will calculate CMCT. They will note other data that
      relate to CMCT.

      Researchers will analyze their findings. They will write a review article.

      Personal data will be removed from all the records before the findings are analyzed.

      Objective- To retrospectively study the results of transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) in
      various neurological disorders and create a descriptive analysis of the results.

      Study population- Existing records of patients within the NINDS database who have had TMS
      performed to measure central motor conduction time (CMCT).

      Design-

        -  Retrospective descriptive analysis.

        -  The NINDS EMG Database will be queried using terms such as TMS, CMCT, and MEP (motor
           evoked potentials) to identify EMG reports on patients who underwent TMS for diagnosis

        -  Within these reports peripheral motor conduction time (PMCT), the cortical motor evoked
           potential (MEP) latency and amplitude will be used to calculate CMCT, clinical patient
           factors pertinent to estimation of CMCT as well clinically significant physical exam
           findings will be recorded as well.

        -  Clinical diagnoses and neurological exams will be extracted from medical records

        -  Patient identifiers will be de-linked after compiling data from medical records

      Outcome measures

      - Results of CMCT using TMS in different diagnoses will be summarized for different
      neurologic disorders and correlated to clinical exam measures documented in previous records
