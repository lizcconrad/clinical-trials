  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Asthma is a chronic lung disease with serious morbidity and potential mortality. Multiple
      physiologic, environmental and social conditions impact the prevalence and severity of
      asthma. Even when diagnosed, effective control can be impeded by improper use of medication,
      not understanding or being unable to avoid environmental triggers, lack of continuity in
      follow-up care, and lack of an asthma action plan. American Indians are especially at-risk
      for health problems related to asthma. American Indians have the highest asthma rate among
      single-race groups; 18.5% of American Indians are diagnosed with asthma, while only 11% are
      diagnosed with asthma in the general population but little is known about why this is true.
      Asthma is a prototypic example of the interaction of biologic, environmental and psychosocial
      influences on disease and this study investigated the possible improvement in asthma control
      from an intensive educational intervention.

  <detailed_description>

      The primary aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that intensive patient education
      regarding self-directed, stepped care will result in reduced morbidity and medical care
      utilization, while increasing quality of life.

      One half (54) of the identified cases will be randomized to receive the previously
      established &quot;BREATHE&quot; study educational program, emphasizing patient-centered, self
      management of asthma. Periodic follow-up through personal contact and surveillance of IHS
      RPMS or other medical provider records was conducted.
