  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Peripheral artery disease (PAD) is a disease in which plaque builds up in the arteries that
      carry blood to the head, organs, and limbs. PAD usually occurs in the arteries in the legs,
      but can affect any arteries. Over time, plaque can harden and narrow the arteries which
      limits the flow of oxygen-rich blood to organs and other parts of the body. Blocked blood
      flow to the arteries can cause pain and numbness. The pain is usually worse with exercise and
      gets better with rest. PAD can raise the risk of getting an infection which could lead to
      tissue death and amputation. This study is investigating whether granulocyte-macrophage
      colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) improves symptoms and blood flow in people with PAD.
      GM-CSF is a drug that is used to stimulate the bone marrow to release stem cells.
      Participants in the study will be randomly selected to receive GM-CSF or a placebo. After a
      four-week screening phase, participants will receive injections of GM-CSF or a placebo three
      times a week for three-weeks. Three months later, participants will again receive injections
      of GM-CSF or placebo three times a week for three-weeks. At six months, the study team will
      follow up to see if the group that received GM-CSF had more improvement than the group that
      received placebo.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Atherosclerotic peripheral artery disease (PAD) of the lower extremities afflicts up to 8% of
      the U.S. population and lack of adequate sustainable therapies necessarily results in severe
      morbidity and increased mortality. Both experimental and current clinical data indicate that
      GM-CSF has the capacity to mobilize a variety of progenitor cells (PCs), including
      endothelial PCs that appear to improve ischemia.

      This study builds on the findings of prior research which showed improvements in claudication
      symptoms after treatment with GM-CSF. This study aims to answer whether repeat administration
      of GM-CSF at 3 months will further improve symptoms. The researchers will investigate in a
      double-blind placebo-controlled randomized study whether 3 weeks of three-times-a-week
      injection of GM-CSF will improve measures of ischemia in patients with intermittent
      claudication.

      This study will recruit 176 participants with atherosclerotic PAD and claudication. After
      screening for inclusion and exclusion criteria, eligible subjects will be trained to perform
      subcutaneous injections and instructed to walk until they develop claudication or symptomatic
      limitation at least three times a day for 4 weeks. At the end of the 4-week period, subjects
      will undergo baseline testing and will be randomized to receive 500 μg/day of GM-CSF thrice
      weekly for 3 weeks (group A) or a placebo (group B). After 3 months, follow-up endpoint
      testing will be performed. Subjects in group A will then receive the second administration of
      500 μg/day of subcutaneous GM-CSF thrice weekly for another 3 weeks and be followed for
      another 3 months for endpoint measurements, while Group B subjects will receive a matching
      placebo. The primary outcome is change in walking performance in the active treatment group
      after 6 months compared to the placebo group. The secondary outcome includes change in peak
      walking time at 6 months, changes in circulating progenitor cell levels, ankle brachial index
      (ABI), walking impairment questionnaire (WIQ) scores, and 36-item Short-Form Health Survey
      (SF-36) scores. Long-term follow up, by way of a telephone call, will occur with each
      participant one, two and three years after they enrolled in the study to administer
      questionnaires and collect adverse event data.

    <measure>Change in 36-item Short-Form Health Survey (SF-36) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Month 3, Month 6, Month 9, Follow-up Years 1, 2, and 3</time_frame>
    <description>36-item Short-Form Health Survey (SF-36) consists of eight scaled scores for the domains of: vitality, physical functioning, bodily pain, general health perceptions, physical role functioning, emotional role functioning, social role functioning, and mental health. Study participants respond to questions relating to their health and activity level by selecting from a variety of Likert scale and yes/no response options. Each scale is directly transformed into a 0-100 scale and lower scores indicate more disability (a score of 0 equates to maximum disability while a score of 100 indicates no disability).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Claudication Onset Time (COT)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Month 3, Month 6, Month 9</time_frame>
    <description>Claudication onset time (COT) during the treadmill exercise will be recorded along with the peak walking time (PWT). The claudication onset time (COT) is the duration of exercise until onset of the participant's typical claudication. This is differentiated from the peak walking time (PWT) which is the time until exercise is terminated because of severe claudication. Graded treadmill exercise testing will be performed using the Gardner protocol where the treadmill speed is kept at 2 mph and the grade starts at 0 and inclines by 2% every two minutes.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Ankle-Brachial Index (ABI)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Month 3, Month 6, Month 9</time_frame>
    <description>To obtain the ankle-brachial index (ABI), bilateral upper and lower extremity blood pressure cuffs are inflated about 30 millimeters of mercury (mmHg) above the systolic pressure. Doppler flow signals are used to detect the reappearing perfusion while reducing the cuff pressure. The results is expressed as a segmental/arm pressure ratio (ABI index). The highest pressure of the two arms will be used for calculating the ABI. The average ratio is about 1.0+/-0.10; an index of 0.90 or lower is considered abnormal. In patients with calcific, non-compressible arteries (certain diabetics) where ABI measurements are unreliable, a toe/ arm pressure index ratio will be performed, with a 2.5 cm cuff used on the great or second toes. A toe/arm index less than 0.65 is considered abnormal.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Foot Transcutaneous Oxygen Tension (TcPO2)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Month 3, Month 6, Month 9</time_frame>
    <description>Foot transcutaneous oxygen tension (TcPO2) is a noninvasive way to measure peripheral arterial disease. TcPO2 is obtained with a monitor before exercise after the patients have been standing for three minutes and is monitored throughout exercise. Values are recorded at initial claudication distance, absolute claudication distance, and after recovery from exercise. A commonly used cut point is 60 millimeters of mercury (mmHg), with values below this indicating the presence of peripheral arterial disease.</description>
