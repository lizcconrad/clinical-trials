  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The HYPNOS study is an acute feasibility study to validate a new device for automatic
      detection and treatment of sleep apnea syndrome. The system is known as the PASITHEA system
      and it will perform the following tasks:

        -  Detect apneas and hypopneas in real time, based on physiological signals acquired with a
           cardiorespiratory holter (nasal air flow, heart rate and blood oxygen saturation (SaO2))

        -  Upon detection of apnea or hypopnea events, trigger kinesthetic stimulation of
           mechanoreceptors of the skin close to the mastoid bone

      The primary objective is to verify that the PASITHEA system is able to detect apneas and
      hypopneas reliably.

      The main secondary objective of the study is to assess the effect of kinesthetic stimulation
      on reducing the number of sleep respiratory disorders.

      Another objective of the study is to verify the safety of the PASITHEA system.

    <measure>Performance of real-time detector of apnea and hypopnea: sensitivity and positive predictive value of the detector will be calculated when comparing automatically detected respiratory events to gold-standard PSG scoring of apnea/hypopnea events.</measure>
    <time_frame>1 night</time_frame>
    <description>During the night of the recording, the PASITHEA system and the PSG will be positioned in parallel. PSG-scored events will be matched with the output of the real-time detector: a true positive event is defined as an event detected less than 10 seconds before or within the duration of a PSG-annotated events. Apneas detected as hypopneas (and reciprocally) will be regarded as true positives. Sensitivity and positive predictive value will be calculated as per conventional definintion and the 9% confidence interval will be calculated using the Wilson score.</description>
