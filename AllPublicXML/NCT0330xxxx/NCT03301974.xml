  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pterygium is a fibrovascular wing shaped encroachment of conjunctival fold on to the cornea
      with elastotic degeneration of a subconjunctival tissue, The standard treatment for pterygium
      is surgical excision, but the recurrence rate after surgery can be as high as 24%-89%, which
      compromises outcomes. Based on the simple excision of pterygium, multiple strategies and
      techniques have been developed to reduce the high rate of pterygium recurrence. The
      investigators aim was to compare the safety, efficacy, overall patient satisfaction and
      recurrence rate of suturing, fibrin gluing and sutureless glue-free technique for attaching
      conjunctival autograft in primary pterygium surgery.

      Design: Prospective randomized comparative interventional clinical study Setting: Assiut
      university hospital &amp; El-Mabarah hospital for health insurance Methods: The study included 60
      eyes of 60 consecutive patients of primary nasal pterygium were enrolled in the study. Simple
      excision under local anesthesia was performed then closure of the bare sclera by conjunctival
      autograft with fibrin glue in 20 eyes of 20 patients (group 1), versus sutured free
      conjunctival autograft in 20 eyes of 20 patients (group 2) ), versus sutureless and glue-free
      conjunctival autograft in 20 eyes of 20 patients (group 3).
