    <textblock>
      Quadriceps and hamstring muscle strenghts have important role in returning to sport after ACL
      reconstruction and one of the main focus of rehabilitation is to improve strenght of these
      muscles. With the strenghtening of the contralateral limb (cross-over training) we aimed to
      improve the strenght of the quadriceps

      Returning to sport after ACL reconstruction is not at desired level among athletes.
      Quadriceps and hamstring muscle strenghts have important role in returning to sport after ACL
      reconstruction. Cross-over training is recomended during rehabilitation after ACL
      reconstrucion. Yet duration of the training, frequancy and type of exercise interention are
      not clear for the cross-over training. Ain of the study is to investigate the effects of
      cross-over training on muscle strenght
