      This qualitative study is part of the 5-year long (2013-18) PERFECTED (Peri-operative
      Enhanced Recovery hip-fracture Care of paTiEnts with Dementia) National Institute for Health
      Research (NIHR) funded research programme. PERFECTED's overall aim is to develop and pilot an
      evidence-based intervention to improve the hospital care of patients living with dementia who
      have fractured their hip. The findings from this particular study will support PERFECTED's
      other activities by exploring stakeholder (lay and professional) views of the hospital care
      experiences of hip-fracture patients who are experiencing memory difficulties. Best practices
      and priorities, including attention to cost-consequences will be explored.

      Semi-structured interviews will be conducted with 15-30 hip-fracture patients with mild
      memory difficulties recently discharged from acute hospitals in Norwich, Nottingham and
      Bradford. Equal attention will be given to those patients discharged directly home and those
      discharged to community hospitals for further rehabilitation. Interviews will be conducted
      with 15-30 recognised carers of hip-fracture patients with moderate/severe memory
      difficulties who have recently been discharged from acute hospitals in the same three
      regions. Semi-structured interviews will also be carried out with a nominated dementia lead
      in each region. Finally, in each region, small focus groups, face-to-face or telephone
      interviews will be conducted, with clinical staff of various grades and professions, hospital
      managers and with NHS commissioners. This study will enable a range of topics and
      perspectives to be explored and potential components for PERFECTED's intervention to be
      identified.

      As part of PERFECTED's on-going commitment to Public Patient Involvement (PPI), lay
      researchers will be trained to assist in interviewing recognised carers of hip-fracture
      patients with moderate/severe memory difficulties. Interviews and focus groups will be
      recorded, transcribed and analysed thematically. Resulting data will address the pre-defined
      aims of the current study and feed into findings reported across the whole of Work Package 1
      of PERFECTED.
