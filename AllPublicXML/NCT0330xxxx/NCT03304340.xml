    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study was to examine the outcomes of postural stability, activities of
      daily living function, and motor capacity of persons after stroke who received transcutaneous
      electrical nerves stimulation (TENS) or functional electrical stimulation (FES), in addition
      to SR, in the post-stroke acute phase. Such persons were compared with others who received SR
      alone in order to determine if the addition of TENS or FES resulted in earlier or more
      effective recovery.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Based on modern knowledge about the neuro-plastic changes that occur immediately after brain
      injuries, rehabilitation should be more effective when started soon after brain damaged.
      Besides, knowledge about one of the factors that determine efficacy of rehabilitation is the
      commencement of treatment, as well as on the time interval from stroke to initiate voluntary
      movement. Therefore, many studies had reported that the effectiveness of functional
      electrical stimulation (FES) and transcutaneous electrical nerves stimulation (TENS), which
      induce stimulation and the excitability, were widely applied in rehabilitation for patients
      with stroke. However, many investigations about the effects of FES or TENS on motor recovery
      for the stroke patients mainly focus on the chronic stage as well as compared each of two
      different kinds of stimulation separately. Hence the investigators will study the impacts of
      TENS and FES on the motor recovery for the stroke patients from the acute stage. Bedsides,
      the investigators also study that whether patients after stroke in the acute stage who
      received adding TENS experienced similar impacts on motor recovery to those who received
      adding FES.

      This was a single-blind randomized control trial study. The study recruited 40 subjects from
      stroke center of National Taiwan Hospital (NTUH) within 3 days after first stroke onset. All
      subjects were in stable medically control and assigned randomly to 1 of 3 groups including
      (1)Functional electrical stimulation (FES) + standard rehabilitation (SR) ,(2) Transcutaneous
      electrical nerves stimulation (TENS) + SR or (3)SR only (control group).The application of
      FES and TENS was used for 30 minutes per day, 5 days per week for 2 weeks. The surface
      electrodes of two dual channels were applied on tibialis anterior and quadriceps for FES and
      TENS group. All groups received SR including neuro-facilitation and functional task training
      etc.

      Outcome measurements were analyzed with repeated measure analysis of variance using SPSS to
      compare the main effects before, during, and after treatment, followed by post-hoc tests with
      Bonferroni correction to compare treatment effects among the 3 groups. For categorical
      variables, a X2 test was used. The significance level was set at 5% (2-tailed).

    <description>the Timed Up and Go Test was used to measure the walking time. Patients went from sitting to standing, walked three meters at a fast, comfortable speed, turned around, walked back, and sat down again. The patients were allowed to use his/her own walking aids, but no physical assistance was given by the researcher or therapist. The patients were also allowed to practice one or two trials in order to comprehend the whole test procedure. The mean time (in seconds) across three trials was used as the walking time.</description>
