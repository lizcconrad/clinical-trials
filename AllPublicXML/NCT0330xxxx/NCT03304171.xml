      The purpose of this study was to examine the relationship between indices of overall diet
      quality and incident breast cancer risk in a large prospective cohort of women.

      This study examined the role of overall diet quality on the risk of developing invasive
      breast cancer among 96,959 women in the California Teachers Study, in which 4,826 women were
      diagnosed with breast cancer during follow-up (1995-2011). Participants' dietary habits were
      recorded at baseline (1995) using a 103-item Block95 Food Frequency Questionnaire to allow
      for the assessment of overall diet quality. Specifically, diet quality was characterized by
      the Alternate Mediterranean Diet (aMED), Alternative Healthy Eating Index-2010 (AHEI-2010),
      Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH), and Paleolithic Index scores. Associations
      between diet quality and the risk of developing breast cancer were examined using
      multivariate Cox proportional hazard regression models to provide hazard ratios and
      corresponding 95% confidence intervals.

        Female participants of the California Teachers Study who met the eligibility criteria.

        The California Teachers Study is comprised entirely of female participants aged 22-104
        years old at enrollment who were current and former public school teachers and
        administrators and completed a 16-page mailed questionnaire at study entry in 1995-1996.
        Details of the California Teachers Study (CTS) have been described previously (Bernstein L,
        et al.; 2002).
