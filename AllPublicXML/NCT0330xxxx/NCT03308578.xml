  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is aimed at examining the alterations in adipose tissue in obstructive sleep apnea
      (OSA) patients in response to treatment with atorvastatin in continuation with standard
      treatment with continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In recent years the role adipose tissue to the development of cardiometabolic disorders has
      been increasingly recognized. Dysfunctional adipose tissue is an important source for
      systemic inflammation and FFA, thus increasing CV risk in obese and aging populations. Even
      though heightened cardiovascular risk in OSA patients is acknowledged, adipose tissue from
      OSA patients has not been investigated.

      CPAP is standard therapy for OSA, but has shown mixed results for improvement of vascular
      function, insulin sensitivity, and BP, and does not reduce CV events and mortality, even in
      patients with established CV disease. Hence, eliminating IH alone may not be sufficient to
      repair preexisting damage; additional adjunct strategies aimed at cellular repair may be
      required to reduce cardiometabolic burden and CV risk. Statins have pleiotropic effects
      including reducing inflammation, and improving BP. The aim of this study is to examine the
      longitudinal changes in the cellular and molecular composition of adipose tissue in OSA
      subjects in response to 6 months combination therapy of CPAP and atorvastatin. We hypothesize
      that the combination therapy will reduce adipose tissue cellular damage (p16INK4A+γ-H2AX dual
      positive cells). Also, decreases in adipose tissue cellular damage will be associated with
      improved cardiometabolic profile. These studies will provide pivotal insights into potential
      therapeutic strategies which may reduce cardiometabolic burden in OSA population.
