    <textblock>
      Multicenter, randomized, open-label, crossover PK study of ASTX727 versus IV decitabine.
      Adult subjects who are candidates to receive IV decitabine will be randomized 1:1 to receive
      the ASTX727 tablet Daily×5 in Cycle 1 followed by IV decitabine 20 mg/m^2 Daily×5 in Cycle 2,
      or the converse order. After completion of PK studies during the first 2 treatment cycles,
      subjects will continue to receive treatment with ASTX727 from Cycle 3 onward (in 28-day
      cycles) until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or the subject discontinues
      treatment or withdraws from the study.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This Phase 3 study will establish PK equivalence of ASTX727 to IV decitabine in approximately
      118 evaluable subjects. Eligible subjects will receive both study treatments: oral
      investigational drug ASTX727, and IV decitabine, as follows: subjects will be randomly
      assigned 1:1 to receive ASTX727 or IV decitabine in Cycle 1 and then cross over to the other
      therapy in Cycle 2.

      In the ASTX727 cycle, subjects will receive the ASTX727 tablet Daily×5. Serial PK
      measurements (blood draws) will be done on Days 1, 2, and 5, along with pre-dose PK
      assessments on Days 1-5 and an assessment at 3 hours post dose on Day 3. Subjects will be
      required to fast from food for 4 hours on days when receiving ASTX727: at least 2 hours
      before and 2 hours after dosing.

      In the IV decitabine cycle, subjects will receive a 1-hour infusion of IV decitabine 20
      mg/m^2 Daily×5. Serial PK measurements will be done on Days 1 and 5, along with pre-dose and
      1-hour post-infusion assessments on Day 3.

      In Cycles ≥3, subjects will receive the ASTX727 tablet Daily×5 in 28-day cycles. (No PK
      assessments will be done from Cycle 3 onward.)

                  transaminase/serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase (ALT/SGPT) ≤2.5 × ULN.

               2. Renal: serum creatinine ≤1.5 × ULN or calculated creatinine clearance or
                  glomerular filtration rate &gt;50 mL/min/1.73 m2 for subjects with creatinine levels
                  above institutional normal.

          5. No major surgery within 30 days of first study treatment.

          6. Life expectancy of at least 3 months.

          7. Women of child-bearing potential must not be pregnant or breastfeeding and must have a
             negative pregnancy test at screening. Women of non-childbearing potential are those
             who have had a hysterectomy or bilateral oophorectomy, or who have completed
             menopause, defined as no menses for at least 1 year AND either age ≥65 years or

             of study treatment.)

          6. Poor medical risk because of other conditions such as uncontrolled systemic diseases,
             active uncontrolled infections, or comorbidities that may put the patient at risk of
             not being able to complete at least 2 cycles of treatment.

          7. Known significant mental illness or other condition, such as active alcohol or other
             substance abuse or addiction, that in the opinion of the investigator predisposes the
             subject to high risk of noncompliance with the protocol.

          8. Rapidly progressive or highly proliferative disease (total white blood cell count of
             &gt;15 × 10^9/L) or other criteria that render the subject at high risk of requiring
             intensive cytotoxic chemotherapy within the next 3 months.

          9. Life-threatening illness or severe organ system dysfunction, such as uncontrolled
             congestive heart failure or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, or other reasons
             including laboratory abnormalities, which, in the investigator's opinion, could
             compromise the subject's safety, interfere with the absorption or metabolism of
             ASTX727, or compromise completion of the study or integrity of the study outcomes.

         10. Prior malignancy, except for adequately treated basal cell or squamous cell skin
             cancer, in situ cervical cancer, prostate cancer or breast cancer under control with
             hormone therapy, or other cancer from which the subject has been disease free for at
             least 2 years.
