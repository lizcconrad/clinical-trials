  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pain after thoracotomy is the most severe pain experienced by the patient. Good pain control
      after the operation provides comfortable respiration and reduces the development of chronic
      pain and complications.

      we aimed to compare SAPB with IBregarding postoperative visual analog scale (VAS) scores and
      analgesic consumption in patients undergoing thoracotomy operation.

      Patients who underwent thoracotomy operation in our hospital between May 2016 and June 2017
      were examined. A retrospective evaluation was made of the data that was retrieved from the
      records of a total of 49 patients aged 18-75 years, ASA I-III, who were applied with
      Intercostal (IB) or Serratus anterior plane(SAPB) for a thoracotomy operation. The patient
      information was retrieved from the patient records and anesthesia block forms. The data were
      examined in respect of age, sex, height, weight, ASA, operation type, operating time, the
      amount of postoperative analgesic consumption, VAS at 1.,2.,4.,6.,12.,24. hours and
      complications (atelectasis, nausea, vomiting, hypotension and bradycardia).

      Statistical analysis was performed using the SPSS program for Mac, version 17.0
      (SPSS,Chicago,IL). Descriptive statistics are presented as mean and SD, and as the number of
      cases (n) and the corresponding percentage (%) for nominal variables. T tests were performed
      for normally continuous variables. The Mann-Whitney U test was used for non-parametric
      variables. A value of p &lt; 0.05 was considered statistically significant.

    <description>Anesthesia induction was performed to all patients .At the end of the operation some patients were performed with intercostal block by the chest surgeon. For 24 hours postoperatively, tramadol was administered with patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) All patients were extubated after the operation and transferred to ICU.</description>
