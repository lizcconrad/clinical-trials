  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A total of 40 participants will be recruited, with 20 participants in each of the following
      subcategories:

      A) High grade lymphoma (DLBCL, FL grade 3b, transformed FL) (n=20) B) Low grade lymphoma
      (e.g. FL grade 1, 2 or 3a, MZL, MCL) (n=20)

      The main purpose for having two experimental treatment arms is to provide a comparator for
      the translational endpoints, i.e. to assess whether the differences observed are due to the
      addition of varlilumab to rituximab. The only difference between Arm A and Arm B is the delay
      in administration of varlilumab in cycle 1, which is on Day 2 in Arm A and Day 8 in Arm B. As
      the post-treatment tissue collection occurs on Day 7/8, prior to administration of varlilumab
      in Arm B, samples will be obtained from participants that have either been treated with
      rituximab alone, or both rituximab and varlilumab. To minimise any potential risks to the
      patient as a result of a repeat biopsy on Day 7/8, a prerequisite for entry to the trial is
      that the participants must have accessible sites for biopsy. Difference in response rates
      between Arm A and Arm B are not expected.

      A multicentre, randomised, phase IIa study in participants with relapsed or refractory CD20+
      B-cell malignancies. The study will be conducted in 2 stages as follows:

      Stage 1 - Safety During the safety phase, 6 participants (3 from each Arm and from any
      subtype) will be treated as detailed in section 6.1. The number of dose limiting toxicities
      (DLTs) experienced by these participants in each arm after having completed the first cycle
      will dictate whether the trial will proceed to the second stage.

        1. In each arm, if out of these 3 participants 0 experience a DLT, then that arm will
           proceed to stage 2.

        2. In each arm, if out of these 3 participants 1 or 2 experience a DLT, then that arm will
           be expanded to 3 more participants.

             1. If 1 or 2 out of 6 participants experience a dose limiting toxicity, the arm will
                proceed to Stage 2.

             2. If 3 or more out of 6 participants experience a DLT, recruitment for that arm will
                be stopped.

        3. If out of these 3 participants, 3 experience a dose limiting toxicity, recruitment for
           that arm will be stopped.

      Initially, the first patient will be entered into the trial. Providing there are no serious
      or unexplained safety issues during the first 2 weeks, as determined by the Safety Review
      Committee (SRC), then dosing of subsequent participants will continue as they are identified.
      Should toxicity findings of concern occur, the SRC may choose to stagger the start of dosing
      for subsequent participants and/or cohorts.

      The objective of Stage 2 is to obtain some further information on the safety of the
      intervention in a larger sample, information on activity (response rate overall and per
      lymphoma subtype) and feasibility of administrating rituximab and varlilumab together. During
      Stage 2, recruitment will continue so (including those in Stage 1), there is a total of 10
      participants per arm and per disease category (a total of 20 participants per disease
      category, 40 participants in the trial in total).

    <intervention_name>Varlilumab</intervention_name>
    <description>Rituximab is a so-called direct-targeting mAb, which binds to the CD20 molecule on the surface of normal and malignant B cells. The mAb then engages immune effectors cells, such as macrophages, through Fc:Fc gamma receptor interaction, leading to tumour cell killing by antibody directed cellular cytotoxicity and/or phagocytosis (ADCC/ADCP).
Varlilumab (1F5, CDX-1127) is a recombinant and fully human IgG1kappa mAb that binds to human CD27 with high affinity (62). As far as we are aware, it is the only anti-CD27 mAb in clinical development. Once bound, varlilumab blocks CD70 binding to CD27.</description>

                  during screening (within 14 days prior to the start of trial treatment) and agree
                  to use one highly effective form of contraception combined with an effective form
                  of contraception (see below) effective from the first administration of all study
                  drugs, throughout the trial and for 12 months after last dose all study drugs are
                  considered eligible.

               -  Male participants with partners of child-bearing potential who agree to take
                  measures not to father children by using one form of highly effective
                  contraception from the first administration of all study drugs, throughout the
                  trial and for 12 months after last dose of all study drugs are considered
                  eligible. Male subjects must also refrain from donating sperm during this period.

             Contraception

             Contraception that is considered highly effective includes oral, injected or implanted
             progesterone-only hormonal contraception (with inhibition of ovulation); oral,
             intravaginal, or transdermal combined (oestrogen and progesterone containing) hormonal
             contraception (with inhibition of ovulation); an intra-uterine device (IUD); an

             partner or abstinence.

             Contraceptive methods considered to be effective include progesterone-only oral
             hormonal contraception, where inhibition of ovulation is not the primary mode of
             action; condom; cap, diaphragm or sponge with spermicidal gel.

               -  Men with pregnant or lactating partners must be advised to use barrier method
                  contraception (for example: condom plus spermicidal gel) to prevent exposure to
                  the foetus or neonate.

               -  Noninvasive malignancies such as adequately treated ductal carcinoma in situ of
                  the breast, non-melanoma skin cancer or lentigo maligna, cervical carcinoma in
                  situ and urothelial papillary noninvasive carcinoma or carcinoma in situ, and

               -  Prostate intraepithelial neoplasia without evidence of prostate cancer.

          3. Receiving treatment (or within a month of) with chemotherapy, immunotherapy or
             immunosuppressive agents. This includes any systemic steroids at dose exceeding 10 mg
             prednisolone (or other steroid equivalent) within 2 weeks prior to first dose of
             varlilumab.

          4. Significant concurrent, uncontrolled medical condition that in the opinion of the
             Investigator contraindicates participation in this study.

          5. Active and documented autoimmune disease (including, but not limited to, inflammatory
             bowel disease, coeliac disease, haemolytic anaemia, or immune thrombocytopenic

          7. Women who are pregnant or lactating.

          8. Serological positivity for Hepatitis B, C, or known HIV infection. As per standard of

             immunochemotherapy.

               -  Positive test results for chronic HBV infection (defined as positive HBsAg
                  serology and positive HBcAb) will not be eligible. Participants with occult or
                  prior HBV infection (defined as negative HBsAg and positive HBcAb) will not be
                  eligible. Participants who have protective titres of hepatitis B surface antibody
                  (HBsAb) after vaccination will be eligible.

         12. Subjects known or suspected of being unable to comply with the protocol.

         13. Ongoing toxic manifestations of previous treatments. Exceptions to this are alopecia
             or certain Grade 1-toxicities, which in the opinion of the Investigator should not
             exclude the patient.

         14. Uncontrolled congestive cardiac failure, cardiac ischaemia or cardiac arrhythmia.
             Clinically significant cardiac disease including unstable angina, acute myocardial
