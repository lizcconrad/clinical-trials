      This is a single site, open label proof of principle exploratory trial to investigate the
      compatibility of C7 oil with the ketogenic diet in subjects diagnosed with G1D. The ketogenic
      diet will have been previously described by the patient's treating physician independently of
      this study and for clinical reasons. The ketogenic diet

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Diagnosis of glucose transporter type 1 deficiency (G1D), confirmed by clinical
             genotyping at a CLIA-certified laboratory.

          -  Stable on ketogenic diet at 2.5:1 to 4:1 ratio (i.e., no changes in ratio will have
             taken place for 2 months). The initiation of a ketogenic diet is previous to - and
             thus is not part of this study.

          -  Males and females 30 months to 35 years and 11 months old inclusive.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects with evidence of independent, unrelated metabolic and/or genetic disease.

          -  Subjects with a chronic gastrointestinal disorder, such as irritable bowel syndrome,
             crohn's disease, or colitis that could increase the subject's risk of developing
             diarrhea or stomach pain.

          -  Subjects with a BMI (body mass index) greater than or equal to 30.

          -  Subjects currently not on ketogenic diet.

          -  Women who are pregnant or breast feeding may not participate. Women who plan to become
             pregnant during the course of the study, or who are unwilling to use birth control to
             prevent pregnancy (including abstinence) may not participate. Females age 10 and over
             will be asked to provide a urine sample for a pregnancy test via dipstick. Subjects
             will be asked to agree to abstinence or another form of birth control for the duration
             of the study.

          -  Allergy/sensitivity to C7

          -  Previous use of triheptanoin less than 1 month prior to study initiation.

          -  Treatment with medium chain triglycerides in the last 24 hours.

          -  Subjects exhibiting signs of dementia, or diagnosed with any degenerative brain
             disorder (such as Alzheimer's disease) that would confound assessment of cognitive
             changes, in the opinion of the investigator.

          -  Active drug or alcohol use or dependence that, in the opinion of the investigator,
             would interfere with adherence to study requirements.

          -  Inability or unwillingness of subject or legal guardian/representative to give written
             informed consent, or assent for children age 10-17,

          -  Addition of a new antiseizure drug in the previous 3 months.
