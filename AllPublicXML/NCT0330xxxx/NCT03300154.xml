  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cardiovascular diseases are increasing throughout the developing world and are the cause of
      almost 16.7 million deaths each year, of which 80% occur in low and middle-income countries.
      As more than three fourth of the global burden of cardiometabolic diseases are related to
      risk factors connected with lifestyles or behaviors, such as smoking, unhealthy eating, low
      physical activity, and harmful consumption of alcohol. This burden could be dramatically
      reduced by changing individual behaviors. This study is focused on interventions that are
      aimed to improve the adherence to treatment in cardiovascular disease (hypertension), based
      on a Behavioral Economics approach. Most of public policies targeted to tackle NCDs utilize a
      rational economic model of behavior. Behavioral economics, by using insights from cognitive
      psychology and other social sciences, has drawn a lot of attention for its potential to
      increase healthy behaviors. Interventions informed by BE principles seek to rearrange the
      social or physical environment in such a way to 'nudge' people towards healthier choices and
      behaviors.

      Main objective: to assess whether the implementation of two strategies based on behavioral
      economics, that include the use of a financial incentive scheme and specific framing to
      beneficiaries (i.e. mobile health interventions), increase the referral, evaluation and
      follow-up of people with moderate and high cardiovascular risk in the public health network,
      compared to the usual strategy.

      Design: A cluster-randomized pragmatic clinical trial will be performed. The randomization
      unit will be the Community Health Centers (CHC) and the intervention groups (2 arms) or
      control will be assigned to 9 health centers in total (3 CHC per arm).

      Population: This RCT is going to be conducted in selected CHC of Salta. Nine CHC will be
      selected, which will be randomized: 3 centers to the control, 3 centers to framing
      intervention with messages and 3 centers to the intervention with incentives.

      A total of 900 patients ≥ 40 years, without health coverage and with a 10-year cardiovascular
      risk ≥ 10% will participate in this study.

      Follow up: 3 month

    <description>The study nurses will schedule an appointment with the doctor at the health center, within 4 weeks from the participant's inclusion in the study. Participants who attend the first visit at the health center will receive a direct incentive consisting of the payment of a limited amount to be determined (approximately AR $ 150-200) through a shopping voucher for the amount mentioned. Participants attending the follow-up visit at the health center within 3 months from their inclusion in the study will participate in a lottery. The lottery will offer the possibility of winning a new voucher with a probability of 1 in 3. Participants who do not attend the health center will not receive any incentive.</description>

    <description>After inclusion, participants will receive weekly text messages (SMS) using a specific framing or formulation of the message, highlighting the potential benefits and positive aspects of health care. These messages will promote follow-up visits, adherence to treatment, and benefits to be gained from a follow-up visit with the physician. Messages will be sent with a frequency of two per week during the first 30 days and then 1 per week until the end of the follow-up. These messages will have no cost to participants.</description>
