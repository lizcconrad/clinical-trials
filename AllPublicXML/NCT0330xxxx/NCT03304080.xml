  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, phase I/II trial of anastrozole, palbociclib, trastuzumab, and
      pertuzumab is proposed as first-line therapy in metastatic hormone receptor-positive,
      HER2-positive breast cancer patients. In this phase I/II clinical trial, the researchers aim
      to establish the safety and efficacy of dual HER2 therapy in combination with palbociclib and
      anastrozole, which represents a novel and all biologic approach to the treatment of HR+,
      HER2+ metastatic breast cancer. Additionally, the researchers aim to examine potential
      biomarkers of response to palbociclib including cyclin D1 expression levels, phosphorylated
      retinoblastoma expression and p16 levels. The researchers intend to use RNA sequencing to
      assess for other predictors of response in an unbiased manner to see if this correlates with
      inhibition of Ki-67 and phosphorylated retinoblastoma expression as well as evaluate for
      potential mechanisms of resistance.

    <measure>Dose-Limiting Toxicity (DLT)</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>The dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) for palbociclib when administered in combination with anastrozole, trastuzumab and pertuzumab. A DLT will be defined as:
Grade 3 or 4 non-hematologic toxicity
Grade 3 neutropenia lasting greater than 21 days
Grade 3 or 4 neutropenia with neutropenic fever or
Grade 4 hematologic toxicity events experienced within the first 4 weeks (1 cycle) of study treatment. These will be assessed via the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI's CTCAE) v4.0 toxicity criteria.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD)</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>The maximum tolerated dose (MTD) for palbociclib when administered in combination with anastrozole, trastuzumab and pertuzumab. If &gt; 33 % of patients experience a dose limiting toxicity (DLT) at any dose level, the dose level below that level will be considered the MTD. Or if the highest level has been reached and ≤ 33% of patients have experienced dose limiting toxicity (DLT), that will be considered the MTD.</description>
