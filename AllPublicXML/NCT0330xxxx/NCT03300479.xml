  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) is responsible for 10-15% of primary strokes. ICH is a dynamic
      process with three phases: initial hemorrhage, followed by hematoma expansion and
      perihematoma edema formation. Hematoma volume is correlated with disease progression and
      outcome. Contemporary evidence proposes that elevated blood pressure is associated with
      hematoma expansion while more than 90% of patients with ICH present with acute hypertension.
      Uncontrolled blood pressure is a leading cause of ICH and it seems also to be a factor of
      poorer outcomes. Therefore, rapid reduction and control of blood pressure might ease disease
      progression and improve the outcome. Clevidipine (Cleviprex®), an ultrashort-acting
      dihydropyridine calcium channel antagonist, with its rapid onset and short duration might be
      more effective than conventional antihypertensives to achieve rapid blood pressure control in
      patients with acute ICH.

      After admission to the ICU the patients presenting with primary intracerebral hemorrhage
      (ICH) are evaluated for enrollment. If systolic blood pressure (SBP) is higher than 160 mmHg,
      the patient will be randomized in one of the two study groups and intravenous therapy with
      Clevidipine (Cleviprex®) or Urapidil (Ebrantil®) will start immediately. Data of systemic
      haemodynamics will be collected continuously by online monitoring, starting at baseline and
      ending after 24h (study data measurements). In particular, all blood pressure measurements
      are extracted via an arterial line, which is placed as standard of care in these patients. If
      the target values are not attained within 30 minutes, the investigators can add or switch to
      alternative antihypertensive drugs of their choice. 24h after initiation of Clevidipine
      (Cleviprex®) or Urapidil (Ebrantil®), all patients receive Nicardipine (Cardene®) (standard
      care in daily clinical routine) for another 24h followed by orally administered
      antihypertensive medication.

      Intracerebral hematoma volume will be determined by readings of noncontrast brain computed
      tomography (CT) scans using the ABC/2 rule to calculate the volume. As a standard in these
      patients a CT scan is performed 6 hours after admission to the ICU.
