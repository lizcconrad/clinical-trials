      1. To demonstrate the ability to detect specific cancer mutations in ctDNA isolated from
           plasma of stage IV cancer patients at HCC.

        2. To compare, in each patient, ctDNA longitudinal samples through treatment, and when
           available, with those of primary tumor and metastasis.

      The overall goal of this study is to study circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) in the blood to
      determine how cancer cells in patients react to treatment. DNA is short for deoxyribonucleic
      acid. DNA contains information that determines in part the traits, such as eye color, height,
      or disease risk, that are passed on from parent to child. This reaction will be measured by
      studying patient blood that will be collected before and during treatment until there is
      disease progression.

    <description>Twenty-five mL of peripheral blood (PB) will be collected for research. Blood will be collected in EDTA tubes and used to isolate ctDNA. For each subject we will request that he/she contribute 25 mL of plasma no more frequently than every 6 weeks, and at same time of standard of care blood draws and routine clinic visit, and for no more than 5 times (including baseline and end of study).</description>
