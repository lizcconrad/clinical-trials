  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a double blinded, randomized, controlled trial of prebiotic in infants born between
      29 and 32 weeks gestational age. The investigators anticipate enrollment of 90 subjects in
      total and for the study to be completed in 18 months. The investigators anticipate collecting
      clinical data, anthropometrics, stool samples (requiring appropriate storage through
      analysis), salivary samples from mother and infant, discarded blood samples from baby after
      the standard care lab tests are done, a single, optional blood draw at the conclusion of the
      study, and subjecting infants to a neurodevelopmental survey at study completion.

      The overall goal of this study is to test prebiotic administration to human milk-fed infants
      who are &gt;1000 gram to &lt;1500 gram birthweight. The goal of this study will be addressed
      through one primary aim, a secondary aim, and exploratory aims, indicated below:

      Primary aim: Compare weight, length, and head circumference Z-score growth between the study
      and placebo groups.

      Secondary aim: Compare the time taken to achieve full feedings (135 mL/kg/day or more)
      between the study and placebo groups.

      Exploratory aim 1: Compare neurobehavior, as measured by the validated Neonatal intensive
      care unit Network Neurobehavioral Scale (NNNS), between the study and placebo groups.

      Exploratory aim 2: Compare fecal calprotectin levels to determine the impact of
      supplementation on reducing intestinal inflammation between the study and placebo groups.

      Exploratory aim 3: Compare fecal microbiome between the prebiotic and placebo groups, to
      determine whether there is a shift in microbial composition towards bifidobacteria and other
      microbes that are capable of metabolizing prebiotic.
