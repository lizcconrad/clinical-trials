    <textblock>
      The study will investigate Essential Tremor and Parkinson's Disease patients who underwent
      Magnetic Resonance guided Focused Ultrasound Surgery (MRgFUS). We will evaluate the effect of
      lesion characteristics on tremor and on quality of life after the procedure as compared with
      the baseline prior to the procedure.

      The purpose of the study is to investigate the effect of lesion characteristics in ExAblate
      Transcranial Magnetic Resonance guided Focused Ultrasound Surgery (MRgFUS) of the Vim
      thalamic nucleus. Clinical measures will be used to study patients suffering from
      medication-refractory tremor, Essential Tremor or idiopathic Parkinson's Disease.

      This study is designed as a prospective, observational, and clinical study. Assessments will
      be made before and after MRgFUS for; clinical tremor relief, quality of life (QoL)
      improvements, assessment of adverse events, and correlations of these measures with the size
      and shape of the lesion and the surrounding edema .

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Men and women, between 18 and 80 years.

          -  Patients who underwent the MRgFUS procedure.

          -  Patients who are able and willing to give consent and able to attend all study visits
             and Radiologic follow-up examination by MRI.

          -  A diagnosis of ET or Idiopathic PD as confirmed from clinical history and examination
             preformed by a movement disorders neurologist.

          -  ET patients: tremor severity score of greater than or equal to 2 in the treated
             hand/arm as measured by postural or action item on the Clinical Rating Scale for
             Tremor (CRST).

          -  PD patients: tremor severity score of equal or greater than 3 on either item 20 or
             item 21 of motor part in the Unified PD Rating Scale (UPDRS).

          -  Substantial disability in the performance of at least two daily activities from the
             disability subsection of the scales UPDRS for PD patients or CRST for ET patients.

          -  The patient must have a history of an unsatisfactory response to medical management.
             All patients will need to have tried and failed at least one drug. Alternatively, a
             patient may also qualify if tremor-suppressing medications are contraindicated due to
             a coexisting medical condition or drug allergy.

          -  Stable doses of all medications for 30 days prior to study entry.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients which have not completed the MRgFUS procedure.

          -  Patients which were diagnosed during the trial with additional diagnoses that can
             affect motor function, quality of life and symptoms of tremor.
