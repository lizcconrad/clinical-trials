  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main purpose of this study is to compare the impact of aerobic interval training
      intensity on exercise adherence and changes in cardiorespiratory fitness, cardiometabolic
      risk profile, body composition, inflammatory markers and subjective health outcomes after a
      12-week intervention trial in overweight individuals at increased cardiometabolic risk.
