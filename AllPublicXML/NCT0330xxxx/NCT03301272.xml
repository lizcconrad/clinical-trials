  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Purpose: Rest tremor in Parkinson's disease is notoriously difficult to treat through
      pharmacological measures, currently only predictably attenuated by the invasive deep brain
      stimulation surgery. We hope to find some predictable and clinically meaningful attenuation
      of tremor with targeted use of onabotulinum toxin on muscles involved in creating the tremor.

      Participants: 16 subjects who meet UK brain bank criteria for Parkinson's disease with
      medically refractory rest tremor of at least 3 cm amplitude.

      Procedures (methods): Subjects will be blinded to receive either sham saline injection versus
      onabotulinum toxin injections directed to muscle groups felt to be clinically involved in
      causing the oscillatory movement of the tremor. Assessment of tremor severity and functional
      improvement from baseline after injection will occur within group (i.e. each subject will
      serve as their own control).

      Hypotheses:

      1. (A) Onabotulinumtoxin A significantly attenuates the amplitude of medically-refractory
      rest tremor of the upper limb in Parkinson's patients as compared to sham injections; as
      measured by reduction in the MDS-UPDRS tremor subscore.

      1. (B) Onabotulinumtoxin A significantly improves the limb function of Parkinson's patients
      with medically-refractory rest tremor of the upper limb as compared to sham injections; as
      measured by an increase in ARAT scores.

      For purposes of properly identifying muscles intended for injection, a portable
      electromyography will be attached to an appropriate gauge electromyography-guided botulinum
      toxin needle, which in turn will be used to hear/see motor evoked potentials (MEPs). Subjects
      will be asked to activate the muscle while needle is inserted to ensure proper placement of
      the needle in the desired muscle prior to injection of study solution.

    <masking>Triple (Participant, Care Provider, Investigator)</masking>
    <masking_description>Double-blinded study whereby the subject, the movement disorder specialist injecting neurotoxin, and the movement disorder specialist rating the patient will be unaware of the solution injected and/or planned for injection same day. To ensure that the injecting specialist is blinded to the solution, syringes will be premixed by a separate member of the research team and de-identified of any possible labels that would indicate the properties of the solution being administered to the subject.</masking_description>

    <measure>Change in Movement Disorders Society Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS) Part III tremor subscore after onabotulinumtoxinA on a limb afflicted by medically-refractory rest tremor in Parkinson's disease.</measure>
    <time_frame>Prior to injection and at 30 days after injection</time_frame>
    <description>MDS-UPDRS is a clinimetric assessment of subjective and objective symptoms and signs of Parkinson's disease created by the Movement Disorder Society with high internal consistency. MDS-UPDRS retains the four-scale structure with a reorganization of the various subscales. The subscale used in this study is Part III, motor examination (18 items). The subscale now has 0-4 ratings, where 0 = normal, 1 = slight, 2 = mild, 3 = moderate, and 4 = severe.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in the Action Research Arm Test (ARAT) score after onabotulinumtoxinA on a limb afflicted by medically-refractory rest tremor in Parkinson's disease.</measure>
    <time_frame>Prior to injection and at 30 days after injection</time_frame>
    <description>The ARAT is an evaluated measure to assess specific changes in limb function after neurologic sequelae. It assesses a person's ability to handle objects differing in size, weight and shape and therefore can be considered to be an arm-specific measure of activity limitation. Values given are score at post-intervention minus score at baseline, score at 1-month follow-up minus score at baseline.
The ARAT is a 19 item measure divided into 4 sub-tests (grasp, grip, pinch, and gross arm movement). Performance on each item is rated on a 4-point ordinal scale ranging from: 3: Performs test normally 2: Completes test, but takes abnormally long or has great difficulty 1: Performs test partially 0: Can perform no part of test The maximum score on the ARAT is 57 points (possible range 0 to 57)</description>

    <measure>Change in tremor amplitude in centimeters (cm) and frequency in Hertz (Hz)</measure>
    <time_frame>Prior to injection and at 30 days after injection</time_frame>
    <description>The Px1 is a novel, external measuring device which uses motion-capture technology to determine the frequency, direction, and amplitude of movement between joints within the hand. Oscillatory movement is captured using a camera system and without ever applying any direct pressure upon the limb. Output includes tremor frequency in (Hertz Hz), and distance traveled by a hand joint as compared to other joints on the hand in centimeters (cm)</description>
