  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1, first-in-human (FIH), single site, randomized, double-blind,
      placebo-controlled study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK), and
      immunogenicity of single ascending doses of a co-administered (1:1, w/w) combination of
      REGN3048 and REGN3051 mAb's, administered IV in healthy adult volunteers. Study duration of
      approximately 16 months. Approximately 48 evaluable subjects will be enrolled in the study,
      eight (8) subjects in each one of 6 sequential ascending IV dose cohorts. In each cohort,
      subjects will be randomized to receive mAb's REGN3048 and REGN3051 (6 subjects) or placebo (2
      subjects). Primary Objective: To assess the safety and tolerability of REGN3048 and REGN3051
      following co-administration of single, ascending IV doses of 1.5, 5, 15, 25, 50, and 75 mg/kg
      of each of the two mAb's.

      25, 50, and 75 mg/kg of each of the two mAb's); 2) To assess the immunogenicity of REGN3048

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

        All must be answered yes for the subject to be eligible for study participation

          1. Informed consent understood and signed prior to initiation of any study procedures

          2. Healthy male or healthy, non-pregnant, non-lactating female, meeting eligibility
             criteria as assessed by the clinicians listed on the FDA Form 1572

          3. Willingness to comply and be available for all protocol procedures including inpatient
             confinement for about 3 days

          4. Age between 18 and 45 years, inclusive on the day of infusion

          5. Body Mass Index (BMI) of &gt; or =18.5 and &gt;or =30 kg/m2 and Weight &gt; or = 50 kg (110
             lbs) and &lt; or = 100 kg (220 lbs)

          6. In female subject of childbearing potential, a negative serum pregnancy test at
             screening and negative serum test within 24 hours prior to infusion Note: A woman is
             considered of childbearing potential unless post-menopausal (&gt; or = 1 year without
             menses without other known or suspected cause and appropriately elevated FSH) or
             surgically sterilized via bilateral oophorectomy or hysterectomy

          7. Females of childbearing potential and males agree to use acceptable contraception for
             the duration of the study Note: A highly effective method of birth control is defined
             as one that results in a low failure rate (i.e., less than 1 percent per year)
             according to the CDC criteria.30. These include progestin implants, intrauterine
             devices (IUDs), surgical (hysterectomy or tubal ligation; vasectomy) or abstinence.
             Use of methods with higher failure rate (such as progestin injectables, combined oral
             hormonal contraceptives, condoms, and diaphragms) will not be acceptable when used
             alone, but they could be considered, if used in combination with another method (for
             example, a female using combined oral contraceptives if her male partner is sterile,
             or if she and her non-sterile male partner use a double-barrier method), after
             consultation with the DMID MM. All males will be required to use a barrier method
             (condoms) for the duration of the study

          8. Screening laboratory tests, are in the normal reference range with acceptable
             exceptions

             Notes:

               1. If urinalysis by dipstick is abnormal, a complete urinalysis with microscopic
                  evaluation will be performed and the results will supersede the results of the
                  dipstick for blood, glucose and protein.

               2. Menstruating females failing inclusion criteria due to a positive blood on urine
                  test (dipstick or microscopic urinalysis) may be retested following cessation of
                  menses. Do not exclude subjects with &lt;5 RBC/HPF.

               3. Other laboratory values that are outside the range of eligibility but are thought
                  to be due to an acute condition or due to collection or laboratory error may be
                  repeated once.

          9. Vital signs are within the acceptable range

         10. Has adequate venous access for the infusion and blood collection

         11. The urine drug screen is negative

         12. Willing to abstain from alcohol consumption for a period of 2 days prior to and during
             the study

         13. Available for follow-up for the duration of the study

        participation.

        All must be answered no for the subject to be eligible for study participation
