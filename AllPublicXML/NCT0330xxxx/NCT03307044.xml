    <textblock>
      This pilot clinical trial studies how well fraction carbon dioxide (CO2) laser therapy works
      in treating vaginal atrophy in patients with breast cancer. Fraction CO2 laser therapy uses
      intense beams of light to cut, burn, or destroy tissue and may remodel vaginal tissue and
      direct controlled thermal damage of vaginal mucosa.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To demonstrate the feasibility of fractionated CO2 laser treatments in patients with
      breast cancer with vaginal atrophy by determining treatment completion rates and tolerability
      of treatment.

      II. To demonstrate the efficacy of fractionated CO2 laser treatments in patients with breast
      cancer with vaginal atrophy as determined by improvement from baseline to post treatment in
      the score of the Vaginal Assessment Scale (VAS).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Sexual behavior/function as measured by the Sexual Experiences Scare, Global sexual
      satisfaction scale, Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI), and the Female Sexual Distress Scare
      (FSDS).

      II. Other symptoms of urogenital atrophy using the Urogenital Distress Inventory (UDI).

      III. Overall patient assessment of symptoms by Patient Global Impression of Improvement scale
      (PGI-I).

      OUTLINE:

      Patients undergo fractional CO2 laser therapy every 4-6 weeks for 3 treatments.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 4 weeks.
