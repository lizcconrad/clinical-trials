  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) are major global health concerns as they commonly
      co-occur and are associated with significant morbidity, mortality, and health care
      expenditures. The Indigenous (First Nations, Metis and Inuit) population bears a
      disproportionate burden of T2DM in Canada. The prevalence of obesity among Indigenous
      individuals is approximately 31.2% compared to 18.6% for the non-Indigenous population. In
      2011, 16.7% of Manitoba's population, or four times the Canadian average, identified as
      Indigenous. At the same time, prevalence of T2DM in Manitoba is on the rise. Bariatric
      surgery is an effective treatment modality for the improvement and resolution of T2DM in
      patients who are obese. We aim to compare the effectiveness of bariatric surgery with
      conventional medical treatment in treating metabolic diseases in Indigenous people; the
      findings of which will assist in future treatment and program planning. Our objective is to
      determine whether Manitoba's urban Indigenous population will achieve better diabetic control
      and improved rates of remission of T2DM with bariatric surgery compared to best diabetic
      medical care.

      Obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) are major global health concerns as they commonly
      co-occur and are associated with significant morbidity, mortality, and health care
      expenditures. The Indigenous population bears a disproportionate burden of T2DM in Canada.
      The 2007/2008 Canadian Community Health Survey (Statistics Canada) reported the prevalence of
      obesity among Indigenous individuals is approximately 31.2% compared to 18.6% for the
      non-Indigenous population. In 2011, 16.7% of Manitoba's population, or four times the
      Canadian average, identified as Indigenous(Statistics Canada). At the same time, prevalence
      of T2DM in Manitoba is on the rise. Bariatric surgery is an effective treatment modality for
      the improvement and resolution of T2DM in patients who are obese. To date, there are no
      published studies comparing the effectiveness of bariatric surgery with conventional medical
      treatment in treating metabolic diseases in Indigenous people.

      Our objective is to determine whether Manitoba's urban Indigenous population will achieve
      better diabetic control and improved rates of remission of T2DM with bariatric surgery
      compared to best diabetic medical care (Manitoba Diabetes Care Recommendations, 2010;
      consistent with the Canadian Diabetes Association and Clinical Practice Guidelines). Our
      primary outcome is best diabetic control at one-year post-intervention, as measured by
      fasting plasma glucose and hemaglobin A1c (HbA1c). Secondary outcomes will include changes in
      diabetic medication use, mean weight loss, and percentage changes in blood pressure, waist
      circumference measurement changes, and levels of fasting blood lipids (total cholesterol,
      HDL, LDL, and triacylglycerides). Additional funding to extend the study to include follow-up
      of study participants at five years post-treatment through accessing their medical charts and
      anonymized administrative data will be sought.

    <description>Patients will undergo standard of care for bariatric surgery patients in Manitoba and receive preoperative evaluation by the Centre for Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery (CMBS) team of nurses, dietitians, psychologist, and kinesiologist. Patients must attend the standard appointments and achieve the personalized program goals to be approved for laparoscopic Roux-En-Y gastric bypass surgery. Once approved, one of four surgeons performs surgery (within 12 months of randomization). Patients are followed post-operatively (by surgeon) at 6 weeks, and at 6 and 12 months. Pharmacologic glycemic control will be determined by an endocrinologist as per a standardized post-operative protocol. Post-procedural multidisciplinary follow-up occurs based on established CMBS guidelines (phone call 1 week post-operatively and an appointment at 3 and 12 months). Patients receive surgery within the current publically funded bariatric surgery program; no additional direct costs incurred by the patients.</description>

    <description>Patients will receive the best available medical practice for the treatment, education, and follow-up T2DM based on Manitoba Diabetes Care Recommendations and Canadian Diabetes Association's clinical practice guidelines. Patients will have access to a general physician, endocrinologist, and a diabetes education group. Endocrinologists will deliver the program to patients. Diabetes care, education and self-management support services will be provided by the Victoria General Hospital (VGH) Diabetes Education Centre; led by a registered nurse and dietitian. Patients will undergo group and individual diabetes management classes and counseling on topics including diet, exercise, smoking cessation, medications, diabetic complications, and blood sugar testing. Family supports will also be provided. Medical therapies, including pharmaceutical agents, will be determined on an individual basis as per standard protocol. There will be no direct patient-related medication costs (publicly funded).</description>
