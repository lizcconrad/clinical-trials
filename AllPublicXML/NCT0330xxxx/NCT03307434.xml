  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The practice of Athletics leads to risk of injuries: about 61 to 76% athletes will occurred
      at least one injury during a season. The prevention of Athletics injuries thus represents a
      major challenge for all stakeholders around athletes. In team sports, injury prevention
      programs have been implemented and scientifically validated. However, no injury prevention
      programs have been implemented and scientifically validated for Athletics. In this context, a
      primary objective will be to analyze the effectiveness of an Athletics Injury Prevention
      Program (AIPP) to reduce the frequency (percentage) of athletes presenting at least one
      injury complaint related to athletic practice at long term (40 weeks). A statistician will
      carry out a randomized control trial in cluster (clubs with AIPP and clubs without AIPP),
      multicenter, including athletes between 15 and 40 years old and licensed in athletic clubs
      and followed during an athletic season.

      The person in charge of the platform will collect on a weekly basis via a IT-questionnaire
      sent out automatically every Monday the following parameters: injury complaints (presence or
      absence, and characteristics if presence) and exposure (number of hours of athletic practice
      (training and competition) and intensity), and the number of AIPP realization per week. The
      main criterion will be the frequency (percentage) of athletes presenting at least one injury
      complaint that have a consequence on the practice (reduction or cessation of practice).
