      The WAVECREST 2 trial is a prospective, multicenter, randomized, active controlled, clinical
      trial to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the Coherex WaveCrest Left Atrial Appendage
      (LAA) Occlusion System. Subjects will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to the Treatment Arm
      (Coherex WaveCrest LAA occlusion system) or the Control Arm (Boston Scientific's Watchman LAA
      occlusion system). The trial is designed to demonstrate that safety and effectiveness of the
      WaveCrest device are non-inferior to the Watchman device.

    <masking_description>If the subject is suspected of having a stroke since their most recent follow-up, a Neurologist blinded to subject's randomization and implanted device must evaluate the subject or otherwise provide rationale for why an in-person neurology visit and exam are unnecessary. Neurology or blinded trial personnel should also administer mRS &amp; NIHSS if there is suspicion of stroke A Clinical Events Committee, also blinded to subject's randomization, will adjudicate primary safety and effectiveness.</masking_description>
