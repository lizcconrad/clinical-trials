  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The authors aimed to compare the clinical efficacy and safety of CaO-SiO2-P2O5-B2O3 glass
      ceramics with PEEK cage that is widely used for posterior lumbar interbody fusion (PLIF)
      surgery in the clinical field.

    <measure>Visual Analog Pain Scale (VAS)</measure>
    <time_frame>3, 6, and 12, months, and every year, up to 5 year after operation</time_frame>
    <description>VAS is a measurement score that indicates pain severity status. VAS score comprised a 10-cm line with ''none'' (0) on one end of the scale and ''disabling pain'' (10) on the other.</description>

    <measure>Oswestry Disability Index (ODI)</measure>
    <time_frame>3, 6, and 12, months, and every year, up to 5 year after operation</time_frame>
    <description>The ODI is based on a self-administered questionnaire measuring ''back-specific function.'' The questionnaire comprises 10 items, each with 6 levels of response. Each item is scored from 0 to 5, and the total summation is converted to a 0-100 scale.20 The ODI scores ranges from 0 to 100, with higher scores indicating severe symptoms.</description>

    <measure>EQ-5D</measure>
    <time_frame>3, 6, and 12, months, and every year, up to 5 year after operation</time_frame>
    <description>EQ-5D is a standardized instrument developed by the EuroQol Group as a measure of health-related quality of life that can be used in a wide range of health conditions and treatments. The descriptive system comprises five dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression. This can be used as a quantitative measure of health outcome that reflects the patient's own judgement. The scores on these five dimensions can be presented as a health profile or can be converted to a single summary index number (utility) reflecting preferability compared to other health profiles.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>PainDETECT</measure>
    <time_frame>3, 6, and 12, months, and every year, up to 5 year after operation</time_frame>
    <description>The painDETECT Questionnaire (PDQ) is a screening tool designed to detect neuropathic pain in patients with chronic low back pain (LBP) based on self-reported pain characteristics. The degree of the seven types of pain quality, the type of pain pattern, and the presence of radiating pain. From the three components of the PDQ, a total score is calculated; a high score indicates that the pain is likely to have a neuropathic component. Scoring is performed using a scoring manual, and results in a final screening score: a score of 0-12 indicates nociceptive pain, 19-38 indicates neuropathic pain, and 13-18 indicates mixed pain.</description>
