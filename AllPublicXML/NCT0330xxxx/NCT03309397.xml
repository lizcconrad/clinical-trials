      Physical activity and sport are beneficial to the cardiovascular system, the musculoskeletal
      system and many chronic pathologies. The High Authority of Health (HAS) recommends a regular
      practice. However, depending on the discipline and level of practice, it may be responsible
      for traumatic injuries, degenerative musculoskeletal injuries, overtraining, eating disorders
      or cardiovascular events. It also promotes urinary stress incontinence, by increasing
      intra-abdominal pressure in some situations.

      The prevalence of urinary leakage in the athlete depends of the practiced physical activity.
      A classification of the sports activities can be carried out according to the risk of
      increased pressures on the pelvic floor:

        -  high-risk sports: trampoline (10.17), acrobatic gymnastics, aerobics, athletics (jumping
           hedges, heights, triple jump), horse riding, basketball, volleyball, handball, martial
           arts;

        -  moderate-risk sports: tennis, skiing ...

        -  low risk sports: walking, swimming, cycling, rollerblading, golf ... In sports, urinary
           incontinence also depends of the practiced movements (jumps, abdominal exercises ...),
           and the occurence of sports activity. This disorder has even become one of the concerns
           of federal sports authority (INSEP).

      However, there is no data regarding stress incontinence of sports teenagers found n the
