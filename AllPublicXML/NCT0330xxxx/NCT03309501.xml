  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Knee osteoarthritis(OA), also known as degenerative arthritis, have affected a lot of people.
      Patients with severe osteoarthritis frequently develop one or more of the typically following
      symptoms: joint pain, stiffness, activity with joint friction noise, limited mobility, such
      as difficulty walking and climbing. Now there are many western medicine treatments including
      symptom relief and joint cartilage protective agents for OA, but the results have not yet
      satisfied. TCM treatment of osteoarthritis has remarkable curative effect and unique
      advantage.Tong-Luo-Qu-Tong Plaster is a common method to treat osteoarthritis of the knee for
      thousands of years in China. It lacked a large sample randomised, double-blind, parallel
      positive controlled, multicenter clinical trial, and the clinical evidence of
      Tong-Luo-Qu-Tong Plaster for Knee Osteoarthritis need to be further completed.

      A randomised, double-blind, parallel positive controlled, multicenter clinical trial will be
      conducted to assess the effectiveness and safety of Tong-Luo-Qu-Tong Plaster on patients with
      knee osteoarthritis. A total of 2000 patients with knee osteoarthritis will be recruited and
      randomly allocated into experimental group(1500) or control group(500). Each patient will
      undergo a 2-week treatment with herbal patches for one session per day.The western Ontario
      and McMaster universities osteoarthritis index (WOMAC) as objective indicators of efficacy is
      the primary efficacy endpoint of the study.The secondary outcome measures are the changes in
      TCM syndrome quantitative score, Visual Analog Scale/Score (VAS) score of pain, and the
      effective time of pain relief of drug from the baseline to 1 week, 2 weeks' follow-up.
