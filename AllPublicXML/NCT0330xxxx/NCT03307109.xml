  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Bone and joint infections (BJI) are rare serious pathology which can lead to a very heavy
      handicap and sometimes to the life threatening. These are devastating diseases whose
      diagnosis is difficult. They are known to be associated with high mortality rates (5%) and
      significant morbidities responsible for functional sequelae (40% of patients) with an
      individual cost (prolonged hospitalization, altered quality of life) and societal (work
      stoppage, partial or total disability, temporary or permanent) extremely high.

      These bone and joint infections have a significant impact on the quality of life of those
      affected who, in addition to their infection, are reduced in their autonomy and often need to
      be taken care of outside their home, sometimes away from home.

      To the knowledge of investigators, there are few studies on the measurement of quality of
      life in patients with osteoarticular infection.

      The aim of this study is to implement the EQ-5D-3L validated quality of life questionnaire
      and the EVA scale (created by EuroQol Group) for each patient with a prosthetic joint
      infection (IPA) on prosthesis during their medical care in the department of Infectious and
      Tropical Diseases.

    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>EQ5D is one of the most widely used health states descriptive system and has a valuation in France.
EQ-5D questionnaires have 5 dimensions: &quot;Mobility&quot;, &quot;Human Autonomy,&quot; &quot;Current Activities&quot;, &quot;Pain / Discomfort&quot;, &quot;Anxiety / Depression&quot; and all dimensions are described by 3 problem levels corresponding to patient response choices.
A quality of life score is obtained according to the answers to the questionnaires.</description>

    <measure>Questionnaire EQ-5D-5L</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>In the EQ-5D-5L the 5 dimensions are described by 5 problem levels corresponding to patient response choices.
A quality of life score is obtained according to the answers to the questionnaires. In France, only the EQ-5D-3L has been validated, not yet the EQ-5D-5L which has only been translated.
In this study investigators want compare the score obtained to the questionnaires EQ5D-5L and EQ-5D-3L to determine if EQ-5D-5L is more adapted to patients having prosthetic joint infection.</description>
