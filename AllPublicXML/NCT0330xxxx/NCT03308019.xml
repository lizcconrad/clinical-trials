      This study evaluates the efficacy of scaling and root planing with and without adjunct
      antimicrobial photodynamic therapy (aPDT) in the treatment of chronic periodontitis (CP)
      among cigarette-smokers and never-smokers.

    <textblock>
      The following inclusion criteria were entailed: (a) Self-reported habitual cigarette-smokers;
      (b) self-reported never-smokers; (c) patients with CP (presence of at least 30% sites with ≥
      3 mm of CAL and PD ≥ 3 mm 18, 19 ). The exclusion criteria were as follows: (a) patients with
      systemic diseases such as acquired immune deficiency syndrome/HIV and diabetes mellitus; (b)
      habitual smokeless tobacco product and alcohol users; (c) third molars and fractured teeth
      with embedded root remnants and edentulous individuals; (d) patients with misaligned teeth;
      and (e) patients that reported to have used antibiotics, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory
      drugs and/or steroids within the past 90 days.

      Demographic information was collected using a questionnaire. Cigarette-smokers (group-1) and
      never-smokers (group-2) with chronic periodontitis were included. Treatment wise, these
      individuals were divided into two subgroups as follows: (a) SRP alone and (b) SRP with
      adjunct aPDT. Periodontal parameters (plaque index [PI], bleeding on probing [BOP], clinical
      attachment loss [CAL] and probing pocket depth ≥4mm [PD] were measured at baseline and at 1
      month and 3 months' follow-up.

    <measure>Probing depth</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Probing depth will be measured as the distance from the gingival margin to the location of the tip of the probe to the nearest millimeter. Pocket depth assessment was carried out at 6 sites per tooth for all teeth (disto-buccal, mid-buccal, mesio-buccal, mesio-lingual, mid-lingual and disto-lingual)</description>

    <measure>Clinical attachment level gain</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Clinical attachment level gain will be calculated for each site as the sum of probing depth and gingival recession. The CAL was recorded at 6 sites per tooth for all teeth (disto-buccal, mid-buccal, mesio-buccal, mesio-lingual, mid-lingual and disto-lingual) except third molars.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Plaque index</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Plaque index will be detected visually by running the probe at 4 sites per tooth (mesio-buccal, disto-buccal, mid-buccal and palatal/lingual) for absence or presence of plaque, based on dichotomous scoring system. The scores ranged as follows; 0 - No visible plaque
1 - Visible plaque</description>

    <description>Bleeding on probing will be recorded at 4 sites per tooth (mesio-buccal, disto-buccal, mid-buccal, and palatal/lingual) for absence or presence of bleeding, based on dichotomous scoring system. The scores ranged as follows; 0 - No visible bleeding

    <description>In groups 1 and 2, aPDT was performed after SRP. The protocol for aPDT is described elsewhere. Briefly, using a blunt needle, 0.005% of Methylene blue was applied into the periodontal pocket and left in place for 10 seconds. The dye was then irradiated with a diode laser (670 nanometers) at 150 milliwatts. In each dye filled periodontal pocket, laser irradiation was performed for one minute using a flexible tip. In the present study, aPDT was performed once, at baseline, by a trained dentist.</description>

    <description>In both groups, SRP was performed in one session under local anesthesia using handheld Gracey curettes No. 5/6. One trained dental hygienist blinded to the study groups and subgroups made 9 to 10 strokes in a vertical (apico-coronal) direction and the inclination between scaler tips and roots was maintained as zero. When the curved explorer indicated a smooth and hard dental surface, SRP was judged as completed. In all individuals, SRP was done in one session without any assigned time limit for completion.</description>
