  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: Cardiac rehabilitation is indicated for ischemic heart disease patients; the
      program content of which is well described in both European and American guidelines. In
      contrast, literature on cardiac rehabilitation program content and efficacy in the Asian
      population is sparse.

      Methods: BeSingCardioRehab will be an intercontinental, retrospective cohort study conducted
      in two cardiac rehabilitation referral centers in Belgium and Singapore. The first aim is to
      compare the impact of phase II center-based cardiac rehabilitation on Major Adverse Cardiac
      Events for ischemic heart disease patients between Europe (i.e. Belgian) and Asia (i.e.
      Singaporean) in the long-term. The second objective is to compare the efficacy of phase II
      cardiac rehabilitation on short-term morbidity (assessed with the validated SMART Risk Score)
      between index European and Asian ischemic heart disease patients. The level of compliance of
      the Belgian and Singaporean cardiac rehabilitation programs to European guidelines standards
      will also be evaluated.

      Hypotheses BeSingCardiorehab will be one of the first studies assessing cardiac
      rehabilitation in Asia. Based on the BeSingCardioRehab study results, phase II center-based
      cardiac rehabilitation programs, can/will be adapted in order to improve program content and
      outcomes.

      BeSingCardioRehab is an intercontinental, multi-center, retrospective cohort study conducted
      in two cardiac rehabilitation referral centers (Heart Center Hasselt in Belgium and National
      Heart Center Singapore in Singapore).

      Patients will be divided in four groups (1:1:1:1) based on i. whether or not they received
      phase II cardiac rehabilitation and ii. whether they are from Belgium or Singapore.

      The first objective of BeSingCardioRehab is to compare the impact of phase II center-based
      cardiac rehabilitation on Major Adverse Cardiac Events for ischemic heart disease patients
      between Europe (i.e. Belgian) and Asia (i.e. Singaporean) in the long-term. The second
      objective is to compare the efficacy of phase II cardiac rehabilitation on short-term
      morbidity (assessed with the validated SMART Risk Score) between index European and Asian
      ischemic heart disease patients. The level of compliance of the Belgian and Singaporean
      cardiac rehabilitation programs to European guidelines standards will also be evaluated.

        ligible study participants include patients suffering from stable ischemic heart disease,
        enrolled in phase II center-based cardiac rehabilitation. Stable ischemic heart disease is
        defined as i. patients in the revascularised, stabilized and asymptomatic phase following
        an acute coronary syndrome (ACS) (unstable angina, non ST-elevation ACS or ST-elevation
        ACS) or ii. patients initially presenting with stable angina who are revascularised or
        asymptomatic under optimal medical treatment (not amenable for revascularization) [2-4].
        Phase II cardiac rehabilitation is defined as the secondary prevention center-based
        intervention performed following the index cardiovascular disease event with the aim of
        clinical stabilization, risk stratification, and promotion of a long-term healthy status.
