      The purpose of the Mental Health in Austrian Teenagers (MHAT) - Study is to collect the first
      epidemiological data on mental health and psychiatric disorders in a representative sample of
      Austrian adolescents between 10 and 18 years.

    <textblock>
      Knowing about the prevalence of psychiatric disorders and related risk and protective factors
      is essential for the development of prevention programs and therapeutic approaches. Up to
      now, no epidemiological data on prevalence rates of psychiatric disorders and related risk
      and protective factors based on a representative sample is available for Austrian
      adolescents.

      The aim of the study is to present rates of behavioral, emotional and social problems as well
      as prevalence rates of mental disorders. Furthermore the investigators want to examine risk
      factors, protective factors and quality of life in a large sample of adolescents aged 10 to
      18 years. A two step design is chosen for this purpose to obtain diagnoses based on the
      Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of the American Psychiatric Association, Version 5 (DSM-5):

        1. Phase 1 (screening) is a screening for emotional, behavioral and social problems as well
           as social and demographic correlates, risk and protective factors and quality of life.

        2. Phase 2 (interviews) includes structured diagnostic interviews to assess psychiatric
           diagnoses according to DSM-5 criteria with adolescents above a predefined cut-off score
           in the screening, and a random sample of adolescents scoring below the cut-off.
