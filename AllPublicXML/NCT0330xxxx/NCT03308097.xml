  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will develop and test an interactive mobile messaging intervention to improve
      engagement in care related to Pre-exposure Prophylaxis (PrEP) and decrease HIV risk behaviors
      for Black men who have sex with men living in the Southern U.S. The mobile messaging
      intervention will include interactive text messaging and free, publicly available links to
      websites and YouTube videos. During the intervention participants will gain information about
      their health, improve motivation for engagement in PrEP related care, and build skills for
      healthy behaviors. Participants will also receive intervention materials to help decrease
      frequent barriers to care. If the intervention is found to be effective, it can be tested in
      a larger study and then disseminated.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The uptake of Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis (PrEP) has been slow for young Black men who have sex
      with men (BMSM) living in the Southern United States. This is a significant issue because
      eight of the ten states with the highest rates of new HIV infections are located in the
      South. Jackson, MS (the site of this project) has the second highest AIDS diagnosis rate in
      the nation, and the highest rate of HIV infection for young urban Black men who have sex with
      men. This study will develop and test an engaging, interactive, and cost effective mobile
      messaging intervention to improve linkage to PrEP care for BMSM (18-35 yrs) living in
      Jackson, MS. BMSM eligible for PrEP, receiving care at the University of Mississippi Medical
      Center STI/HIV testing clinics, will be texted interactive links to publicly available,
      online content about PrEP and HIV prevention. Links will be sent to PrEP eligible BMSM by
      8-16 interactive text messages over 4 weeks. The material used in the intervention will be
      consistent with the Information Motivation Behavior (IMB) Model and will address cultural and
      structural barriers to initiating PrEP care. A small randomized controlled study among 66 new
      participants in the clinics will examine the preliminary efficacy of the intervention
      compared to enhanced standard of care on attendance at a PrEP Services Appointment (the first
      step in initiating PrEP care). It is hypothesized that, compared to BMSM receiving enhanced
      standard of care, BMSM receiving the PrEP Mobile Messaging Intervention will show greater
      attendance at a PrEP Services Appointment and decreased HIV risk behavior at 4 and 16 weeks.
