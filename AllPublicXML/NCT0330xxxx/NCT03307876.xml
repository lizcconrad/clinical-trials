    <textblock>
      A cartilage degradation product, the Fibronectin-Aggrecan complex (FAC), has been identified
      in patients with degenerative disc disease (DDD). Alpha-2-macroglobulin (A2M) can prevent the
      formation of the G3 domain of aggrecan, reducing the fibronectin-aggrecan G3 complex and
      therefore may be an efficacious treatment. The present study was designed to determine 1) the
      ability of autologous concentrated A2M to relieve back pain in patients with LBP from DDD and
      2) the ability of FAC to predict the response to this biologic therapy.

      24 patients with low back pain and MRI-concordant DDD had prospective evaluation. Oswestry
      disability index (ODI) and visual analog scores (VAS) were noted at baseline and at 3- and
      6-month follow-up. Primary outcome of clinical improvement was defined as patients with both
      a decrease in VAS of at least 3 points and ODI &gt;20 points. Molecular discography and delayed
      FAC analysis and injection of platelet poor plasma at the time of the procedure. Patients
      with FACT-positive assays were significantly more likely to show improvement in their VAS and
      ODI at follow-up.

      Objectives: A cartilage degradation product, the Fibronectin-Aggrecan complex (FAC), has been
      identified in patients with degenerative disc disease (DDD). Alpha-2-macroglobulin (A2M) can
      prevent the formation of the G3 domain of aggrecan, reducing the fibronectin-aggrecan G3
      complex and therefore may be an efficacious treatment. The present study was designed to
      determine 1) the ability of autologous platelet poor plasma (PPP) with concentrated A2M to
      relieve back pain in patients with low back pain (LBP) from DDD and 2) the ability of FAC to
      predict the response to this biologic therapy.

      Study design/setting: Prospective cohort

      Patients: 24 patients with low back pain and MRI-concordant DDD

      Methods: All patients underwent lavage for molecular discography and delayed FAC analysis and
      injection of autologous platelet poor plasma (PPP) rich in A2M (Cytonics Autologous Protease
      Inhibitor Concentrate, APIC) at the time of the procedure. ANOVA with Bonferonni correction
      for multiple comparisons was performed.
