  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Measuring brain perfusion is biased by a inter- and intrasubject variability, caused by
      physiological and lifestyle factors. In this study, the investigators want to investigate the
      effects of a different mood state (neutral, positive and negative mood), induced using
      subjects own memories, on both global and regional cerebral perfusion, measured with arterial
      spin labeling.
