  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Osteoporosis is a common disease that makes the bones fragile and easy to break. Osteoporotic
      fractures are a serious health problem resulting in pain, reduced mobility, increasing degree
      of dependence and sometimes death.

      Osteoporosis is currently diagnosed by measuring bone density at the hip/spine through an
      exam called DXA. Although all post-menopausal women are at higher risk, currently Italian
      national guidelines do not recommend population-screening programs. This leads to several
      cases not being identified before a fracture occurs.

      Since dental panoramic radiographs (OPGs) are common procedures during dental check-ups or
      before dental treatments, it would be of great value if dentists could use them to identify
      people with unknown osteoporosis and early refer them to a specialist before they fracture.

      This study aims to test if it is meaningful to use OPGs to screen for post-menopausal
      osteoporosis. In particular, it will inform on how many undiagnosed osteoporotic women attend
      a Dental Hospital, how willing they are to have a DXA scan after a dental appointment and how
      precise the OPGs are as screening tools.

      124 post-menopausal women will be recruited, which will undergo an OPG and a DXA scan to
      check their bone density.

      Background:

      The World Health Organization (WHO) has defined osteoporosis as a level of bone mineral
      density (BMD), calculated with DXA (Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry) technique, 2.5 standard
      deviations (SD) or more below the average mean value of young healthy women (T-score ≤ -2.5)
      (Kanis et al., 2013).

      Although the WHO reports that there is indirect evidence supporting screening programs in
      women aged 65 or older, current Italian national guidelines do not recommend
      population-screening programs for osteoporosis (SIOMMMS 2015). As a consequence, a
      significant part of Italian osteoporotic patients that may develop a fracture is left
      undetected and untreated. Although it is recommended to assess risk of osteoporotic fractures
      with the WHO FRAX tool in all women ≥65 years and men ≥75 years and refer for DXA
      accordingly, it is not clear how well this tool has been adopted by general practitioners
      (GPs) in Italy.

      Considering the high percentage of people attending regular dental visits (&gt; 22 million
      according to ISTAT 2013) and the fact that panoramic radiographs of the jawbones are a common
      procedure that is performed during routine dental check-ups or before several dental
      treatments, it could be of great clinical value if dentists could opportunistically use
      panoramic X-rays to identify patients at a high risk of osteoporosis.

      In the past years, specific quantitative and qualitative indices/parameters, which can be
      calculated on dental panoramic radiographs, have been proposed as tools to detect
      osteoporosis, with different levels of accuracy.

      Amongst the quantitative indices, the most adopted ones are the mandibular cortical width
      (MCW) and the panoramic mandibular index (PMI). The MCW represents the width of the
      mandibular cortex and it is measured in the mental foramen region, along a line passing
      through the middle of the mental foramen and perpendicular to the tangent to the lower border
      of the mandible. The PMI represents the ratio between the mandibular cortical width at mental
      foramen region and the distance from the lower border to the inferior edge of the mental
      foramen.

      Amongst the qualitative indices, the Klemetti index (KI) is by far the most applied one. KI
      qualitatively classifies the mandibular cortex distally to the mental foramen in the
      following categories: C1, when the endosteal margin is even and sharp; C2, when the endosteal
      margin presents lacunar resorption or cortical residues on one or both sides; and C3, when
      the cortical layer is clearly porous, with heavy endosteal cortical residues. A recent
      systematic review and meta-analysis from our group showed that the presence of any kind of
      cortical porosity (C2+C3) is associated to a sensitivity and specificity in detecting
      osteoporosis of 80.6% and 64.3%, respectively. The advantage of using this index, compared to
      other available indices, is that it is straightforward and relatively easy to measure and it
      does not require specific softwares.

      It is clear that the panoramic indices cannot replace the diagnosis of osteoporosis by BMD
      measurement with DXA scan. However, whenever a panoramic radiograph is available, they might
      be opportunistically used to detect previously undiagnosed osteoporotic patients and refer
      them to a specialist before they develop a fracture.

      While several studies support the use of panoramic indices, they have never been tested in an
      Italian University Hospital setting and in a study adequately powered and controlled for
      confounding variables.

      Study description:

      This is a feasibility study designed as a cross-sectional study aiming to recruit a cohort of
      124 consecutive post-menopausal women. Participants will be recruited from the &quot;Centro
      Universitario di Odontoiatria, Dipartimento di Medicina e Chirurgia, Università di Parma&quot;.
      Leaflets advertising the study and giving contact points will be placed in the &quot;Centro
      Malattie Osteometaboliche&quot;, in the &quot;Centro Universitario di Odontoiatria&quot; and will be sent to
      the General Practitioners of Parma.

      Before enrolment, written and verbal information will be given to the patients and written
      informed consent will be obtained.

      Study visits include enrolment (Visit 1) and DXA scan (Visit 2).

      1.1 Visit 1 (Enrolment)

        -  Signing of informed consent;

        -  Recording of any concomitant medication;

        -  Confirmation of participant eligibility in relation to the inclusion/exclusion criteria;

        -  Examination of hard and soft tissues;

        -  Full-mouth six-points pocket chart, with recording of probing pocket depth (PPD),
           recession (REC), furcation involvement and mobility. The results of the dental and
           periodontal examination will be explained to the patients. The trial will not cover the
           expenses for any treatment the patients might need.

        -  Dental panoramic radiograph (if not performed within the previous 6 months at Centro
           Universitario di Odontoiatria)

      1.2 Visit 2 (DXA scan) (within 6 months from enrolment)

      - DXA scan at lumbar spine and hip at &quot;Centro Osteoporosi e malattie metaboliche
      scheletriche&quot; (if not performed within the previous 6 months)

      Photos of the teeth may be taken to facilitate case documentation. Subjects will not be
      identifiable.

      At the end of visit 2, two examiners blinded to the DXA results will independently measure
      the panoramic indices on the OPGs. In particular, for the KI, the level of mandibular
      cortical erosion in the mental foramen region will be qualitatively evaluated after zooming
      the OPG and optimization of the image contrast and white balance.

      The MCW and PMI will be measured with the digital software provided by ORTHOPHOS XG 3D.

      After at least 1 week, the examiners will repeat the measurements in 20% of the OPGs, in
      order to evaluate intra- and inter- examiner reproducibility.

OPGs are routine low-dose x-rays that are often performed during dental check-ups, follow-ups or before dental treatments (e.g. extractions, implant placement, etc.), as they allow the evaluation of both bone and dental structures of both jaws, the sinus and temporo-mandibular joints.</description>

DXA is a low-dose exam that allows the measurement of bone mineral density in relation to a T- score, and is considered the gold-standard for the diagnosis of osteoporosis.
Patients will be classified into healthy (T score -1), osteopenic (T score between -1 and -2.5) and osteoporotic (T score-2.5).</description>
