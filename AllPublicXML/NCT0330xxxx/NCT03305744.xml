  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study evaluates cardiac structure and function differences between healthy endurance
      trained athletes with atrial fibrillation and healthy age matched endurance trained athletes
      without atrial fibrillation. It is hypothesized that despite having similar structural
      adaptations of the heart (due to endurance training), athletes with atrial fibrillation
      display will impaired heart functional measures compared to endurance athletes without atrial
      fibrillation.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Regular physical activity, including vigorous exercise, lowers cardiovascular risk factors,
      including the risk of developing Atrial Fibrillation (AF), one of the most commonly diagnosed
      types of arrhythmias. Paradoxically, despite the cardioprotective effects of exercise, middle
      aged endurance athletes are at 5 fold risk of developing AF compared to active individuals.
      Long standing endurance training induces significant changes to the heart- collectively known
      as the 'athlete's heart.' While these changes may be beneficial for performance, they may be
      conducive in promoting the risk of AF in this cohort. The aim of this study is to compare
      cardiac structure and function in endurance athletes diagnosed with AF (n=17) and in healthy
      aged matched endurance athletes (n=17). Male subjects between ages 45 and 65 years old with a
      long-standing history of endurance training and competition will be recruited. Heart
      structure and function will be compared at rest and during submaximal exercise. Participants
      will also complete fitness assessments and questionnaires that characterize their lifetime
      involvement in exercise training. This study will address the gap in the literature regarding
      the interaction of endurance training and AF risk.

    <measure>Left intra-atrial electromechanical delay (ms)</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline (day 1: at first visit, one time measure)</time_frame>
    <description>Left intra-atrial electromechanical delay will be measured using cardiac echocardiography at rest and during submaximal cycling. Left intra-atrial electromechanical delay will be measured as the time interval between the initiation of the P wave (on an electrocardiogram) to the beginning of the late diastolic wave (Am wave) on echocardiography.</description>

    <measure>Left atrial reservoir function</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline (day 1: at first visit, one time measure)</time_frame>
    <description>Left atrial reservoir function will be measured by Speckle Tracking echocardiography, at 60-80 frames per second. Left atrial reservoir function will be measured by assessing left atrial reservoir strain (%), measured during ventricular systole on echocardiography.</description>

    <measure>Left atrial volume (mL)</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline (day 1: at first visit, one time measure)</time_frame>
    <description>Left atrial volume (mL) will be measured using echocardiography at the end of ventricular systole, prior to the opening of the mitral valve. Imaging will be acquired using two and four chamber views.</description>
