    <textblock>
      The Brevera Breast Biopsy System integrates tissue acquisition, real time imaging, and post
      biopsy handling all during the same procedure. This post-market clinical trial will be
      performed to obtain clinical/operational data and feedback on the Brevera Breast Biopsy
      System as compared to the current standard-of-care breast biopsy procedures

    <intervention_model_description>Each individual radiologist will enroll a maximum of twenty (20) subjects, and a maximum of three (3) radiologists may participate in this study from each representative study site. After a radiologist completes his or her five (5) cases with Brevera in Phase (1), each site will begin to sequentially enroll subjects based on a block-stratified randomization. Subjects will either be enrolled to have their biopsy procedure performed using current standard-of-care breast biopsy procedures at the site or Brevera Breast Biopsy procedures based on the block diagram given in Figure.
Randomization of enrollment will be determined prior to study start-up and provided to each site. Each radiologist will enroll 20 total subjects as part of the block stratification phase.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>A breast biopsy is a test that removes tissue or sometimes fluid from the suspicious area. The removed cells are examined under a microscope and further tested to check for the presence of breast cancer. A biopsy is a diagnostic procedure that can definitely determine if the suspicious area is cancerous.</description>
