      The purpose of this study is to compare electrical acute changes between simultaneous and
      sequential LV pacing and to assess the paced QRSd over a range of inter- and
      intra-ventricular programmable delays setting during MPP pacing.

      The study will be a prospective, single-arm, non-randomized, non-blinded, acute study
      conducted at CRT device implant and prior to subject discharge. Subjects scheduled to be
      implanted with a Quadripolar Pacing System who provide informed consent will undergo
      &quot;Enrollment&quot; and participate in &quot;SCOPE-CRT&quot; study. Enrollment and device implant can occur in
      the same day. Including Enrollment, each subject's participation is expected to be 1-2 days.
      The total duration of the study is expected to be 12 months, including Enrollment. Enrollment
      will include the Informed Consent process, physical examination, and collection of
      demographics, cardiovascular history, medical history, and medications.

      During CRT implant, surface ECG and PV loop recordings will be taken over the different
      programmable MPP settings. Following data collection, CRT device programming will be left to
      the discretion of the physician.

        A total of 50 selected heart failure patients with approved indication for CRT by European
        Society of Cardiology/European Heart Rhythm Association guidelines (ESC/EHRA) will be
        enrolled for this prospective study.

             Heart Rhythm Association guidelines (ESC/EHRA)

          -  QRS duration &gt; 130 ms

          -  Ability to provide informed consent for study participation

               -  VT or VF treatable by surgery
