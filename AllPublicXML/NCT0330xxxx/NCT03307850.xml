  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This clinical trial will identify exercise-related and emotional stress related effects on
      glycemic control in patients with type 1 diabetes using sensor-augmented pump (SAP) therapy.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with type 1 diabetes (T1D) on an insulin pump will be studied for 5 weeks in the
      outpatient setting performing their normal activities, to include their normal diet and
      exercise, while assessing the amount of type of exercise performed, and emotional stress
      levels, using stress sensor, questionnaires and salivary cortisol levels.

Subjects at the William Sansum Diabetes Center will perform graded exercise on a treadmill for up to 45 minutes with all activity and stress monitors running, achieving 30 and 60% calculated heart rate reserve, once during the study. Subjects at Mayo Clinic will perform a graded exercise test on a treadmill to determine V02max and ensure stable cardiac status, once during the study.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Age 18-75 years

          -  Clinical diagnosis, based on investigator assessment, of T1D for at least one year and
             using insulin for at least 1 year.

          -  Using an insulin pump for diabetes therapy for at least 3 months

          -  Demonstration of proper mental status and cognition for the study

          -  Non-smoker

          -  If not currently using CGM, willing to use CGM during the study

          -  An understanding of and willingness to follow the protocol and sign the informed
             consent

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Admission for diabetic ketoacidosis in the 6 months prior to enrollment unless study
             team feels the subject is appropriate for study given complete clinical context for
             subject

          -  Severe hypoglycemia resulting in seizure or loss of consciousness &gt; once in the 6
             months prior to enrollment

          -  History of a seizure disorder (except hypoglycemic seizure), unless written clearance

             with the completion of the protocol such as the following examples:

               2. Presence of a known adrenal disorder or chronic oral steroid therapy

               3. Abnormal liver function test results (Transaminase &gt;3 times the upper limit of
                  normal); testing required for subjects taking medications known to affect liver
                  function or with diseases known to affect liver function

               4. Abnormal renal function test results (calculated GFR &lt;60 mL/min/1.73m2);

               5. Active gastroparesis (defined actively being treated with medications)

          -  If on antihypertensive, thyroid, anti-depressant or lipid lowering medication, lack of

          -  Abuse of alcohol or recreational drugs

          -  Pregnancy

          -  Infectious process not anticipated to resolve prior to study procedures (e.g.
             meningitis, pneumonia, osteomyelitis).

          -  Uncontrolled arterial hypertension (Resting diastolic blood pressure &gt;90 mmHg and/or
             systolic blood pressure &gt;160 mmHg) at the time of screening

          -  Uncontrolled microvascular complications such as current active proliferative diabetic
             retinopathy defined as proliferative retinopathy requiring treatment (e.g. laser
             therapy) in the past 12 months.

          -  A recent injury to body or limb, muscular disorder, use of any medication, any
             carcinogenic disease, or other significant medical disorder if that injury, medication
             or disease in the judgment of the investigator will affect the completion of the
             protocol.
