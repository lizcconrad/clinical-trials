  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators recently completed an NIMH R34 in which they piloted a patient- and
      provider-informed tablet-based toolkit designed to facilitate delivery of Trauma-Focused
      Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (TF-CBT) - a treatment that was selected because it addresses a
      wide range of symptoms using techniques shared by other treatments for emotional and
      behavioral disorders. The tablet-based toolkit consists of numerous components (e.g., videos,
      interactive games, drawing applications) that are designed to facilitate provider-patient
      interactions in a way that enhances children's engagement and supports adherence to the
      treatment model. The tablet-based toolkit was very well received by children, caregivers, and
      providers in the pilot evaluation. Moreover, all benchmarks for feasibility were met or
      exceeded. This study proposes to conduct a hybrid effectiveness-implementation trial to
      examine the extent to which the tablet intervention may improve fidelity, engagement, and
      children's mental health outcomes. The investigators will conduct a randomized controlled
      trial with 120 mental health providers and 360 families in partnership with dozens of clinics
      in the Carolinas and Florida. Providers will be assigned randomly to tablet-facilitated vs.
      standard TF-CBT. Youth aged 8-16 years with clinically elevated symptoms of PTSD will be
      recruited. Baseline and 3-, 6-, 9-, and 12-month post-baseline assessments will be conducted
      by independent, blind evaluators. Sessions will be videorecorded for observational coding of
      engagement and fidelity by independent raters blind to study hypotheses. The investigators
      will also examine costs and conduct semi-structured interviews with families, providers,
      supervisors, and agency leaders to inform future dissemination and implementation
      initiatives. Technology-based resources that are scalable, easy to use, and designed for
      efficient integration into everyday practice may have sustained national impact.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Assuring children access to the highest quality mental health care is a top national
      priority. Yet, quality of care continues to be highly variable in traditional service
      settings. Novel, scalable solutions are needed to address modifiable quality-of-care
      indicators in sustainable ways. To this end, provider fidelity and children's engagement are
      key correlates of clinical outcome and practical targets for intervention. There is
      tremendous opportunity to address both through technology. Studies in child education show
      that interactive games, touch-screen learning, and demonstration videos enhance engagement,
      knowledge, motivation, and learning. These benefits also may extend to the therapeutic
      context, where strategic integration of technology-based activities may enhance children's
      learning, strengthen the therapeutic alliance, and keep providers on protocol. The
      investigators recently completed an NIMH R34 in which they piloted a patient- and
      provider-informed tablet-based toolkit designed to facilitate delivery of Trauma-Focused
      Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (TF-CBT) - a treatment that was selected because it addresses a
      wide range of symptoms using techniques shared by other treatments for emotional and

      interactions in a way that enhances children's engagement and supports adherence to the
      treatment model. The tablet-based toolkit was very well received by children, caregivers, and
      providers in the picot evaluation and all benchmarks for feasibility were met or exceeded.

    <description>Child engagement will be measured via coding of audiotaped sessions by independent, trained raters who are blind to study purpose and hypotheses. The Child Involvement Ratings Scale (CIRS), a 6-item scale that measures child engagement for each session, will be used. Four &quot;positive&quot; involvement items and two &quot;negative&quot; involvement items are rated for each session on a 6-point scale (&quot;not at all&quot; to &quot;a great deal&quot; present). The positive-involvement items emphasize the extent to which children initiate discussions, demonstrate enthusiasm, self-disclose, and demonstrate understanding. Negative-involvement items address withdrawal or avoidance in treatment. Coders provide ratings based on two 10-min segments of session audiotapes (beginning at min 10 and min 40).</description>

    <description>Fidelity to the TF-CBT protocol will be measured via coding of videotaped treatment sessions by independent, trained raters who are blind to study purpose and hypotheses. Ratings will be completed using the TF-CBT Version of the Therapy Process Observational Coding System for Child Psychotherapy (TF-CBT TPOCS-S), a behaviorally specific checklist of TF-CBT provider behavior that we have modified for the current study to ensure relevance to the eTF-CBT condition. This checklist will be used to calculate providers' fidelity to each TF-CBT component. Two independent raters will listen to video-recorded treatment session tapes and complete the TF-CBT TPOCS-S to code the presence/absence of specific treatment techniques depicted on the tapes.</description>
