      This study aimed to verify if combination of a healthy diet and orange juice consumption can
      minimize cardiometabolic risk factors for Metabolic Syndrome (MetS)

      The clinical study was parallel, controlled, and randomized with metabolic syndrome subjects
      (ATPIII, AHA / NHLA) aimed at the consumption of an energy-balanced balanced diet for 12
      weeks and divided into two groups: Control (n = 38): dietary guidance only; and Orange Juice
      (n = 38): diet guidance associated with 500 mL / day of 100% whole orange juice. The
      recruitment process began in June 2016, the intervention was carried out from September 2016
      to December 2016, and the data analysis started in January 2016. The sample number took into
      account variances on LDL-C, with a type I error α = 0.05 and a type II error β = 0.2 (80%
      power). The minimum sample size should have 32 individuals per group (n = 64). Considering an
      approximately 15% dropout rate, the final sample size of study was constituted by 38
      individuals per group. Primary and secondary endpoints were the reduction of LDL-C and
      modification of the levels of cardiometabolic risk factors, inflammatory and hemodynamics
      parameters, respectively. Kolmogorov Smirnov and Levene test assessed normality and
      homogeneity of data, respectively. T-test was conducted to identify possible differences
      between OJ and control groups at baseline. A linear mixed-effects model was apply to
      determine the time effect within and between groups (Sidak post hoc) and P significance was
      set up ≤ 0.05. The assessment of body composition, metabolic biomarkers and food intake were
      analyzed over a 12-week intervention.

    <description>Nutritionists prescribed the same balanced diet for both groups keeping suffice energy to maintain the current weight, estimated from total energy expenditure (TEE) for each individual and based on individual weight. The dietary plan was composed of six meals/day: breakfast (fat-free milk and coffee; whole-grain bread with margarine, and an apple); snack 1 (250 mL OJ/ banana or other fruits and free-fat yogurt); lunch (brown rice, beans, grilled lean meat, salad, cooked vegetables); snack 2 (250 mL OJ / free-fat yogurt with oatmeal); dinner (brown rice, beans, grilled lean meat, cooked vegetables and salad); and snack 3 (salty crackers or oat cookies, tea without sugar). Body composition measurements were colected every two weeks; blood samples and dietary questionnaires, monthly.</description>
