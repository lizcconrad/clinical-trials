  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Although Cystic Fibrosis is a complex genetic disease affecting many organs, lung disease is
      the primary cause of mortality. The objective of this study is to determine the safety and
      tolerability of SNSP113 in healthy subjects and subjects with stable cystic fibrosis.
