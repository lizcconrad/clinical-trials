  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Psychiatrists have expressed concern at the emergence of education as a serious source of
      stress for school-going children - causing high incidence of deaths by suicide. Many
      adolescents in India are referred to hospital psychiatric units for school-related distress -
      exhibiting symptoms of depression, high anxiety, frequent school refusal, phobia, physical
      complaints, irritability, weeping spells, and decreased interest in school work. Previous
      studies have found significant anxiety, distress, depression, worn outs and severe impact of
      psychological factors on the performances of dental, engineering and medical student. But
      students preparing for competitive exams have not been studied yet.

      Current study reports the scientific evidence of immediate effect of yoga based techniques
      combined with music and Vedic chants on adolescents preparing for competitive exams.
