  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      PTC(Pseudotumor cerebri) patients may develop increased Intracranial pressure (ICP) that can
      produces increased pressure around the distal optic nerve,which is likely followed by venule
      compression, ischemia, and loss of visual function.Vision loss in PTC is most commonly
      characterized by standard automated perimetry to measure peripheral visual field sensitivity.

      Pupillometry is a promising approach for functional assessment in PTC because it is
      noninvasive, objective, performed quickly with minimal patient cooperation needed.

      The feasibility of using chromatic multifocal pupillometry for assesment of PTC will be
      examined.
