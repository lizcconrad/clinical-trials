  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Type 2 diabetes is the largest growing concern across the globe, and this is particularly
      apparent in developing countries, including Nepal. Despite the growing burden and chronic
      nature of diabetes, prevention and control of this disease is far from adequate setting in
      Nepal. Moreover, there is lack of evidence on effectiveness and affordability of a population
      approach on reducing blood glucose level among diabetes persons. The main aim of this study
      is to determine the effect of Female Community Health Volunteers' (FCHVs)-led family-based
      health education and screening on blood sugar level in adults at community level in Nepal.
      This is a community-based cluster randomized controlled trial involving family based health
      education through FCHVs in Nepal. People ≥25 years of age listed in the Community-Based
      Management of Hypertension (COBIN) study and who were diabetics are eligible for eligible for
      participation in the study. FCHVs will conduct family based health education and fasting
      blood glucose measurements in the treatment arm vs not any interventions in the control arm.
      Independent assessors will conduct the baseline and end line assessment of the intervention.
      Intention to treat analysis and per protocol analysis will be used in analysis to detect
      significant differences between treatment and control group participants at baseline and
      follow up. For individual outcomes, proportions will be compared using Chi-square test and
      continuous measures will be compared using t-tests. Random effect mixed regression analysis
      will be adjusted for age and sex. Since randomisation will be at the cluster level in the
      study, a random-effect model will be used to account for clustering effect. Effectiveness of
      the intervention will be tested by analysis of covariance, which will allow us to adjust for
      baseline differences between groups. It is anticipated that the study can give valuable
      information regarding effectiveness, acceptability, and feasibility of an innovative way to
      improve diabetes management. Assessing the FCHVs' ability to address diabetes may contribute
      to develop a policy that can be scaled-up to a national level.
