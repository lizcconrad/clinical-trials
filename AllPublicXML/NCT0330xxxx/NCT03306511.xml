  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Few studies indicate that sprint performance may be impaired in football players with a
      previous hamstring strain injury. This exploratory cross-sectional study aim to compare
      sprint performance between football players with and without a previous hamstring strain
      injury. The findings may elucidate potential indications of insufficient rehabilitation
      following a hamstring strain injury.

      Sprint performance data will be collected using the MySprint Iphone Application.

      Due to pragmatic reasons and the exploratory nature of this study the aim is to include
      players on a team level.

      Based on the prevalence of hamstring strain injuries the expected number of cases to be
      included are 10-20 football players with a previous hamstring strain injury, and a
      corresponding 80-90 number of healthy controls.

      No outcomes will be weighted (flat outcome structure).
