  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) is embarking on a clinical program to assess the treatment of PAH with
      an Angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). This new treatment may require subcutaneous
      administration, in comparison to current treatments which are taken orally. Hence, GSK would
      like to conduct this qualitative interview study with PAH subjects to explore subject's
      perspective and preferences for various modes of treatment administration (daily or weekly
      subcutaneous injection versus current treatment options). This will be a qualitative study
      comprising the conduct of semi-structured telephone concept elicitation interviews with 8 to
      10 PAH subjects (each approximately 30 minutes in duration) in the United States (US).

    <description>All interview questions are designed to be very open-ended in order to ascertain subjects' preferences in an un-biased manner (as possible), with additional probes only being used when necessary to ensure all concepts of interest are covered. Subjects will be asked a series of broad, open-ended questions designed to encourage them to talk openly and as spontaneously as possible about their experience of taking oral treatment(s) for their PAH.</description>

        A sample of 8 to 10 US-English speaking subjects will be recruited. Recruitment will be
        facilitated by a third-party vendor in the US. A purposive approach to sampling will be
        employed to ensure subjects with a range of demographic and clinical characteristics are
        recruited.
