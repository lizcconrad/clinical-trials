  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1, multiple dose, open-label pharmacokinetic study conducted in healthy adult
      male and female subjects to determine and compare plasma, epithelial lining fluid (ELF) and
      alveolar macrophage (AM) concentrations of ETX2514 and sulbactam in healthy adult subjects
      after intravenous infusion of ETX2514 1.0 g given concurrently with intravenous sulbactam 1.0
      g, administered every 6 hours with each infused over 3 hours, for 3 consecutive doses
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Blood samples for determining plasma concentrations of ETX2514 and sulbactam will be
      collected within 5 minutes prior to and at 1.0, 2.0, 2.5, 2.95, 3.05, 3.25, 3.5, 4.0, 5.0 and
      6.0 hours after start of the third dose (last dose) administered on Day 2.

      Each subject will undergo one standardized bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) in
      the outpatient bronchoscopy suite at 1.0, 2.5, 3.25, 4.0, or 6.0 hours after start of the
      infusion of the third dose of ETX2514 and sulbactam (6 subjects per timepoint) on Day 2.

      Safety will be assessed throughout the study by adverse event monitoring, clinical laboratory
      tests, ECG, physical examination, and vital sign monitoring.
