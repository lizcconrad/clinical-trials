      This study will measure the risks and benefits of early screening of Alzheimer's disease.
      Early diagnosis through screening may enhance the family member's transition to a family
      caregiver and reduce caregiver burden by providing an opportunity for the family member to
      learn about the syndrome, receive interventions, and to prepare for their new care giving
      role.

      Specific Aim 1: Multi-level mixed effects models will be used to examine differences in HUI
      scores for both patients and family members using dyadic analytic approaches. For this aim,
      the investigators will compare family members in the two screening groups (screening only and
      screening plus) to those in the no screening group. Repeated HUI scores from both patients
      and family members will be included as the outcome variables with participant type (patient
      or family member), group (screening only and screening plus versus no screening), time, and
      interaction between groups and time as independent variables while adjusting for the time and
      occurrence of prior screening that the patient experienced. The investigators will use a
      multi-level variance-covariance matrix in the mixed effects models to account for three
      sources of potential correlations: (1) correlations from measures obtained from the same
      individual over time. An autoregressive correlation will be used; (2) correlations within a
      dyad between a patient and his/her family member; and (3) correlations for outcome measured
      from individuals within the same randomization group. A compound symmetry structure will be
      used for the latter two correlations. Parameter estimation and hypothesis tests for the
      mixed-effects models will be conducted using the maximum likelihood approach that provides
      robust estimation under the missing at random mechanisms. A significant interaction between
      group and time would indicate differences in changes of HUI over time between the two groups.
      Absence of significant interactions, significant main group effects will suggest differences
      in HUI between groups at both follow-up times. For Hypothesis 1 the investigators will use a
      linear contrast for HUI from family members in the combined screening groups (screening only
      and screening plus) versus the no screening group at 12 months. The investigators will also
      include additional covariates in the mixed effects models to determine whether family member
      characteristics (relationship to patient, frequency or types of contact, etc.) and knowledge
      of screening are associated with the outcome measures.

      The multi-level mixed effects models provide a powerful modeling framework for analyzing
      dyadic outcomes. An alternative model using family member outcomes as the dependent variable
      and patient outcomes as an independent variable would underestimate variances in outcome
      measures by ignoring the randomness in the patients' outcomes by treating patient outcomes as
      fixed covariates.86 In our proposed models, correlations between patients and their family
      members on outcome measures (congruence) are explicitly included in the mixed effects models
      and estimated using maximum likelihood approach. The inclusion of the additional covariance
      structure due to repeated measures and within group correlation also makes it possible to
      estimate potential differences in patient-family member congruence over time and among the
      randomization groups. Comparisons on patient-family member congruence among the groups will
      be conducted using the likelihood ratio test (LRT) derived from a mixed effects model using
      group specific correlation structure versus a model using the same correlation in all four
      groups. Changes in congruence can also be conducted using LRT comparing a mixed effects model
      with time specific correlation structure versus a model using equal correlations across time.
      By re-aligning data from the family member one lag time behind measures from patients, the
      investigators will also be able to detect a lag effect in family member outcomes using this
      modeling framework.

      To account for the potential impact from the frequency of screening, the investigators will
      include the number of previous AD screenings from either CHOICE or primary care screening
      (routine or AWV) captured in electronic medical records as a covariate in the mixed effects
      model. Number of months between the first AD screening to the time of HUI measure will also
      be included to control for the time lapse from screening to outcome measures. Given that our
      randomization is stratified by previous CHOICE screening assignment, patients receiving
      previous screening will be balanced across the three randomized groups.

      Specific Aim 2: Separate mixed effects models with PHQ-9 or GAD-7 scores collected at
      baseline, 6 or 12 months from both patients and family members will be used as the outcome
      variables for Specific Aim 2. Participant type, randomized group, time and interaction
      between group and time will be used as independent variables, similarly to the modeling
      procedures described in details for Aim 1 above. Linear contrasts will be used to compare
      PHQ-9 and GAD-7 scores from family members in the combined screening groups versus the no
      screening group at 12 months. Frequency and time of previous AD screenings will also be
      included in the mixed effects models to examine the potential impact from the frequency of
      screening.

      Specific Aim 3: Mixed effects models with Caregiver Preparedness Scale or the Revised Scale
      for Caregiver Self-Efficacy scores collected at baseline, 6 or 12 months will be used as the
      outcome variables, group (screening only and screening plus versus no screening), time and
      interaction between group and time as independent variables. Using the Role Transitions
      Framework, the investigators expect higher caregiver preparedness and self-efficacy in the
      screening groups at 6 months and continued higher increases in these measures over the 12
      month follow-up period compared to those in the control group. Linear contrasts will be used
      to compare preparedness and caregiver self-efficacy scores in the combined screening groups
      versus the no screening group at 12 months. The investigators will also control for the
      frequency of previous screening as described in Aim 1 and evaluate potential interactions
      between patients/family member characteristics and time to identify variables associated with
      increased level of caregiver preparedness and self-efficacy over time.

      Specific Aim 4: To measure the impact and compare strategies for evaluation and treatment
      post screening, the investigators will compare quality of life measures, depression and
      anxiety symptoms from family members in the screening only (notify dyad and PCP of results
      only) group to the screening plus (notify dyad and PCP and a referral to ABC Med Home if
      screen positive) group using multi-level mixed effects models, similarly to the approach
      described in details for Aim 1. Separate mixed effects models with HUI, PHQ-9 or GAD-7 scores
      collected at baseline, 6 or 12 months from family members will be used as the outcome
      variables. Screening group (screening only versus screening plus), time and interaction
      between group and time will be used as independent variables. Linear contrasts will be used
      to compare HUI, PHQ-9 and GAD-7 scores between the two screening groups at 12 months.

    <description>The investigators will use the Preparedness for Caregiving Scale to measure the impact of ADRC screening on family member preparedness. The Preparedness for Caregiving Scale consists of eight items that asks family members how well prepared they believe they are for multiple domains of caregiving. Responses are rated on a 5-point scale with scores ranging from 0 (not at all prepared) to 4 (very well prepared). The scale is scored by calculating the mean of all items answered with a score range of 0 to 4.
