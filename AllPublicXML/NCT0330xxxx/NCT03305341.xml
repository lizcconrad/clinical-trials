      The usual approach group, after local therapy with surgery, 300 double blind random group
      separated SCLC patients currently used the Combined Chemotherapy on ETOPOSIDE INJECTION plus

      The detailed methods:

        -  1) Detect drug target whole gene precision sequence of everyone patient for all 600
           recruited double blind SCLC patients.

        -  2) Mutually compare everyone patient drug target whole gene precision sequence for total
           600 recruited double blind SCLC patients.

        -  3) Calculate drug target gene SNPs in all 600 recruited double blind SCLC patients.

        -  4) Correlate everyone patient drug target gene SNP to everyone patient drug efficacy.

        -  5) Correlate everyone patient drug target gene SNP to everyone patient drug safety.

        -  6) Mutually compare the usual approach group SNPs (300 double blind random group
           separated SCLC patients) with the study approach group SNPs (300 double blind random
           group separated SCLC patients).

        -  7) Confirm the relationship between drug target gene SNPs and drug efficacy.
