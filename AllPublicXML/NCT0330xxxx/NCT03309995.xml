  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A randomized parallel-group two arm superiority trial with an allocation ratio 1:1, both
      participants and investigators blinded.

      The zinc lozenge that will be used in the study is a commercial product available from the
      University Pharmacy, Helsinki, Finland. The product is classified as a &quot;medical device&quot; and
      it is not regulated according to the jurisdiction for medicines.

      Each lozenge contains 13 mg elemental zinc as zinc acetate. The instruction in the commercial
      package for common cold patients is to dissolve slowly 6 lozenges per day in their mouth,
      which totals to 78 mg/day of elemental zinc, at most for 5 days. The same instruction will be
      used in this trial.

      The University Pharmacy prepared 200 placebo lozenge packages so that the placebo lozenges
      contain sucrose octaacetate, and they are similar with the zinc lozenges in visual appearance
      and in taste. 200 packages of zinc lozenges will be used as the active intervention. The
      packages will contain 30 lozenges (6 lozenges/day × 5 days).

      The packages of lozenges will be distributed to the enrolled participants in November 2017.
      The participants will be instructed to keep the package readily available so that, when they
      catch the common cold, they will find the package and they can start to take the lozenges
      according to the instructions.

      The participants will be instructed to start taking zinc lozenges as soon as they start to
      suffer from the first symptoms of the common cold. The participants will be instructed to
      take 6 lozenges daily over the time awake, evenly distributed, allowing the lozenge to
      dissolve in the mouth as slowly as possible. The duration of intervention is for the maximum
      of 5 days. If the symptoms disappear before 5 days, the participant may stop the usage of the
      lozenges.

      There will be no limitations for other treatments that participants wish to use for treating
      their colds.

      Participants will be requested to respond to a web-based symptom questionnaire daily from the
      first day of the treatment to the recovery from the common cold, or to a maximum of 2 weeks.

    <description>Data of 12 common cold symptoms will be recorded by patients to web-based system, with scale 0: Absent, 1: Mild, 2: Moderately severe, 3: Very severe symptom. The symptom score is calculated as a sum over all the symptoms which means that the maximum of the symptom score scale is 3×12 = 36 points. Recovery from the cold is defined as the day when the symptom score is 0 or 1.</description>
