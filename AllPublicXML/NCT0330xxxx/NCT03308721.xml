  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study looks at a new study medicine for weight management in people with overweight or
      obesity. The aim of this study is to find out how safe and tolerable the study medicine is.
      The study also looks at how the study medicine behaves in the body and how it is removed from
      the body.

      Participants will either get NNC9204-1177 (the new study medicine) or placebo (a formula that
      looks like the study medicine but does not have active ingredients). Which treatment
      participants get will be decided by chance.

      NNC9204-1177 has not been approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration. Its use
      in this study is experimental. Participants will get 1 or more injections into the skin of
      the stomach area once each week for 12 weeks.

      The study will last for about 5 months. Participants will have 19 clinic visits with the
      study doctor. At certain times during the study, participants will have blood draws and 3
      different kinds of electrocardiograms. Participants will answer mental health questionnaires.
      Women: Women cannot take part if pregnant, breast-feeding or plan to become pregnant during
      the study period.

             Overweight should be due to excess adipose tissue, as judged by the investigator

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Any disorder which in the investigator's opinion might jeopardise subject's safety,

             1%, such as implants, injectables, oral contraceptives, intrauterine devices,
             diaphragm or cervical cap+spermicide), or who intend to donate sperm in the period
             from screening until 3 months following last administration of the investigational
