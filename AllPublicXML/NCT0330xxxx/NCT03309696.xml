      This device-study includes a pilot, physiological investigation of normal human subjects. The
      aim is to determine how existing non-invasive neuromodulation devices affect brain circuitry
      as measured by EEG recording. Currently, the application of non-invasive neuromodulation is
      rarely guided by detailed knowledge of how neural activity is altered in the brain circuits
      that are targeted for intervention. This gap in knowledge is problematic for interpreting
      response variability, which is common. To address this gap, the current proposal aims to
      combine two forms of neuromodulation sequentially, transcranial direct current stimulation
      (tDCS) and repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS), to regulate homeostatic
      plasticity prior to rTMS delivery at different frequencies of rTMS. Homeostatic plasticity,
      the initial activation state of a targeted circuit, is a key determinant of whether rTMS
      induces long term potentiation (LTP) or long term depression (LTD) Yet, homeostatic
      plasticity is rarely measured or controlled in rTMS studies. We aim to control homeostatic
      plasticity by preconditioning the targeted circuits with tDCS prior to rTMS delivery. The
      protocol also includes an exploratory aim to examine physiological changes in patients with
      tinnitus who only receive active stimulation, however, the exploratory aim is not part of the
      pilot physiological investigation.

      Background and Rationale: The aim of this study is to determine how existing non-invasive
      neuromodulation devices affect brain physiology as measured by EEG recording. Currently, the
      use of non-invasive neuromodulation is rarely guided by a detailed knowledge of how neural
      activity is altered in the brain circuits that are targeted for intervention. This gap in
      knowledge is problematic for interpreting response variability, which is common. To address
      this gap, the current proposal aims to combine two forms of neuromodulation sequentially,
      transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) and repetitive transcranial magnetic
      stimulation (rTMS), to regulate homeostatic plasticity prior to rTMS delivery at different
      frequencies. Homeostatic plasticity, the initial activation state of a targeted circuit, is a
      key determinant of whether rTMS induces long term potentiation (LTP) or long term depression
      (LTD).Yet, homeostatic plasticity is rarely measured or controlled in rTMS studies. In a
      physiological investigation of health subjects, we aim to control homeostatic plasticity by
      preconditioning the targeted circuits with tDCS prior to rTMS delivery. The justification for
      this study is that controlling homeostatic plasticity can reduce subject variability and the
      knowledge gained can be used to optimize rTMS delivery. What is needed to move the field
      forward is a method for combining tDCS and rTMS and for measuring neuronal responses directly
      which we aim to establish in this study. The pilot study project will examine the targeted
      effects of neuromodulation in normal subjects. The brain regions targeted for intervention
      include auditory areas in the temporal cortex (TC) that process sounds and functionally
      connected regions of the dorsolateral frontal cortex (DLFC) that mediate sensory habituation.
