  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The former Nickel Directive was introduced in EU in 1994 limiting the release of nickel from
      items intended for prolonged contact with skin. The nickel regulation entered into full force
      in 2001 and became a part of REACH (the EU chemicals regulation) in 2009. Since then the
      prevalence of nickel allergy has declined in some countries, but not in others, following the
      implementation. Young individuals still become allergic to nickel (2, 3) and a high
      prevalence of nickel allergy, exceeding 10%, is seen among young women (below 30 years) in
      the general population.

      The EU nickel regulation has been changing over time. The present limits of nickel release
      for metallic items intended for direct and prolonged contact with the skin is &lt;0.5
      μg/cm2/week and &lt;0.2 μg/cm2/week for any post assemblies inserted into pierced holes. In
      2014, EU defined prolonged contact with the skin as: at least 30 minutes on one or more
      occasions within two weeks for items with continuous skin contact, or to at least 10 minutes
      on three or more occasions within two weeks (7).

      The overall objective is to evaluate how well the EU nickel regulation protects individuals
      against developing nickel dermatitis. More specifically we will:

        1. Study the penetration of nickel in normal and irritated skin after short repeated skin
           exposure under controlled temperature in nickel sensitized patients and in healthy
           controls

        2. Reveal the potential of short repeated nickel skin exposure on normal and irritated skin
           to elicit dermatitis, during controlled climate factors in nickel sensitized patients
           and controls using the time restrictions of the definition of prolonged skin contact in
           the nickel regulation.

    <description>All participants will be exposed to 8 metal discs, 3 cm in diameter, 4 on each arm, placed on the volar side of the forearms (figure 1). Three of the metallic discs consists of &gt;99 wt.% nickel one consist of &gt;99wt.% Aluminium.The latter is used as a negative control. The discs will be applied under occlusion and with initial pressure and friction.
One metallic disc with nickel, and one with aluminium, will be randomized for the earlobes on the patients with nickel allergy</description>
