  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In recent years, the patients with IB2 and IIA2 stage cervical cancer are still treated with
      radiotherapy and chemotherapy based treatment, but the radiotherapy will severely damage the
      function of ovary, cause endocrine dyscrasia and the sexual function of vagina. So we want to
      study whether neoadjuvant chemotherapy without radiotherapy will achieve the same outcome
      compared with traditional therapy including radiotherapy. So we randomly divide IB2 and IIA2
      stage cervical cancer patients into two groups. The neoadjuvant chemotherapy group will
      receive two courses of chemotherapy basically composed of platinum, and then undergo surgery,
      after that, doctors will add more courses of chemotherapy according to the situations of the
      patients, including whether the patients have the adverse prognostic factors. The control
      group will undergo surgery directly, and then receive chemotherapy and radiotherapy at the
      same time. Then we will compare the outcomes of these two groups, and analyze the therapeutic
      effect, the impact on survival rate and the effect on improving the living quality of patient
      from two groups. All the outcomes will be fed back to clinical doctors and instruct them to
      choose better treatment for patients.

    <description>The patients will receive 2 courses of platinum based chemotherapy before surgery, 2-3 weeks after each course, doctors will appraise the effect of the chemotherapy. Patients who are sensitive to the treatment will undergo radical hysterectomy and pelvic lymph node dissection 3 weeks after chemotherapy. And 2-3weeks after the surgery, patients will receive adjuvant chemotherapy according to the pathological risk factors.</description>

And all the reports or papers about this research will not relate to the patients' identity. But we do not decide whether the information be available to others, the final decision maybe decided by all the patients in this research.</ipd_description>
