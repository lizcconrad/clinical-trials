  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Historically, Plasmodium vivax has been termed &quot;benign&quot; due to its non-life threatening
      clinical course and since the 1800's this view has been cultivated as demonstrated by the use
      of the term &quot;benign tertian malaria&quot; to describe the infection.However over the last 15
      years, more severe P. vivax malaria is being reported, causing concern that severe P. vivax
      malaria is under diagnosed. The definition of severe P. vivax malaria borrows from P.
      falciparum and is primarily one of exclusion. Species PCR (polymerase chain reaction) is the
      only way to prove P. vivax mono-infection but is expensive and requires skilled staff and
      technology. In resource constrained settings, diagnostic testing is not available for
      detection of most non-malarial infections further affecting the ability to determine whether
      severe symptoms are due to P. vivax malarial infection or a concomitant one.

      Retrospective studies from India, Pakistan, Indonesia, Papua New Guinea and Sudan support the
      existence of severe P. vivax malaria. However, inconsistent methodologies, definitions of
      severity, and use of diagnostic tests to exclude concomitant infection do not allow for
      standardised assessments for severe P. vivax infection across studies. A review by Baird,
      highlighted that the risk of being classed as suffering from severe illness was only
      minimally higher in P. falciparum than in P. vivax, but was unable to combine the data as a
      meta-analysis. The primary reported symptoms for severe P. vivax included severe anaemia
      particularly in children, severe thrombocytopaenia, respiratory distress, neurological
      syndromes (coma or seizures), renal and hepatic failure.

      Prospective studies have shown similar results. Tjitra et al showed that 23% (675 of 2,937)
      patients admitted with microscopically diagnosed P. vivax infections in Papua, Indonesia had
      severe disease and that the risk of severe malaria was significantly higher when admitted
      with P. vivax than with P. falciparum. In studies from Papua New Guinea, few differences
      between the clinical presentation of P. falciparum and P. vivax were found in children with
      severe malaria. This appears to be similar in populations from Sudan, Pakistan and India. In
      contrast, in Thailand, anecdotal observations note a low prevalence of severe P. vivax
      infections.

      The WHO criteria to assess severe P. falciparum have been extrapolated to P. vivax. In the
      2015 WHO malaria guidelines some criteria now account for P. vivax, such as removing a
      minimum parasitaemia when assessing for severe anaemia. Whilst these criteria may not be the
      most sensitive tool to define severe P. vivax infections, it is used for this purpose. It has
      been suggested that additional clinical information may be necessary to define truly severe
      P. vivax cases.

      In order to describe the characteristics of the severity of P. vivax infections in
      north-western Thailand, we will perform a retrospective review of annual reports of the
      outpatient database, the inpatient database and eligible inpatient medical records from 2001
      to 2016. The WHO malaria guidelines and additional clinical information will be used to
      assess the severity of infection and thus, a rate of severe P. vivax can be determined.

        routine clinical work performed in the outpatient and inpatient departments at SMRU during
        2001-2016. The patient population consists of refugees and migrants living along the
        Thailand Myanmar border in north-western Thailand who seek health care at the SMRU
