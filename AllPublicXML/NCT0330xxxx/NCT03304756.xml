  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single arm, single center, non-randomized, phase II trial of stage IIB/III TNBC.
      Patients received neoadjuvant chemotherapy with cisplatin (50 mg/m2) in combination with
      doxorubicin (50 mg/m2) and cyclophosphamide (500 mg/m2) every 21 days and for a total of 6
      cycles. After surgery, adjuvant chemotherapy consisting of docetaxel (75 mg/m2) every 21 days
      was further provided for 4 cycles. Primary outcome was pathological complete response in the
      breast and axilla (pCR; ypT0ypN0). Secondary outcomes were safety, disease-free survival and
      overall survival.

      This is a non-randomized, open-label, single arm, single center, phase II clinical trial.
      Patients received neoadjuvant chemotherapy with cisplatin (50 mg/m2, intravenous [IV], day 1)
      in combination with doxorubicin (50 mg/m2, IV, day 1) and cyclophosphamide (500 mg/m2, IV,
      day 1) every 21 days and for a total of 6 cycles (CAP regimen). Subsequent mastectomy plus
      axillary lymph node dissection was performed. Pathological specimen was analyzed to assess
      tumor response in the breast and axilla. Adjuvant chemotherapy consisting of docetaxel (75
      mg/m2, IV) every 21 days was further provided for 4 cycles. In case of tumor progression
      during neoadjuvant treatment, CAP was discontinued and additional local or systemic treatment
      was provided at the discretion of the investigator. The protocol was approved by the
      institutional review board of National Cancer Institute - Brazil. All patients provided
      written informed consent. The Brazilian Group of Breast Cancer Studies (GBECAM) and National
      Cancer Institute -Brazil were the academic sponsors and National Cancer Institute- Brazil was
      the funding source of the trial.
