  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The rate of fluid removal (ultrafiltration, UF) during hemodialysis (HD) may contribute to
      cardiovascular morbidity and mortality among individuals receiving maintenance HD. More rapid
      UF rates are associated with higher morbidity and mortality. Ultrafiltration profiling, the
      practice of varying UF rates to maximize fluid removal during periods of greatest hydration
      and plasma oncotic pressures, is one treatment modification that may reduce UF-related harm
      without necessitating reduction in interdialytic fluid intake or longer HD treatments. To
      date, UF profiling has not been adequately studied independent of sodium profiling.

      This study investigates the comparative effect of UF profiling versus non-profiled
      conventional HD on select cardiovascular and patient-reported outcomes. Participants will
      complete two phases of UF profiling and two phases of conventional HD and will act as their
      own controls.

    <intervention_model_description>The study is a 4-phase crossover trial in which participants are successively alternated between conventional HD and conventional HD + linear UF profiling across 4 phases with intervening wash-out periods. The study compares conventional HD (the participant's standard HD prescription with no UF profiling) to conventional HD + linear UF profiling. Participants will be randomly allocated to conventional HD or conventional HD + linear UF profiling for phase 1. Participants will undergo 9 treatments during each phase for a total of 18 conventional HD treatments and 18 UF profiled treatments. Participants will undergo 3 wash-out HD treatments between phases.</intervention_model_description>

Participants randomized to starting with the experimental UF profiling phase will receive 9 HD treatments with UF profiling (1st experimental phase). Following a 3 conventional HD treatment wash-out period, participants will then cross over to 9 conventional HD treatments (1st control phase). Following a 2nd 3 conventional HD treatment wash-out period, participants will cross over to 9 HD treatments with UF profiling (2nd experimental phase). Following a 3rd conventional HD treatment wash-out period, participants will cross over to 9 conventional HD treatments (2nd control phase).</description>
