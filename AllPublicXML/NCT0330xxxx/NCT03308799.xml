  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This trial is a randomized, investigator-blind, multicentre, vehicle- and
      comparator-controlled, parallel-group trial with the purpose of evaluating efficacy, safety
      and convenience of the MC2-01 cream.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The MC2-01 Cream is designed for optimal patient satisfaction - it quickly absorbs into the
      skin leaving it nicely moisturized allowing patients to move on in daily routines. In this
      trial, the MC2-01 cream will be compared to a marketed product CAL/BDP combination and
      vehicle. The purpose of the trial is to compare the clinical efficacy, safety, and
      convenience of this cream to the marketed product. The trial will include a 8-week treatment
      period.
