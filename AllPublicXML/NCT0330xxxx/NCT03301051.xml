      This Phase 3 study is intended to assess the efficacy of the Quadrivalent VLP Influenza
      Vaccine during the 2017-2018 influenza season in healthy adults 18 to 64 years of age. One
      dose of Quadrivalent Virus-Like Particles (VLP) Influenza Vaccine (30 μg/strain) or of
      placebo will be administered to approximately 10,000 subjects.

      This randomized, observer-blind, placebo-controlled multicenter, Phase 3 study will be
      conducted at multiple sites. The composition of the Quadrivalent VLP Influenza Vaccine to be
      used in this study includes a mix of recombinant H1, H3, and two B hemagglutinin proteins
      expressed as VLPs for the 2017-2018 influenza virus strains.

      Approximately 10,000 healthy male and female subjects aged 18 to 64 years will be randomized
      in a 1:1 ratio into one of two parallel treatment groups, such that approximately 5,000
      subjects will receive the Quadrivalent VLP Influenza Vaccine at a dose of 30 μg/strain and
      approximately 5,000 subjects will receive the placebo. Within the two treatment groups,
      subjects will be stratified by site and two age groups (18-49 years of age and 50-64 years of
      age in a 1:1 ratio).

      Subjects will participate in this study for approximately eight to ten months, during which a
      first visit will be scheduled on Day 0 for screening and vaccine administration.

        Inclusion Criteria

        Subjects must meet all of the following inclusion criteria to be eligible for participation
        in this study; no protocol waivers are allowed:

          1. Subjects must be able to read, understand, and sign the informed consent form (ICF);
             complete study-related procedures; and communicate with the study staff at visits and
             by phone;

          2. Subject must have a body mass index (BMI) below 40 kg/m2;

          3. Subjects are considered by the Investigator to be reliable and likely to cooperate
             with the assessment procedures and be available for the duration of the study;

          4. Male and female subjects must be 18 to 64 (has not yet had his/her 65th birthday)
             years of age, inclusive, at the Screening/Vaccination visit (Visit 1);

          5. Subjects must be in good general health prior to study participation, with no
             clinically relevant abnormalities that could jeopardize subject safety or interfere
             with study assessments, as assessed by the Principal Investigator or sub-Investigator
             (thereafter referred as Investigator) and determined by medical history, physical
             examination, and vital signs; Note: Subjects with a pre-existing chronic disease will
             be allowed to participate if the disease is stable and, according to the
             Investigator's judgment, the condition is unlikely to confound the results of the
             study or pose additional risk to the subject by participating in the study. Stable
             disease is generally defined as no new onset or exacerbation of pre-existing chronic
             disease three months prior to vaccination. Based on the Investigator's judgment, a
             subject with more recent stabilization of a disease could also be eligible.

          6. Female subjects must have a negative urine pregnancy test result at the
             Screening/Vaccination visit (Visit 1);

          7. Female subjects of childbearing potential must use an effective method of
             contraception for one month prior to vaccination and agree to continue employing
             adequate birth control measures for at least 60 days post-vaccination. Moreover,
             female subjects must have no plan to become pregnant for at least two months
             post-vaccination. Abstinent subjects should be asked what method(s) they would use
             should their circumstances change, and subjects without a well-defined plan should be
             excluded. The following relationship or methods of contraception are considered to be
             effective:

               -  Hormonal contraceptives (e.g. oral, injectable, topical [patch], or estrogenic
                  vaginal ring);

               -  Intra-uterine device with or without hormonal release;

               -  Male partner using a condom plus spermicide or sterilized partner (at least one
                  year prior to vaccination);

               -  Credible self-reported history of heterosexual vaginal intercourse abstinence
                  until at least 60 days post-vaccination;

               -  Female partner;

          8. Non-childbearing females are defined as:

               -  Surgically-sterile (defined as bilateral tubal ligation, hysterectomy or
                  bilateral oophorectomy performed more than one month prior to vaccination); or

               -  Post-menopausal (absence of menses for 24 consecutive months and age consistent
                  with natural cessation of ovulation).

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Subjects who meet any of the following criteria will be excluded from participating in this
        study; no protocol waivers are allowed:

          1. Any subject whose medical condition(s) is sufficiently severe that annual influenza
             vaccination would be routinely recommended in the jurisdiction of recruitment, as per
             the Investigator's judgement;

          2. According to the Investigator's opinion, history of significant acute or chronic,
             uncontrolled medical or neuropsychiatric illness. 'Uncontrolled' is defined as:

               -  Requiring a new medical or surgical treatment during the three months prior to
                  study vaccine administration unless the criteria outlined in inclusion criterion
                  no. 5 can be met (i.e. the Investigator can justify inclusion based upon the
                  innocuous nature of medical/surgical events and/or treatments);

               -  Requiring any significant change in a chronic medication (i.e. drug, dose,
                  frequency) during the three months prior to study vaccine administration due to
                  uncontrolled symptoms or drug toxicity unless the innocuous nature of the
                  medication change meets the criteria outlined in inclusion criterion no. 5 and is
                  appropriately justified by the Investigator.

          3. Any medical or neuropsychiatric condition or any history of excessive alcohol use or
             drug abuse which, in the Investigator's opinion, would render the subject unable to
             provide informed consent or unable to provide valid safety observations and reporting;

          4. Any autoimmune disease other than hypothyroidism on stable replacement therapy
             (including, but not limited to rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus,
             Crohn's disease, and inflammatory bowel disease) or any confirmed or suspected
             immunosuppressive condition or immunodeficiency including known or suspected human
             immunodeficiency virus (HIV), Hepatitis B or C infection, the presence of
             lymphoproliferative disease;

          5. History of chronic pulmonary (including asthma, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, and cystic

             neurologic, hematologic (including anemia and hemoglobinopathy), or metabolic
             disorders (including diabetes mellitus);

          6. Because this is a placebo-controlled study, any subjects in close contact with
             individuals considered to be at high risk for developing influenza-related
             complications (individuals considered at high risk for complications include adults
             and children who have chronic pulmonary or cardiovascular [except isolated
             hypertension], renal, hepatic, neurologic, hematologic, or metabolic disorders
             [including diabetes mellitus]), ;

          7. Administration or planned administration of any non-influenza vaccine within 30 days
             prior to randomization up to blood sampling on Day 21. Immunization on an emergency
             basis will be evaluated case-by-case by the Investigator;

          8. Administration of any adjuvanted or investigational influenza vaccine within one year
             prior to randomization or planned administration prior to the completion of the study;

          9. Administration of any 'standard', non-adjuvanted influenza vaccine (e.g. live
             attenuated trivalent/quadrivalent inactivated influenza vaccine or split
             trivalent/quadrivalent inactivated influenza vaccine administered by intranasal,
             intradermal, or intramuscular route) within six months prior to randomization and up
             to completion of the study;

         10. Use of any investigational or non-registered product within 30 days or five
             half-lives, whichever is longer, prior to randomization or planned use during the
             study period. Subjects may not participate in any other investigational or marketed
             drug study while participating in this study until after the study;

         11. Treatment with systemic glucocorticoids at a dose exceeding 10 mg of prednisone (or
             equivalent) per day for more than seven consecutive days or for 10 or more days in
             total, within one month of study vaccine administration; any other cytotoxic or
             immunosuppressant drug, or any immunoglobulin preparation within three months of
             vaccination and until the completion of the study. Low doses of nasal or inhaled
             glucocorticoids are allowed. Topical steroids are permitted;

         12. Any significant disorder of coagulation including, but not limited to, treatment with
             warfarin derivatives or heparin. Persons receiving prophylactic anti-platelet
             medications (e.g. low-dose aspirin [no more than 325 mg/day]), and without a
             clinically apparent bleeding tendency are eligible. Subjects treated with new
             generation drugs that do not increase the risk of intramuscular bleeding (e.g.
             clopidogrel) are also eligible;

         13. History of allergy to any of the constituents of the Quadrivalent VLP Influenza
             Vaccine or tobacco;

         14. History of anaphylactic allergic reactions to plants or plants components;

         15. Use of antihistamines with systemic absorption for more than 14 days in the four weeks
             prior to vaccination or use of antihistamines 48 hours prior to study vaccination (the
             use of topical antihistamines and nasal or inhaled steroids is acceptable);

         16. Use of prophylactic medications (e.g. acetaminophen/paracetamol, aspirin, naproxen, or
             ibuprofen) within 24 hours of randomization to prevent or pre-empt symptoms due to
             vaccination. Any subject discovered to have taken a prophylactic medication to prevent
             or pre-empt symptoms due to vaccination within the 24 hours prior to planned
             randomization must be delayed until at least the 24 hours period is met;

         17. Planned use of influenza antiviral treatment medication before the collection of
             nasopharyngeal swabs (e.g. oseltamivir, zanamivir, rapivab);

             diastolic BP ≥ 90 mmHg, heart rate ≤ 45 beats/min and ≥ 100 beats/min) evaluated by an
             Investigator to be clinically significant. A subject with abnormal vital signs results
             may be included in the study based on Investigator's judgment (e.g. a resting hear
             rate ≤ 45 in highly trained athletes);

         22. Presence of any febrile illness (including an oral temperature ≥ 38.0 ˚C within 24
             hours prior to vaccination. Such subjects may be re-evaluated for enrolment after
