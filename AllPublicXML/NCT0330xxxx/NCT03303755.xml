  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cerebral palsy (CP) is the most frequent disability in children, and despite advances in
      perinatal medicine, its incidence has not declined worldwide. The vast majority of these
      patients are malnourished. As the severity of the PC increases, nutritional disorders
      increase the health risk of patients are more common and prominent. In this population, there
      are practical difficulties to perform a nutritional and growth assessment which makes it
      difficult to treat and follow up, because of the lack of reference growth in Argentina, and
      the difficulty in taking anthropometric measurements of weight and height because of their
      motor compromise, posture and muscle tone.

      The main objective is to design and validate predictive models for the nutritional and growth
      assessment of children and adolescents with CP and instruments for estimating weight and
      height from body segments, in order to improve care, quality of life of these patients to
      promote their social inclusion.

      Material and method: It will be an observational, descriptive and cross-sectional study.
      There will be two parts of the study, in the first part the population will be healthy
      children from 2 to 18 years old from Cordoba, Argentina. The sample size was calculated based
      on growth WHO standards data, for α=0.05 and 1-β=0.80, creating an stratified sampling
      divided in 16 age groups for each age. This first part will help to establish which body
      segments to use.

      In the second part, the population will be children and adolescents from 2 to 18 years old
      with diagnosis of CP from Córdoba, Argentina. A stratified sequential sampling shall be
      performed. The sample size will be 192 patients, 12 per age stratum. The variables studied
      will be: weight, height, body segments, sex, age, CP type, feeding path and type of feeding.

      For the analysis of the data the normal continuous variables will be described in means with
      their respective standard deviations and those of non-normal distribution in medians with
      their ranges. For the development of the predictive equations using body segments measures, a
      generalizable linear regression model will be used. The correlation coefficient r,
      determination R2 and test of F will be calculated with p &lt;0.05. To generate predictive growth
      models, the percentiles from 3 to 97 will be calculated, using the LMS method and a q-q
      graph.

      The study of nutrition in patients with PC is an emerging field, for which this work plan
      seeks to develop methodologies that promote social inclusion by making substantial and
      necessary contributions to improve the treatment of this pathology.
