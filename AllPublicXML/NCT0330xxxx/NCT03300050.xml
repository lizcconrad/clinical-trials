  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The clinical study will evaluate safety and the immune response of a prime- boost regimen
      with a live attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV) prime and an inactivated split influenza
      vaccine (IIV) boost with or without adjuvant.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, multi-center, randomized, controlled, observer-blind, Phase 1 trial in
      healthy male and female adults 18 through 39 years of age to evaluate safety and the immune
      response of a prime boost regimen with LAIV prime and IIV boost with or without adjuvant . Up
      to 65 eligible subjects will participate and will be randomized 4:3:1:3:2 to one of five
      groups to receive a first dose of study cH8/1N1 LAIV (or placebo) or study cH8/1N1 IIV +
      AS03A adjuvant (or placebo) followed three months later by study cH5/1N1 IIV +/- AS03A
      adjuvant (or placebo).
