      Exercise programs (EP) have been shown to be the effective approach for functional outcomes
      in interstitial lung diseases (ILD). In many studies, the duration of exercise programs
      varies between 8-12 weeks. However, the optimal duration of exercise program is still
      unknown.

      We aimed to compare the results of the 8th week with the results of the 12th week of the PR
      programs applied to the patients with ILD.

      A total of 14 patients with ILD referred to our PR unit [11 idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, 2
      sarcoidosis (stage 3 and 4) and 1 nonspecific interstitial pneumonia] were included in the
      study. Pulmonary function test, arterial blood gas analysis, 6- minute walk test, mMRC
      dyspnea scale, quality of life questionnaires and hospital anxiety depression scale were
      performed before, at the 8th and 12th weeks after the exercise program applied to the
      patients twice a week.
