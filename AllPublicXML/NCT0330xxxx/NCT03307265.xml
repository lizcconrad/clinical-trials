  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to test whether wearing a weighted jacket can help improve the
      balance distortion of patients with neurologic pathologies.

      The center of mass of the patient will be analyzed in order to determine the direction in
      which the imbalance is most important. Weights will be placed accordingly in a jacket in
      order to correct the imbalance. In the experimental group, weights will represent 1.5 to 2%
      of the patient body mass. In the control group, the investigators will use weights of 200
      grams maximum, placed evenly on both sides of the jacket. Patients will wear the jacket for 2
      consecutive hours.

      After wearing the jacket for 2 hours, data similar to those recorded at the beginning of the
      experiment will be taken again, namely the determination of the center of mass and of the
      deviations caused by the imbalance.

      A final series of tests will take place approximately one week after wearing the jacket, to
      determine if there are any residual effects.
