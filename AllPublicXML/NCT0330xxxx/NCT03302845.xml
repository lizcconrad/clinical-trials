                  hysterectomy, tubal ligation, or bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy) or
                  postmenopausal (defined as at least 12 months of spontaneous amenorrhea). Females
                  of childbearing potential must agree to use an adequate method of contraception
                  during the study from CRU admission through Safety Follow-up. Adequate methods of
                  contraception for subjects or partner include condom, diaphragm, or cervical cap
                  used in conjunction with spermicidal gel, foam, cream, film, or suppository.
                  Hormonal contraception is NOT acceptable in this study. If necessary,
                  follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) results &gt;40 IU/L at Screening are confirmatory
                  in the absence of a clear postmenopausal history.

               2. Nonsterile male subjects with sexual partners of childbearing potential must
                  agree to use adequate methods of contraception from CRU admission through Safety
                  Follow-up. Adequate methods of contraception for subjects or partner include the
                  following: condom with spermicidal gel, diaphragm with spermicidal gel, coil
                  (intrauterine device), surgical sterilization, vasectomy, oral contraceptive
                  pill, depo-progesterone injections, progesterone implant (ie, Implanon®),
                  NuvaRing®, Ortho Evra®; if a subject is not sexually active, but becomes active,
                  he or his partner should use medically accepted forms of contraception.

          -  Able to comprehend and willing to sign an informed consent form (ICF)

             evaluated as not clinically significant (NCS) by the Investigator if outside normal
             range.

          -  Has no clinically meaningful abnormal findings during Screening and CRU admission
             physical examination, Screening and Baseline ECG, or Screening and Baseline vital
             signs

          -  Has the ability to understand and communicate the requirements of the study and is
             willing to comply with all study procedures

          -  Has not consumed and agrees to abstain from taking any dietary supplements, herbal
             products (eg, St. John's wort, garlic, or milk thistle), over-the-counter medications
             (OTC), supratherapeutic doses of vitamins, or prescription drugs (except as authorized
             by the Investigator AND Medical Monitor) from 14 days prior to CRU admission through
             the Safety Follow-up Visit

          -  Has not consumed alcohol-containing beverages for 3 days prior to CRU admission (as
             confirmed by alcohol breath analyzer) and agrees not to consume alcohol through the
             Safety Follow-up Visit

          -  Has not used tobacco- and/or nicotine-containing products within 60 days prior to the
             CRU admission and agrees to abstain from using tobacco- and/or nicotine-containing
