  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Global prevalence of Non Alcoholic Fatty Liver Diseases (NAFLD) ranges from 22% to 28%.The
      spectrum of these hepatic abnormalities extends from isolated steatosis to steatohepatitis
      (Non Alcoholic Steato-Hepatitis, NASH) and steatofibrosis leading to cirrhosis and
      hepatocellular carcinoma. NAFLD is one of the main causes of cirrhosis and increases the risk
      of liver-related death and hepatocellular carcinoma (developed in patients with or without
      cirrhosis). Despite this major public health concern, apart from lifestyle changes, treatment
      of NAFLD is still elusive as there is lack of efficacious pharmacological treatment.
      Alcoholic liver diseases are also frequent in Western countries. Alcoholic liver diseases and
      NAFLD share common pathological lesions and molecular pathways. This is illustrated by the
      emerging role of abnormalities of the microbiota (dysbiosis) in these 2 diseases leading to
      the concept of &quot; liver-gut axis &quot;. Whereas the molecular mechanisms responsible for the
      progression from a &quot;safety&quot; state to NASH or to a severe alcoholic steato-hepatitis are still
      unclear, hepatic inflammation is a key factor involved in the progression of NAFLD and
      alcoholic liver disease.

      The hypothesis is that cellular and molecular abnormalities and gut dysbiosis could be
      present in patients with simple steatosis or with steato-hepatitis and could be responsible
      for the occurrence of hepatocellular carcinoma particularly without cirrhosis.

      The main objective is to compare cellular and inflammatory pathways in liver with and without
      hepatocellular carcinoma in patients with alcoholic or non-alcoholic fatty liver diseases.

        Group 1

        Inclusion Criteria :

          -  Available social insurance

          -  Signed consent for the study enrollment

          -  Age ≥ 18 years

        Exclusion Criteria :

          -  Patients in the group with metabolic fatty liver with hepatocellular carcinoma

          -  Alcohol consumption ≤ 30 g/d (or 210 g/week) in men and ≤ 20 g/d (or 140 g/week) in
             women.

          -  Decision (less than 3 months) to perform a liver biopsy of a tumor suspect of HCC and
             of adjacent liver in routine practice.

          -  No systemic HCC treatment in the previous 6 months

        Group 2

        Inclusion Criteria :

          -  Available social insurance

          -  Signed consent for the study enrollment

          -  Decision (less than 3 months) to perform a liver biopsy in routine practice. Liver
             biopsy will be organized because of one or more liver abnormalities and/or fatty liver
             seen at liver ultrasound due to the current lack of validated non-invasive marker of
             inflammation, cellular death and fibrosis in these patients.
