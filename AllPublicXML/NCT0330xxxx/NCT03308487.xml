    <textblock>
      Groups (group 1 receives 1000 IU vitamin D and group 2 receives 2000 IU vitamin D) through a
      random allocation. It is necessary to mention that all cases in each group could be able to
      receive the current supplementation during pregnancy (Folic acid, iron and multivitamin and
      calcium). This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of two doses of vitamin D supplementation
      (1000 and 2000 IU/d) during pregnancy on maternal and newborn vitamin D status and metabolic
      profile including lipid profile (serum concentration of total cholesterol (TC), low-density
      lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C),
      triglyceride(TG)), glucose homeostasis (fasting glucose, insulin, insulin resistance
      (HOMA-IR)) and inflammatory and oxidative stress (OS) markers and pregnancy outcomes
      including gestational diabetes, preeclampsia, preterm delivery, abortion, cesarian section,
      and also anthropometric data and apgar score of infants compared with placebo.

      In this randomized controlled trial, 84 pregnant women aged at 18-40 years with gestational
      age of &lt;12 weeks will be recruited and divided into 2 groups.

      Demographic, socioeconomic and lifestyle data as well as blood samples and urine samples will
      be collected at baseline and in the last month of pregnancy. Moreover the cord blood will be
      collected at birth.

      Fasting blood glucose, insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), insulin, lipid profile (serum
      concentration of total cholesterol (TC), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C),
      high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), triglyceride(TG)), inflammatory (IL-1β, IL-6,
      IL-10, TNF-α, hs-CRP) and oxidative stress markers (MDA, TAC), calcium:creatinine ratio are
      going to be evaluated at the beginning and in the end of the interventional period in
      pregnant women. Inflammatory (IL-1β, IL-6, IL-10, Tumor Necrosis Factor (TNF-α), hs-CRP) and
      oxidative stress markers (MDA, TAC) will be determined in cord blood as well.
