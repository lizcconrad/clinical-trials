  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Short-term insomnia is one of the most common sleep disorders. Online cognitive behavioral
      therapy for insomnia (e-aid Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia, eCBTI) has received
      wide attention in recent years. Foreign countries already have some eCBTI treatment tool,
      shown similar efficacy as standard CBTI, but how eCBTI can help in short-term insomnia
      disorders require further exploration and examination.

      In this study, Investigators will establish eCBTI treatment tool to test whether eCBTI can
      reduce the conversion of short-term insomnia disorder to chronic insomnia disorder; and
      whether they can reduce short-term insomnia, anxiety, depression and improve quality of life
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Insomnia patients are collected from: A. The WeChat app platform, B. intelligent
      hardware/software customers, and C. Outpatient from Sleep clinic. Included 200 cases of
      short-term insomnia patients, the participants will randomly divided into 100 short range
      eCBTI Group and 100 patients with control group, short eCBTI Group will receive 1 Week eCBTI
      Treatment and control group will not receive any treatment. Both groups will receive 3 months
      of follow-up.

      After 3 months, two groups of subjects will have baseline assessment(except socio-demographic
      information), including insomnia disorder diagnosis processes and self evaluation form (ISI,
      DBAS, SHPS ,PSAS,FIRST,ESS,HADS,SF-12). Short eCBTI groups will also complete compliance
      treatment satisfaction questionnaires in order to evaluate the implementation status of eCBTI
      treatment strategies.

      This study provides a Smartphone to complete third-party applications online insomnia
      treatment procedures. Short eCBTI includes 1 -week core curriculum: daily 5 minutes of sleep
      hygiene education curriculum, record a sleep diary, and selective listening to audios of
      eCBTI tools. In addition, according to history of past 2 weeks of sleep, individual
      customized stimulus control and sleep restriction therapy is provided.

      Previous studies have shown that approximately 40% of Short-term insomnia disorder will turn
      into Chronic insomnia disorders.While our preliminary work suggests, with the extension of
      follow-up time, high rates of chronic insomnia may be more ( 52.3% ).In order to meet the 95%
      confidence intervals (Confidence Interval, CI )( 35%-49% ) requirement, the project needs 200
      Short-term insomnia disorder subjects, and random access eCBTI Treatment group and the
      control group ( 100 Cases) of whom an estimated 70% or more participants can complete 3 month
      of follow-up. This sample size ensures continuous data of small sample (Cohen d = 0.30)
      statistical effect is greater than 0.8, And test the odds ratio of dichotomous variables
      (Odds Ratio, OR) greater than 1.50(p&gt;0.05 ).

      Mean value for continuous variable data ± Standard deviation, Numerical or categorical
      variable data expressed as a percentage, Independent t test data and non-parametric data (2
      groups). Using repeated measures for analysis of variance to compare two sets of continuous
      variables in the treatment and follow-up of changes in the process (such as ISI score, etc).
      The clinical outcome of 2 categorical variable is computed using survival analysis, such as
      two new chronic insomnia and so on. All statistical procedures are used in Windows running
      22.0 version of the SPSS package (IBM SPSS 22.0).

    <measure>Changes in Insomnia Severity Index(ISI)</measure>
    <time_frame>changes of scale score from baseline to 2 weeks and 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>The ISI is a 7-item self-report questionnaire assessing the nature, severity, and impact of insomnia in the last month. The dimensions evaluated are: severity of sleep onset, sleep maintenance, and early morning awakening problems, sleep dissatisfaction, interference of sleep difficulties with daytime functioning, noticeability of sleep problems by others, and distress caused by the sleep difficulties. A 5-point Likert scale is used to rate each item (e.g., 0 = no problem; 4 = very severe problem), yielding a total score ranging from 0 to 28. This outcome will be measured at 2 weeks and 3 months in both the eCBTI and Control groups.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in Ford Insomnia Response to Stress Test (FIRST)</measure>
    <time_frame>changes of scale score from baseline to 2 weeks and 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>FIRST, a measure to identify individuals predisposed to sleep disturbance and the subsequent development of chronic insomnia. This nine-item self-report instrument assesses the potential likelihood that an individual will experience sleep disturbance following various stressful events/situations. FIRST scores range from 9 to 36. Scores of 18 and above indicate that stressful situations experienced prior to sleep—or the anticipation of stressful situations ahead—may routinely disturbed sleep and make vulnerable to chronic insomnia. We will evaluate relative risk associated with the FIRST cut-points among reactive sleepers by comparing insomnia rates at Year 1 between eCBTI and Control groups further dividing them into two groups: (1) moderately reactive sleepers as indicated by scoring 16 or 17 on the FIRST (i.e., above threshold, but below the 18-point value), and (2) highly reactive sleepers as indicated by scoring 18 or above on the FIRST.</description>

    <measure>Changes in Short Form 12-Item Health Survey（SF-12）</measure>
    <time_frame>changes of scale score from baseline to 2 weeks and 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>The SF-12 is a 12-item self-report questionnaire used to assess generic health outcomes from the patient's perspective.The SF-12 addresses the 8 domains viz. Physical functioning (PF), Role - physical (RP),Bodily pain (BP),General health perceptions (GH),Vitality (V),Social functioning (SF),Role - emotional (RE) and Mental health (MH) . The 2 scores that will be obtained from this assessment are composite scores representing physical health and mental health composite summaries, PCS and MCS respectively. An algorithm will be used to generate the physical and mental health composite scores for comparison to normative data. In normative data, the mean score is set to 50, thus scores &gt; 50 indicate better physical or mental health than the mean and scores &lt; 50 indicate worse health.</description>

    <measure>Changes in Sleep Hygiene and Practices Scale(SHPS)</measure>
    <time_frame>changes of scale score from baseline to 2 weeks and 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Subjects' general sleep hygiene and practices are measured with Sleep Hygiene and Practices Scale.The SHPS is a 13-item self-report measure designed to assess the practice of sleep hygiene behaviors. Each item is rated on a five-point scale ranging from 0 (never) to 4 (always). Total scores range from 0 to 52, with a higher score representing poorer sleep hygiene. SHPS has shown adequate reliability and validity .</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in Pre-Sleep Arousal Scale(PSAS)</measure>
    <time_frame>changes of scale score from baseline to 2 weeks and 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Participant's problems during initiation of sleep is assessed with Pre-Sleep Arousal Scale.The Pre-Sleep Arousal Scale (PSAS) is a brief self-administered measure in which participants rate the intensity of experienced arousal. Internal consistency for somatic (8 items) and cognitive (8 items) subscales are satisfactory (α = 0.81 and α = 0.76) respectively.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in Epworth Sleepiness Scale(ESS)</measure>
    <time_frame>changes of scale score from baseline to 2 weeks and 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Subjective measure of a patient's sleepiness is measured with Epworth Sleepiness Scale.The Epworth Sleepiness Scale is a self-report 8-item questionnaire producing scores from 0 to 24. Scores greater than 10 suggest significant daytime sleepiness. The Epworth Sleepiness Scale has good psychometric properties , correlates with objective measures of sleepiness , and has been shown to differentiate between individuals with and without sleep disorders and those who are and are not sleep deprived.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS)</measure>
    <time_frame>changes of scale score from baseline to 2 weeks and 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>The HADS is a self-report questionnaire to determine the levels of anxiety and depression that a participant is experiencing. The HADS is a fourteen item scale that generates ordinal data. Seven of the items relate to anxiety and seven relate to depression.Each item on the questionnaire is scored from 0-3 and this means that a person can score between 0 and 21 for either anxiety or depression. The HADS uses a scale and therefore the data returned from the HADS is ordinal. A cut-off point of 8/21 for anxiety or depression will be used. For anxiety (HADS-A) this gave a specificity of 0.78 and a sensitivity of 0.9. For depression (HADS-D) this gave a specificity of 0.79 and a sensitivity of 0.83.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Treatment adherence rating scale (TARS)</measure>
    <time_frame>after 3 months in eCBTI group.</time_frame>
    <description>A self-reported questionnaire will be administered posttreatment to assess adherence to CBTI guidelines and the perceived helpfulness of treatment guidelines. Adherence to each therapeutic element will be rated on a 0 to 3 scale as follows: (0) Followed rarely or not at all; (1) Followed occasionally; (2) Followed most of the time; (3) Followed consistently. Ratings for all therapeutic elements will be broadly grouped into a Behavioral Component and a Cognitive Component. The Behavioral Component consists of stimulus control and sleep restriction guidelines and will include the following 4 items: adhering to a fixed prescribed bedtime, getting out of bed when unable to sleep, using the bed only for sleep, and restricting the amount of time spent in bed (Cronbach α = 0.50). The Cognitive Component consists of endorsement of 2 items: &quot;Changing my expectations about sleep&quot; and &quot;Changing the way I think about not sleeping&quot; (Cronbach α = 0.83)</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Treatment satisfaction rating scale (TSRS)</measure>
    <time_frame>after 3 months in eCBTI group.</time_frame>
    <description>Subjects' satisfaction to the treatment measured by Treatment satisfaction rating scale.The Consumer Report Treatment satisfaction scale will be adapted for insomnia in the study as: &quot;How much do you feel the insomnia treatment program has helped you in the following areas?&quot; The areas will include insomnia, energy level, work productivity, coping, life enjoyment, hopefulness, self-esteem, and mood. Each item will be rated on a 5 point Likert scale, with 1 = Made things a lot better; 2 = Made things somewhat better; 3 = Made no difference; 4 = Made things somewhat worse; 5 = Made things a lot worse. All items on this measure will be coded such that higher scores indicates greater symptom improvement. Overall treatment satisfaction was computed as the average score on all 7 items of the TSRS, which provided an index of clinically significant improvement (Cronbach α = 0.86).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in Dysfunctional Beliefs and Attitudes about Sleep Scale (DBAS)</measure>
    <time_frame>changes of scale score from baseline to 2 weeks and 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>The DBAS is a 30-item self-report questionnaire designed to evaluates sleep-related beliefs, querying respondents' expectations and attitudes regarding the causes, consequences, and potential treatments of sleep issues. The 30-item version showed adequate psychometric properties as evidenced by good internal consistency (Cronbach Alpha = 0.80), moderate item-total correlations (mean rs = 0.37), and adequate convergent and discriminant validity.Likert-type scale requiring participants to choose from 0 (strongly disagree) to 10 (strongly agree) will be used. Thus, the results are quantified in terms of strength of endorsed beliefs. A higher score indicates more dysfunctional beliefs and attitudes about sleep. The total score is based on the average score of all items.</description>
