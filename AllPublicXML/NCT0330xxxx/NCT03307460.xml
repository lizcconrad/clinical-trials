      Prospective study to evaluate the value of uPAR-targeted PET/MR scan using the tracer
      68Ga-NOTA-AE105 in patients with newly diagnosed prostate cancer

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Prostate cancer is one of the most frequent types of cancer in men. The characteristics of
      the disease varies significantly among patients where some have an indolent type of cancer,
      from which they will never experience symptoms while others have highly aggressive malignant
      disease that requires prompt therapeutic action.

      Treatment of localized prostate cancer is based on a risk stratification, where patients are
      either offered therapy with curative intent - surgery or radiotherapy - or in case of
      low-risk disease an &quot;active surveillance&quot; strategy can be advised. In active surveillance the
      disease is monitored by PSA measurement, repeated biopsies and digital rectal examination.
      Some patients progress during active surveillance to a higher risk classification, which may
      lead to selection of active therapy.

      The aim of this study is to investigate positron emission tomography (PET) with the
      radiolabelled tracer 68Ga-NOTA-AE105, combined with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in
      patients with newly diagnosed prostate cancer. 68Ga-NOTA-AE105 targets the receptor
      urokinase-type plasminogen activator receptor (uPAR), which is a known marker for aggressive
      disease in prostate cancer.
