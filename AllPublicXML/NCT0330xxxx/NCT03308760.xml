  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Acute rupture of the Achilles tendon is a very frequent sports injury. Surgical repair is the
      usual treatment in young subjects, and although the optimal technique is still a matter of
      debate, conventional surgery with a direct approach is still the reference technique in young
      sportsmen and women. Studies investigating the evolution of ankle muscle strength following
      surgery for a ruptured Achilles tendon are rare, even though it is a crucial criterion to
      determine the possibility of returning to the sport. This project thus proposes to study, in
      comparison with the healthy ankle:(1) the evolution of muscle strength in the
      flexors/extensors and invertors/evertors of the injured ankle, evaluated using an isokinetic
      dynamometer, and (2) the evolution of stabilometry parameters, at 6 months, then at 12
      months, following surgery for acute unilateral rupture of the Achilles tendon, operated on
      using the conventional technique in young sportsmen and women and in comparison with the
      healthy side.
