    <textblock>
      Studies show that sleep apnea increases the risk of cardiovascular disease and is associated
      with obesity. However, it is unclear how sleep apnea affects fat tissue. Studies have shown
      that fat tissue is likely involved in developing cardiovascular disease. The purpose of this
      study is to see how sleep apnea changes fat tissue.

    <textblock>
      In recent years, the contribution of adipose tissue to obesity-related insulin resistance
      (IR), diabetes mellitus and cardiovascular disease (CVD) has become clear.In particular,
      accumulation of damaged cells in obese and aging adipose tissue has been shown to impair
      adipose tissue function and may thus increase CVD risk. Cellular and molecular alterations in
      adipose tissue are known to contribute to adipose tissue and systemic insulin resistance,
      chronic inflammation, and may lead to higher blood pressure. Importantly, any clinical
      consequences of adipose tissue dysfunction would be compounded by the large amount, and
      central metabolic role, of adipose tissue in humans. However, there is a gap in our
      understanding of the OSA-induced changes in the adipose tissue and its implication for
      development of cardiometabolic disorders.

      The aim of this study is to examine the cellular and molecular composition of adipose tissue
      in obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) subjects in comparison to adipose tissue from healthy
      individuals. We hypothesize that adipose tissue from OSA subjects will have a higher
      accumulation of markers of cellular damage with positive p16 and γH2AX. These studies will
      provide pivotal insights into pathways that may be targeted to reduce cardiometabolic burden
      in OSA population.
