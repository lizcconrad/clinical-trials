  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This randomized clinical trial will test a behavioral caregiving intervention that has been
      used successfully for dementia and spinal cord injury caregivers to provide services to
      stressed and burdened parent caregivers of post 9/11 service members/veterans. This
      intervention is six intensive individual sessions that will teach problem solving, cognitive
      restructuring and stress reduction targeted to an individual assessment of the care dyad's
      needs. It will be compared to another method of delivering content, education webinar
      sessions, which are analogous to the usual standard of care and will function as an attention
      control arm. The objective of the study is to determine which of these delivery mechanisms is
      more effective at helping parent caregivers of injured post 9/11 returning troops to improve
      their depression, anxiety, and burden, and to determine the feasibility of using individual
      sessions with this population of caregivers.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Depression - Patient Health Questionnaire - 9 (PHQ-9)</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The PHQ-9 has 9 items based on the DSM-IV depression diagnostic criteria. Time Frame: All questions refer to the past two weeks.Scaling: 0 (not at all) to 3 (nearly every day). Scores are summed to characterize depression as minimal (0-4), mild (5-9), moderate (10-14), moderately severe (15-19), or high/severe (20-27). On the PHQ-9, major depressive syndrome is suggested if #1 or #2 and 5 or more items are ranked positive (at least &quot;more than half the days,&quot; count #9 if present at all). Other Depressive Syndrome suggested if #1 or #2 and two, three, or four of #1-9 are at least &quot;More than half the days&quot; (count #9 if present at all).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Anxiety - Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7). Time Frame: All questions refer to the past two weeks.</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>the GAD-7 contains a 7-item checklist of symptoms of GAD. All questions refer to the past two weeks. Scaling: 0 (not at all) to 3 (nearly every day)
# of Items: 7-items. Scaling: 0 (not at all) to 3 (nearly every day). Scoring for each item ranges from 0 (not at all) to 3 (nearly every day) for an overall score of 0 to 21; higher scores equal more anxiety. Several cut points have been put forward for different purposes. Spitzer et al recommend a cut point of 10 to indentify cases of GAD. They also suggest cut points of 5, 10, and 15 to represent mild, moderate and severe similar to levels of depression on the PHQ (Spitzer et al., 2006). A cut point of 8 may also be used to detect possible cases of an anxiety disorder (Kroenke et al., 2007).</description>

    <description>The individual sessions intervention focuses on education, skills building, and support. It will be delivered in six sessions by telephone over three months. A Caregiver Notebook will include comprehensive materials for all sessions and topics. Treatment fidelity will be monitored and ensured through assessment of intervention delivery, receipt, and enactment. The intervention is targeted and individualized to the concerns of the specific caregiver and care recipient through a risk assessment. The Risk Assessment (RA) assesses the main caregiving risk areas for the specific caregiving dyad. The RA is used to tailor the intervention for care recipient behaviors or safety issues and/or caregiver centered issues/concerns related to health, physical and emotional well being, and/or social support.</description>

    <description>For the education webinar sessions, topics addressing each of the caregiving risk factors topics but without the skills building or cognitive restructuring components present in the individual intervention sessions will be available online in webinars. The education webinar sessions will focus on general information about post 9/11 concerns, problem behaviors, caregiver health, caregiver emotional well-being, and red flags. Education webinar session participants will not receive the Caregiver Notebook until they have completed their 6 month interviews. Parents will be able to view all 6 webinars at any time during the first 3 months. Each session will last approximately thirty minutes through PowerPoint slide presentation format with a pre-recorded script.</description>
