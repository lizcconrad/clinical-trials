  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Rehabilitation after Total Knee Arthroplasty surgery involves physical therapy services to
      address limitations in range of motion, strength, and participation in normal daily
      activities. This investigation will compare the outcomes from standard physical therapy
      intervention in comparison to reduced frequency physical therapy sessions supplemented with
      in-home exercise equipment.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Total knee arthroplasty (TKA) is a common surgical procedure for individuals experiencing
      pain and reduced physical abilities related to knee pain, most commonly osteoarthritis.
      Common physical impairments associated with post-operative TKA rehabilitation include:
      reduced knee range of motion (ROM), reduced strength, reduced participation in activities of
      daily living, and pain. TKA surgery is routinely paired with physical therapy (PT)
      interventions post-operatively in order to facilitate recovery for patients electing to
      undergo this intervention. The Total Range Exerciser (T-REX) is a medical device aimed at
      reducing the need for post-operative physical therapy services while promoting outcomes.

      A successful outcome after total knee arthroplasty requires symptom relief and restoration of
      physical function. Measurement of pain and function can be achieved through patient-reported
      outcomes measures and objective functional testing. The Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis
      Outcome Score (KOOS) is a patient-reported outcomes measure intended to capture the
      individual patient's perception of progress throughout the rehabilitative process. Objective
      measurements of physical function are necessary to quantify the magnitude of physical
      impairment associated with the patient's perceived status. Physical function can be measured
      through standardized assessment of knee ROM, strength, and ambulation. The purpose of this
      study is to evaluate the effectiveness of standard physical therapy compared to reduced
      frequency physical therapy supplemented with the (T-REX) after in total knee arthroplasty in
      subjective and objective measurements of physical function.

    <time_frame>Pre-surgery to 3 months post-surgery</time_frame>
    <description>The KOOS measurement is a patient-reported questionnaire that contains 42 questions covering 5 categories (pain, symptoms, activities of daily living, sports and recreation, and quality of life</description>

    <measure>Change in Knee Active Range of Motion (AROM)</measure>
    <time_frame>Pre-surgery to 3 months post-surgery</time_frame>
    <description>Measurement of the range of motion that the participant can perform (in degrees) when maximally bending and straightening the knee.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Knee Passive Range of Motion (PROM)</measure>
    <time_frame>Pre-surgery to 3 months post-surgery</time_frame>
    <description>Measurement of the range of motion (in degrees) that the participant's knee can maximally bend and straighten as a result of a manually applied movement.</description>

    <measure>Change in Timed Up-and-Go Test (TUG)</measure>
    <time_frame>Pre-surgery to 3 months post-surgery</time_frame>
    <description>The TUG is a physical performance test that consists of the participant rising from a chair, ambulating 9 meters, turning around, returning to the chair and sitting. It is recorded in seconds.</description>

    <measure>Change in 6-minute Walk Test (6MWT)</measure>
    <time_frame>Pre-surgery to 3 months post-surgery</time_frame>
    <description>The 6MWT is an assessment of longer duration ambulation and cardiorespiratory endurance. The test measurement is the total amount of distance that the participant ambulates within a 6-minute period.</description>

    <measure>Change in 30 second Chair Stand Test (30s-CST)</measure>
    <time_frame>Pre-surgery to 3 months post-surgery</time_frame>
    <description>The 30s-CST is a test of strength, endurance and functional balance. The maximum number of sit to stand repetitions performed over a 30 second period represents the score for this test. Pre-test positioning includes placement of a 44 cm (17 inch) chair, measured from floor to seat surface, against a wall to inhibit movement of the chair during the test.</description>

    <description>The participants randomized to the Standard Care Physical Therapy group will begin outpatient physical therapy services after discharge from inpatient care, on day 4 or 5 post-Total Knee Arthroplasty. The frequency of sessions will be 2-3 x per week for the initial 2 weeks, followed by 2 x per week until the culmination of physical therapy. The frequency and duration of sessions will be determined by the treating physical therapist based upon the clinical needs and progress of the specific participant.</description>
