      Abstract Objectives: Use of analgesics is the most common method to alleviate the pain
      induced by chest tube removal (CTR), but patient response to medication can vary and may not
      be achieved complete relaxation. This study was to determine the effectiveness of cold
      application in combination with standard analgesic administration before CTR on CTR-induced
      pain.

      Methods: A prospective, randomized, single-blind, placebo sham-controlled study was
      conducted. In addition to the same routine care, subjects in the experimental group (n = 30)
      received cold application of 600 g ice packs 15 minutes before CTR, whereas subjects in the
      placebo sham group (n = 30) received tap water packs. Numerical rating scale was used to
      measured pain intensity before, immediately after, and 10 minutes after CTR.

    <description>We manufactured two ice packs (17 × 12 cm) with a combined weight of 600 g. The ice packs were inserted into adjustable wraps made in our hospital so that they can be fixed next to the skin on each side of the chest tube in patients awaiting CTR. The combined contact area of the ice packs was approximately 25 cm in diameter around the chest tube.
For patients of the experimental group, they were received 15-minutes cold application.</description>
