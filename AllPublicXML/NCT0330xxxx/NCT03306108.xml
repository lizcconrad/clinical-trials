      The study will be conducted as Prospective study including 50 patients (aged &lt;6years ) at
      Otorhinolaryngology department, Assuit University Hospital (aged &lt;6years ) who will undergo
      cochlear implantation. All subjects will undergo implantation with Medel sonata flex 28 or
      standard electrodes with a standard surgical procedure. The standard surgical procedure will
      include extended end aural approach ,posterior tympanotomy and a round window insertion.The
      results of immediate postoperative Neural Response Telemetry (NRT) measurements &amp;
      postoperative CT imaging will be obtained.

      Each patient will be subjected to the following scheme:

        -  immediate postoperative Neural Response Telemetry (NRT) measurements

        -  postoperative CT imaging

        -  Data obtained from both measurements will be used to determine the intra cochlear
           electrode position then both data will be correlated.

    <textblock>
      Cochlear implantation (CI) is a worldwide accepted and effective surgical procedure for
      patients with profound sensory neural hearing loss to gain near normal hearing.1 The position
      of electrode inside the cochlea affects the outcomes. Full insertion of the CI electrode
      array and insertion in scala tympani usually has optimal results and better words
      recognition.2 Translocation of electrode array from scala tympani to scala vestibule or
      outword migration of electrode array may result in poor response.2 There are many
      intraoperative and post operative techniques to determine the position of electrode array
      inside the cochlea, some are radiological as transorbital view plan x-ray or computed
      tomography or 3D rotational x ray and others are electrophysiological measurements.3 Although
      the accuracy of the radiological techinques they are time and cost consuming1. The
      electrically evoked cochlear action potential (ECAP) threshold is dependent on the distance
      between the electrodes and the spiral ganglion cells. The neural response telemetry-ratio
      (NRT-ratio) is one of the electrophysiological measurments techniques and it is based on each
      individual electrode's ECAP threshold and can identify the intracochlear electrode array
      position 4. According to a study done by Philipp Mittmann in 2015, a NRT-ratio above 1.05
      indicates an electrode translocation from scala tympani to scala vestibuli and a NRT-ratio
      below 1.05 shows correlation to a pure scala tympani placement5, but another study found
      variation of the NRT-ratio in a group of patients with an electrode placement within scala
      tympani.6

    <description>NRTratio is based on each individual electrode's ECAP threshold and can identify the intracochlear electrode array position in perimodiolar electrodes. The NRT-ratio showed a good reliability for the determination of the intracochlear electrode array position compared to the radiologic control intraoperatively Calculation of the NRT-ratio is done by dividing the arithmetic average of the t-NRT values from the apical electrodes 16 to 18 divided by the arithmetic average of the basal t-NRT from electrodes 5 to 7. With a NRT-ratio above 1.05, a high chance of a scalar change was rather likely, and a NRT-ratio below 1.05 was associated with a high chance of an electrode array position within the scala tympani.</description>
