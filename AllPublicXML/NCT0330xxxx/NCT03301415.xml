  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase II, open-label trial to evaluate valganciclovir as a treatment to prevent
      development of SNHL in infants with asymptomatic congenital CMV infection. The trial will be
      conducted in two phases - screening of newborns to identify eligible subjects, and treatment
      of those newborns who have confirmed CMV infection at birth but without outward
      manifestations of congenital CMV infection. 229 newborns with confirmed CMV infection but
      without baseline SNHL and who meet all inclusion/exclusion criteria will be enrolled into the
      treatment phase. Study duration is 5 years. Primary objective of this study is to estimate
      the proportion of subjects with asymptomatic congenital CMV infection who, following
      treatment with 4 months of oral valganciclovir, develop sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) by
      6 months of life.

      This is a phase II, open-label trial to evaluate valganciclovir as a treatment to prevent
      development of SNHL in infants with asymptomatic congenital CMV infection. The trial will be
      conducted in two phases - screening of newborns to identify eligible subjects, and treatment
      of those newborns who have confirmed CMV infection at birth but without outward
      manifestations of congenital CMV infection. Approximately 48,250 newborn infants with no
      outward manifestations of congenital CMV infection will be screened to detect approximately
      241 neonates with asymptomatic congenital CMV infection; these 241 newborns then will have
      audiology examinations to determine baseline hearing, with approximately 229 having normal
      hearing in both ears. Those 229 newborns with confirmed CMV infection but without baseline
      SNHL and who meet all inclusion/exclusion criteria will be enrolled into the treatment phase.
      Enrolled subjects will be treated for four months with oral valganciclovir (16 mg/kg/dose,
      administered two times per day). Audiologic assessments will be made during the Screening
      Period and Study Months 4 (end of treatment), 6, 12, and 18. Treated infants will be followed
      for safety throughout the first 6 months of the study (including for 2 months
      post-treatment). Study duration is 5 years. Primary objective of this study is to estimate
      the proportion of subjects with asymptomatic congenital CMV infection who, following
      treatment with 4 months of oral valganciclovir, develop sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) by
      6 months of life. Secondary objectives are to: 1) define the safety and tolerability of
      valganciclovir in enrolled subjects, 2) estimate the proportion of subjects with asymptomatic
      congenital CMV infection who, following treatment with 4 months of oral valganciclovir,
      develop SNHL over the first 18 months of life, 3) to compare changes in whole blood CMV viral
      load versus plasma CMV viral load during and following antiviral treatment, 4) to assess
      correlation between CMV viral load, by body compartment, and SNHL.

      Substudy:

      Through the screening process, approximately 12 neonates congenitally infected with CMV who
      have SNHL at birth also will be identified. Newborn patients with SNHL and who are being
      treated clinically with valganciclovir will be offered enrollment into an observational
      substudy.
