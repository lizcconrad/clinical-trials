    <textblock>
      The purpose of this observational study is to evaluate the safety and performance of the
      Single Use Endoscopic Linear Cutter Stapler and Reloads from Frankenman used in
      (hemi)colectomy to remove tumors and create anastomoses in patients with cancer in the
      ascending colon. The goal of the study will be achieved by assessing the device performance
      and reporting of peri- and postoperative complications in a prospectively maintained
      database.
