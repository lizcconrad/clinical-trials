  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Physical inactivity and low adherence to the Mediterranean diet cause alterations in body
      composition, which increases the risk factors for cardiovascular and metabolic diseases. In
      addition, exercise in different surfaces or water could affect the bone density specially in
      women. Objective: The purpose of the study was to analyze the effect of a short-term aerobic
      exercise program in different surfaces on the body composition and bone density of women
      within at work, and to evaluate the quality of the Mediterranean diet and distribution of
      macronutrients in the studied population. Material &amp; Methods: Randomized controlled trial. 63
      women from a randomized work environment (IG, n=34) and a control group (CG, n=29)
      participated in a short-term aerobic exercise programmed (12 weeks), for body composition and
      bone density Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) was used and to evaluate diet, the
      Mediterranean Diet Quality Questionnaire (KIDMED) and the Food Frequency Questionnaire for
      macronutrient distribution were used.

    <description>A moderate-intensity aerobic physical exercise programme was carried out during the months of March to May 2017 (12 weeks), with a frequency of three sessions per week (36 sessions in total) with a duration of 45 minutes per session. The intensity was controlled through the Borg 1982 modified scale of perceived exertion (RPE). It is a scale from 0 to 10, considering 0 as &quot;nothing at all&quot; and 10 as &quot;very very strong&quot;, setting the moderate intensity as value</description>
