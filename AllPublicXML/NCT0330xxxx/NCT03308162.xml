      This study is testing the acceptability and feasibility of an active, experiential group
      therapy for health behavior change within a medical setting.

      The purpose of the current study is to offer a preliminary test of feasibility and
      acceptability for a group intervention, conducted in a primary care setting, that aims to
      teach skills that initiate health behavior change. Participants will be recruited from a
      local family medicine clinic and groups will be held on site at the clinic. Patients will be
      recruited by their physicians and given a baseline survey of their exercise and nutrition
      behaviors as well as their overall well being and self efficacy to change their health
      behaviors. Participants can join the group at any time and attend as many sessions as
      desired. Groups are held 2 times per month and include worksheets, meditations, and exercise.
      Patients and their providers will be given 2 follow up surveys after 5 and 13 weeks to assess
      for acceptability and feasibility of the program, as well as health behavior change.
      Statistical analyses will include multivariate analyses, descriptive analyses, and frequency
      data collection.
