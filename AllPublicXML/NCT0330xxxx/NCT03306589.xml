  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This exploratory study aims to assess exposure of healthy subjects to systemic challenge with
      either LPS or GM-CSF. This will be done by measuring inflammatory mediators and cellular
      activation markers both in circulation and in skin blisters induced by exposure to
      cantharidin (an agent that causes blisters). LPS is often used to induce inflammation whereas
      GM-CSF is a cytokine and a key mediator in inflammatory diseases. In this 2 parts study,
      subjects will have 2 sessions in each part. Part I of the study is a dose-exploration phase
      and part II will be a continuation phase to draw more precise outcomes. In session 1,
      subjects will be randomized to receive either LPS or GM-CSF and will have 2 blisters induced
      on each forearm followed by blood draws and a blister harvest on each forearm at 24 and 48
      hours post-induction. After a minimum of 14 days blister healing period, subjects will return
      for session 2. In part I, Up to 6 cohorts will be tested and all cohorts will have 2
      sessions. For Part I, initially Cohort 1 will proceed with session 1. After their blister
      healing period, Cohort 1 will return for their session 2 visit in two groups (Group A and
      Group B) on different days. Group A will be dosed on the same day (one with LPS and one with
      GM-CSF) and Group B will be dosed on a different day (one with LPS and one with GM-CSF) after
      group A. Dose-escalation in Cohort 2-6 will be continued until the well tolerated dose has
      been determined. The same dose will be administered to an additional Cohort in Part II and
      the same 2-session design will be used. Approximately 24-30 healthy subjects will be enrolled
      for the study and the total duration of the study for each subject will be approximately 13
      weeks from screening to follow up.

             product within the following time period prior to the first dosing day in the current
             study: 90 days, 5 half-lives or twice the duration of the biological effect of the
             investigational product (whichever is longer) or currently in a study of an
             investigational device.

          -  Previous exposure to LPS in a clinical research setting. Where participation in the
