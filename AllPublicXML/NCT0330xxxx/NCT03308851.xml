  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this research is to compare the rate of canine retraction following
      the osteoperforation and piezocorticision procedures in cases of first premolar extractions.
      The secondary objectives are to compare the second order movement of the canine (tipping),
      the amount of root resorption associated with the procedures, the inflammation process by
      measuring the inflammatory markers in the gingival crevicular fluid, the loss of posterior
      anchorage by measures on the cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) 3-dimensional radiograph
      and on the casts and to evaluate the pain level and the impact on quality of life following
      each procedure using the questionnaire of the visual analogue scale (VAS) of pain.
