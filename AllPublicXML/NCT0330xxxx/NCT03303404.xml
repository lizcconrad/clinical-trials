  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To determine if 24-hr ambulatory blood pressure monitoring effects endothelial function, we
      will measure flow-mediated dilation before and after the blood pressure monitoring (ischemia
      conditioning).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Reestablishing blood flow (reperfusion) to organs that had their blood supply restricted
      (ischemia) can cause damage to the vasculature via injury and tissue death resulting in
      endothelial dysfunction. This ischemia-reperfusion (blood flow occlusion and resupply)
      triggered injury can be reduced or prevented by preceding brief periods of ischemia called
      preconditioning. Properly-performed preconditioning can exert a powerful protection against a
      subsequent sustained period of ischemia in a variety of organs in the body including the
      heart, kidney, and skeletal muscle. Preconditioning protocol involves repeated brief
      inflation and deflation of a blood pressure cuff. In many of human cardiovascular research
      studies, it is common to measure endothelial function and ambulatory (24-hour) blood
      pressure. The ambulatory blood pressure device takes repeated blood pressure readings every
      15-30 minutes during the daytime and 30-60 minutes at night. It is possible that repeated
      bouts of inflation/deflation of the blood pressure cuff could induce preconditioning effects
      and influence endothelial function. Therefore, in the proposed study we aim to address this
      hypothesis.

    <description>Unlike casual blood pressure measurements, 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring provides an insight into blood pressure changes in everyday life and an estimate of the overall blood pressure load exerted on the cardiovascular system over 24 hours. Blood pressure recordings over a 24-hour period of normal daily activity will be made using a noninvasive ambulatory monitor (Spacelabs, Redlands, WA). The ambulatory system will be calibrated against a mercury sphygmomanometer, and the cuff will be programmed to inflate automatically every 15 min from 6 AM to 11 PM and every 20 min between 11 PM and 6 AM. For each individual subject, the nighttime period will be defined as the time when the subject goes to bed at night until rising in the morning. Daytime will be defined as the remainder of the 24-hour period. Daytime and nighttime states will be monitored by an Actiwatch (Mini-MItter, Bend, OR), a watch-like device placed on the wrist that measures gross motor activity.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Adults aged between 30 to 60 years old.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Exclusion from the study may be due to: i) pregnancy (by asking the subjects when the last
        time she had menstruation; we do have simple testing kits available if a subject is unsure
        about her status); ii) a recent illness, recent surgery, or any medical intervention in the
        48 hours before any of the study days; iii) personal history of diabetes (fasting blood
        glucose &gt; 126 mg/dL), heart disease, or other cardiovascular problems.
