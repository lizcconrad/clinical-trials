  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 3 study aimed at investigating the effects of a personalized exercise program
      (PEP) in NSCLC patients (stage I, II, IIIa) and secondary lung cancer patients undergoing
      surgical treatment at the University of Utah and comparing the intervention to the current
      standard of care (no exercise program).

      This is a Phase 3 study aimed at investigating the effects of a personalized exercise program
      (PEP) in NSCLC patients (stage I, II, IIIa) and secondary lung cancer patients undergoing
      surgical treatment at the University of Utah and comparing the intervention to the current
      standard of care (no exercise program).

      Eligible patients will be randomized between two arms (1:1 ratio) prior to the surgery and
      will be followed for 6 months post-surgery:

        -  An Intervention Arm (referred to in materials as Group 1) which features pre- and
           post-surgery PEP interventions.

        -  A Control Arm (referred to in materials as Group 2) which does not include a
           personalized exercise program (the standard of care). Patients randomized to the Control
           Arm will be given the opportunity to participate in a PEP-intervention session providing
           exercise counseling after the 6 month assessment and will receive a free activity
           tracker for their participation.

A secondary endpoint associated with the evaluation of improvement in physical performance is the result of the short physical performance battery test.

    <description>The PEP intervention involves a combination of home-based exercise as well as in-patient exercise. The exercise modes will include basic transfer and calisthenics mobility, aerobic and resistance exercises and will be performed in various postures (supine, sitting, standing and walking) with variable challenges (level walking, bending, inclines, steps and squatting).
For patients randomized to the Intervention Group (Group 1), the PEP intervention will be personalized, implemented, and modified (based on the patients AM-PAC mobility stage) by a licensed physical therapist in face-to-face meetings (~30-40 minutes) or during the weekly phone calls. An exercise education manual, specifically developed for this study, will be used by the physical therapist to educate the patients on all aspects of starting and maintaining the exercise intervention.</description>

          -  Male or female subject aged â‰¥ 18 years.

          -  Diagnosis of primary lung cancer stage I, II, or IIIa OR secondary lung cancer.

          -  Disease amenable to surgical resection in the opinion of the treating surgeon.

          -  Patients must be able to follow directions and complete questionnaires and exercise
             diaries in English.

          -  Patients must agree to be randomly assigned to either Intervention or Control Group.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Deemed ineligible for surgery by the enrolling physician

          -  Abnormalities on screening physical exam judged by study physicians or supervising
             physical therapist to contraindicate participation in exercise program compliance.

          -  Alcohol or drug abuse as judged by study physicians.

          -  Significant mental or emotional problems that would interfere with study participation
             will be assessed by the NCCN Distress Thermometer. Any value higher than 7 will
             trigger further intervention, but ultimately enrollment into the clinical trial will
             be determined by the enrolling physician.
