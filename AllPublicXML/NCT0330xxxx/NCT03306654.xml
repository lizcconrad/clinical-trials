  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Participants will be randomly assigned between three well-being programs, and assessed with
      questionnaires before and after the 8-week program, as well as 1-month after the end of the
      program.

      Participants will be randomly assigned between three different well-being programs, with each
      program lasting 8-weeks and taking place on a simplified research version of the Happify
      platform. Well-being programs include the unchanged Happify platform, a version of the
      Happify platform that is designed to engage with specific activities but does not aim to
      promote positive emotion or reduce negative emotion (i.e., Placebo condition), and a version
      of the Happify platform that encourages thinking about well-being through quizzes and polls
      without providing any instructions for promotion (i.e., Wait-list Control). Participants will
      be asked to complete questionnaires before and after the 8-week program, as well as a 1-month
      follow-up questionnaire after the program is complete, at which point study participation
      will end.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Absenteeism (Health and Performance Questionnaire, HPQ [World Health Organization (WHO), 2002])</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline to 8-week post, 1-month follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>An 8-item subset of the HPQ focusing on job absenteeism and work quality. Participants will be asked to indicate how many times in the past week they missed part of/an entire work day due to problems with their physical or mental health, and to indicate how often in the past 7 days the quality of their work suffered (e.g., how often they found themselves not working as carefully as they should).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Work Engagement (Utrecht Work Engagement Scale [Schaufeli et al., 2002])</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline to 8-week post, 1-month follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>A 2-item subset of the UWES focusing on job resilience and perseverance. Participants will be asked to indicate how frequently they feel mentally resilient at their job and how frequently they persevere.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Burnout (Maslach Burnout Inventory [Maslach &amp; Jackson, 1981])</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline to 8-week post, 1-month follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>A 5-item subset of the MBI focusing on feeling burned out in work settings. Participants will be asked to indicate the extent to which they agree that they feel burned out (e.g., that they feel burned out from their work or feel frustrated by their job).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Job-Related Stress (Stress-related Presenteeism Scale [Gilbreath &amp; Frew, 2008])</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline to 8-week post, 1-month follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>A 6-item measure of job stress-related presenteeism. Participants will be asked to indicate how frequently they suffer from stress-related presenteeism is work (e.g., they are unable to concentrate on their job at work, or stress distracts their attention away from job tasks).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Resilience (composite of Perceived Stress Scale [Cohen et al., 1983], Happify Scale [Carpenter et al., 2016] and Life Orientation Scale, Revised [Scheier &amp; Carver, 1985]).</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline to 8-week post, 1-month follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>Composite score made of perceived stress, positive emotionality, and optimism. Perceived stress was measured using the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS; Cohen, Kamarck, &amp; Mermelstein, 1983), a 10-item questionnaire that asks users to rate on a scale of 0 (never) to 4 (very often) how frequently they experience various symptoms of feeling stress. Positive emotionality was measured using the emotion subscale of the Happify Scale (HS-E; Carpenter, Crutchley, Zilca, Schwartz, Smith, Cobb, &amp; Parks, 2016), which is a 4-item scale asking participants to rate the extent to which, over the past week, they have experienced positive and negative emotions that are activated or de-activated. Optimism was measured using the Life Orientation Scale, Revised (LOT-R; Scheier &amp; Carver, 1985), a 6-item scale on which participants rate the extent to which they identify with optimistic or pessimistic beliefs.</description>

    <measure>Absenteeism (Healthy Days measure [Center for Disease Control (CDC), 2000])</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline to 8-week post, 1-month follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>A 1-item measure of the extent to which poor physical/mental health prevents one from doing their usual activities, such as self-care, work, or recreation, in the past 30 days [CDC, 2002].</description>
