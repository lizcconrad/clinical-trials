  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective multi-center clinical evaluation following recipients of the G7 Dual
      Mobility hip device. The primary objective is to characterize survivorship of the G7 hip at
      five years post-index procedure. Secondary objectives include documentation of clinical
      outcomes, safety and radiographic data.

      This multi-center prospective follow-up study will evaluate clinical outcomes, functional
      outcomes, radiological outcomes and further characterize the safety profile of the G7 Dual
      Mobility Hip Arthroplasty System. This will be accomplished by assessing these domains using
      the Harris Hip Score, UCLA Activity Score, and EQ-5D-3L, obtaining and assessing radiographs
      and the tracking of device or procedure related adverse events. Subjects will undergo
      unilateral primary or revision total hip arthroplasty and will then be followed for 10 years
      with intervals at 6 weeks, 1-, 2-, 3- 5- and 10 years. For the 10 year visit, subjects will
      not be required to present in their doctor's office, but will fill out a survey. Subsequent
      to 10 year data collection, the subject's participation in the study will be compete.

        All patients undergoing revision hip arthroplasty, undergoing a hip arthroplasty to correct
        a functional deformity, patients seeking treatment for femoral neck fracture, and
        trochanteric fractures of the proximal femur with head involvement, unmanageable by other
        techniques, and patients with significant hip pain or functional limitations and who are at
        a high dislocation risk will be considered for the study. Patients may have avascular
        necrosis, osteo- or rheumatoid arthritis.
