  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Early attempts by the tobacco industry to develop &quot;safer&quot; cigarettes led to the widespread
      introduction of ventilation holes in cigarette filters; however, this design feature may
      instead increase smoking-related harm and make cigarettes more palatable. The overall goal of
      this project is to model regulatory restrictions banning cigarette filter ventilation and
      determine their effects on consumption of both cigarettes and a wide range of alternative
      tobacco products. Testing potential regulatory actions under controlled conditions will
      facilitate evidence-based policies that have a net benefit to health.

      The duration of the experiment will be approximately 3 months. Participants will begin with
      an initial one week (approximately) exposure period to both unventilated and ventilated
      research cigarettes. Participants will be given the opportunity to sample both types of
      cigarettes. In the following sessions, participants will alternate between Electronic Tobacco
      Marketplace (ETM) sessions and free exposure periods to their assigned experimental
      cigarette, with weekly assessments throughout to track changes in smoking behavior and
      cigarette valuation. In total, participants will complete 10 experimental sessions (see
      Appendix B for experimental timeline figure). For the sake of clarity, session types are
      separated below. The consent and initial sessions may take place in the same or separate
      sessions.

      At the beginning of the experiment, participants will be assigned to one of two groups:
      ventilated or unventilated. Group assignment will determine what cigarettes will be given to
      the participant after sessions in which the participants do not actually purchase their
      cigarettes of choice. Additionally, participants that typically smoke menthol cigarettes will
      be given a menthol version of their assigned cigarette. Experiment cigarettes will be clearly
      labeled as such with a notice that they are investigational cigarettes and if they are &quot;Type
      A&quot; or &quot;Type B.&quot;

      At the initial session and throughout the study, urine samples may be collected and stored
      for testing (for tobacco use and pregnancy) and breath samples for carbon monoxide and
      alcohol. Self-report may be used in place of urine analyses on a case-by-case bases. Urine
      sample analyses for tobacco use may only take place at the VTCRI site.

      Initial Assessment Session and Sampling (Session 1).

      First, participants will complete the consenting process. The first session will be an
      assessment session to collect information from participants on patterns and degree of tobacco
      and other substance use, perceptions of all cigarette types available in the ETM, as well as
      the results of behavioral and cognitive tasks that the investigators think may inform or
      complement the results from the main study.

      Participants will also complete the initial sampling period following the initial sampling
      session. The goal of this period is to familiarize the participants with their randomly
      assigned experimental cigarette. After their assessment session, participants will be given a
      7-day supply of ventilated and unventilated (3.5 days of ventilated and 3.5 days of
      unventilated) research cigarettes and asked to use these cigarettes. The actual number of
      cigarettes delivered to each participant will be determined by multiplying their reported
      cigarettes smoked per day by 7. Therefore, the average minimum number of cigarettes that will
      be delivered is approximately 70 (10 cigarettes per day minimum to qualify to participate).
      To verify usage during this and all subsequent usage period (see below), participants will be
      asked to return spent cigarette filters in resealable bags the investigators provide. A
      subset of these spent filters will be randomly chosen and analyzed to permit correlation of
      mouth-level exposure to smoke constituents with differences in ETM purchasing behavior
      between ventilated and unventilated cigarettes. During this sampling period, participants
      will go about their daily lives, allowing the participants to sample these research
      cigarettes in the social environment in which they typically operate. This &quot;real-world&quot;
      sampling period will serve to increase the generalizability of the results obtained in the
      ETM sessions. This duration of exposure was chosen to give participants time to begin to
      familiarize themselves with their assigned cigarettes. This will enable the participants to
      make informed purchasing decisions during the upcoming sessions.

      Real Experimental Tobacco Marketplace Sessions (Sessions 2,6, and 10).

      Following the initial sampling period, participants will complete a purchasing session in our
      realistic tobacco product marketplace. Participants will be seated in front of a computer to
      access an online marketplace with an interface similar to many online merchants. This will
      allow participants to browse through the products and add as many as the participants desire
      to the virtual shopping cart. Each product will have the price clearly displayed along with
      an image. Each ETM session will contain five pricing scenarios, in which the investigators:

      i. manipulate the price of participants' assigned research cigarettes to assess demand in a
      context with no other products available; ii. manipulate the price of participants'
      non-assigned research cigarettes to assess demand in a context with no other products
      available; iii. manipulate the price of both assigned and non-assigned cigarettes in unison
      to assess simple preference between the two; iv. manipulate the price of participants'
      assigned cigarettes while the price of non-assigned cigarettes remains constant to assess the
      degree to which assigned cigarettes substitute for non-assigned cigarettes; v. manipulate the
      price of participants' non-assigned cigarette while the price of assigned cigarettes remains
      constant to assess the degree to which non-assigned cigarettes substitute for assigned
      cigarettes.

      In each of these scenarios, the price-manipulated cigarettes will be available across a range
      of prices (e.g., $0.12, $0.25, $0.50, $1.00, $2.00, and $4.00). Price-constant cigarettes
      will be set to the median cigarette price in the community. Participants will use an
      experimentally provided income (proportional to their real-world tobacco consumption) to
      purchase from the ETM. At each price, participants will be asked to make seven days of
      tobacco-product purchases from the ETM. After all 5 scenarios are complete, participants will
      receive the cigarettes the participant purchased from one randomly selected price.
      Participants will be well informed of these procedures prior to purchasing. For those seven
      days after marketplace sessions, participants will be asked to only use those products the
      participants have purchased from the tobacco marketplace, and to not purchase any outside
      tobacco products, to not sell or give away any of their purchases, and to not ask anybody
      else to purchase products for the participant. The investigators will strongly encourage
      participants to follow these procedures, and to report any deviations from these procedures,
      which the investigators will incorporate into our statistical analyses. If the participant
      does not spend their entire income, the participants will be allowed to keep the remainder.
      In this way, participants will be spending real money and incurring a financial cost for
      their purchases, leading to more realistic product selections. Following the seven days of
      using cigarettes obtained from the ETM, participants will again visit the lab to return any
      unused products and report the use of experimenter provided and non-experimenter provided
      tobacco products.

      Extended Cigarette Exposure and Experimental Tobacco Marketplace Testing (Sessions 3, 4, 5,
      7, 8, and 9).

      Following the first session in the ETM and its associated period of tobacco product use,
      participants will begin periods of freely provided exposure to their assigned cigarette
      (ventilated or unventilated), alternating with two additional sessions in the ETM at regular
      intervals. The purpose of this additional exposure between discrete ETM assessments is so
      that the investigators may examine the effects of sustained exposure to participants'
      assigned cigarettes at regular intervals. During the extended-exposure periods, participants
      will visit the lab every 7 days. At each of these sessions during extended-exposure periods,
      the participants will return any unused cigarettes, report the use of experimenter provided
      and non-experimenter provided tobacco products, receive cigarettes for the upcoming 7 days,
      and complete many of the assessments the participants completed at their initial assessment
      session.

      Following sessions 5 and 9 (the sessions immediately before the Real ETM sessions)
      participants will be given 6 days of their assigned cigarettes and 1 day of the unassigned
      cigarettes in order to expose the participant to the unassigned cigarettes before the Real
      ETM session.

      An abbreviated set of assessments will be collected on a weekly basis throughout the
      experiment (Appendix A) in addition to any additional scheduled session (e.g., Real ETM).
      These assessments will focus on measuring tobacco product use and measures of dependence and
      withdrawal, including a Timeline Follow-Back for the period since the last session, as well
      as product perceptions. The investigators will also include a purely hypothetical version of
      the ETM (on non-real ETM sessions), in which participants do not receive products purchased
      to use outside the laboratory. Because these hypothetical ETM assessments can be repeated
      with greater frequency and without interrupting periods of continuous exposure to assigned
      research cigarettes, data from hypothetical assessments will be used to inform determinations
      of the effects of time on valuation of ventilated and unventilated cigarettes in more detail
      than primary ETM assessments.

    <description>The Electronic Tobacco Marketplace (ETM) measures participant purchasing of different nicotine products. Participants will be restricted to a budget based on how much they typically spend on tobacco products in a week. They will be allowed to purchase ventilated or unventilated cigarettes at a variety of prices. For the three real-ETM sessions, participants will randomly draw to select an ETM trial and will be given the cigarettes purchased in that trial. ETMs with hypothetical purchasing will be used on the other sessions. The purpose of this task is the measure at what price does the unassigned cigarette function as a substitute for the assigned cigarette.</description>
