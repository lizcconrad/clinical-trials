  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of a clinic-based physical
      activity coaching intervention in people with pre-manifest and early stage Huntington's
      Disease (HD). Fourteen individuals with premanifest and early stage HD will be recruited to
      participate in a 4 month coaching intervention. Feasibility will be assessed by recruitment
      and retention rates, and acceptability will be assessed by participant interviews.
      Participants will also be evaluate at baseline and following the coaching intervention to
      explore preliminary efficacy in terms of physical activity, self efficacy, disease-specific
      motor and cognitive function, walking endurance and strength.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators have previously developed and evaluated a physical activity behavioral
      change intervention in people with early-mid stage HD (Engage-HD). In a study conducted in
      the United Kingdom, self-reported physical activity, self-efficacy for exercise, and
      cognition were increased for those in the coaching intervention group compared to a social
      contact control group. This intervention has not yet been applied to individuals with
      pre-manifest (prior to onset of clinical symptoms) and early stage HD, where it may be most
      critical to engage in exercise. To date, no study has prospectively evaluated a physical
      activity intervention to facilitate exercise uptake in these earliest stages. This study will
      explore the feasibility and acceptability of the Engage-HD intervention in 14 individuals
      with pre-manifest and early stage HD. The intervention will entail one face-to-face coaching
      session (approximately 1 hour), and three remote video sessions (via secure Webex connection
      via computer or smart phone, or phone call if internet/smart phone is not available to
      participant) lasting approximately 20 minutes. Participants will also be given FitBit
      wearable activity monitors to allow for self- monitoring of physical activity for use during
      the 4-month intervention. Participants will be evaluated at baseline and again 4 months later
      on a range of exploratory outcomes including physical activity, self efficacy,
      disease-specific motor and cognitive function, walking endurance and strength. Results from
      this study will be used to make relevant adaptations to prepare for a multi-site randomized
      controlled trial.
