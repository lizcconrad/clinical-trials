  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main purpose of this study is to evaluate the effects of repeat dosing of ibrutinib on
      the single-dose pharmacokinetics (PK) of oral contraceptives (OC - ethinylestradiol [EE] and
      levonorgestrel [LN]), the cytochrome P450 (CYP)2B6 probe bupropion and the CYP3A4 probe
      midazolam; and to evaluate the effects of single-dose ibrutinib on the single-dose PK of the
      CYP3A4 probe midazolam in female participants with B cell malignancy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter study of ibrutinib (first-in-class, potent, covalently-binding
      inhibitor of Bruton's tyrosine kinase [BTK]) in female participants with B cell malignancy.
      The study consists of 3 phases: Screening Phase (up to 28 days), 7-day Pretreatment Phase
      (Days 1 to 7), Treatment Phase including PK assessment period (Days 8 to 26) and a Follow-up
      Phase (Day 27 to end of Cycle 6). The study procedures includes electrocardiogram (ECG),
      vital signs, blood samples withdrawal to evaluate PK and safety. The Antitumor activity will
      be assessed by means of computed tomography (CT) imaging and positron emission tomography
      (PET) scans. No formal statistical hypothesis will be tested. This is an estimation study
      designed to determine if an increase or decrease in exposure to OC or probe drugs occurs in
      the presence of ibrutinib.
