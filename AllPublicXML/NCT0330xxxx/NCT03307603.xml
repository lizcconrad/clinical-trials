    <textblock>
      This study has two portions. The main goal of the Phase Ib portion of this research study is
      to see at what time Yttrium-90 (Y-90) radioembolization therapy and nivolumab can safely be
      given to patients without having too many side effects. Other purposes of this research study
      will be to study any tumor responses.

      The Phase II portion of the study will test how many patients show shrinkage in their tumor
      with this combination of medicines and what changes occur inside the cancer cells and blood
      cells after treatment. The study team will pick the part of the study each subject
      participates in.

      Y-90 radioembolization therapy is minimally invasive procedure that combines two types of
      therapy (embolization which blocks certain blood vessels, and radiation therapy, which kills
      cancer cells) to treat cancer tumors in the liver. This works with tiny glass or resin beads
      filled with the radioactive isotope yttrium-90 (Y-90). They are placed inside the blood
      vessels that feed the tumor in the liver. This blocks the supply of blood to the cancer cells
      and delivers a high dose of radiation to the tumor while sparing normal tissue.

      Nivolumab is an FDA approved medicine that is used for the treatment of different types of
      cancers and metastases (second growths from cancer).

      Primary Objective

      Phase Ib: To determine the safety and tolerability of Y-90 radioembolization therapy when
      given in conjunction with neoadjuvant/adjuvant nivolumab as assessed by CTCAE version 4, in
      patients with metastatic colorectal cancer who undergo Y-90 radioembolization to hepatic
      metastases and have additional disease located outside of the radioembolization field.

      Phase II: To determine the objective response rate (RR) as assessed by RECIST criteria of
      metastases located outside of the Y-90 radioembolization treatment field in patients with
      metastatic colorectal cancer who undergo Y-90 radioembolization to hepatic metastases and
      receive neoadjuvant/adjuvant nivolumab.

      Secondary Objectives

      Phase Ib:

      To assess the response rate (RR) of patients with metastatic colorectal cancer who undergo
      standard Y-90 radioembolization therapy to hepatic metastases as well as neoadjuvant/adjuvant
      nivolumab as assessed by measurement of foci located outside of the Y-90 radioembolization
      field.

      Phase II:

      To assess the progression free survival (PFS) of patients with metastatic colorectal cancer
      who undergo standard Y-90 radioembolization therapy to hepatic metastases as well as
      neoadjuvant/adjuvant nivolumab as assessed by measurement of metastatic foci located outside
      of the Y-90 radioembolization field.

      To assess the 1-year and 2-year overall survival (OS) rate of patients with metastatic
      colorectal cancer who undergo standard Y-90 radioembolization therapy to hepatic metastases
      as well as neoadjuvant/adjuvant nivolumab.

      Correlative Objectives

      To characterize the baseline expression and localization of immune markers including
      Programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1), Programmed cell death protein ligand 1 (PD-L1),
      Programmed cell death protein ligand 2 (PD-L2), T-cell immunoglobulin and mucin-domain
      containing-3 (TIM-3), Lymphocyte activation gene 3 (LAG-3), Tumor necrosis factor receptor
      superfamily, member 4 (OX40) and Cluster of Differentiation 137 (CD137) within the tumor
      microenvironment and correlate this with treatment response.

      To examine the change in density of Cluster of Differentiation (CD8)+/Kiel-67 (Ki-67) high
      tumor infiltrating lymphocytes and expression levels of PD-L1 in the tumor parenchyma prior
      to and following treatment with Y-90 and nivolumab as assessed in a lesion outside of the
      radioembolization field. Changes in biomarkers will be correlated with treatment response.

      To assess baseline and changes in the immune signature of Y-90 na√Øve colorectal cancer in
      patients with liver metastases who receive Y-90 radioembolization and nivolumab therapy.
      Human transcriptome gene expression arrays will be performed and expression data will be used
      to identify immune cell subsets using CIBERSORT and immune signatures will be assessed using
      ImmuneSigDB.

      To assess baseline and changes in non-targeted tumor antigens using Proto Array Human Protein
      MicroArray Profiling and Immunoglobulin G (IgG) quantification in patients with liver
      metastases who receive Y-90 radioembolization and nivolumab therapy. Changes in profile will
      be correlated with treatment response.

      Study Design

      This is a single arm phase Ib/II trial assessing the safety and toxicity (phase Ib) followed
      by the antitumor activity (response rate) (phase II) of nivolumab when administered in
      combination with Y-90 radioembolization therapy.

      Study design

      Eligible patients will undergo Y-90 radioembolization to one side of the liver according to
      standard practice as directed by an interventional radiologist. Yttrium-90 will be given as
      biocompatible resin-based microspheres and will be introduced to the tumor(s) on one side of
      the liver through a catheter placed in the right or left hepatic artery (depending on the
      lobe treated). The dose of radiation will be determined by a radiologist and will be based on
      body surface area and tumor burden. During the phase Ib portion of the study, nivolumab will
      be administered per the scheduling algorithm at a flat dose of 240 mg intravenously over 30
      +/- 5 minutes. Depending on the schedule being assessed, this may include a neoadjuvant dose
      to be given prior to Y-90, and will contain an adjuvant dose following Y-90 therapy. During
      the phase II portion of the study, nivolumab will be administered as determined during the
      phase Ib portion of the study. Nivolumab will continue to be administered on an every 2 week
      basis for a total of 48 weeks or until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity or
      discontinuation due to patient/physician preference. Patients will be evaluated with a
      history and physical exam as well as laboratory parameters once every 2 weeks throughout the
      duration of the study. Patients will undergo CT scans of the chest and pelvis as well as MRI
      of the liver to assess disease status 2 months following the Y-90 radioembolization
      procedure, then every 3 months for a total of 2 years. Upon completing treatment, patients
      will be followed monthly for another 100 days for toxicity monitoring. Archived tissue
      specimens will be obtained at baseline and a post-treatment biopsy of a metastatic lesion
      located outside of the Y-90 radioembolization field will be obtained 60 +/- 5 days following
      treatment with Y-90 radioembolization for assessment of intratumoral immunogenicity.
      Carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) levels will be assessed at baseline, then once monthly for 6
      months, then every 3 months for a total of 2 years. Patients will have a pre-treatment serum
      sample collected as well as post-treatment samples collected approximately 6 weeks, 12 weeks
      and 20 weeks after treatment with Y-90 radioembolization for banking, to be used in the
      future assessment of putative biomarkers.

             weeks after the last dose of investigational product. Women who are not of
             childbearing potential (i.e., who are postmenopausal or surgically sterile as well as
             azoospermic men do not require contraception).

          -  Patients must have the ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written
             informed consent document

        Exclusion Criteria:

             have vitiligo, type I diabetes mellitus, residual hypothyroidism due to autoimmune
             condition only requiring hormone replacement, psoriasis not requiring systemic
             treatment, or conditions not expected to recur in the absence of an external trigger.

          -  Patients having a condition requiring systemic treatment with either corticosteroids
             (&gt; 10 mg/day prednisone equivalents) or other immunosuppressive medications within 14
             days of study drug administration. Inhaled or topical steroids and adrenal replacement
             doses &gt; 10 mg/day prednisone equivalents are permitted in the absence of active
             autoimmune disease.

          -  Patients who are positive for hepatitis B virus surface antigen (HBV sAg) or hepatitis
             C virus ribonucleic acid (HCV RNA) indicating acute or chronic infection.

          -  Patients with a known history of testing positive for human immunodeficiency virus
             (HIV) or known acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS).

          -  Patients who have received prior external beam radiation therapy to the liver.

          -  Patients who have clinical evidence of ascites or are in clinical liver failure.

          -  Patients who are known to have greater than 20% lung shunting of the hepatic artery
             blood flow determined by Technetium microaggregated albumin (MAA) scan (if conducted
             prior to study enrollment).

          -  Patients who have had a standard of care pre-assessment angiogram that demonstrates
             abnormal vascular anatomy that would result in significant reflux of hepatic arterial
             blood to the stomach, pancreas or bowel.

          -  Patients with known portal vein thrombosis.

          -  Patients with untreated brain metastases or leptomeningeal metastases will be
             excluded. Patients with brain metastases are eligible if metastases have been treated
             and there is no magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) evidence of progression for at least
             4 weeks after treatment is complete and within 28 days prior to the first dose of
             nivolumab administration. There must also be no requirement for immunosuppressive
             doses of systemic corticosteroids (&gt; 10 mg/day prednisone equivalents) for at least 2
             weeks prior to study drug administration.

          -  Patients with uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to ongoing
             or active infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris,
             cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit
             compliance with study requirements.

          -  Patients who are pregnant or breastfeeding will be excluded from the study due to the
             potential teratogenic or abortifacient effects that may result from nivolumab or Y-90
             Theraspheres. Because there is an unknown, but potential risk for adverse events in
             nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with nivolumab and Y-90,
             breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated with nivolumab and Y-90.
             These potential risks may also apply to other agents used in this study.

          -  HIV-positive patients on combination antiretroviral therapy are ineligible because of
             the potential for pharmacokinetic interactions with nivolumab. In addition, these
             subjects are at increased risk of lethal infections when treated with
             immunosuppressive agents. Screening HIV testing is not required.
