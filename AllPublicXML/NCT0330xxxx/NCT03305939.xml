  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Diabetes mellitus is a major public health concern for both the developed and the developing
      countries. Globally 246 million people affected with diabetes, and will rise up to 300
      million by 2025. In India, around 25% of the 25 million pregnancies are associated with
      gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM), and increasing rapidly over the time. Reported
      prevalence rates for GDM for Sri Lanka (13%) and Bangladesh (10%) have been described.
      However, in Bangladesh, estimate varies from 9.7% to 12.9% when different criteria were used.

      Knowledge gap: There is knowledge gap on whether a resource- and culturally-appropriate
      lifestyle intervention program will be more effective and cost effective relative to usual
      care in delaying incidence of T2D among women in South Asia. Evidence of developed countries
      indicate that a low-intensity lifestyle intervention, integrated with antenatal care in
      health system, optimizes healthy diet and attenuates physical activity decline in early
      pregnancy.

      Objective of the study: 1.To determine whether a resource- and culturally-appropriate
      lifestyle intervention program in Bangladesh , provided to women with prior gestational
      diabetes after delivery, will reduce the incidence of worsening of glycaemic status.

      2. To explore whether the designated lifestyle intervention program is affordable, acceptable
      and scalable locally.

      Methods:

      Study design: An open-label parallel group pragmatic individual randomized controlled trial
      with blinded primary endpoint adjudication. The randomized controlled trial will be preceded
      by an intervention development and optimization phase.

      Intervention: Low intensity lifestyle modification program Duration of intervention delivery:
      1 years (12 months) and respondents would be followed up 6 monthly for next 3 years (36
      months).Study settings: In Bangladesh, the investigators will conduct the intervention trial
      in 4 maternity care hospitals in Dhaka city.

      Sample size: A total of 1440 women with GDM from 24 hospitals (~60/hospital) will require for
      the RCT from 3 different countries. In Bangladesh, 360 participants from 4 selected maternity
      care hospitals (90 participants from each hospital, 45 cases and 45 controls) will be
      required.

      Inclusion Criteria: Absence of T2DM at 6Â±3months post-partum OGTT.

      Anticipated outcomes: Primary outcomes:

      Proportion of women with a change of glycaemic category, at or prior to final visit:

      Normal glucose tolerance to impaired fasting glucose (IFG) or impaired glucose tolerance
      (IGT) or T2DM; and/or impaired fasting glucose/impaired glucose tolerance to type 2 Diabetes
      Mellitus (DM)

      Secondary outcomes:

      Mean changes in Body weight, Mean changes in waist circumference, Mean changes in systolic
      blood pressure, mean changes in fasting blood glucose, mean changes in physical activity, and
      mean changes in fruits and vegetable consumption (changes in dietary pattern), incremental
      cost effectiveness ratio.

      Burden: Diabetes Mellitus is a major public health concern for both the developed and the
      developing countries. Globally 246 million people affected with diabetes, and will rise up to
      300 million by 2025. In India, around 25% of the 25 million pregnancies are associated with
      gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM), and increasing rapidly over the time. Reported
      prevalence rates for GDM for Sri Lanka (13%) and Bangladesh (10%) have been described.
      However, in Bangladesh, estimate varies from 9.7% to 12.9% when different criteria were used.

      Knowledge gap: There is knowledge gap on whether a resource- and culturally-appropriate
      lifestyle intervention program will be more effective and cost effective relative to usual
      care in delaying incidence of T2D among women in South Asia. Evidence of developed countries
      indicates that a low-intensity lifestyle intervention, integrated with antenatal care in
      health system, optimizes healthy diet and attenuates physical activity decline in early
      pregnancy.

      Study Design:

      An open-label parallel group pragmatic individual randomized controlled trial with blinded
      primary endpoint adjudication will be performed. The randomized controlled trial will be
      preceded by an intervention development and optimization phase.

      Study Setting:

      This is an individual Randomized Control Trial in 1440 women from 24 hospitals (approx) in
      India (700 participants from 10-12 hospitals), Bangladesh (350 participants from 4 hospitals)
      and Sri Lanka (350 participants from 4-6 hospitals). In Bangladesh the study will be
      conducted in 4 hospitals (two public and two private hospitals). The selected facilities are
      as follows: Marie Stopes premium 1, Dhanmondi (Private), BIRDEM2 (Private), Mohammadpur
      Fertility Services &amp; Training Center (Public) , Maternal &amp; Child Health Training Institute,
      Azimpur (Public).

      Sample Size: Bangladesh the estimated sample size is 360 (180 case and 180 control). As the
      investigators are conducting the study in 4 maternal facilities, sample size would be 90/per
      hospital (45 case and 45 control).

      The selection process of the respondents for the full scale trial: The investigators will
      recruit pregnant women of 24-34 weeks of gestation identified with GDM from the selected
      maternal facilities by conducting a standard Oral Glucose tolerance test (OGTT). The
      investigators will identify them and contact with the patients. The research staff will
      explain the purpose and the procedure of the study. After taking informed consent the
      research team will include them in the study for next 4 years.

      Eligibility Criteria: At each participating hospital, women with GDM will be identified at
      24-34 weeks gestation through the performance of a standard oral glucose tolerance test
      (OGTT) using the International Association of the Diabetes and Pregnancy Study Groups
      (IADPSG).

      The inclusion criteria will be the absence of T2DM (i.e. confirmation of NGT, IFG or IGT) at
      3 to 9 months post-par tum OGTT.

      Exclusion criteria will be limited to:

      Confirmed case of Type 2 diabetes, travel time to hospital should not be more than 2 hours,
      lack of access to a mobile telephone, use of steroids during pregnancy prior to diagnosis of
      GDM , assisted reproduction , likelihood of moving residence in the next 3 years and refused
      consent.All reasons for exclusion or consent refusal will be carefully recorded. Study
      procedure: After obtaining IRB approval for the study, the research team will go for staff
      recruitment. Field research staffs will obtain program specific training for 2 weeks. Program
      specific training includes both theory and practical components and motivational interviewing
      techniques.

      Program specific training:

      Site training will occur prior to enrollment of study participants. Training will be done
      either by Central coordinating Center (CCC) directly or through a trained member at the
      Regional Coordinating Center (RCC)

      The selection process of the respondents for the full scale trial:

      The selection process of the respondents for the full scale trial following a standard Oral
      Glucose tolerance test (OGTT):For stage 1: During screening, The investigators will recruit
      women with GDM at their 24 to 34 weeks of gestation through a standard Oral Glucose tolerance
      test (OGTT). OGTT will be applicable for all participants come to the selected facilities
      during the gestation age of 24-34 weeks. The gestational age would be the identification
      phase of the pregnant women. After screening the participant as having GDM by the standard
      Oral Glucose tolerance test (OGTT) following International Association for Diabetes and
      Pregnancy Study group (IADPSG) criteria, the investigators will recruit them as study
      participants. For government facilities to conduct OGTT the cutoff RBS value would be used in
      Bangladesh (6.7 mg/dl and more) and to perform OGTT we will obtain Stage 1 consent initially.
      After obtaining stage 1 consent there will be one individual session in the specific
      outpatient department in a prescheduled dates which will include introductory information
      about the study, general advice on type 2 DM and the team will obtain a tentative appointment
      after 3 to 9 months of delivery for postpartum OGTT. There will be at least one contact after
      hospital discharge and prior to 6 months post delivery. In case of referred GDM patients to
      other institutions such as BIRDEM 2, DMC or any other hospitals (mainly who will be need
      insulin therapy), the investigators will track the patients from the specific institutions.
      The investigators will collect the list of the referred patients from our selected maternity
      facilities .After tracking them Stage 1 consent will be collected from the referred patients
      from that specific hospitals and then the team will do follow up and will ensure that after
      delivery the respondents will come to the original maternal facilities for getting the
      intervention. In case of BIRDEM 2 the patients may have some of their own health educational
      program but the investigators will not deal with that.

      For stage 2: After 3 to 9 months of delivery each individual respondents who consented for
      stage 1 will be approached again for a post partum OGTT. Those who will be diagnosed as
      IGT/IFT or with normal glycaemic status having a place of residence with in catchment area
      (with in 2 hrs travel time from home to facility) and should have access to mobile phone,
      will be enrolled in the study for next 3 years. The individual diagnosed with type 2 DM will
      be excluded from study and will be referred to usual care.

      Assignment of interventions: Allocation procedure (Randomization):

      Patients will be recruited and then randomly allocated into intervention and control arm by
      central concealed randomization. Randomization will be conducted through a central,
      computer-based randomization service, and will be stratified by country; center and use of
      insulin during pregnancy. The investigators should end up with approximately equal numbers of
      intervention and control participants at each center.

      Blinding:

      By necessity, neither site investigators nor participants will be blinded to allocation
      (intervention vs. usual care). However, all central study staff, statisticians and outcome
      adjudicators will remain blinded until final database lock.

      Consent for stage 2: Stage 2 consent will be obtained before central randomization. As post
      partum OGTT is not a routine in our settings so before collecting blood sample for post
      partum OGTT and also for collecting base line data after, The investigators will go for
      obtaining Stage 2 consent where all the procedure and details of the study will be explained.

      Study arms: Intervention The intervention will include 4 face-to-face group sessions combined
      with remote on-going support, and an intensification offering when needed .However depending
      on outcomes during the optimization phase, the balance of face-to-face and remote contact
      might vary substantially overall and between countries. Intervention group will be linked up
      with the facilitator and will be followed up by the outcome assessor. Face-to-face sessions
      will be delivered by a trained facilitator using the existing Help-her training program
      optimized for each country. Eligible and consenting women will attend a selected hospital in
      groups of 5-10 and will have baseline measures assessed prior to the commencement of the
      program. During session 1 the respondents will receive a program specific user manual and
      over the following weeks work through the behavioral skills sessions with a health worker
      trained in the delivery of the program. The participant manuals will be developed following
      Preg Diab Care pilot will undergo minor adaption for use in each country. Each session will
      last for 90 minutes. Following the face to face visits participants will also receive
      reminders, motivational messages and small actionable behaviors delivered using mobile text
      /voice messages and voice calls which will be adapted from a mobile phone /recently developed
      an Indian population (WHO BE HEALTHY BE MOBILE manual on implementing m Diabetes). The
      process has been mentioned as Support strategies delivered remotely in the protocol. Home
      visits and/or telephone calls will be utilized for participants who are unable to attend
      sessions to ensure components are delivered.

      In addition, at week 26, women will undergo a review of progress, and for data collection.
      Program intensification will be offered to women who gain weight by the 6 month time point;
      those who gain more than 2% of baseline weight (which accounts for transient weight
      fluctuations) will receive monthly phone coaching for the remaining 6 months, delivered by
      the trained facilitators. All phases of the program focus on self-management through small,
      feasible, and sustainable changes, by building knowledge and skills across 3 themes (1)
      simple healthy eating and moderate physical activity messages; 2) behavioral skills such as
      problem-solving / goal-setting / self-monitoring; and 3) enhancing internal motivation,
      self-efficacy, and self-management. Simple messages regarding eating and physical activity
      give women an achievable context in which to begin to formulate their own health priorities.
      The program is deliberately not prescriptive with a focus on sustainable behaviors and local
      context. It is estimated 30% of participants may require more intensive support based on the
      previous Help-her trials.

      In year 2 and 3:

      There will be six monthly follow up including specific data collection by using specific CRF(
      case record forms) forms and blood sample collection to check the blood glucose level (HbA1c
      during every alternate 6 month follow up Months 6, 18 and 30 (but If Value is more than 6.5%
      then call patient for OGTT. ) Annually at Months 12, 24 and 36 perform OGTT unless an interim
      diagnosis of T2DM has not already been made and source documentation is available
      .Participants who change glycaemic category but do not develop T2DM,will be followed up.

      Control Control group participants will be referred to their usual doctor for ongoing
      management, with no attempt made to influence this. Any abnormal OGTT results during follow
      up will be provided to the patient and their doctor. This is entirely consistent with current
      usual care. However there will be no standardized &quot;usual care&quot; across the study sites ,so it
      can be vary from site to site and the study will not interfere with usual care as a part of
      intervention if exists.

      Contents of intervention:

      SMS:

      There will be an expert working group formed by representative for all three countries .SMSs
      ( total 84 SMSs )will to be translated in native language first.The sms/voice call vendor
      will send the messages automatically on receipt of participant information from the central
      study staff.

      Monthly phone calls:

      Total 17 phone calls will be made to each participant (approx) Reinforcing about diet,
      physical activity, baby centric messages and what's going on.

      For intensification group: additional 4-6 phone calls; counsel them individual barriers;
      (women who can't gain desired weight loss.)

      Please see the below table to check the guideline for phone calls:

      Primary outcome:

      Proportion of women with 2 type of change of glycaemic category, at or prior to final visit;
      from Normal glucose tolerance to impaired fasting glucose (IFG) or impaired glucose tolerance
      (IGT) or T2DM; or Impaired fasting glucose (IFG) or impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) to Type
      2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM).

      Secondary outcomes:

      Mean Change in fasting blood glucose, mean change in body weight ,mean change in waist
      circumference (cm), changes in mean systolic blood pressure (SBP),mean change in physical
      activity level , change in dietary pattern including fruits and vegetable consumption,
      incremental cost effectiveness ratio. Data collection methods Follow-up and data collection
      will operate on the principle of collecting the minimum information required to evaluate the
      major quantitative study outcomes. Data will be collected at randomization and 6 monthly
      intervals thereafter, involving a brief case record form, with additional OGTT and HbA1c
      test, alternately conducted at the follow up 6 monthly visits and both tests at the End of
      Study visit. Data will be captured electronically and data management will strictly comply
      with ICH-GCP guidelines, utilizing Standard Operating Procedures established at participating
      institutes. Monitoring will be used to ensure quality and completeness of data, with an
      emphasis on central statistical monitoring to minimize costs.

      Data Analysis plan:

      This study aims at estimating the impact of the intervention at the regional level. For
      analysis the investigators will pool data from all three participating countries and will
      prepare a combined data set. Relevant analysis will be done based on this combined data set.
      Randomization will be done at individual level and this will not allow us to estimate any
      change at the country level. Analysis will be based on the principle of intention-to-treat.
      The effectiveness of the study intervention on the primary outcomes will be determined using
      Cox models for survival data, with censoring of participants who develop a subsequent
      pregnancy or type 2 DM during follow-up. Analyses of secondary outcomes will be conducted
      using standard statistical procedures applicable to dichotomous, categorical or continuous
      data as appropriate. However, any country level change detected during the analyses will be
      reported.

      Data Safety Monitoring Plan (DSMP) Our research protocol includes Data Safety Monitoring
      Plan. The purpose of DSMP is to provide a framework for appropriate oversight and monitoring
      of the conduct of clinical trials to ensure the safety of participants and the validity and
      integrity of the data. In this study data collection tools will be pretested and checked for
      validity and reliability before going for data collection. The investigators will also
      maintain the confidentiality of each participant and data will be stored for further
      analysis. Data collection in the field will be supervised by Principal Investigator and
      Research Investigator (RI). RI will check 10% of the data for random error for quality
      assurance (QA). The objective of this QA plan is to clear, concise, and complete plan for the
      data operation and its quality objectives and identifying key project personnel Serious
      Adverse Events All serious adverse events must be reported during follow-up (from
      randomization to 30 days after the final visit). A Serious Adverse Event (SAE) is any adverse
      event (any untoward, undesired, unplanned clinical event in the form of signs, symptoms,
      disease, or laboratory or physiological observations occurring in a human being participating
      in a clinical study, regardless of causal relationship) that meets one or more of the
      following criteria: results in death; or ,is life threatening (see below); or requires
      hospitalization or prolongation of an existing hospitalization (see below); or results in a
      persistent or significant disability or incapacity (see below); or results in a congenital
      anomaly or birth defect etc.

      Additionally, an important medical event that may not result in death, be life threatening,
      or require hospitalization may be considered an SAE when, based on appropriate medical
      judgment, which can jeopardize the subject and may require medical or surgical intervention
      to prevent one of the outcomes listed above.

      Research Ethics Approval Ethics approval has already been obtained from a number of ethics
      committees, including the University of Sydney Human Research Ethics Committee. In India,
      approvals from the Health Ministry Screening Committee and the All India Institute of Medical
      Sciences (Central Coordinating Centre) have been obtained. The trial will be registered with
      the Clinical Trials Registry of India, Sri Lanka and Bangladesh (Clinical Trials Registry).
      In Bangladesh, ethics committee approval from icddr,b and BADAS IRB has been obtained.

      Consent: Respondents willing to take part in the study will be consented in appropriate
      manner as per icddr,b consent and ethical review committee requirements. Written informed
      Consent would also be obtained from the women participating in the full scale trial.

      Donor The study is funded by a National Health and Medical Research Council of Australia
      (NHMRC) Global Alliance for Chronic Diseases (GACD) Grant (APP1093171) and Indian Council of
      Medical Research (ICMR) GACD Grant.
