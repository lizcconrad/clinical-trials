      Prospective, multicenter observational study to collect Escherichia coli (E. coli) isolates
      originating from mechanically ventilated intensive care unit (ICU) patients; in order to
      characterize phenotype and genotype of E. coli strains retrieved from the lower respiratory
      tract of ventilated patients.

      Prospective, observational, multiple center study performed in 14 ICUs in France to collect
      Escherichia coli (E. coli) isolates originating from mechanically ventilated intensive care
      unit (ICU) patients; in order to characterize phenotype and genotype of E. coli strains
      retrieved from the lower respiratory tract of ventilated patients. All E. coli isolates
      identified in the microbiology lab and retrieved from a lung specimen (either tracheal
      aspirate, bronchoalveolar lavage, or telescopic plugged catheter) originating from an ICU
      patient will be kept, and stored at -80°C in brain-heart infusion broth containing glycerol
      20 %. They will be then centralized in the investigators' research unit for further analysis
      that includes determination of Antimicrobial susceptibility, E. coli phylotype , O-type, and
      virulence factor gene content.

      These isolates will be compared to those of two previously published collections, one from
      the stools of community subjects, considered as commensal strains, the other from the blood
      of bacteraemia patients.
