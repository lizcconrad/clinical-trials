  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Clomiphene citrate has been widely used for treatment of infertility for decades. Although
      its anti-estrogenic effects leads to low pregnancy rate, clomiphene citrate is still a
      first-line treatment for ovulation induction because of its simple usage, low prices, no
      injection and low risk of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome. Clomiphene citrate shows high
      affinity with estrogen receptor, which inhibits endometrial proliferation, inevitably leads
      to a decline in endometrial receptivity, thus affecting the success rate of IVF.

      In that case, use clomiphene citrate for ovulation induction is lost more than gained based
      on fresh embryo transfer. But recently, some researchers have proposed to extend the time
      from ovulation induction to embryo transfer, and the increased level of estradiol can replace
      clomiphene citrate to combine with the receptor, so that the uterine environment is more
      conducive to pregnancy. Therefore, use clomiphene citrate based on vitrification of embryo
      maybe a good way for treatment of infertility.

      At present, using frozen embryo transplantation after ovulation induction by clomiphene
      citrate is a common treatment, but few research has mentioned the best time for embryo
      implantation. The investigators research is to find the most appropriate time for frozen
      embryo implantation after using clomiphene citrate for ovulation induction.

      This study receives patients from 2017 August to 2018 June who undergo ART treatment at
      Shanghai Jiai Genetics &amp; IVF Institute and taken either CC or GnRH antagonist
      protocol(control group) for ovulation induction.

      The investigators will record every patients' age, BMI, serum E2, P, LH level, infertility
      factors and pregnancy outcomes, counted the implantation rate and clinical pregnancy rate,
      and then used SPSS Software x2 test for statistical analysis, the significance was set at
      p＜0.05.The investigators will also make a correlation analysis about the serum hormone level
      and pregnancy outcomes.

    <description>Ovulation induction: regular Clomiphene Citrate protocol. Start use rFSH or HMG from day 2/3 of the menstrual cycle, the initial dosage is determined by patients' age, BMI, antral follicle number, FSH, E2, AMH and past ovarian response, usually 150-225IU/d, until hCG injection. At the same time, take CC 100mg/d until hCG injection. The dosage of Gn will be adjust by serum E2, P, LH and the development of follicular.</description>
