      Background:

      CLN3, or Batten disease, is a genetic disorder. This deadly disease leads to decline of brain
      and nervous system functions. Symptoms of CLN3 typically occur between 4 and 7 years of age.
      They include changes in how a person sees, thinks, and moves. CLN3 can also cause seizures.
      No effective treatments for the disease are yet known. There is limited testing of potential
      therapies. Researchers want to study CLN3 more so they can improve future therapies.

      Objective:

      To identify clinical or biochemical markers that can be used as therapeutic outcome measures
      for CLN3.

      Eligibility:

      People with CLN3. It must be based on

      Two CLN3 mutations OR

      One CLN3 mutation AND findings seen with a powerful microscope

      Family members of a person with CLN3.

      Design:

      Participants will have already been referred to NIH for CLN3 evaluation.

      If participants agree to do the study, they will:

        1. give spinal fluid, blood, urine, and skin samples. They may provide other samples if
           they were already collected. These may include cells, surgical specimens, and DNA.

        2. will be seen by multiple healthcare specialists.

      Participants may provide medical records or photos. Participants will sign a release of
      medical records form.P

      Researchers may send samples or clinical data to other investigators. For research testing,
      the samples will not include the participant s name. For a test in a clinical lab,
      researchers will include the participant s name. These results will become part of the
      clinical record at NIH.

    <textblock>
      Juvenile Neuronal Ceroid Lipofuscinosis (Batten Disease, CLN3) is a recessive, fatal,
      lysosomal storage disease that results in progressive neurodegeneration. In aggregate, the 13
      disorders of neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis are considered the most common neurodegenerative
      disorders in children with incidence estimates ranging from 1/12,500 to 1/100,000 in European
      and USA populations. Neurological symptoms of CLN3 typically manifest between 4 and 7 years
      of age. The initial clinical presentation is progressive vision loss and cognitive
      impairment, followed by insidious progression of motor dysfunction and onset of seizures.
      Affected individuals generally succumb to the disease in young adulthood. There is no
      effective treatment for CLN3. A major impediment to the testing of potential therapeutic
      interventions is the lack of well-defined outcome measures. The purpose of this protocol is
      to obtain both baseline and rate of progression data on clinical and biochemical markers that
      may later be used as an outcome measure in a clinical trial, and to establish a biorepository
      of samples from CLN3 participants.

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:

        Individuals with a diagnosis of CLN3

        Diagnosis of CLN3 determined by one of the following:

          -  Two CLN3 mutations

          -  One CLN3 mutation AND characteristic electron microscopy (EM) findings (such as
             curvilinear body, fingerprint profile, granular osmiophilic deposits).

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

          -  Individuals who cannot travel to the NIH because of their medical condition.

          -  Individuals who, in the opinion of the Investigator, are unable to comply with the
             protocol or have medical conditions that would potentially increase the risk of
             participation.

          -  Female individuals who are pregnant will be excluded from evaluations requiring
             radiation or sedation.

          -  Individuals who fail the screening for MRI safety criteria will be excluded from the
