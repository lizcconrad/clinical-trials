  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will investigate the beneficial effects of supplementation with a plant polyphenol
      blend rich in anthocyanins on parameters of inflammation and metabolic responses following a
      challenge with a high-fat (HF) meal.

      The investigators will use a randomized crossover study to investigate the effects of: 1)
      placebo (control); 2) plant polyphenol blend rich in anthocyanins; on systemic inflammatory
      markers (endotoxemia, cytokines, NF-κB), glucose and lipid metabolic responses following
      consumption of a high-fat (HF) meal in healthy subjects. The high-fat meal (320 g) consists
      of English muffin bread, sausage, egg and cheese, obtained from US market and completed with
      palm fat. The total energy content of the high-fat meal is 1,026 Kcal with 70.5 g of fat
      (29.8 g of saturated fat), 270 mg of cholesterol, 65 g carbohydrate, 5.2 g sugar, and 33 g
      protein with a total of 62% energy originated from fat, 25% from carbohydrates and 13% from
      protein. The high-fat meal will be standard and it will not be adjusted for large and small
      participants.
