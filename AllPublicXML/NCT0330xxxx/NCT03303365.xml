  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      For patients with cerebral oligometastases who are in adequate clinical condition
      stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) is the treatment of choice, being recommended by
      international guidelines for the treatment of one to four lesions. Newer findings have shown
      that for patients with more than four lesions SRS can be considered as a favorable
      alternative to whole-brain radiotherapy (WBRT), the currently established standard-of-care
      treatment. With modern techniques highly conformal SRS of multiple lesions has become
      feasible with comparable clinical effort and minimal toxicity as compared to WBRT.
      Developments in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI- imaging) have produced highly sensitive
      contrast-enhanced three-dimensional fast spin echo sequences such as SPACE that facilitate
      the detection of very small and early-stage lesions in a fashion superior to the established
      Magnetization Prepared Rapid Gradient Echo (MPRAGE) series.

      Since it has been established that the response of brain metastases to SRS is better for
      smaller lesions and that WBRT can come at the price of significant neurotoxicity, the
      investigators hypothesize that 1) earlier detection of small brain metastases and 2) early
      and aggressive treatment of those by SRS will result in an overall clinical benefit by
      delaying the failure of repeated localized therapy and thus preserving quality of life and
      potentially prolonging overall survival. On the other hand however, overtreatment might be a
      valid concern with this approach since it has yet to be proved that a clinical benefit can be
      achieved.

      The current study aims to stretch the boundaries of the term &quot;cerebral oligometastases&quot; by
      performing SRS for up to ten cerebral metastases, compared to the established clinical
      standard of four, given that existing data supports the non-inferiority of this approach and
      given that modern Cyberknife SRS facilitates the treatment of multiple lesions with minimal
      treatment-associated toxicity.

      Scientific Background: Brain metastases are the most common intracranial cancer
      manifestations, affecting up to one third of adult cancer patients with systemic spread.
      Prognosis is generally poor with overall survival ranging below 6 months on average. However,
      a more detailed inspection reveals a prognostic subgroup, for which improved overall survival
      and clinical symptom control can be achieved and that is most descriptively characterized by
      favorable clinical performance (KPI ≥ 70%) and extracranially controlled disease. Whereas for
      most patients with brain metastases whole-brain radiotherapy, steroids or best supportive
      care represent the palliation treatment of choice, the abovementioned subgroup is eligible to
      profit from a locally radical therapy concept and in those cases neurosurgical resection and
      stereotactic radiosurgery have both produced favorable results. In patients unsuitable for
      neurosurgical resection, single- or multifraction, SRS has several distinct advantages over
      WBRT, the most significant being short treatment time, less posttherapeutic neurocognitive
      impairment, better local tumor control and little to no hair loss. Furthermore, SRS can be
      repeated multiple times or performed before or after WBRT. Current clinical guidelines
      recommend SRS in cases of cerebral oligometastases, defined as one to four intracranial
      lesions with an extracranially controlled systemic disease status. However, recent data
      suggests that it may be a suitable treatment for patients with five to ten or even more than
      ten lesions, being non-inferior to the SRS of four or less lesions. There are several factors
      supporting this rationale: On the one hand technical improvements in the field of SRS have
      significantly facilitated the treatment of a higher number of target lesions with little to
      no increase in toxicity and comparable clinical effort. On the other hand, the ever improving
      sensitivity of medical imaging has caused an increase in the detection of oligometastatic
      constellations, enabling their treatment in an earlier stage. For a long time the
      contrast-based high-resolution cranial computer tomography (cCT) had been the gold standard
      of detecting cerebral metastases. This was significantly improved by the introduction of
      magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with contrast-enhanced T1-weighted sequences. Sensitivity
      was further improved with the introduction of 3T MRI into clinical routine and the
      development of high-resolution three-dimensional gradient-echo sequences such as the
      contrast-based T1-weighted MPRAGE, featuring a slice thickness of 0.9 mm and multiplanar
      reconstruction, thus enabling the detection of very small sized lesions in the range of one
      to a few millimeters. However, the use of gradient-echo (GE) techniques to obtain
      three-dimensional high-spatial-resolution images comes at the cost of inferior contrast
      enhancement and higher susceptibility to artifacts than is the case with two-dimensional
      spin-echo (SE) techniques. Recent developments in MRI research have produced another sequence
      that might prove even superior to MPRAGE in the specific detection of very small and early
      brain metastases: Sampling perfection with application-optimized contrasts by using different
      flip angle evolutions (SPACE) is a three-dimensional fast SE sequence that combines high
      contrast enhancement superior to MPRAGE with a high spatial resolution and multiplanar
      reconstruction. Kato et al. have found this sequence to be significantly superior to MPRAGE
      in the detection of contrast enhanced parenchymal lesions, especially if those are &lt; 5mm in
      size as is characteristic of small very-early-stage cerebral metastases.

      Trial Objectives: It is the purpose of this study to evaluate treatment response and toxicity
      after SRS of up to ten simultaneous cerebral metastases, treating either all lesions visible
      in the highly sensitive SPACE MRI sequence or only those visible in the conventional
      contrast-based MPRAGE sequence. Treatment response is evaluated with respect to the
      ineligibility for further cerebral SRS at 12 months after initial SRS, defined by
      simultaneous new occurrence or progression of &gt; 10 brain metastases (as a surrogate parameter
      for overall local control), furthermore overall survival and cognitive function and quality
      of life.

      Patients´Selection: A total of n=200 patients will be enrolled into the trial (n=100 per
      treatment group). All patients fulfilling the inclusion and exclusion criteria will be
      informed about the study and included into the study if they declare informed consent.
      Registration for the study must be performed before the start of RT.

      Trial Design: The trial will be performed as a single-center two-armed prospective randomized
      Phase II study. Patients will be randomized into an experimental arm and a control arm. All
      patients will receive pre-therapeutic MRI imaging as described in (Chapter 6) and imaging
      will be assessed by a radiologist. For patients in the experimental arm, all available MRI
      series, including SPACE will be taken into consideration for the definition of treatment
      target lesions. For patients in the control arm the assessing radiologist will be blinded
      with respect to the SPACE sequence and for the definition of treatment target lesions
      primarily contrast-based three-dimensional MPRAGE, complemented by all non-SPACE MRI
      sequences will be taken into consideration.

In Arm A, the contrast-based T1-weighted SPACE sequence is utilized for GTV definition. In Arm B, the contrast-based T1-weighted three-dimensional MPRAGE sequence is utilized for GTV definition. In both cases the GTV consists of all contrasted tissue associated with the target lesion and all additional tissue judged by an experienced physician to be part of the suspect target lesion. To the GTV a PTV margin of 1 mm is added by isotropic expansion that can be slightly modified if deemed necessary by the treating physician (e.g. intersection with adjoining OAR).
Dose prescription to the PTV for target lesions will be as follows:
20 Gy to the 70%-isodose (lesions &lt; 2 cm max. diameter)
18 Gy to the 70%-isodose (lesions 2 - 3 cm max. diameter)
6 x 5 Gy to the conformally surrounding isodose (lesions &gt; 3 cm max. diameter)</description>
