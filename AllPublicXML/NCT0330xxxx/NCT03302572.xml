  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The knowledge and completion of advanced directives (ADs) by the population is generally low.
      Primary care could develop a very important role to inform and assist in the preparation of
      this document because of its accessibility.

      Objective: To evaluate the effectiveness of an oral brief information and a brochure
      administered in primary care to improve the proportion of ADs records.

      Design: Randomized clinical trial. Ambit: 7 offices from a urban health center which serves
      about 25,000 users older than 18 years.

      Material and methods It will be administered randomly triptych and oral brief information
      about the existence of advance directives for people over 18 to attend the appointment of
      their family doctor for any reason (intervention group). It will be given the possibility of
      more extensive information if they wish and collaboration will be offered for the advance
      directive according to patient preferences. The control group will not receive any
      information. Follow-up: 3 months. Variables will be: number of people interested in ADs,
      number of ADs made and demographic data (gender, age, education level, race, comorbidities,
      religion, testament) in both groups. Statistical analysis: multiple linear regression,
      Poisson and Cox as response analyzed, with the intervention/control group as the main
      variable adjusting for potential confounders. Bivariate comparison using Student t test or
      Mann-Whitney test (continuous variables) and chi-square or Fisher's exact test (categorical
      variables). 165 subjects were required in the control group and 165 in the intervention
      group.

      Conclusion: positive results of this study will bring out the brief information managed by
      family physicians increases the number of ADs thus facilitating the right to autonomy of the
      patient.

    <description>Patients will be given brief information about the existence of advance directives after resolving the reason for the visit for which they had come. This information will not last more than 3 minutes and will not be repeated on successive visits within the recruitment period. Also, an informative triptych will be given to the patient so that he can read it at home. These leaflets have been made by the regional Department of Health. They will be advised that we can extend the information or help them to do the document in the near future if they want, we will inform that we would wait for the answer 3 months. In case of interest, they can leave their information in the User Service by specifying name, telephone number and reference doctor or ask for an appointment again.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients older than 18 years old who go to their family doctor by appointment.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  - Patients with language barrier

          -  Patients younger than 18 years (advanced directives not provided for by law)

          -  Patients with altered decision-making ability according to computerized clinical
             history by coding in health problems or mentioned in a clinical course of computerized
             medical history : cognitive impairment, dementia, mental retardation diagnosed.
             Although there are studies on attitudes towards advanced directives of people with
             early cognitive impairment (Minimental&gt; 18), it was decided to discard because the
             intervention should be brief. The cited study also concludes that this type of
             patients prefer to delegate decisions to the family.

          -  Patients who come spontaneously to their family doctor.

          -  Patients who have already been recruited previously in the study. Patients who may
             visit by appointment only on more than one occasion will only participate once and
             subsequent visits for recruitment will be excluded. In addition, there will be no
             reinforcement of the study intervention in these visits.

          -  Patients who have already formalized the advanced directives.

          -  Patients who do not wish to participate in the study.
