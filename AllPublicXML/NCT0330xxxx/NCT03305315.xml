  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Given the frequency of temporomandibular joint (TMJ) dysfunction and the variations in its
      expression, this project intends to initiate a process of objective evaluation of mandible
      function and its impairment due to different diseases. The first step is to determine whether
      3D kinematic quantification of the mandible would make it possible to objectively assess the
      effect of post-operative management on TMJ function recovery. If the first results are
      encouraging and show the sensitivity of the analysis of minor joint dysfunctions, the
      investigators will evaluate the feasibility of kinematic assessments for major TMJ
      dysfunctions and for the follow-up of patients.

      The expected benefits of this study are to be considered in the medium term and concern the
      possibilities offered by measuring mandible kinetics in the treatment of TMJ disorders.

    <description>Jaw mobility will be measured during simple movements of the mouth (opening the mouth, side-to-side and backwards-and-forwards movement of the jaw). These movements will be measured using a specific apparatus, part of which will be placed on the head like a helmet with the other part placed in the mouth and stuck to the teeth using a dental adhesive. The part in the mouth is specifically designed for this purpose. Measurements using this apparatus will take around 30 minutes.</description>
