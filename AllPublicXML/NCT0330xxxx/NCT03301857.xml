    <description>Safety Follow Up - Cohort B Subjects who completed denosumab treatment in 20062004 and were in the safety follow-up (FU) at the conclusion of 20062004 will continue in long-term safety FU in this study. FU study visits will be done every 6 months (± 30 days) either via telephone or in-person clinic visit. Retreatment with denosumab (120 mg subcutaneous [SC] every 4 wks) is allowed for subjects who previously demonstrated a response to denosumab and have experienced disease recurrence while in long-term safety FU at the investigator's discretion. If more than 12 months have elapsed since the last denosumab therapy, biopsy confirmation of disease for further pathologic evaluation of the recurrence is required.</description>

    <description>Cohort A: subjects who were receiving denosumab at the conclusion of Study 20062004 can continue receiving denosumab at the current dose and schedule at the investigator's discretion. All subjects should be adequately supplemented with calcium and vitamin D (at least 500 mg of calcium and 400 IU of vitamin D), except in the case of pre-existing hypercalcemia. Follow-up study visits will be performed in clinic every 6 months (± 30 days) while receiving denosumab. Subjects who discontinue denosumab will have an end-of-treatment (EOT) in-person clinic visit approximately 6 months (± 30 days) after the last dose of denosumab. Thereafter, they will enter the long-term safety follow-up and will be monitored as per Cohort B requirements.</description>
