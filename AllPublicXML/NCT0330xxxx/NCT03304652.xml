  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Recent studies in animal models have suggested a critical role for cerebrospinal fluid and
      Interstitial fluid flux through cerebral parenchyma for removal of byproducts of cellular
      metabolism and hence in maintaining the health of the brain. This effect is modulated during
      sleep, suggesting a potentially important mechanism for sleep to maintain both acute
      homeostasis and long-term cerebral health.

      The central goal of these studies is to develop a sensitive MRI biomarker of cerebral
      conformational changes during sleep. This exploratory work aims to establish the sensitivity
      and reproducibility of MRI as a non-invasive neuroimaging assessment of cerebral changes
      during natural sleep and sedation.

      Recent studies in animal models have suggested a critical role for cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)
      / Interstitial fluid (ISF) flux through cerebral parenchyma for removal of byproducts of
      cellular metabolism and hence in maintaining the health of the brain. It remains unknown to
      what extent these phenomena exist in the human brain. A key challenge in this work is to make
      non-invasive and reproducible measurements of the cerebral microenvironment in humans. For
      these studies, we have implemented a suite of MRI measurements to track physiological changes
      in the brain during sleep. This exploratory work aims to establish the sensitivity and
      reproducibility of MRI as a non-invasive neuroimaging assessment of cerebral changes during
      natural sleep and sedation. The long term goal of this work is to use MRI as an imaging
      biomarker to assess the cerebral response to normal versus disordered sleep in patients.

      Our specific aims will address the following questions:

      Aim 1: How sensitive are MRI metrics for determining changes in the brain during sleep?

      Aim 2: How reproducible are MRI metrics during sleep and during sedation?

      We will recruit 12 normal adult subjects for this study (consecutive respondees to
      recruitment adverts). We will make regional MRI measurements during onset, maintenance and
      waking from stage N2 sleep. From these we will characterize which MRI metrics are most
      sensitive to changes in the cerebral environment, and how these vary for different cerebral
      regions.

      Measurements will be repeated during ~90 minutes of natural sleep, and following oral
      sedation with 10 mg zaleplon (Sonata).
