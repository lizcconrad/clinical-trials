  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators will conduct a randomized controlled trial of an 8-week resilience-enhanced
      CBT online self-management program for chronic pain plus usual care (PRISM), standard e-CBT
      self-management plus usual care (e-CBT), and usual care alone. Thus, 300 individuals with
      chronic pain will undergo a comprehensive pre-intervention assessment that includes a blood
      draw (T1). Participants will then be randomized 2:2:1 as follows: e-CBT (n=120), PRISM
      (n=120) and usual care (n = 60). Immediately post-intervention (T2) and at 6 months (T3) and
      12 months (T4) after that, participants undergo the same in-person assessment including blood
      draw. Telomerase activity will be assessed at T1, T2 and T3; and telomere length at T1 and T4

    <measure>Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire-Revised (FIQ-R)</measure>
    <time_frame>At 8-week assessment point</time_frame>
    <description>The Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire-Revised (FIQR) assesses the total spectrum of problems and responses to therapy. The 2009 revised version contains 21 items assessing broad domains such as physical function, overall impact, and a wide range of symptoms. The measure is self-report with a recall period of the past week and requires only several minutes to complete.</description>

    <arm_group_type>Active Comparator</arm_group_type>
    <description>Patients randomized to e-CBT will undergo &quot;Standard Web-based Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (e-CBT) Self-Management Program&quot; and meet with a study medical assistant (MA) for an orientation session. The MA provides an overview of the program, explains the rationale for treatment, and directs them to the FibroGuide website. FibroGuide features the CBT modules that will be used by both groups. Patients will complete one module per week. Materials needed for the 8-week intervention including the instructions for each activity and forms for the written aspects of an activity (worksheets) will be provided in the first visit and available online. The FibroGuide website evolved from the evidence-based website Living Well with Fibromyalgia that has established efficacy for improving functional status and reducing pain.</description>

    <description>Patients randomized to PRISM will undergo &quot;Promoting Resilience through Innovative Self-Management&quot; (PRISM) and meet with the MA for an orientation session. The MA describes the program, explains the rationale for treatment, and directs them to the FibroGuide and PRISM websites. Materials and worksheets are provided in the first visit and available online. The e-CBT elements retained are the core elements of CBT for pain, while the resilience-based activities capitalize on the best practices for positive activities interventions including having multiple overlapping activities, making favored activities standard practice beyond the study and having a coaching component.</description>

    <description>Patients randomized to the usual care only group will have no contact with the study MAs. Usual care patients return for the same follow-up assessments (and electronic medical record review) at 8 weeks and at 6 and 12 months. Whereas major surgery including surgeries for pain, are exclusion criteria, spine and pain injections will be permitted.</description>
