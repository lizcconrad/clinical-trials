  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to compare the effect of chloroprocaine vs. bupivacaine on duration of motor
      block and duration until meeting discharge criteria in patients undergoing cervical cerclage.
      The hypothesis is that chloroprocaine will result in faster resolution of motor block.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cervical cerclage is an ambulatory surgical procedure of short duration commonly performed
      under spinal anesthesia. Bupivaciane and chlororpocaine are both commonly used, but how their
      use impacts clinical care, in particular patient flow, is not well studied.

      This is a prospective, randomized, double blind, controlled trial. Participants meeting
      inclusion criteria will be randomly allocated to receive spinal anesthesia with either
      chloroprocaine or bupivacaine.

      Patients will then be assessed for motor block and sensory level until they are discharged
      from the recovery room.

    <masking_description>The anesthesia provider responsible for the clinical care of the patient will be given an envelope prepared during randomization and instructed to open it and prepare the medication in a separate room, such that the investigator and patient cannot see which vial is being used to prepare the medication. The anesthesia provider will also be instructed not to reveal the allocation group to the investigator or the patient.
Both bupivacaine and chloroprocaine are clear liquids, and the intended doses of both medications are the same volume, to insure complete blinding.</masking_description>

    <description>The patient will be randomly selected to receive either Chloroprocaine or Bupivacaine as the local medication for in spinal anesthesia, with a 50% chance to receive either drug.
During the cervical cerclage procedure and in the recovery room, the patient will be checked for motor block (the ability to move feet and legs) and for sensory block(the ability to feel) using a plastic tip, every 5 minutes in the first hour, and at 10 minutes intervals afterwards until the anesthesia wears off completely. The patient will also be asked to walk and urinate after the local anesthetic wears off to ensure complete resolution of local anesthesia.</description>
