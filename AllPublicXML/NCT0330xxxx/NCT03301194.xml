  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hypertension (HT) is an important risk factor for stroke, coronary heart disease (CHD), heart
      failure and renal diseases, and the leading risk factor of global disease burden. A multitude
      of interventions have proven efficacy in lowering blood pressure and reducing long term HT
      complications, including pharmacologic treatment, DASH diet (Dietary Approaches to Stop
      Hypertension), exercise, weight reduction, smoking cessation, alcohol moderation and
      self-monitoring of blood pressure.

      Objectives:

      To evaluate long-term effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of
      Risk-Assessment-and-Management-Programme-for-Hypertension (RAMP-HT), a multi-disciplinary
      structured service to enhance quality of hypertension care in primary care compared to usual
      care

      Hypotheses:

        1. RAMP-HT is effective in reducing HT complications, based on previous results showing
           RAMP-HT was effective in improving patients' blood pressure

        2. RAMP-HT is cost-effective

      Design and Subjects:

      Retrospective study of 5-year longitudinal data on matched cohorts of public primary care
      patients with uncontrolled HT under RAMP-HT and usual care will be conducted to evaluate
      long-term effectiveness and direct medical costs. Results from the long-term effectiveness
      and costing analyses will be applied to Markov modeling to determine the life time
      cost-effectiveness of RAMP-HT.

      Main outcome measures:

        1. 5-year incidence of cardiovascular complications

        2. Direct medical costs of RAMP-HT and usual care HT patients

        3. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of cost per quality-adjusted life year
           (QALY) gained by RAMP-HT compared to usual care

      Data analysis:

      Cox regression will be performed to estimate the effect of RAMP-HT on the development of HT
      complication adjusted for baseline covariates. Descriptive statistics will be used to
      calculate costs of RAMP-HT and annual direct medical costs for HT patients. Markov modeling
      will be used to simulate 2 patient cohorts (RAMP-HT versus usual care) to estimate the
      respective lifetime direct medical costs and QALY gained/person. Cost/QALY of RAMP-HT will be
      compared to that of usual care to determine the ICER.

      Expected results:

      The results can provide evidence on the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of RAMP-HT for
      primary care patients with uncontrolled HT, which can inform health policy and service
      planning.

      Aim and objectives:

      The aim of this study is to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of the RAMP-HT of the HA in
      primary care patients with uncontrolled hypertension.

      The objectives are to:

        1. Evaluate the long term (5-year) effectiveness of RAMP-HT compared to usual care in
           reducing cardiovascular complications, end-stage renal disease and all-cause mortalities
           in a cohort of primary care patients with uncontrolled hypertension at baseline

        2. Estimate the direct medical cost of RAMP-HT and other health services among primary care
           HT patients with or without complications

        3. Evaluate the cost-effectiveness of RAMP-HT, compared to usual care, in gaining one QALY
           in primary care patients with uncontrolled hypertension

      Hypotheses:

        1. RAMP-HT is more effective in reducing 5-year cardiovascular complications, end stage
           renal disease and all-cause mortality among primary care patients with uncontrolled
           hypertension compared to usual care

        2. The direct medical cost of RAMP-HT patients, for the same disease complication status,
           is not higher than that of usual care except for the RAMP-HT cost

        3. The direct medical cost of HT patients with one or more complications is higher than
           that of HT patients without any complication

        4. RAMP-HT is cost-effective compared to usual care, i.e. ICER per QALY gained is below the
           threshold value of 1 annual GDP (Gross Domestic Product) per capita of Hong Kong, which
           is the benchmark recommended by the World Health Organization

    <description>CVD is defined as the presence of any of coronary heart disease (CHD), heart failure or stroke. CHD includes all ischaemic heart disease, myocardial infarction, coronary death or sudden death as indicated by the ICPC-2 K74 to K76 or ICD-9-CM 410.x, 411.x to 414.x, 798.x codes. Heart failure is defined as the ICPC-2 K77 or ICD-9-CM 428.x codes. Stroke (fatal and non-fatal stroke) is defined by the ICPC-2 K89 to K91 or ICD-9-CM 430.x to 438.x codes.</description>

    <time_frame>12-month before baseline, baseline, 12, 24, 36, 48 and 60-month</time_frame>
    <description>Public medical costs will be estimated from products of the unit costs (published in the HKSAR Government Gazette and Hospital Authority (HA) ordinance (Chapter 113) of charges for non-entitled persons) and the utilization rates of 1) dispensed drugs, 2) laboratory tests and investigations, 3) healthcare services including general outpatient clinics (GOPC), specialist outpatient clinics (SOPC), allied health services (e.g. dietician, physiotherapist or occupational therapist), accident and emergency (A&amp;E) department and 4) admissions to hospital in the 12 months before baseline and at 12, 24, 36, 48 and 60 months after study enrolment for each patient in the study cohorts.
Private direct medical costs include the cost of all private Western doctor and Chinese medicine practitioner consultations, private hospitalisation and self-medications inclusive of self-financed medications prescribed by the HA.</description>
  </primary_outcome>

    <time_frame>60-month</time_frame>
    <description>Multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression will be performed to estimate the adjusted effect of RAMP-HT on the dependent variable of each first HT complication event, adjusting for all baseline covariates of patients.</description>

    <description>RAMP-HT was launched since October 2011 by the Hospital Authority with the support from the Food and Health Bureau. Standardized cardiovascular risk factor assessment, hypertensive complication screening and assessment on patient adherence to treatment are carried out on enrolled patients. Patients are stratified into low, medium or high risk groups according to the 10-year cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk calculated from their relevant risk factors by the Joint British Society 2005 Equation. A multidisciplinary team comprised of doctors, nurses, dieticians, physiotherapists and/or occupational therapists would then deliver individualized management targeted to the patient's risk factors according to standardized risk-stratified guidelines.</description>
