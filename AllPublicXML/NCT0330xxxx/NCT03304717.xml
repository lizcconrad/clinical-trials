  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall objectives are to explore the safety and efficacy of Reverse Transcriptase
      Inhibitors Tenofovir (TDF)/ Emtricitabine (FTC) administered for six months in AGS affected
      children 2 to 18 years of age.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators propose that a trial to assess the proof of principle that antiretroviral
      therapy through a drug combination of Tenofovir (TDF) and Emtricitabine (FTC) can decrease
      endogenous retroelement accumulation, and alter interferon signaling in Aicardi Goutieres
      Syndrome (AGS) patients is reasonable and warranted at this time, based on existing in vitro
      and animal data. Additionally, this trial will further the investigators understanding of
      this disorder, measuring for the first time retroelements in human participants, exploring
      the retroviral burden in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), the Interferon (IFN) signaling response,
      as well as evaluating antigen targets of autoimmunity and cytokines. If successful, this
      approach will clearly demonstrate the need for a larger trial of antiretrovirals in AGS with
      more clinically relevant outcomes.

    <measure>Change in interferon activation as measured by interferon response genes</measure>
    <time_frame>From Baseline to 13 months</time_frame>
    <description>The investigators propose to measure genes in the IFN stimulatory pathway in AGS patients, as a measure of disease activity and as a possible biomarker of therapeutic activity. Current data suggests that IFN related genes remain elevated in the late teens in AGS affected subjects, making it a more reliable measure of disease activity than IFN alpha. Validation of this preliminary data includes serial measurements in blood across several time points, to assess for variability.</description>

    <time_frame>From Baseline to 13 months</time_frame>
    <description>The investigators will pursue immunophenotyping of CSF cells in AGS subjects. Immunophenotyping and target antigens will further understanding of end organ damage in AGS. Additionally, this may provide biomarkers for therapeutic outcome and disease activity.</description>

    <description>This is a double-blind, placebo-controlled, 2 arm, cross-over trial involving 34 children with clinical findings and molecular confirmation of Aicardi Goutieres Syndrome, who also have an abnormal interferon signature. For arm 1, half of the patients will receive TDF/FTC (a combination of Tenofovir [TDF] and Emtricitabine [FTC]) for the first 6 months of the study. There will be a one month washout period before starting on placebo for 6 months.</description>
