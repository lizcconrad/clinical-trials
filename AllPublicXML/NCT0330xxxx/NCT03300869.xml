  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to investigate the natural history of spinal muscular
      atrophy (SMA) types 2 and 3 patients in Taiwan. This study will provide further insights into
      the clinical course SMA. Several analyses will be conducted regarding overall survival,
      demographic characteristics, motor function, respiratory and nutritional support, and
      genotype and phenotype correlation.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      As with other rare diseases, individual groups of SMA have therefore opted to share patient
      information in the form of clinical sites to increase the overall patient cohorts on which
      clinical outcomes and new assisted-healthcare technologies can be assessed. Using the
      collaborative and retrospective study of types 2 and 3 SMA patients in Taiwan, the
      investigators aim to 1) characterize the correlation of genotype and phenotype, 2) correlate
      the onset, progression, management with disease outcome, 3) depict comorbidity and within
      type 2 and 3 SMA patients with different SMN2 copy number.

        In the past decades, The SMA is a rare disease (incidence of 1 in every 6,000-10,000 live
        births) with a carrier frequency of about 1 in 40-50 people. Therefore, individual
        countries have small cohorts of affected patients.
