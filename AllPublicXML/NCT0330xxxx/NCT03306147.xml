  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic pain is one of the most prevalent and debilitating medical conditions and opioid
      analgesics are a commonly prescribed class of medications in the United States. Opioid
      efficacy has been proven in terms of managing acute and chronic pain; however, opioid
      overdose deaths, addictions, and diversions have all continued to increase over the years.
      The purpose of this study is to increase patient engagement in pain management and education,
      and to decrease opioid use by 10% over the study period. This study will also help present
      opportunities for future studies to obtain insight regarding the chronic use of opioids.

      The institutional review board has approved this prospective single-center study at a large
      900-bed academic university medical center. The electronic medical record system will
      identify 300 patients, who are at least 18 years of age, with a history of opioid use for 3
      or more months, or who are currently prescribed and are using long-acting or extended release
      opioids. Procedures by student pharmacists, pharmacy residents, and pharmacists will include
      reviewing medical records and prescription drug monitoring programs for the use of opioids,
      evaluating baseline pain, quality of life, and satisfaction via questionnaires and assessment
      questions, and performing thorough medication consultations on current opioid regimens.
      Education of pain and promotion of adjunct and non-pharmacologic alternative therapies will
      be completed to engage patients in assessing their pain and seeing the effectiveness of their
      treatment. Patients will receive 3 follow-up interventions: 2 phone calls with a pharmacist
      or student pharmacist at weeks 2 and 6, and a follow-up visit with a pain or primary care
      physician. Opioid usage, pain, quality of life, and patient satisfaction will be assessed.
      The primary outcome measured will be a decrease in opioid usage in morphine milligram
      equivalents. Secondary outcomes include change in quality of life and patient satisfaction.
