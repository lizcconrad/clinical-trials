  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In stroke survivors, atrial fibrillation is typically detected with short-term
      electrocardiogram (ECG) monitoring in the stroke unit. Prolonged continuous ECG monitoring is
      impractical and requires substantial resources while insertable cardiac monitors are invasive
      and costly. Chest and thumb-ECG could provide an alternative for atrial fibrillation
      detection post-stroke.

      The primary objective of our study is to assess the incidence of newly diagnosed atrial
      fibrillation during 28 days of chest and thumb-ECG monitoring in patients with cryptogenic
      stroke. Secondary objectives are to assess Health-related Quality of Life using Short Form-36
      and the feasibility of the Coala Heart Monitor in patients with stroke.

      Stroke survivors in Region Gävleborg, Sweden, will be eligible for the study from October
      2017. Patients with a history of ischemic stroke without documented atrial fibrillation
      before or during ECG evaluation in the stroke unit will be evaluated by the chest and
      thumb-ECG system Coala Heart Monitor. The monitoring system is connected to a smart phone
      application which allows for remote monitoring and prompt advice on clinical management. Over
      a period of 28 days, patients will be monitored twice daily and may activate the ECG
      recording at symptoms. Upon completion, the system is returned by mail. This system offers a
      possibility to evaluate the presence of atrial fibrillation post-stroke, but the feasibility
      of this system in patients who recently suffered from a stroke is unknown. In addition
      Health-related Quality of Life using Short Form-36 in comparison to Swedish population norms
      will be assessed. The feasibility of the Coala Heart Monitor will be assessed by a
      self-developed questionnaire.

        Patients with a clinically confirmed diagnosis of ischemic stroke will be recruited from
        the catchment area of Region Gävleborg, Sweden. Eligible patients will be identified from
        daily checks of the medical records in the stroke unit. The recruitment is planned to start
        in October 2017.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients, aged ≥18 years, with a validated diagnosis of ischemic cryptogenic stroke
             are eligible for the study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  For screening with chest and thumb-ECG, exclusion criteria are as follows: previously
             known atrial arrhythmia with an indication for anticoagulation, implantable
             defibrillator, pacemaker or insertable cardiac monitor, pregnancy, permanent
             indication for anticoagulation (including low-molecular weight heparin) due to atrial
             arrhythmia, mechanical heart valve, deep vein thrombosis, or pulmonary embolism.
             Patients with a life expectancy ≤6 months (e.g. severe heart failure New York Heart
             Association functional class IV or malignancy) are likewise excluded.
