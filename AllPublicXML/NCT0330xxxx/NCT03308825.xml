  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This multicenter, open-label, Phase IV study was designed to describe the safety and
      immunogenicity of Fluzone Quadrivalent vaccine in children 6 months to &lt; 9 years of age and
      adults 18 to &lt; 65 years of age, and to describe the safety and immunogenicity of Fluzone
      High-Dose vaccine in adults ≥ 65 years of age.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will assess the safety and immunogenicity profiles of Fluzone Quadrivalent vaccine
      in children and adults and Fluzone High-Dose vaccine in older adults. Immunogenicity outcomes
      (GMTs, GMT ratios, seroprotection, and seroconversion) will be assessed, as appropriate, on
      Day 0 (pre-vaccination) and Day 28 post-final vaccination for subjects 6 months to &lt; 9 years
      of age, and on Day 0 (pre-vaccination) and Day 21 for subjects ≥ 18 years of age. Solicited
      reactions, unsolicited non-serious adverse events, and serious adverse events will also be
      reported.

             product administration).

          -  For participants 6 to &lt; 12 months of age, born at full term of pregnancy (≥ 37 weeks)

             informed consent form has been signed and dated by parent(s) or guardian(s) for
             participants 6 months to &lt; 9 years of age.

          -  Participant and parent/guardian (of participants 6 months to &lt; 9 years of age) are
             able to attend all scheduled visits and to comply with all study procedures.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Participant is pregnant, or lactating, or of childbearing potential and not using an
             effective method of contraception or abstinence from at least 4 weeks prior to
             vaccination and until at least 4 weeks after vaccination. To be considered of
             non-childbearing potential, a female must be pre-menarche, or post- menopausal for at
             least 1 year, or surgically sterile.

          -  Participation at the time of study enrollment (or in the 30 days preceding the first
             study vaccination) or planned participation during the present study period in another
             clinical study investigating a vaccine, drug, medical device, or medical procedure.
             Note: Participants may be considered eligible for enrollment if no intervention for
             the other study occurred within the 30 days prior to the first study vaccination and
             none are planned before the participant would complete safety surveillance for the

             life-threatening reaction to study vaccine or to a vaccine containing any of the same
             substances. Note: The list of vaccine components is included in the Prescribing
             Information for each study vaccine.

          -  Thrombocytopenia, which may be a contraindication for intramuscular vaccination, at
             the discretion of the Investigator.

          -  Bleeding disorder, or receipt of anticoagulants in the 3 weeks preceding inclusion,
             contraindicating intramuscular vaccination.

          -  Deprived of freedom by an administrative or court order, or in an emergency setting,
             or hospitalized involuntarily.

          -  Current alcohol abuse or drug addiction.

          -  Chronic illness that, in the opinion of the Investigator, is at a stage where it might
             interfere with study conduct or completion.

          -  Moderate or severe acute illness/infection (according to Investigator judgment) on the
             day of planned vaccination or febrile illness (temperature ≥ 100.4°F [38.0°C]). A
             prospective participant should not be included in the study until the condition has
             resolved or the febrile event has subsided.

          -  Identified as an Investigator or employee of the Investigator or study center with
             direct involvement in the proposed study (participants ≥ 18 years of age) or
             identified as an immediate family member (i.e., parent, spouse, natural or adopted
             child) of the Investigator or employee with direct involvement in the proposed study
             (all participants).

          -  History of serious adverse reaction to any influenza vaccine.

          -  Personal history of Guillain-Barré syndrome.

          -  Any condition that in the opinion of the Investigator would pose a health risk to the
             participant if enrolled or could interfere with the evaluation of the vaccine.

             the Investigator), neurologic disorder, or seizure disorder.
