  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The patients with primary erectile dysfunction (IIEF-EF &lt;26 points), will be randomly
      assigned to three shockwave treatment protocols: Protocol 1 six sessions, one per week;
      Protocol 2, six initial sessions, one per week, followed by monthly maintenance sessions
      (every 4 weeks) for five months; Protocol 3, six monthly sessions. The EHS and IIEF-EF scores
      will be compared as well as the possible adverse events from the therapy upon beginning and
      completing the treatment and at the 3-month and 6-month follow-ups. Self-esteem and quality
      of life will also be evaluated using the SEAR scale.

    <measure>IIEF-EF score 6 months after completing the treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>6 month follow-ups</time_frame>
    <description>This is a highly sensitive and specific scale for detecting changes in erectile function in response to treatment. The degree of dysfunction is scored on a range of 0 to 30 points on the Erectile Functioning domain (questions 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 15). The categories are: severe between 0 and 10, moderate between 11 and 16, mild-to-moderate between 17 and 21, mild between 22 and 25, and no ED between 26 and 30.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Erection Hardness Score</measure>
    <time_frame>3-month and 6-month follow-ups</time_frame>
    <description>The EHS has a single Likert scale: 0 = Penis does not increase in size; 1= the penis increases in size but is not hard; 2 = the penis is hard but not hard enough for penetration; 3 = the penis is hard enough for penetration but not completely hard; 4 = the penis is completely hard and fully rigid</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Clinical improvement</measure>
    <time_frame>6-month follow-ups</time_frame>
    <description>For patients with moderate ED, a 5-point increase in the IIEF-EF score is considered improvement. For patients with mild ED a 2-point increase on this scale is considered improvement. And for those with severe ED a 7-point change is considered improvement.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of satisfactory relations</measure>
    <time_frame>3-month and 6-month follow-ups</time_frame>
    <description>According to the patient's journal records. For the purpose of this study, satisfactory relations are defined as the increase in rigidity and duration of the erection as evaluated by the patient and his partner. For patients who were not able to penetrate before treatment, satisfactory relations will include not only an increase in rigidity and duration of the erection but also the ability to penetrate.</description>

    <description>Low-intensity shock waves are acoustic wavelengths which are transmitted continuously at a frequency between 16 and 20 megahertz for under 10 microseconds. They generate a pressure pulse and transport energy as they propagate through a medium. Three different methods can be used to generate this type of wave: electro-hydraulics, electro-magnetics and piezoelectricity. Regardless of the method, when the shock waves are applied to an organ they interact with the deep tissue. This causes stress and small mechanical traumas, activating the release of angiogenic factors which induce new vascularization of the affected tissue, thereby improving blood flow.</description>
