  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Two Phase III trials showed superiority in terms of efficacy and tolerance of nivolumab in
      second-line treatment compared to docetaxel in metastatic NSCLC in the general population, so
      it is important to evaluate this treatment in PLWHIV (Patient Living With HIV) in maximum
      security conditions, taking into account their specificities and complex underlying
      immunological status. As NSCLC in PLWHIV is a rare tumour, a phase 2 trial, using DCR
      (Disease Control Rate) data, would be able to recruit a sufficient number of patients, in a
      reasonable period of time, to provide a proof of concept of the safety and efficacy of
      nivolumab in this population. Therefore, we think that an open-label, one arm phase 2 trial,
      with a rapid accrual, would be currently a crucial approach and a window of opportunity to
      explore whether nivolumab could find its place in PLWHIV with NSCLC. Such a trial is
      typically a trial for an academic sponsor, experienced in PLWHIV with NSCLC, which previously
      showed its ability to recruit patients with such a rare disease as the IFCT did with the
      IFCT-1001 CHIVA trial, testing carboplatin plus pemetrexed followed by pemetrexed.

          8. Written informed consent

          9. Patients must have adequate organ function: creatinine clearance &gt; 40 mL/min
             (Cockcroft, MDRD or CKD-Epi formula or 24h Urine Calculate creatinine clearance from a
             24h urine collection ), neutrophiles count &gt; 1500/mm3; platelets &gt; 100 000/mm3 ;
             hemoglobin &gt; 9 g/dL; hepatic enzymes &lt; 3N with total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 × ULN (upper
             limit of normal) except subjects with documented Gilbert's syndrome (≤ 5 × ULN) or
             liver metastasis, who must have a baseline total bilirubin ≤ 3.0 mg/dL

         10. Patients must receive appropriate care and treatment for HIV infection including ART
             when clinically indicated and subjects should be under the care of a physician
             experienced in HIV management. In case of recent introduction of cART and CD4 levels
             &lt;50 cells/ml, inclusion will be possible provided subjects had at least 4 weeks of
             treatment prior to inclusion, to avoid clinical type IRIS (immune inflammatory
             syndrome reconstitution). All antiretroviral treatments are allowed.

         11. Females of childbearing potential who are sexually active with a nonsterilized male
             partner must use a highly effective method of contraception for 28 days prior to the
             first dose of investigational product, and must agree to continue using such
             precautions for 6 months after the final dose of investigational product; cessation of
             contraception after this point should be discussed with the referent physician.
             Periodic abstinence, the rhythm method, and the withdrawal method are not acceptable
             methods of contraception. They must also refrain from egg cell donation for 6 months
             after the final dose of investigational product. Men receiving nivolumab and who are
             sexually active with women of childbearing potential will be instructed to adhere to
             contraception (appendix I) for a period of 31 weeks after the last dose of nivolumab.

         12. Persons deprived of liberty could be eligible because the expected benefice
             (improvement of disease control rate) justifies the foreseeable risk (adverse reaction
             of nivolumab).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Concurrent malignancies requiring active intervention

          2. Active Infection

          3. Patient with known EGFR activating tumor mutation or known ALK or ROS1 gene
             rearrangement not treated with the appropriate targeted therapy.

          4. History of immunological events related to HIV: lymphoid interstitial pneumonitis
             (LIP), non-infectious uveitis, encephalitis and other manifestations of CD8 lymphocyte
             infiltration syndrome, HIV-associated nephropathy (HIVAN).

          5. Subjects with active, known or suspected autoimmune disease. Subjects with vitiligo,
             type I diabetes mellitus, residual hypothyroidism due to autoimmune thyroiditis only
             requiring hormone replacement, or conditions not expected to recur in the absence of
             an external trigger are permitted to enroll.

          6. Active or history of inflammatory bowel disease (eg, diverticulitis, colitis, Crohn's,
             coeliac disease or other serious gastrointestinal chronic conditions associated with
             diarrhea). Note that diverticulosis is permitted.

          7. Symptomatic cerebral metastasis unless treated by brain radiotherapy which will be
             completed for at least 15 days before the beginning of the treatment; subjects with
             carcinomatous meningitis.

          8. Prior treatment with an anti-PD-1, anti-PD-L1, anti-PD-L2, anti-CTLA-4 antibody, or
             any other antibody or drug specifically targeting T-cell co-stimulation or checkpoint
             pathways.

          9. The last dose of prior chemotherapy or radiation therapy (with the exception of
             palliative radiotherapy) was received less than 3 weeks prior to inclusion;

         10. History of primary immunodeficiency, history of organ transplant that requires
             therapeutic immunosuppression and the use of immunosuppressive agents within 28 days
             of inclusion or a prior history of severe (grade 3 or 4) immune mediated toxicity from
             other immune therapy.

         11. Subjects with a condition requiring systemic treatment with either corticosteroids (&gt;
             10 mg daily prednisone equivalent) or other immunosuppressive medications within 14
             days of inclusion. Intranasal/inhaled or topical steroids, and adrenal replacement
             steroid doses ≤ 10 mg daily prednisone equivalent, are permitted in the absence of
             active autoimmune disease.

         12. Female subjects who are pregnant, breast-feeding or male or female patients of
             reproductive potential who are not employing an effective method of birth control.
