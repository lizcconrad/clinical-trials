  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability and PK of GSK2982772, in repeat
      oral doses in healthy subjects. This study is being conducted to support administration of
      higher dose levels of GSK2982772 than initially studied in the First Time in Human (FTiH)
      study. This study will also assess the impact of food during the repeat doses of GSK2982772.
      This will be a two part study; Part A and Part B. Part A (cohort 1) - single ascending dose,
      randomized, placebo-controlled, 3-way crossover. Part B (cohorts 2, 3 and 4) - repeat dose,
      randomized, placebo-controlled, sequential-group. Subjects will be randomized in 3:1 ratio to
      receive GSK2982772 or placebo in crossover manner on Day 1 of each of the three periods in
      Part A and in sequential groups for 14 days in Part B. Approximately 48 subjects will be
      included in this study. The study duration, including screening and follow-up, will not be
      expected to exceed 13 weeks for Part A and 8 weeks for Part B.
