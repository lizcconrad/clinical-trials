      This randomized trial studies how well panitumumab, leucovorin calcium, and fluorouracil
      after combination chemotherapy and panitumumab induction work in treating patients with RAS
      wild type colorectal cancer that has spread from where it started to nearby tissue or lymph
      nodes or other places in the body or cannot be removed by surgery. Monoclonal antibodies,
      such as panitumumab, may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Drugs
      used in chemotherapy, such as leucovorin calcium, fluorouracil, and oxaliplatin, work in
      different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping
      them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Giving panitumumab, leucovorin
      calcium, and fluorouracil after combination chemotherapy and panitumumab induction may work
      better in treating patients with colorectal cancer.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To compare the duration of progression free survival 1 (PFS1) in patients with RAS wild
      type who have received induction leucovorin calcium, fluorouracil, and oxaliplatin (FOLFOX) +
      panitumumab and not progressed at 6 cycles and randomized to maintenance therapy with
      fluorouracil (5FU) based therapy with or without panitumumab.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To compare the response rate (RR) in patients with RAS wild type who are randomized to
      maintenance therapy with 5FU based therapy to those randomized to 5FU based therapy with
      panitumumab.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Progress free survival 2 (PFS2). II. To assess the adverse event (AE) profile and safety
      of the proposed treatment in this population.

      III. To assess and compare the overall survival (OS) between the two treatment groups.

      IV. To compare the quality of life (QOL) as measured by health state index (HIS) between
      patients who achieve partial response (PR) versus (vs.) those who progress and those who have
      stable disease during the induction phase.

      V. To compare the QOL as measured by HSI between the two groups randomized to maintenance
      therapy.

      VI. To assess the evolution of RAS mutation under treatment during induction phase as well as
      maintenance.

      VII. To explore relationship between genomic and proteomic alterations of the tumor with
      response and PFS to panitumumab.

      OUTLINE:

      INDUCTION:

      Patients receive panitumumab intravenously (IV) over 30-60 minutes, oxaliplatin IV over 2
      hours, leucovorin calcium IV, and fluorouracil over 46-48 hours on day 1. Treatment repeats
      every 14 days for up to 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.

      MAINTENANCE: Patients who are not candidates for surgery, have no disease progression, or do
      not have complete response after Induction are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.

      ARM I: Patients receive panitumumab IV over 30 minutes, leucovorin calcium IV, and
      fluorouracil over 46-48 hours on day 1. Courses repeat every 14 days in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      ARM II: Patients receive capecitabine orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 1-21. Courses
      repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months.

          -  Metastatic or locally advanced (unresectable) colorectal cancer with histological
             confirmation of adenocarcinoma (patients with or without measurable disease by imaging
             are eligible)

          -  No prior systemic chemotherapy for metastatic disease; subjects who received adjuvant
             therapy with FOLFOX and at the time of recurrence are at least 6 months away from last
             chemotherapy are eligible for this study

          -  At the time of randomization to maintenance therapy only patients who didn't progress
             by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) criteria are eligible;
             patients with complete response (CR) and those who are candidates for resection will
             not be eligible for randomization to maintenance therapy, subjects who undergo surgery
             potentially have curable disease with defined duration of treatment and use of EGFR in
             the adjuvant setting is deemed to be detrimental in these population; likelihood of
             achieving CR is low and standard of care in this unique patient population is not well
             defined

          -  Provide written informed consent

          -  RAS wild‐type tumor

          -  Patients who are candidates for upfront metastasectomy (defined as those with limited
             liver metastatic disease) are not eligible for this study; the candidacy for

                  contraception

          -  Co‐morbid systemic illnesses or other severe concurrent disease, history of any
             psychiatric or addictive disorder, or laboratory abnormality, which, in the judgment
             of the investigator, would make the patient inappropriate for entry into this study or

             prescribed regimens

          -  Patients known to be human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) positive

          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness whom in the opinion of the investigator, may
             increase the risks associated with study participation or study treatment, or may
             interfere with the conduct of the study or the interpretation of the study results

          -  Receiving any other investigational agent, which would be considered as a treatment
             for the primary neoplasm

          -  Other active malignancy =&lt; 3 years prior to registration; exceptions are: nonmelanoma
             skin cancer or carcinoma‐in‐situ of the cervix that has been treated
