             least four years after treatment

          3. Clinical findings consistent with advanced dry AMD with evidence of one or more areas
             of &gt;250 microns of geographic atrophy (as defined in the Age-Related eye Disease Study
             [AREDS] study) involving the central fovea.

          4. GA defined as attenuation or loss of RPE as observed by biomicroscopy, OCT, and FA.

             20/200 in Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) visual acuity.

          6. The visual acuity (BCVA) of the eye that is NOT to receive the transplant will be same
             or better than the eye to receive the transplant

          7. Medically suitable to undergo vitrectomy and subretinal injection.

          8. Medically suitable for general anesthesia or waking sedation, if needed.

          9. If female and of childbearing potential, willing to medically acceptable methods of
             contraception during the study.
