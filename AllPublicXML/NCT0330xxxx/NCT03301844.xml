      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of, and patient satisfaction with
      Blephapad Combo in the treatment of posterior blepharitis.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Blepharitis is the most common condition in patients seeking an eye examination due to
      discomfort or eye irritation. Treatment of blepharitis is recommended even in mild cases as
      chronic inflammation may cause permanent damage to the Meibomian glands.

      Each eye of each patient represents an experimental unit. Each patient will apply Blephapad
      Combo to one eye and standard treatment to the other eye in accordance with the randomization
      procedure.

      The aim of this randomized, controlled study with a closed sequential design is to evaluate
      versus standard treatment the efficacy of, and patient satisfaction with Blephapad Combo in
      the treatment of posterior blepharitis.

    <description>Blephapad Combo is used to cleanse, soften, sooth and decongest inflamed eyelids and cilia.
The combo also presents an applicator with a heatable tablet that is applied to the eyelid in order to clean and open occluded Meibomian glands, thereby allowing the production of lipids necessary for a healthy tear film. The heatable tablet is to be used prior to cleansing with Blephapad wipes.</description>
