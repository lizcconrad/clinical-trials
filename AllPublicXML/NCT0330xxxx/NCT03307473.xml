  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Physical inactivity and sedentary are recognized as important risks factors for several
      diseases and total mortality. One of the main perceived barriers to physical activity is the
      lack of time and motivation. Active commuting during daily routine could overcome these
      barriers and e-bikes appears to be a promising and practical tool to meet physical activity
      guidelines.

      E-bikes are a physically active transportation mode, with a riding intensity contributing to
      activities in the moderate-intensity range (3-6 METs) for any of the assistance mode.
      Electric assistance is provided only when a rider is pedaling. The study VELONAPS mainly aims
      at investigating if real-life usage of utilitarian e-bike is associated with significant
      changes on total physical activity and sedentary patterns. During up to 4 months of free use
      of an e-bike, our purpose is to quantify its usage along with total physical activity and
      sedentary levels. We hypothesize that using an e-bike for commuting increase the total
      physical activity of at least 7.5 MET-h/week, increasing as well adherence to physical
      activity guidelines.

      During 3 months in a the geographic area of Clermont-Ferrand (France), new e-bike buyers and
      renters are invited to take part in VELONAPS study before starting to use their e-bike. The
      sample is constituted of willing participants who plan to use their e-bike, at least in part,
      for work-related and commuter trips. Each participant will be followed during 4 months, with
      4 study points.

      At T0, subjects are invited for the baseline visit including a medical interview and physical
      examination (with anthropometric measurements), and a physical stress test evaluating aerobic
      fitness (submaximal step-test). Online questionnaires are provided to measure physical
      activity and sedentary patterns (RPAQ), motivations and barriers to physical activity (EMAPS
      and BPAQ), perceived health and quality of life (SF-12), perceived exertion for common
      physical efforts (Borg scale).

      At T1 and T2 (respectively one and two months after having started e-bike use), the
      questionnaire measuring physical activity and sedentary patterns of the past month is
      requested again.

      At T4 (final study point, after 4 months of e-bike use), subjects are invited for the
      follow-up visit including anthropometric measurements and a physical stress test evaluating
      aerobic fitness. Online questionnaires are provided to measure the same dimensions than at
      the T0 study point.

      The primary endpoint of the study is to compare the physical activity level at T0 and the one
      at T4.

      Secondary endpoints are the modifications (comparisons between T0 and T4) in :

        -  sedentary levels.

        -  the percent of individuals meeting the physical activity guidelines.

        -  motivations and barriers to physical activity.

        -  perceived health and quality of life.

        -  perceived exertion for common physical efforts.

        -  anthropometric measurements (BMI and waist size). Subgroup analyses will identify either
           consistency of, of large differences, in the magnitude of e-bike use effect among
           different categories of participants: by age, by sex, by initial physical condition, and
           by initial total physical activity level.
