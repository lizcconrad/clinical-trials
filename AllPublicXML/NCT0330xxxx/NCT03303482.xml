  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background. To increase school readiness, Pre-K programs for low-income children must be
      responsive to the role of trauma in the lives of children, families, and staff. In 2017-2018,
      the School District of Philadelphia's (SDP) Office of Early Childhood Education will help
      Pre-K teachers support children's social‐emotional and behavioral health, which is essential
      for early learning, by offering teachers a professional development course called Enhancing
      Trauma Awareness (ETA).

      Purpose. To determine whether teachers who take ETA will have: 1) better work functioning; 2)
      more trusting work relationships; and 3) better health.

      Population. Pre-K classroom teachers (n=128) working in centers under SDP auspice that serve
      exclusively low-income (≤300 % of poverty) children.

      Intervention. A 12-week professional development course—Enhancing Trauma Awareness—will
      delivered by Lakeside Global Institute in 6 group sessions, with 16 teachers per group and
      each session lasting 2.5 hours.

      Design. Consenting teachers will be randomly assigned by classroom (lead teacher and/or
      assistant teacher) to receive the ETA course in either fall 2017 (intervention groups) or
      spring 2018 (wait-list control groups).

      Data collection and analysis. An external evaluation team (Temple University) will administer
      a confidential, online survey to all 128 teachers in fall 2017 (before fall course), winter
      2017 (after fall course), and spring 2018 (after spring course). Teacher-children
      relationship quality will be the a priori primary outcome, and secondary outcomes will be
      assessed across the domains of work functioning, trust, and health.

    <intervention_model_description>The investigators will randomly assign consenting teachers by classroom (lead teacher and/or assistant teacher) to either the fall or spring course (intervention and waitlist control groups, respectively). The course will be taught to groups of 16 teachers, with four groups in the fall course (64 teachers) and four in the spring course (64 teachers). To determine the impacts of the training intervention on those assigned to the fall course (intervention groups), those assigned to the spring course (control groups) will serve as concurrent controls during the fall.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>The trauma awareness professional development course is delivered in a small group (up to 16 participants; 2.5 hours every other week over 12 weeks). The course provides an environment for professionals to explore in depth the complex nature of trauma, while also recognizing and emphasizing the highly sensitive nature of trauma that is essential to becoming trauma-informed. The course facilitates a heightened awareness and appreciation for trauma-related behaviors and consequences that influence relationships and systems and that persist across generations.</description>
