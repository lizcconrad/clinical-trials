    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, non-controlled, non-randomized study to investigate the long-lasting
      radiolabeled somatostatin analogue based peptide receptor radionuclide therapy and evaluation
      safety and dosimetry of 177Lu-DOTA-EB-TATE in patients with advanced metastatic
      neuroendocrine tumors. A single dose of 0.50GBq-0.70GBq (13.5-18.9 mCi) of 177Lu-DOTA-EB-TATE
      will be injected intravenously. and monitored at 2, 24, 72,120 and 168 hours post-injection
      with semiquantitative method based on quantitative single-photon emission computed
      tomography/computed tomography (SPECT/CT) performance.

    <textblock>
      Neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) are a heterogeneous group of neoplasms that can develop anywhere
      in the body and arise from neuroendocrine cells throughout the endocrine system. The most
      recent NCCN guidelines for unresectable and metastatic NET recommend somatostatin analogues
      as first-line treatment, but do not recommend a particular treatment sequence for the
      remaining therapies. Radiolabeled somatostatin analogue therapy, also known as peptide
      receptor radionuclide therapy has become a well-accepted treatment for patients with well to
      moderately differentiated unresectable or metastatic NETs and disease progression after
      first-line treatment. However, a major problem in the therapeutic use of 177Lu-Dotatate has
      been its short half-life and fast rate of clearance. This study was designed to investigate
      the safety, dosimetry and preliminary effects of a long-lasting radiolabeled somatostatin
      analogue 177Lu-DOTA-EB-TATE in patients with advanced metastatic neuroendocrine tumors.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Adults who had neuroendocrine tumors and had metastasized, that were with
             histologically confirmed, inoperable and had showed disease progression according to
             Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors [RECIST]. Tumors were with
             well-differentiated histologic features and a Ki67 index of 0 to 20%. Target tumors
             were selected from CT, MRI, and 68Ga-DOTA-TATE PET/CT, with confirmed somatostatin
             receptor-expressing and at least one lesion has higher uptake than that of normal
             liver parenchyma on 68Ga-DOTA-TATE PET imaging within 1 weeks.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  The exclusion criteria were a serum creatinine level of more than 150 μmol per liter,
             baseline measured GFR of less than 50 mL/min/1.73 m2, determined by 99mTc-DTPA renal
             function examination, a hemoglobin level of less than 8.0 g/dl, a white-cell count of
             less than 2.0× 109/L, a platelet count of less than 75 × 109/L, a total bilirubin
             level of more than 3 times the upper limit of the normal range and a serum albumin
             level of more than 3.0 g per deciliter, cardiac insufficiency including carcinoid
             heart valve disease, a severe allergy or hypersensitivity to radiographic contrast
             material, claustrophobia, and pregnancy or breastfeeding.
