  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Nine to 30% of the population suffers from gastro-esophageal reflux disease (GERD) -
      suggestive symptoms (heartburn, regurgitation, chest pain, chronic couch, sore throat).
      Proton pump inhibitor (PPI) is usually the first line treatment. However 20 to 60% of
      patients have persistent symptoms on proton pump inhibitor. Complementary examinations are
      then required to determine the cause of persistent symptoms (non compliance to treatment,
      persistent esophageal acid exposure despite proton pump inhibitor, non acid reflux, reflux
      hypersensitivity, functional symptoms, rumination syndrome…). The gold standard to detect
      reflux episodes in patients on proton pump inhibitor therapy is 24-h ambulatory esophageal
      pH-impedance monitoring. Esophageal High Resolution Impedance-Manometry might help to
      determine gastro-esophageal reflux disease mechanisms especially when performed post
      prandially. Further some publications demonstrated that the number of reflux episodes
      detected during the post prandial period might be well correlated to the total number of
      reflux episodes recorded during 24 h.

      The hypothesis of this study is that 1-hour post prandial esophageal High Resolution
      Impedance-Manometry might be useful to diagnose gastro-esophageal reflux disease and can
      replace in some instances 24-h esophageal pH-impedance monitoring. Therefore the aim is to
      compare the number of reflux episodes detected with esophageal High Resolution
      Impedance-Manometry performed during 1-h post prandial period to the total number of reflux
      episodes detected during 24-h ambulatory esophageal pH-impedance monitoring.

    <description>Esophageal high resolution impedance manometry (HRIM) consists of introducing a transnasal probe to record esophageal contractility (manometry), bolus transit (impedance) but also the occurrence of reflux episodes. Ambulatory 24-h pH-impedance monitoring consists of recording the occurrence of reflux episodes by introducing a transnasal catheter into the esophagus. After inserting the transnasal HRIM probe and the pH-impedance catheter, both HRIM and 24-h pH-impedance recordings are started. The patient is instructed to eat a meal that induces reflux symptoms (the patient brings his own meal). One hour the end of the meal, the HRIM probe is removed. The patient is discharged at home and the 24-h pH-impedance monitoring is continued. The patient is coming back 24-h after catheter insertion to stop the pH-impedance recording and remove the catheter.</description>
