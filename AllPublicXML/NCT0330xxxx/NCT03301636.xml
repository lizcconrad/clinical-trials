  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an adaptive clinical trial that includes a dose escalation phase followed by a
      randomized controlled Phase 3 trial. The purpose of the dose escalation phase is to establish
      the Phase 3 dose of indoximod in combination with pembrolizumab or nivolumab in subjects with
      unresectable or metastatic melanoma and evaluate PK. Subsequently the efficacy, safety and
      tolerability of indoximod plus pembrolizumab or nivolumab versus placebo plus pembrolizumab
      or nivolumab will be studied in subjects with unresectable or metastatic melanoma in the
      Phase 3 portion of the trial.
