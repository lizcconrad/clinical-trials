    <textblock>
      In the stage of registration study, our purpose is to find out the safety range of activated
      coagulation time level in cerebral aneurysm and arteriovenous malformations with hybrid
      operation.

      This study is divided into anticoagulation program in cerebral aneurysm with hybrid operation
      and anticoagulation program in cerebral arteriovenous malformations with hybrid operation two
      parts, and each part divide into two stage, on the stage of registration study. This study is
      a multi-center, single-blind, prospective cohort study. Record the patient's intraoperative
      activated coagulation time Changes in detail, to observe the effect of activated coagulation
      time maintenance level on hemorrhage event rate of Intraoperative and postoperative 48 hours,
      purpose to find out the safety range of activated coagulation time level in cerebral aneurysm
      and arteriovenous malformations with hybrid operation. On the stage of randomized controlled
      study. This study is a multicenter, single-blind, prospective, randomized controlled study.
      Patients is divided into intraoperative standard dose group of Heparin Sodium and low dose
      group of Heparin Sodium randomly. To observe the effect of different anticoagulation regimens
      on activated coagulation time safety coverage rate during surgery, and finally develop a
      scientific and effective intraoperative anticoagulant therapy program.
