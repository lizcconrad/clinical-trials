    <textblock>
      This study intends to investigate the changes in gait pattern in adult spinal deformity (ASD)
      patients with sagittal imbalance. It will investigate the gait kinematics in patients who
      have a mismatch of their spinopelvic parameters, and a positive sagittal balance. The
      investigators hypothesise that patients with abnormal spinopelvic parameters may demonstrate
      a pathological gait pattern.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      With an ageing population, ASD presents as a significant health issue with increasing
      incidence. Most of the earlier literature concentrated on radiographic measurements of the
      deformity in the coronal plane, and its surgical correction. However, recent publications
      have demonstrated that sagittal spinopelvic alignment plays a critical role in pain and
      disability in patients with ASD, and is a primary determinant of health related quality of
      life measures. There is substantial evidence that restoration of these parameters after
      spinal reconstructive surgery is correlated with good clinical outcome.

      Maintenance of the ideal sagittal alignment allows an individual to maintain an erect posture
      with minimal energy expenditure. When there is progressive loss of lumbar lordosis,
      compensatory mechanisms involving the pelvis, hips and knees occur to extend adjacent
      segments of the kyphotic spine to allow for compensation of anterior translation of the axis
      of gravity. However, this compensatory mechanism may potentially result in adverse effect.
      One of the main disabilities in ASD patients with sagittal imbalance is their decreased
      walking tolerance. The change in the spinal alignment along with these compensatory
      mechanisms may result in an inefficient gait worsening their walking tolerance.

      Few studies in the literature have investigated the changes in gait pattern in patients with
      sagittal imbalance. Of those, the patient group was heterogeneous, and the only criterion of
      sagittal imbalance was a positive sagittal vertical axis (SVA), which the investigators now
      know is not a complete assessment of the sagittal alignment. The investigators propose to
      study the change in gait pattern in individuals with abnormal spinopelvic parameters, and how
      this may affect their quality of lives.
