  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Double blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial of human recombinant hyaluronidase
      injections in individuals with post-stroke upper limb muscle stiffness. Fifty individuals
      with post-stroke hemiparesis, with moderately-severe muscle stiffness, between 6 months and 3
      years will be randomized to receive either hyaluronidase plus saline (treatment arm, n=25) or
      normal saline (control arm, n=25) injections. Both the assessors and the patients will be
      blind to group assignment. All patients will be assessed at three time points: (1)
      pre-injection, (2) 1-2 weeks post-injection, and (3) 12-14 weeks post-injection. Assessments
      will be performed pre-injection and 1-2 weeks post-injection for joint range of motion,
      muscle strength by EMG MVC, upper limb motor impairment and function, stretch reflex testing,
      shear wave elastography, and muscle MRI, and 12-14 weeks post-injection for all assessments
      except muscle MRI

      Aim 1: To test the effect of hyaluronidase injections on upper limb motor outcomes; Aim 2: To
      evaluate the effect of hyaluronidase injections on non-neural and neural components of muscle
      stiffness; Aim 3. To determine the effect of hyaluronidase on intramuscular GAG content by
      proton T1p relaxation mapping on muscle MRI.

    <description>tool that can be used to systematically and thoroughly assess mental status. It is an 11-question measure that tests five areas of cognitive function: orientation, registration, attention and calculation, recall, and language. The maximum score is 30. A score of 23 or lower is indicative of cognitive impairment. The MMSE takes only 5-10 minutes to administer and is therefore practical to use repeatedly and routinely.</description>
