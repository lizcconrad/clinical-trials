      This project with PCOS patients include an assessment of quality of life and sexuality in
      naïve patients.

      Hypothesizing that PCOS women would show higher rates of psychological alterations, this
      study is aimed to investigate the association between polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) and
      psychological disturbances, including anger and to analyze whether the
      biochemical/phenotypical features of PCOS may play a role in the type and severity of
      psychological disorders.

    <description>The authors will select 30 PCOS patients who met the more strict and conservative Rotterdam diagnostic criteria (Rotterdam phenotype A) which include the presence of oligo-anovulation (cycles lasting &gt;35 days or amenorrhea) and hyperandrogenemia /hyperandrogenism (hirsutism or obvious acne or pronounced alopecia). All patients should have bilateral polycystic ovaries morphology on ultrasound. Additionally, the authors have decided to enroll PCOS patients that are all without pregnancy desire at the moment they fill out the questionnaires, in order to control for the potential confounding role of infertility on psychological outcomes. Different pituitary, adrenal, ovarian, thyroid or metabolic diseases will be excluded</description>

    <arm_group_label>2/CONTROL</arm_group_label>
    <description>The authors will enroll a control group of 30 women, age- matched with the PCOS women, from consecutive women controlled in the same outpatient clinic who met the following inclusion criteria: history of irregular menstrual cycle in absence of severe gynecologic and non-gynecologic diseases. This PCOS sample will be entirely constituted by women with no pregnancy desire; therefore, with the aim to limit the potential effect of the unfulfilled wish to conceive in the final results; additionally, infertile women will not admitted into the control group.</description>
