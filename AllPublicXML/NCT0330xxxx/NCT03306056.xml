    <textblock>
      The main purpose of this study is to compare the effects of whole-body electromyostimulation
      versus a conventional low-volume strength-training program, each combined with an
      individualized, weight-reducing diet, on the cardiometabolic risk profile, muscle strength,
      body composition, inflammatory markers and subjective health outcomes in overweight
      individuals at increased cardiometabolic risk.
