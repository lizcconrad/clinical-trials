  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of the study is to reveal the acquired resistance mechanism of the first and
      second generation Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor-Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitor (EGFR-TKI) in
      tissue and plasma using Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) and the difference of ctDNA in
      plasma and DNA in biopsy samples is compared and the consistency of two samples was observed.
      At the same time, the sensitivity, specificity and the consistency of detecting T790M
      mutation using ddPCR, Cobas and NGS were compared.

    <textblock>
      With the deepening of the concept of tumor management, it is necessary to monitor the
      patient's gene during the course of treatment, especially in patients with acquired
      resistance of the first generation EGFR-TKI. Re-biopsy can effectively provide tissue samples
      as a &quot;gold standard&quot; for gene detection samples. While, the plasma circulating tumor DNA
      (ctDNA) detection is an important sample of gene detection and the treatment when tissue
      samples cannot be assessed. However, due to tumor heterogeneity and ctDNA detection technique
      sensitivity, plasma ctDNA and tissue samples of the test results are inconsistent. Therefore,
      the difference between re-biopsy tissue samples and plasma ctDNA samples will provide strong
      evidence for the application of plasma ctDNA in TKI-resistant patients.

      The study was designed as a prospective and single center study. Fifty patients will be
      enrolled into the study and the clinical data of patients, including smoke history, cancer
      history, location, pathology, gene mutation status and so on of the first biopsy samples will
      be collected and recorded in a case report form. For patients recruited in the study, lesions
      which were assessed as progressive disease(PD) will be obtained by interventional pulmonology
      technology. And about 20ml peripheral blood will be collected at the same time. The tissue
      will be divided into two parts, one part was sent to Pathology Department of Shanghai Chest
      Hospital and will be processed with paraffin-embedded, and for those diagnosed NSCLC, the
      other part will be extracted with DNA and performed NGS for the qualified DNA sample and
      using Cobas to detect the T790M mutation. The matched peripheral blood will also be extracted
      with DNA and performed NGS and ddPCR.
