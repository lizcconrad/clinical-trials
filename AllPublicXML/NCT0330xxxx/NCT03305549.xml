      The Recovery After Dialysis-Requiring Acute Kidney Injury (RAD-AKI) Pilot Study is a 2-arm
      randomized clinical trial of hospitalized patients with dialysis-requiring acute kidney
      injury (RAD-AKI), comparing conventional thrice-weekly intermittent hemodialysis dialysis
      (control) to a &quot;conservative dialysis strategy&quot; in which hemodialysis is not continued unless
      specific metabolic or clinical indications for RRT are present. The overall hypothesis is
      that the current practice of thrice-weekly acute intermittent hemodialysis for AKI-D masks
      evidence of renal recovery and may actually delay or preclude recovery. The primary objective
      of this pilot study is to assess the safety and feasibility of the proposed intervention and
      study design.

    <textblock>
      The recent landmark Artificial Kidney Initiation in Kidney Injury (AKIKI) trial showed that a
      delayed strategy for RRT initiation among patients with incident stage 3 AKI - in which RRT
      was delayed unless specific metabolic or clinical indications for RRT were present - was safe
      and averted the need for RRT in nearly half of the critically ill participants, in comparison
      to an early RRT initiation strategy. The hypothesis for this study is: for prevalent patients
      with established AKI-D, a conservative dialysis strategy - in which hemodialysis is not
      continued unless specific metabolic or clinical indications for RRT are present - will
      shorten time to RRT-independence and improve the likelihood of renal recovery.

      The RAD-AKI Pilot Study is a 2-arm randomized clinical trial of hospitalized patients with
      dialysis-requiring acute kidney injury (RAD-AKI) that will compare conventional thrice-weekly
      intermittent hemodialysis dialysis (control) to a &quot;conservative dialysis strategy.&quot; The
      primary objective of this pilot study is to assess the safety and feasibility of the proposed
      intervention and study design.
