      The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the efficacy of fasinumab compared to
      placebo, when administered for up to 24 weeks in patients with osteoarthritis (OA) of the
      knee or hip.

      The secondary objectives of the study are: to evaluate the efficacy of fasinumab compared to
      non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID)s, when administered for up to 24 weeks in
      patients with OA of the knee or hip; to assess the safety and tolerability of fasinumab
      compared to placebo and compared to NSAIDs, when administered for up to 24 weeks in patients
      with OA of the knee or hip
