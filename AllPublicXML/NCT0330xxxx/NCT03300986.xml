  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to look at how changes to a person's functional electrical stimulation might
      change how they walk. Functional electrical stimulation (FES) is commonly used to help people
      with foot drop from upper motor neurone conditions such as stroke or multiple sclerosis. This
      group of people have muscle weakness which makes it difficult to lift the foot, which causes
      trips and falls.

      FES reduces foot drop by using a portable device to apply short electrical pulses to the
      nerve which lifts the foot. The FES device stimulates this nerve only during the swing phase,
      when the foot is off the floor. Typically this is achieved by using a foot-switch, which
      detects when the heel leaves the floor. Stimulation begins a short interval of time after the
      heel leaves the floor, ramps up from zero to set stimulation for the individual, and at
      another period of time after the heel hits the floor, stimulation ramps down from set amount
      to zero. There are four time intervals described here which can be varied by the clinician on
      the device:-

        -  Delay (the time between heel lift and the start of stimulation)

        -  Ramp up (the time for stimulation to reach full strength)

        -  Extension (the time between heel strike and the ramp down)

        -  Ramp down (the time for stimulation to reach zero from full strength) These intervals
           are usually set by experienced clinicians using a qualitative assessment of the
           patient's walking and trial-and-error. A literature review has found no published
           studies which compare walking with different timing. This knowledge would be useful for
           clinicians, who could use this information as a starting point in finding the best
           timing parameters for each patient.
