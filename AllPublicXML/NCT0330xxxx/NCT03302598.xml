  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A prospective study of 40 patients admitted with the diagnosis of enterocutaneous fistula and
      prepared for definite surgical repair in the form of resection anastomosis of ECF. The
      investigators used preoperative serum C-reactive protein as predicting factor to recurrence
      and independent variable for timing of surgery.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There is a controversy in timing of operation. The timing depends on clinical assessment,
      laboratory tests and radiological investigations. The cornerstone of this decision is to
      control sepsis and inflammatory condition before surgery. This issue made surgeons favor
      longer interval between incidence of ECF and definite surgical treatment. In some cases there
      may be a hidden place for infection or continuation of the inflammatory situation without
      clear signs, which necessitated the presence of a possible indicator helps in making the
      surgical decision. Serum C-reactive protein is the common inflammatory marker used to exclude
      inflammatory condition. Although its level is within normal range but some cases showed high
      recurrence rate when the level exceeded certain as the investigators believed in their study.
      Now the investigators can say that the perioperative serum C-reactive protein level can be
      used as an objective parameter for helping to make surgical decision and reduce recurrence of
      ECF.

    <description>the investigator will measure the preoperative C-reactive protein in cases of ECF which are scheduled for operative treatment . The level of c-reactive protein will be measured in the postoperative recurrent cases . we aim to find a relation between perioperative level of C-reactive protein and recurrence of ECF so it can help surgeon to choose proper time for surgical treatment to avoid recurrence of ECF</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  patients with ECF were included in the study

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Cases submitted for surgical treatment with protecting stoma or terminal were excluded
             from our study. Other fistulas like perianal, pancreatic, biliary and internal
             fistulas were not involved due to their different nature, treatment and prognosis
