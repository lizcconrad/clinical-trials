  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The emergence of adult psychic disorders occurs in about three quarters of cases before 25
      years. The Pass-Aje service of Clermont-Ferrand University Hospital is a psychiatric unit
      specializing in the management of disorders of young adults. This unit evaluates the first
      episodes among the diversity of the clinical presentations of the psychic disorders. Suicidal
      attempts or ideations account for a large part of the reasons for entering the unit and are
      found transversely in many disorders. Among the reasons for hospitalization are a wide
      variety of situations that are not initially associated with an accurate diagnosis such as
      withdrawal, de-schooling, runaways, behavioral disorders (disorders of social interactions,
      self and hetero aggression, eating disorders).

      Investigator propose to study the psychiatric outcome of hospitalized patients in the
      Pass-Aje unit and their psychosocial evolution in order to compare them with the data of the
      general population and to identify the factors influencing their future.
