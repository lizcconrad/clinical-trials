  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this trial is to evaluate the effect of avacopan treatment on renal disease
      activity in patients with complement component 3 glomerulopathy (C3G).
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      C3 glomerulopathy (C3G) is characterized by evidence of alternative complement activation
      based on C3 deposition in the glomeruli. There are two forms of the disease: dense deposit
      disease (DDD) and C3 glomerulonephritis (C3GN). There is no approved treatment for patients
      with C3G.

      This is a randomized, double blind, placebo controlled Phase 2 study to evaluate the safety
      and efficacy of avacopan (CCX168) in patients with C3G. The primary objective is to evaluate
      the efficacy of avacopan compared to placebo based on histologic changes in kidney biopsies
      taken before and during treatment.

          1. Biopsy-proven C3G, either DDD or C3GN, with or without a renal transplant, and with
             the following observations upon renal biopsy taken within 12 weeks prior to screening
             or during screening:

               1. â‰¥2-levels of magnitude greater staining of C3 than any combination of IgG, IgM,
                  IgA, kappa and lambda light chains, and C1q by immunohistochemistry, and

               2. evidence of proliferative glomerulonephritis (mesangial hypercellularity of
                  greater than 3 mesangial cells per mesangial area and/or endocapillary
                  hypercellularity defined as an increased number of cells within glomerular
                  capillary lumina, causing luminal narrowing) based on light microscopy, and

               3. confirmation of the presence of electron dense deposits in the glomeruli on
                  electron microscopy corresponding with the C3 immunofluorescence positivity;

             have experienced menarche and who is not permanently sterile or postmenopausal,
             defined as at least 12 consecutive months with no menses without an alternative
             medical cause) may participate if adequate contraception is used during, and for at
             least the three months after study completion; Male subjects with partners of
             childbearing potential may participate in the study if they had a vasectomy at least 6

             history, physical examination, and clinical laboratory assessments. Subjects with
             clinical laboratory values that are outside of normal limits (other than those
             specified in the Exclusion Criteria) and/or with other abnormal clinical findings that
             are judged by the Investigator not to be of clinical significance, may be entered into

             virus (HIV) viral screening test indicative of acute or chronic infection;

          8. Evidence of tuberculosis based on interferon Î³ release assay (IGRA), tuberculin
             purified protein derivative (PPD) skin test, or chest radiography done at screening or
             within 6 weeks prior to screening;

             phenobarbital, phenytoin, rifampin, or St. John's wort;

         12. Known hypersensitivity to avacopan or inactive ingredients of the avacopan capsules
             (including gelatin, polyethylene glycol, or Cremophor) or inability to swallow the
             capsules;

         13. Participated in any clinical study of an investigational product within 30 days prior
             to screening or within 5 half-lives after taking the last dose; and
