    <textblock>
      Conduct a randomized control study to compare the tolerance of 4% chlorhexidine gluconate/4%
      isopropyl alcohol versus povidone iodine vaginal cleansing solutions for surgical
      preparations of the vagina. Patients will be randomized to either control (povidone iodine)
      or experimental (chlorhexidine gluconate), and then be given a short survey prior to and
      immediately after surgery, and again 24-48 hours via phone asking them about the presence and
      severity of vaginal dryness, burning, itchiness, unusual vaginal discharge, and pain or
      burning with urination.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Surgical site antisepsis is critical in preventing surgical site infections. Although
      chlorhexidine gluconate has proven to be superior to povidone iodine for surgical site
      antisepsis, povidone iodine is the only FDA-approved antiseptic solution for surgical
      preparation of the vagina. Many surgeons are hesitant to use chlorhexidine gluconate for
      preoperative vaginal cleansing due to the alcohol dissolvent present in the solutions that is
      implicated in a greater risk of irritation. Yet, there has been no randomized study to
      illustrate whether the risk of vaginal irritation is greater in chlorhexidine gluconate
      versus povidone iodine. Thus, the purpose of the study is to conduct a randomized control
      trial to compare the tolerance of 4% chlorhexidine gluconate to povidone iodine using
      patient-reported outcomes of vaginal or urinary symptoms. Patients will be randomized to
      either control or experimental, and then be given a short survey prior to and immediately
      after surgery, and again 24-48 hours via phone asking them about the presence and severity of
      vaginal dryness, burning, itchiness, unusual vaginal discharge, and pain or burning with
      urination.
