  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this trial is to explore the clinical utility of two investigational agents in
      patients with advanced cancer.

      This is a multi-center, open-label Phase I/Ib study. The study consists of four dose
      escalation parts and two dose expansion parts testing LHC165 as a single agent or LHC165 in
      combination with PDR001. The dose escalation parts will estimate the Maximum Tolerated Dose
      (MTD) and/or Recommended Dose for Expansion (RDE) and test two different dosing schedules for
      LHC165.

      The dose expansion parts of the study will use the MTD/RDE for each the LHC165 single agent
      and in combination with PDR001, determined in the respective dose escalation parts to assess
      the activity, safety and tolerability of LHC165 as a single agent or LHC165 in combination
      with PDR001 in patients with specific types of solid tumors.

      Approximately 206 adult patients with advanced solid tumors will be enrolled.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase I/Ib, multi-center, open-label study to characterize the safety,
      tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK), pharmacodynamics (PD), and preliminary antitumor
      activity of LHC165 single agent and in combination with the Programmed Cell Death Protein-1
      (PD-1) checkpoint inhibitor PDR001. Two different dosing schedules will be explored for
      LHC165 single agent and in combination with PDR001 resulting in four dose escalation groups
      in accessible tumors. The first dose escalation group will receive LHC165 via intratumoral
      injection on Days 1 and 15 of Cycles 1, 2, 5, and 6. If biological activity is seen in the
      LHC165 single agent group on the biweekly dosing schedule, another dose escalation group
      using a monthly dosing schedule will be opened where patients will receive LHC165 via
      intratumoral injection on Day 1 of Cycles 1, 2, 5, and 6. In addition, once two safe doses
      are observed in the LHC165 single agent group on the biweekly dosing schedule, an LHC165
      combination with PDR001 dose escalation group will be opened using the biweekly dosing
      schedule. If biological activity is seen in the LHC165 combination with PDR001 group on the
      biweekly dosing schedule, another dose escalation group for the combination using a monthly
      dosing schedule will be opened.

      Once the recommended dose for the LHC165 single agent and in combination with PDR001 is
      identified, the respective expansion parts of the study will open.
