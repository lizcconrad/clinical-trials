  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase I single-site study to evaluate the irritation potential of topically applied
      ATx201 GEL, 2% and 4%, along with positive and negative control and placebo control (ATx201
      GEL Placebo), in healthy human subjects on intact and abraded skin. Approximately thirty-six
      (36) healthy adult subjects will receive all the test articles to provide for 30 subjects to
      complete the study. The test articles will be applied to the upper back of the subjects
      during the study, and the placement of the test articles will be randomized. Abraded skin
      will be induced using sequential tape stripping.
