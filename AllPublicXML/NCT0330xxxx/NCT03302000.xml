  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Introduction: Prematurity has been more frequent in industrialized countries, which is a risk
      factor for delay in child development. Delays in the development of visual system could be
      highlighted. However, studies that evaluate or stimulate the visual system in preterm infant
      (PT) at an early age and hospitalized in a neonatal unit care (NUC) are scarce.

      Objective: To compare visual acuity of PT and full term (FT) infants. In addition, to verify
      the effect of the early visual stimulation in this population.

      Methods: Non-probabilistic sample of PT assessed at NICU and full-term infants, aged between
      0 and 3 months. A visual acuity assessment will be performed with the ML Leonhardt Battery of
      Optotypes Visual Acuity Cards. Afterwards, a visual stimulation with High Contrast Figures
      will be performed. In addition, a post-stimulation evaluation will be performed with the same
      measure. Also evaluation after 30 days of interventions will be applied with visual acuity
      test and, also, Sensory Profile Scale (SPS) and Alberta Infant Motor Scale (AIMS). The study
      variables will be alertness, attention, fixation, visual tracking, spatial frequency, scores
      of SPS and AIMS. The data will be analyzed according to their distribution of normality. A
      significance level of 5% will be adopted.

    <description>Visual acuity will be assessed with ML Leonhardt Battery of Optotypes (MLLBOS) scale. MLLBOS consists of 8 visual carts, with high-contrast visual images of 12X12cm. The scale evaluates alertness, attention, fixation and visual tracking (LEONHARDT et al., 2012). The evaluation will be recorded by a digital video camera. The camera will be positioned fixed to the infant's face.</description>

    <description>Infant Sensory Profile Scale (SPS) is a 125 item, norm-referenced, parent-report questionnaire. Sensory processing is divided in six items: general processing, auditory processing, visual processing, tactile processing, vestibular processing and oral sensory processing.</description>

    <time_frame>change measure (first day - baseline; after 7, 14, 21 and 28 days of intervention at home)</time_frame>
    <description>Motor development will be assessed with Alberta Infant Motor Scale (AIMS). AIMS is composed of 58 figures distributed in four different positions: prone (21), supine (9), sitting (12) and standing (17), which can be used in children from birth to 18 months of age. The total score of the test is given by the sum of the subtotals obtained for each subscale.
From this representation will be obtained the percentile that represents the motor development of the evaluated child. The referred percentile ranges from 5th, 10th, 25th, 50th, 75th and 90th. The scale presents scores, percentiles and motor performance categorization in: normal (&gt; 25%); suspect (between 25 and 5%); abnormal (&lt;5%).</description>

    <description>Early visual stimulation (EVS) will be implemented by physioteraphist. Nine high contrast figures will be used. Figures will be moved in vertical, horizontal and circular directions. Figures are black and white. One card is composed by a face coloured in yellow and red.
At home: the parents will receive training to do visual stimulation at home. For 30 days, 10-minute time each day. Once a week the physiotherapist will visit infant in order to verify the presence of any doubts about the EVS.</description>
