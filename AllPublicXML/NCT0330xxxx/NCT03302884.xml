      Prospective multicentre assay to assess ctDNA value for ovarian cancer monitoring and disease
      recurrence after front-line treatment.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The main objective is to explore the capacity of ctDNA to be an early marker of ovarian
      carcinoma recurrence after front-line treatments, i.e. to show significant modifications
      before clinical diagnosis of disease relapse.

      Prospective multicentre open-label study

      During visits in the frame of management of the disease, blood samples will be collected at
      diagnosis, after each cycle of eventual neoadjuvant chemotherapy, every 6 months during the
      following 2 years, and every year during the remainin time of follow-up. Tumor samples will
      be collected at surgery or through a biopsy.

      Patients will then have a standard care follow-up for a period of 5 years.

             carcino-ma, without previous treatment for ovarian malignancy.

          2. Indication of preoperative and/or adjuvant chemotherapy.

          3. Age â‰¥ 18 years old.

          4. Patient affiliated to the ''National security'' regimen or beneficiary of this regimen

          5. Signed written informed consent prior to any screening procedures being performed

        Non inclusion Criteria:

          1. Contraindication to surgical assessment.

          2. Pathological diagnosis of mucinous carcinoma.

          3. History of concurrent malignancy or malignancy within 5 years before study enrollment,
