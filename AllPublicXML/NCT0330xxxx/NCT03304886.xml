      Purpose of the study is to assess the diagnostic accuracy of an on- line questionnaire in
      comparison to a semi-structured interview administered by a trained interviewer.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The worldwide current gold standard for diagnosing headaches is the International
      Classification of Headache Disorders (ICHD 3 beta). Adhering strictly to ICHD criteria has
      been problematic for accurately diagnosing patients in the clinic and as for clinical trials.
      To address these issues, an online instrument was developed that successfully diagnosis
      common primary and secondary headache disorders. In this research Investigator hopes to
      demonstrate an on- line questionnaire is non inferior to a semi-structured interview for
      accurately diagnosing different types of headaches (for example: episodic migraine vs. non
      episodic migraine, chronic migraine vs. non chronic migraine, episodic tension-type vs.
      non-episodic tension type, chronic tension-type headache vs. non chronic tension-type
      headache, medication overuse headache vs. non medication overuse headache, post traumatic
      headache vs. non post traumatic headache).

      Participants will be screened by telephone to see if participants meet the criteria for
      taking part in this research study. Once participant is deemed eligible,the participants will
      then be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to complete either the semi-structured interview over the
      phone first and then complete the online questionnaire or vice versa. Study is expected to
      enroll 500 participants with headache and healthy controls.

    <description>An on- line questionnaire is non inferior to a semi-structured interview for accurately diagnosing episodic migraine vs non episodic migraine, chronic migraine vs. non chronic migraine. We will compare the 4 primary (chronic and episodic migraine, chronic and episodic tension-type headache) obtained on each of the two evaluations for reliability using recognized statistical tools: This analysis will be conducted by independent reviewers, not the developers of either instrument</description>
