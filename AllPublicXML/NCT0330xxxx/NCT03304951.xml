    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Investigator has determined that the potential study subject has moderate to severe
             chronic rhino sinusitis with ethmoid involvement and has failed medical therapy prior
             to enrollment.

          -  Age ≥22 years The potential study subject meets the American Academy of
             Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery (AAO-HNS) criteria for chronic rhino sinusitis
             (Rosenfeld, et al, 2007)

          -  12 weeks or longer of two or more o f the following signs and symptoms:

               -  Mucopurulent drainage (anterior, posterior or both)

               -  Nasal Obstruction (congestion)

               -  Facial pain-pressure-fullness, or

               -  Decreased sense of smell and Inflammation si documents by one or more of the
                  following findings:

               -  Purulent (not clear) mucus or edema in the middle meatus or ethmoid region

               -  Polyps in nasal cavity or the middle meatus, and/or

               -  Radiographic imaging showing inflammation of the paranasal sinuses

          -  SNOT-20 total raw score ≥ 41

          -  Non-Contrast CT scan (coronal view) confirms depth of olfactory fossa is Keros
             classification 1or 2 (Gauba, Sleh, Dua, Agarwal, Ell, &amp; Vize, 2006)

          -  The potential study subject is capable of understanding and executing written informed
             consent (IC)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Sinus opacification score of ≤ 8 or ≥ 18 measured using the CT derived Lund-Mackay
             scoring system

          -  Isolated sinus disease evident on Non-Contrast CT scan that would unlikely to respond
             to target ethmoid treatment (e.g., isolated sphenoid or frontal disease).

          -  Polyposis scored as 3 using the Modified Lund-Kennedy Score as follows:

             3 = Polyps completely obstructing the nose

          -  Prior ocular and/or sinus surgery that alter the boney anatomy or violate/enter the
             orbit or sinus (i.e. Fess, balloon sinuplasty). Minor procedures such as septoplasty
             or turbinectomy are not exclusions.

          -  Prior surgical history, physical exam, nasal endoscopy, and /or imaging studies that
             suggest significant craniofacial deformity (such as facial anatomic abnormality from
             surgical intervention, trauma, and congenital or any other cause thus prohibiting
             adequate placement of the Sinopsys® Lacrimal Stent).

          -  Presence of a sinonasal encepholocele as determined by Non-Contrast CT scan.

          -  Presence of active HEENT infection including acute dacryocystitis, with the exception
             of baseline CRS (Chronic Rhinosinusitis) infection.

          -  Febrile illness within 2 weeks of procedure and/or active pus from nose.

          -  Any sign of active ophthalmic disease, infection or inflammation including the
             presence of severe ocular surface inflammatory disease as determined by ophthalmic and
             physical exam, which could be exacerbated by the presence of the device.

          -  Current use of topical medications for the eye to treat an active ophthalmic disease.

          -  Underlying medical condition that, in the opinion of the Investigator, would place the
             subject at high risk if PO or IV sedation (MAC or monitored anesthesia care) were used
             during the procedure.

          -  Known silicone allergy

          -  Documented diagnostic history of Cystic Fibrosis

          -  Documented history of migraines and/or cluster headaches requiring treatment with
             anti-migraine medication.

          -  Documented uncontrolled or poorly controlled seasonal or perennial allergies requiring
             daily anti-allergy oral, nasal or ophthalmic medications.

          -  Tobacco, marijuana and /or e-vape inhaler use either currently or during the last 6
             months

          -  Documented history of bleeding disorders, for example, von Willebrand's disease or
             hemophilia.

          -  Inability to stop thrombolytics or other anti-platelet medication prior to procedure
             day including but not limited to Coumadin (warfarin) for 5 days, Plavix (clopidogrel)
             for 3 days, ASA(aspirin)/NSAIDs/fish oil supplements for 10 days, Xeralta®
             (rivaroxaban) for 24 hours.

          -  For contact lens wearers, inability to go without contact lenses for at least 10 days
             postoperatively.

          -  Known use of any investigational ocular or sinusitis drug(s) or devices within 30 days
             prior to enrollment.

          -  Investigator determination that the potential study subject is unable to comply with
             study procedures and /or follow-up, or provided informed consent.

          -  Women of childbearing potential who test positive on the study-required urine
             pregnancy test and who are unwilling to practice a medically acceptable contraception
             regimen from screening through week 8 visit. Women who are documented as
             postmenopausal for at least 1 year (&gt; 12 months since last menses) or are surgically
             sterilized, do not require testing.

          -  Severe co-morbidity or poor general physical/mental health that, in the opinion of the
             Investigator, will not allow the subject to be a good study candidate (i.e. other
             disease processes, mental capacity, cognitive function, substance abuse, shortened
             life expectancy, vulnerable patient population, high surgical risk).

          -  Currently involved in another clinical study where that participation may conflict or
             interfere with the treatment, follow-up or results of the clinical study.
