      This is a phase 1 clinical trial evaluating the safety, tolerability of escalating doses of
      AGuIX-NP in combination with radiation and cisplatin in patients with locally advanced
      cervical cancer. Dose escalation will be conducted using the modified toxicity probability
      interval (mTPI) method.

      Three dose levels of intravenous AGuIX nanoparticles will be explored: 20mg/kg (level -1), 30
      mg/kg (level 1) and 50 mg/kg (level 2).

    <description>Three intravenous injections of AGuIX will be delivered.
The first injection of AGuIX will be delivered intravenously the 1st day and the 11th day of EBRT. The first injection will be preceded with an MRI (unenhanced T1 and T2 sequences) then followed with another MRI performed 4 hours later, to monitor tumor uptake.
Irradiation will be performed after the second MRI.
The second injection will be followed by an MRI 4 hours later
The third injection will be delivered intravenously the day of the brachytherapy procedure. Intravenous hydration will be performed during all brachytherapy courses to ensure AGuIX clearance.
Up to three dose levels may be explored: 20mg/kg (level -1), 30 mg/kg (level 1) and 50 mg/ kg (level 2). The starting dose level will be 30mg/kg.</description>
