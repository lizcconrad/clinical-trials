    <textblock>
      This study aims to prospectively investigate the use of virtual reality headsets on the
      placement of IVs in a pediatric emergency department, by comparing the first stick success
      rate, total number of attempts, and the time to successful IV placement between patients who
      use virtual reality headset technology during the placement and those who receive the
      standard of care IV placement when child life ( individuals with special training in aiding
      and augmenting pediatric coping skills) is not available. The investigators will also compare
      the patient and parent perception of pain and anxiety associated with the IV placement in
      both study groups. Finally, by detailing which medications have been given prior to use of
      the VR for IV placement the investigators may evaluate for possible synergistic effects of VR
      with prior medication administration.

      Children often describe procedures involving needles as the most stressful portion of the
      hospital experience. 1,2 Many studies involving the perception of pain have highlighted the
      importance of attention for the perception of pain, and, conversely, the benefit of
      distraction for decreasing pain perception. 3,4 Virtual reality technologies (VR) have been
      shown to mitigate the experience of pain and anxiety in patients undergoing procedures in a
      number of different ways. 5,6 While small studies have demonstrated the use of VR to be
      effective in diminishing pain during intravenous (IV) placement for outpatient imaging in
      pediatric patients aged 8-12, there have not been large-scale studies assessing the use of VR
      during IV placement in the Pediatric Emergency Department. 7 Studies examining the use of VR
      during venipuncture and IV placement also frequently focus on self-reported or
      parent-reported pain, rather than objectively quantifying number of IV sticks and time to
      successful IV placement.8 Additionally, the pediatric age ranges which benefit from VR have
      not been well-established, with some studies citing benefits only in patients over 10 years
      of age, and others showing improvements in all age groups.7,9,10
