  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The five-repetition sit-to-stand test (5R-STS) has been used in many medical disciplines, but
      has never been correlated with or validated in regard to degenerative spinal diseases. The
      investigators aim to assess the possibility of using the standardized 5R-STS as an objective
      measure of functional impairment and pain severity in patients with degenerative lumbar
      spinal diseases.

        100 patients with degenerative lumbar spinal diseases that are seen in outpatient
        consultations will be recruited. All tests and questionnaires are part of the normal
        clinical assessment of the study center; The patients are thus not required to make any
        extra efforts.

        25 healthy volunteers (the authors and volunteers from the department) will be included to
        get baseline data for the 5R-STS in healthy people

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Degenerative diseases of the lumbar spine (Herniated disc, lumbar stenosis,
             spondylolisthesis, degenerative disc disease)

          -  Symptoms of lower back pain, neurogenic claudication, or radiculopathy

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Hip or Knee prosthetics

          -  Walking aides

        This study will also include 25 healthy volunteers:

        Inclusion Criteria:

        - No degenerative spinal or lower extremity complaints

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Back pain, leg pain, other lower extremity-related complaints
