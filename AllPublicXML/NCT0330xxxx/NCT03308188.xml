  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a 10-month internet-based randomized controlled trial to evaluate whether an online
      chronic pain management program (&quot;E-Health&quot;) can assist with reduced opioid reliance in
      chronic pain patients. About half of the eligible participants will receive access to the
      E-Health program in addition to their standard chronic pain treatment; the other half will
      just continue receiving their standard chronic pain treatment.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will determine whether an innovative, accessible E-health intervention can assist
      with reduced opioid reliance in chronic pain patients, which can, ultimately, reduce risks of
      unintended opioid overdose and death. Importantly, the study will contribute to a better
      understanding of the mechanisms contributing to opioid use reduction while managing pain. The
      findings may assist in developing treatment options for a population at risk for opioid
      adverse effects.

      Potential participants will be identified through electronic health record (EHR) queries at
      participating sites. Participants will be assessed at baseline, at the end of the 4-month
      treatment period, and at 6 months following end-of-treatment through an electronic data
      capture system accessed by the participants. Other outcome data will be obtained from the
      participant's EHR data.

    <description>The Goalistics Chronic Pain Management Program, referred to as the E-health program in EMPOWER, was developed from cognitive, behavioral, interpersonal, and self-management interventions with demonstrated efficacy in traditional face-to-face or group settings. It is patient-centered, having been developed based on substantial input from people with chronic pain and chronic pain professionals.</description>
