      This study is a prospective randomized, controlled trial of two strategies to provide
      patients with the pertussis vaccine. Eligible adult patients with be offered pertussis
      vaccination in the Emergency Department vs. a referral to Public Health for pertussis
      vaccination. The effect of both strategies on triage time as well as measure of emergency
      department efficiency including length of stay, time to physician and left without being seen
      rates will be compared. At a four-month follow up, rates of pertussis vaccination will be
      measured.
