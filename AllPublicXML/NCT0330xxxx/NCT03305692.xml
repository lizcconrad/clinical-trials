  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) has been a valuable intervention for patients with
      systolic heart failure for over 15 years. Despite years of research, there is a still a
      25-40% non-responder rate depending on the outcomes measured. CRT optimization is a term used
      to describe the act of individualizing the therapy (CRT programming) for an individual
      patient. This is not often performed, but when it is, echocardiography is utilized. Recent
      work of body surface mapping using a novel system called the ECG Belt has shown a
      relationship between measures of electrical dyssynchrony and acute and chronic heart pumping
      function. This study will compare outcomes of patients randomized to either echocardiographic
      or ECG Belt optimization of CRT devices.

  <detailed_description>

      This is a prospective randomized study designed to determine whether cardiac
      resynchronization therapy (CRT) device programming guided by the ECG Belt (Medtronic, PLC)
      improves echocardiographic and functional outcomes in heart failure (HF) patients. The
      population will include patients treated with CRT for standard indications (not implanted for
      the sole purposes of this study). The study will focus enrollment on patients who do not have
      baseline characteristics predicting the best CRT response. Therefore the study will not
      enroll patients having non-ischemic HF etiology, left bundle branch (LBBB) morphology, and
      QRSd &gt; 150 ms or those previously RV paced.
