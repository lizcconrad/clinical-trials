  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: The transition to long-term care facility can be a stressful and emotional event
      for the elderly. The evidences showed that the prevalence of depression and the cognition
      impairment were higher in the institutionalized elderly than the community dwelling elderly.
      It could affect the quality of life of the elderly and increase risk of mortality.

      Purpose: The aim of the study is to evaluate the effect of outdoor activities and sunlight
      exposure on depression, cognitive function, and quality of life among institutionalized
      elderly.

      Method: The design is a randomized control trial. Participants will be randomly allocated to
      experimental or control groups by block randomization. In the experimental group,
      participants will be encouraged to reduce time spent on bed and bedroom. Nurses, nurse aids
      or family will take participants outdoors and exposure their face, hands or arm to sunlight
      for 15-30 minutes a day, five days a week for three months (if the UV index is over 8
      according to the forecast of Center Weather Bureau, the participants will be asked to stay
      inside). In the control group, the participants will receive routine care. The control group
      will neither be encouraged to stay outdoors nor limit the chance to exposure to sunlight.

      Expected outcome: The expected benefit of the research is to improve the depression,
      cognitive function, and quality of life of the institutionalized elderly.
