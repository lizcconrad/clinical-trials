  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to obtain additional data on efficacy and safety of 12-week
      course of therapy with Anaferon for children for prevention of influenza and other acute
      respiratory viral infections in children during the peaks of seasonal morbidity.

      Primary objectives of the study:

        1. To assess duration of the period from the first dose of the drug until manifestation of
           the symptoms of influenza or another acute respiratory viral infection (ARVI) in two
           groups of subjects receiving preventive therapy with the study drug (Anaferon for
           children) or Placebo.

        2. To compare duration of periods from the first dose of the drug until manifestation of
           the symptoms of influenza or another ARVI in two groups of subjects (Anaferon for
           children and Placebo).

        3. Based on the comparison of duration of periods from the first dose of the drug until
           manifestation of the symptoms of the disease in these two groups, to assess efficacy of
           Anaferon for children for prevention of influenza and other ARVI in children during the
           peaks of seasonal morbidity and demonstrate superiority of the study drug over placebo.

      Additional study objectives:

        1. To assess and compare percentage of children not falling with influenza or another ARVI
           in the two groups during 4-, 8- and 12-week course of preventive therapy.

        2. To assess and compare percentage of children in the two groups with the symptoms of
           respiratory or ear-nose-throat bacterial infections requiring antibacterial therapy
           within 12-week preventive therapy.

        3. To assess and compare percentage of children hospitalized with influenza/ARVI or their
           complications in the two groups within 12-week preventive therapy.

        4. Based on collection and analysis of adverse events during the therapy, to obtain
           additional information on safety of the study drug
