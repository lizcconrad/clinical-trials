      This study evaluates the comparison between liposomal bupivacaine versus bupivacaine HCl in
      Transversus Abdominis Plane blocks for gynecologic surgery on the length of stay in the
      hospital, total narcotic use, and overall complications rates.

      The proposed pilot study is evaluating the use of Exparel ™ in an anesthesia protocol for
      patients undergoing major lower abdominal gynecologic surgery. Exparel ™ is a formulation of
      liposomal bupivicaine that is reputed to have a much longer duration of action compares to
      bupivacaine. Exparel™ has been originally demonstrated to be safe and effective in
      bunionectomy and hemorrhoidectomy. It has recently gained FDA approval for all surgical site
      infiltration including TAP (Transversus Abdominis Planus block) blocks. Exparel™ has also
      been studied in other procedures and demonstrated reduction in opioid use and median length
      of stay (LOS).

      Currently, patients on the gynecologic oncology service undergoing major abdominal surgery
      are receiving a type of regional anesthesia using bupivacaine HCl known as a TAP block as
      part of an effort to decrease narcotic use post-operatively and decrease hospital length of
      stay. Bupivacaine has a known eight to twelve hour duration of action, thus addressing
      immediate post operative pain. As Exparel™ is anticipated to have a longer duration of
      action, the purpose of this study is to determine if TAP blocks with Exparel™ have an
      advantage over standard TAP blocks with bupivacaine HCl in reducing length of hospital stay
      in a randomized controlled trial. Our hypothesis is that TAP blocks with Exparel™ will result
      in reduced length of stay contributing to significant hospital cost savings. Secondary
      outcomes include total narcotic use (hypothesized to be reduced) and overall complication
      rates (hypothesized to remain unchanged). Given there are no published data on the efficacy
      and safety of using Exparel™ in open gynecologic abdominal surgery, this will be a pilot
      study.

When performing a bilateral TAP with Bupivicaine 0.25% and the incision extends above the umbilicus: 30 ml of 0.25% bupivacaine is drawn up and given on each side after identification of planes by the anesthesiologist (need 2 vials). A 3rd vial of 30 ml 0.25% bupivacaine will be drawn up and is directly infiltrated into the surgical site (above and below the fascia prior to closure of fascia) extending above the umbilicus by the surgeon.</description>

That total volume will be divided into two 30 ml syringes, and each will be used (per side) for the TAP blocks.</description>
