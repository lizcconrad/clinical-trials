  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will be conducted to see if unlocking mandible from deep bite in growing females
      by flat fixed anterior bite plane will change mandibular position in skeletal mandibular
      deficiency and if there is a difference in the change of mandibular position if we assisted
      the mandible by holding it in a more forward position by modified inclined fixed anterior
      bite plane .These results will be compared to normal mandibular growth from previous records
      of a matched control group in the discussion afterthat.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Two groups of patients the first for flat fixed anterior bite plane, the second for modified
      inclined fixed anterior bite plane.Full records are taken to patients. Then bands selection
      for upper first molars,impressions for upper arch with bands fitted and impression to lower
      arch, fabrication of either flat/ modified inclined fixed anterior bite planes and
      cementation in patient's mouth,evaluation of results after 8 months.

    <description>Bands selection will be done for upper 6s. Alginate impressions taken and molar bands are fitted in place into the impressions. Impressions for upper and lower arches are poured with stone plaster. Mounting on simple hinge articulator will be done.
Lingual arches (diameter 1 mm) with anterior acrylic bite plates with thickness enough to separate posterior teeth 4mm .
The acrylic bite planes were in occlusion with the lower anterior teeth and extended sagittally 2-3mm beyond edges of lower incisors.

    <description>In modified inclined fixed anterior bite plane,the modification is that some indentations will be done in the acrylic part where the lower anteriors will fit such that mandible will be held in a more forward position. These indentations will be relieved lingually to overcome it's flaring effect on mandibular incisors .The inclined plane will be 60 degrees to occlusal plane.
Functional bite will be taken to position the mandible in the proper position forward.
Bite taken edge-to-edge for appliance construction. Mounting upper and lower casts on simple hinge articulator for construction of modified flat fixed anterior bite plane</description>
