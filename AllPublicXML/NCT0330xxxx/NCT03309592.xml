  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of the combination of
      ambrisentan and tadalafil in reducing mPAP to below 35mmHg in patients with moderate to
      severe Portopulmonary Hypertension (POPH) as a means to candidacy for liver transplantation.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The outcome of liver transplantation (LT) in the presence of moderate to severe POPH is
      significantly poor with a 50% reported mortality rate in LT recipients having a mean
      pulmonary artery pressure (mPAP) &gt;35 mmHg and 100% when the mPAP is greater than 50 mmHg;
      therefore, making moderate to severe POPH a contraindication to liver transplants. Those
      recipients with significant pulmonary artery pressure (PAP) may be denied the opportunity for
      transplant unless the mPAP is brought below 35 mmHg with medical treatment. This study will
      test the efficacy &amp; safety of the combination of using ambrisentan and tadalfil in reducing
      the Pulmonary Arterial Pressure to below 35 mmHg in patients with moderate to severe POPH as
      a means to candidacy for liver transplantation.
