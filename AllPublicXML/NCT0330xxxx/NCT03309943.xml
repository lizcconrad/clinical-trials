  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The central objective of this project is to obtain proof-of-concept data demonstrating the
      effects of propranolol (a beta-adrenergic antagonist) on neurobiological responses to
      personal smoking environments and behavioral responses in a laboratory smoking behavior task.
      Human cigarette smokers (N = 50) will take photographs of locations where they do and do not
      smoke cigarettes. They will then be randomly assigned to receive either propranolol (40 mg)
      or placebo prior to completing: A) An MRI session assessing neural responses to personal
      smoking/non-smoking environments, standard smoking/non-smoking environments and proximal
      smoking/non-smoking cues; and B) A laboratory session examining smoking behavior in response
      to environmental cues.

In order to maintain compliance with HIPAA requirements (as well as university data security policies), all data will be de-identified according to HIPAA guidelines prior to being shared. Personal images themselves will not be made publicly available due to privacy concerns. However, a brief description of each image (e.g. &quot;Front porch of home&quot;) will be made available. Data would be provided in widely accessible formats (e.g. csv/xls), along with a detailed data dictionary describing all elements and coding and study protocols.</ipd_description>
