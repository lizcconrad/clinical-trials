  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will implement therapeutic bright light that is tailored to the individual's
      circadian typology and will estimate its effects on circadian rhythms, 4 common
      cancer-associated symptoms, and impact on quality of life in survivors living with cancer.
      Examining a selected phase marker (core body temperature) in relation to the associated
      clinical features (symptoms) is the starting point for future investigation of the biological
      mechanisms of symptoms.

    <description>On 2 random days during the 2-week bright light treatment, ambient light will be recorded continuously during waking hours using a digital foot candle datalogging light meter (Extech Instruments, Waltham, MA) Model SDL400. The 7.1&quot; x 2.9&quot; x 1.0&quot; light meter (12.21 oz) has the capacity to measure up to 10,000 footcandles (accuracy: ± 4% reading). The light-weight light sensor is approximately 2 inches in diameter and comes with a clip and strap that makes it comfortable to wear just below the neck.</description>

    <description>8 items with 5-point rating scales (1=never to 5=always) measuring affective and cognitive manifestations of depressive mood. Higher scores indicate worse depression. In a sample of depressed outpatients, PROMIS-Depression showed greater reliability when compared to the CES-D and the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9). Convergent validity with the CES-D and PHQ-9 was supported by strong correlations, ranged 0.72 to 0.84</description>
