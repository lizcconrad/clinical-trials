  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary hypothesis of the proposed study is that an electrophysiology-based algorithmic
      approach is superior to standard clinical follow-up with remote monitoring in reducing the
      combined endpoint of cardiovascular hospitalization, syncope and death in patients with new
      onset conduction disturbance following transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study population consists of pacemaker-free patients that are 18 years or older
      undergoing a TAVI at the Montreal Heart Institute. Patient consent is required.

      Patients meeting the inclusion criteria will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to one of the
      following two groups:

      Group 1: electrophysiology-based algorithmic approach

      Group 2: standard clinical follow-up with transcutaneous cardiac monitoring.

    <description>Participants assigned to this group will receive a transcutaneous cardiac monitor prior to hospital discharge.
In addition, the physician will perform an electrophysiological study the day after the transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVI) procedure.
If electrical slowdown is confirmed during the electrophysiological study, the doctor will proceed with the pacemaker implantation.
In the case where the electrical slowdown is not confirmed by the electrophysiological study, the participant will not have a pacemaker implantation.</description>

    <description>Patient will be in the electrophysiology laboratory. The doctor will freeze the groin area and a medication may be given to help the patient relax. A catheter will be inserted into the groin up to the heart and the heart's electrical system will be recorded.</description>

    <description>The transcutaneous cardiac monitor is applied to the skin on the thorax. It may be necessary to shave the area. The monitor is water resistant and can be used in the shower. The monitor's location needs to be changed every 7 days. Instructions will be supplied to the patient.</description>
