    <textblock>
      Advance directives are again in the heart of debate since the Leonetti-Claeys's law . These
      pieces of legislation allow everyone to decide by advance their wishes of the end of
      life.However, it does not seem that to legislate on a subject is enough to apply the text of
      law. High authority of health suggest that medical and paramedical staff have to participate
      to the elaboration of the questionnaire and the redaction of advance directives.

      So the aim is that ,before asking patient about their knowledge on these advance directive,
      to evaluate if the staff knows about the law .
