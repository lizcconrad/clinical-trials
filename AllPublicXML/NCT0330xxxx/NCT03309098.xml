  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Ankle injuries, specifically lateral ankle sprains, are the most common acute injury to the
      active population (Hootman, Dick, &amp; Agel, 2007). It is important to insure the use of best
      practice and ensure that the techniques being utilized in clinics for evaluation are
      validated and consistent within the techniques. Manual testing and instrumented testing have
      not yet been tested within the same cohort.

      The purpose of this study is to compare the diagnostic outcomes of a clinician and of a
      diagnostic arthrometer when testing acute ankle injuries. Participants will be recruited at
      University of Nebraska at Omahas (UNO) Injury Prevention and Care Clinic and Athletic
      Training Room in Sapp Fieldhouse. Participants with be members of the UNO Wellness Center or
      UNO athlete, aged 19-80 years old. During a standard evaluation the participant will have a
      clinician test manual ligamentous laxity and a blinded clinician testing laxity using an
      arthrometer. Participation will not alter the normal treatment or care for participants. The
      author hypothesizes that the diagnostic accuracy for all performed test will be good to
      excellent when assessed for laxity and moderate to good when assessed for pain.
