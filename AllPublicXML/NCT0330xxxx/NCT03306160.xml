    <textblock>
      This is a prospective cohort study which aims to explore the significance of brachial and
      central ambulatory blood pressure monitoring in predicting cardiovascular risk in patients
      with end stage renal disease who are treated with hemodialysis. Enrolled patients will
      receive a 48-hour central and brachial ambulatory blood pressure monitoring at its first-time
      dialysis after enrollment. And their cardiovascular events and deaths at first and third year
      will be followed-up.

      The protocol of this study was approved by the local ethical review board. The including
      criteria: 1) ESRD treated with hemodialysis for more than 3 months prior to study enrollment;
      2) agree to participate the study and sign informed written consent; 3) available for
      long-term follow-up. The excluding criteria: 1)chronic atrial fibrillation or other cardiac
      arrhythmia; 2) nonfunctional arteriovenous fistula in the contralateral brachial area of the
      one used for dialysis; 3) myocardial infarction, angina pectoris and ischemic stroke during
      the previous month; 4) congestive heart failure class IV based on the New York Heart
      Association classification; 5) malignancy or any other condition with poor prognosis; 6)
      antihypertensive treatment during one month prior to enrollment. After enrollment, every
      patient will receive a question-based interview to obtain medical history and the following
      examinations and tests: anthropometric parameters measurement including body height, weight;
      biochemical tests including vein blood and urine. At the first-time dialysis after
      enrollment, patients will receive 48-hour central and brachial ambulatory blood pressure
      monitoring using a well validated and commercial device Mobil-O-Graph (IEM, Germany).
      Brachial blood pressure are measured for each patient before every dialysis for at three
      month. Then one-year and three-year cardiovascular events and deaths will be followed-up. The
      primary outcome measures are as follows: deaths and cardiovascular events including nonfatal
      myocardial infarction, unstable angina, stroke, hospitalization for heart failure, or
      resuscitated cardiac arrest.
