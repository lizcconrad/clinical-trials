    <textblock>
      This pilot phase I trial studies the side effects and how well MUC1 peptide-Poly-ICLC vaccine
      works in preventing lung cancer in current and former smokers at high risk for lung cancer.
      Vaccines made from peptides may help the body build an effective immune response to kill
      cells. MUC1 peptide-Poly-ICLC vaccine may stimulate the body's immune system and slow or stop
      the changes from normal to pre-cancer to cancer.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Immunogenicity of the vaccine, assessed at week 12, based on the increase in IgG anti‐MUC1
      antibody titer over the pre‐vaccination levels.

      II. Safety, assessed throughout the trial and continued observation for 24 weeks.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To explore potential differences, if any, in the immunogenicity of the vaccine (as
      assessed at week 12 by the IgG anti‐MUC1 antibody titer ratio) in current versus (vs.) former
      smokers.

      II. To evaluate pre‐vaccination levels of circulating myeloid derived suppressor cells (MDSC)
      and correlate with the ability to respond to the vaccine.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To explore immune response at week 24. II. To explore the relationship between chronic
      obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) status at pre‐registration and immune response in
      current versus former smokers.

      III. To explore the impact of the MUC1 peptide-Poly-ICLC vaccine (MUC1/Poly‐ICLC vaccine) on
      inflammation‐related high sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) and interleukin‐6 (IL‐6)
      levels.

      IV. To explore the impact of baseline levels of hsCRP and IL‐6 on the ability to successfully
      vaccinate with MUC1/Poly‐ICLC.

      V. To establish a biospecimen repository archive: frozen peripheral blood live cells and
      plasma for future more detailed and comprehensive immunologic assays, including direct
      testing of anti‐MUC1 T cell immunity.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive MUC1 peptide-Poly-ICLC vaccine subcutaneously (SC) at weeks 0, 2, and 10.

      After completion of study treatment, patients may be followed up at week 28.

    <description>Will be evaluated by monitoring changes in IgG anti‐MUC1 antibody titer ratio; defined as t12/t0, where t0 is the &quot;initial titer&quot; measured prior to vaccination, and t12 is the &quot;final titer&quot; drawn at 12 weeks.
