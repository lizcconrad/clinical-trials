      To evaluate the performance of uterocervical angle (UCA) in the prediction of labor
      induction.

    <textblock>
      Induction of labor is a common procedure in obstetrics. In recent years, uterocervical angle
      (UCA) emerged as a new ultrasound parameter in the prediction of labor. Dziadosz et al
      concluded that the performance of UCA was even better than the cervical length in their
      cohort. A wide UCA during second trimester shown to have an increased risk of preterm labor
      and narrow angle was less likely to have labor.

      The investigators are aimed to investigate predictive role of both cervical length and UCA in
      the labor induction in third trimester of pregnancy.The investigators focused on nulliparous
      women who are taking dinoproston for the cervical preparation and aim to measure their UCA.
