  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is no evidence available about which molecular profiling methods are currently used for
      cancer patients in Austrian clinical practice. The construction of the registry proposed as a
      completely independent research endeavor, will be helpful for scientific evaluation and the
      establishment of highly credible data.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In the situation of enormous possible beneficial options for patients, health care systems,
      researchers and companies and the simultaneously present high number of uncertainties, the
      establishment of an independent registry for patients undergoing any type of comprehensive
      genomic profiling offers many advantages.

      In particular, an overview of the speed of development, the &quot;market penetration&quot;, the use of
      the technology in specific indications (tumor types, stages and in specific situations of
      unresponsiveness to certain drugs), the frequency by which treatment decisions will
      definitely follow the result of comprehensive genomic profiling and the reasons for this, the
      treatment outcome of such patients, the platform technologies applied (in-house (which
      types), vs. commercial) and the development of these parameters over time and in relation to
      the development of novel drugs will be analyzed.

      The registry proposes to cover the time period from the years 2016 to 2019, which will allow
      for assessment of both the current and emerging landscape of genomic/molecular testing
      practice in Austria and effect of molecular profiling on patient care and outcome.

        A cohort of oncology patients who received or plan to receive comprehensive genomic testing
        anytime on or after January 1, 2016. Patient medical, testing and treatment information
        will be obtained through extraction of data from existing patient medical charts.
        Longitudinal follow-up data, including survival and tumor progression, will also be
        extracted from patient medical charts. This patient follow-up data will be obtained until
        patient death or loss to follow-up.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        This registry will include cancer patients for which broad genomic profiling is indicated
        as assessed by the medical need and as deemed appropriate by the physician, for example

          -  cancer with high mutational load and suspicion of regular or frequent formation of
             neoantigens

               -  skin, lung, stomach, esophagus, colorectum, bladder, uterus, cervix, liver, head
                  and neck, kidney, breast

               -  lymphoma B-cell

          -  any other neoplastic disease where molecular targeting is performed but treatment
             fails

          -  cancer of unknown primary origin (CUP)

          -  planned or already carried out comprehensive genomic testing as of Jan 1, 2016 note:
             this registry will not initially register patients who are tested for only 1-5
             mutations by conventional means, but patients undergoing genomic profiling based on
             NGS)

          -  a patient´s signed informed consent

          -  Patients ≥ 18 years of age

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Due to the non-interventional design of the registry there are no specific exclusion
             criteria.
