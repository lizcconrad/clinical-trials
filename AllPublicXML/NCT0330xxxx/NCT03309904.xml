  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the preventive effect of a neuromuscular training program on injuries in
      youth floorball players. Half of participants will receive the training program, and half act
      as control and perform their usual training practices.

    <textblock>
      The study is a cluster-randomized controlled trial including male and female youth (12-17
      years) floorball players. Club is used as cluster unit.

      Coaches in the intervention group receive education of the preventive neuromuscular training
      program Knee Control (Knäkontroll) before the start of the season. Knee Control consists of 6
      different exercises, with 4 different variations and 1 pair-exercise, and takes about 10
      minutes to complete. In addition, coaches are instructed to perform a 5-minute running
      warm-up before the Knee Control exercises. Teams are to carry out the intervention at all
      training sessions, and the 5-minute warm-up also before all matches.

      Coaches in the control group carry on their normal training and warm-up routines with their
      clubs.

      Teams are followed for one full season: October 2017 - March 2018. Data registered for the
      study include exposure to floorball training and matches, and injuries that occur as a result
      of participation in floorball.

    <description>The Knee Control program is a neuromuscular training program that consists of 6 different exercises, with 4 levels of progression and one pair-exercise, for each exercise. The Knee Control program takes about 10 minute to complete after familiarization. In addition, a 5-minute running warm-up is instructed to coaches. Coaches are to perform the Knee Control program + the 5 minute warm-up at all training sessions during the season, and the 5 minute warm-up before all matches.</description>
