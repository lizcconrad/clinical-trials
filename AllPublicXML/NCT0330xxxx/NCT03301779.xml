  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary goal of Hemanext. is to improve red cell storage through novel storage methods.
      Based on our review of the pertinent literature, there is substantial evidence suggesting
      that prolonged exposure to oxygen during storage results in oxidative damage to the red blood
      cells leading to decreased therapeutic potential. Therefore, removal of oxygen from red blood
      cell products prior to storage has potential to preserve the cells in a more physiologically
      relevant state.

      Currently, Hemanext has focused on the design and development of a dual compartment bag
      system designated as the Hemanext Red Blood Cell Processing System. After standard processing
      of donated whole blood units into leukoreduced packed red blood cells (LR-RBCs) with the
      appropriate additive solutions, the LR-RBCs would then be placed in the oxygen reduction bag
      (ORB) which allows for the rapid diffusion of oxygen out of the blood, through a sterile,
      oxygen-permeable membrane, and into iron-based oxygen sorbents. After processing, the blood
      is transferred again from the ORB into the Hemanext storage bag (HSB) which will preserve the
      anaerobic state of the LR-RBC product for the duration of cold storage.

      Hemanext has conducted preliminary storage tests to ascertain the effects of anaerobic
      storage on overall blood health in various storage solutions. The research team has focused
      primarily on percent hemolysis, which is mandated by the FDA to remain below 1% for the
      duration of storage, as well as ATP and 2,3-DPG levels.

      In vitro and in vivo performance of O2/CO2 reduced red blood cells produced with the Hemanext
      System will be used to demonstrate the acceptability the final product for clearance. To
      accomplish this, the study will require a total of 100 studyevaluable donors. completing the
      study. The study entails a randomized, paired, 2-x-2 crossover design where every study donor
      (n = 10093) evaluable study donors who completes the study will donate a total of two whole
      blood units with individual units being donated at least 56 days (8 weeks) apart. One unit
      will be used as the test and the other unit will be used for the control. The order in which
      the IP and the CP will be used to collect, filter and store the whole blood and appropriate
      blood products (within the context of the crossover design) will be randomized.
