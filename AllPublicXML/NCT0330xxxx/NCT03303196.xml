  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a pilot study designed to determine if the bihormonal bionic pancreas provides
      improved blood glucose control, compared to the current standard of care, in individuals with
      hyperinsulinism who developed diabetes after having a pancreatectomy.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The management of diabetes following pancreatectomy for hyperinsulinism (HI) generally
      consists of the same approaches that are used for individuals with type 1 diabetes (T1D).
      However, there are significant differences in individuals with HI and post-pancreatectomy
      diabetes that increases the risk of hypoglycemia in these individuals and prevent achieving
      tight glycemic control. Individuals with HI have glucagon deficiency and unlike T1D, those
      with HI and post-pancreatectomy diabetes have residual dysregulated insulin secretion that
      results in marked hypo- and hyper-glycemia. Furthermore, pancreatic insufficiency can result
      in disturbances in nutrient absorption and fluctuations in glucose concentrations.

      Current treatment approaches with intermittent subcutaneous insulin administration or insulin
      pump therapy offer inadequate glycemic control in these individuals. We propose a novel
      approach to the management of these individuals with the bihormonal bionic pancreas to
      replace both hormones, insulin and glucagon, through an automated glycemic management system.
