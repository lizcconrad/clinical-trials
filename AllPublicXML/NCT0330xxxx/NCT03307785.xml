             study treatment, or is of non-childbearing potential.

          -  Male patient agrees to use an adequate method of contraception and not donate sperm
             starting with the first dose of study treatment through 90 days after the last dose of

             cervical cancer.

          -  Patient is considered a poor medical risk due to a serious, uncontrolled medical
             disorder, nonmalignant systemic disease, or active infection that requires systemic
             therapy.

          -  Patient has a condition (such as transfusion-dependent anemia or thrombocytopenia),

        Note: No data are available regarding the presence of niraparib or its metabolites in human
        milk, or on its effects on the breastfed infant or milk production. Because of the
        potential for serious adverse reactions in breastfed infants from niraparib, female
        patients should not breastfeed during treatment with niraparib and for 1 month after
        receiving the final dose.

          -  Patient has a known history of human immunodeficiency virus (type 1 or 2 antibodies).

          -  Patient has known active hepatitis B or hepatitis C.

             past 2 years.

          -  Patient has received prior therapy with an anti-PD-1, anti-PD-L1, anti-PD-L2,
             anti-CTLA-4 including ipilimumab), or any other antibody or drug specifically
             targeting T-cell co-stimulation or checkpoint pathways.

          -  Patient has undergone prior treatment with a known PARP inhibitor.

             conduction abnormalities, uncontrolled hypertension, myocardial infarction, cardiac
             arrhythmia or unstable angina, New York Heart Association Grade 2 or greater
             congestive heart failure, serious cardiac arrhythmia requiring medication, Grade 2 or
             greater peripheral vascular disease, and history of cerebrovascular accident [CVA])
             within 6 months of enrollment.

          -  Patient has a history of bowel obstruction, including subocclusive disease, related to
             the underlying disease and history of abdominal fistula, gastrointestinal perforation,
             or intra abdominal abscesses. Evidence of recto-sigmoid involvement by pelvic
             examination or bowel involvement on CT scan or clinical symptoms of bowel obstruction.

          -  Patient has proteinuria as demonstrated by urine protein: creatinine ratio ≥1.0 at
             screening or urine dipstick for proteinuria ≥2 (patients discovered to have ≥2
             proteinuria on dipstick at baseline should undergo 24-hour urine collection and must
             demonstrate &lt;2 g of protein in 24 hours to be eligible).

          -  Patient is at increased bleeding risk due to concurrent conditions (e.g., major
             injuries or surgery within the past 28 days prior to start of study treatment, history
             of hemorrhagic stroke, transient ischemic attack, subarachnoid hemorrhage, or
             clinically significant hemorrhage within the past 3 months).

          -  Patient has a known hypersensitivity to bevacizumab components or excipients
