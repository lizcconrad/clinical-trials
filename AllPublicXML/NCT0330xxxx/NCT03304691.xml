    <textblock>
      Background:

      Malaria is caused by parasites carried by some mosquitos. When the mosquitos bite people, the
      parasites can infect them. One of these parasites is Plasmodium vivax (P. vivax). Some
      children have P. vivax in their blood. They did not have malaria symptoms, but some also had
      a blood problem called anemia. This can make people feel tired or weak. This could have been
      caused by P. vivax. Researchers want to know how P. vivax infects these children, and if it
      affects their health.

      Objective:

      To collect blood, stool, and urine monthly from children to look for infections with P.
      vivax, worms, and other parasites.

      Eligibility:

      Children between 6 months and 10 years old

      Design:

      For screening, the study will be explained to the participant s parents or guardians, who
      will provide consent.

      Participants will have a visit once a month for about 3 months, from November to January, and
      then for about 6 months from June to November 2018. Visits include:

      Questions about their health

      Medical history

      Physical exam

      Blood draw by pricking the finger tip

      Urine and stool collection. They may collect these at home and bring them back.

      If participants have P. vivax in their blood, them may need to come back to the clinic within
      3 days. They will have blood taken from their arm using a needle.

      If participants feel ill during the study, they can go to the clinic for an exam and blood
      tests.

      If participants develop malaria while on the study, they will be treated.

      Participants samples will be stored for future research studies.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Plasmodium vivax was thought not to be a problem in Duffy blood group negative Africans.
      However, recent research has found that P. vivax infection occurs not only in areas where
      Duffy-positive and -negative people live side-by-side, but also in areas where populations
      are predominantly Duffy-negative, such as Bandiagara, Mali. In this region, our research
      group recently observed 25 P. vivax infections in children, all of whom were Duffy-negative.1
      Furthermore, some preliminary data suggest that, despite having extremely low parasitemia and
      no malarial symptoms (no fever, muscle aches, or chills), the children of Bandiagara with P.
      vivax may have a drop in hemoglobin. The present study will detect P. vivax infections in
      children of the Bandiagara region. We will conduct physical exams and collect blood, urine,
      and stool samples monthly from November 2017 to January 2018 and from June to November 2018.
      Our goal is to detect and characterize P. vivax infections, focusing on molecularly
      characterizing how P. vivax invades erythrocytes in Duffy-negative individuals. Specifically,
      we want to identify the parasite ligands involved in this invasion. We will use RNA
      sequencing (RNAseq) of P. vivax in blood samples of infected subjects to define the level of
      expression of parasite invasion ligands. From the parasite DNA found in blood samples, we
      will determine whether there is gene expansion of the parasite ligand Duffy binding protein
      (PvDBP) (the number of copies of PvDBP in each genome), and identify the sequence of PvDBP to
      determine whether it can bind an erythrocyte receptor other than the Duffy blood group
      antigen (i.e., Duffy-negative erythrocytes). An additional focus will be whether P. vivax
      leads to anemia in the Duffy-negative children.
