  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This multi-center study open-label trial will enroll a single cohort of relapsed/refractory
      diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) patients whom are ineligible for autologous stem cell
      transplant (ASCT) due to 1) insensitivity to salvage chemotherapy, or 2) inability to
      tolerate high-dose myeloablative chemotherapy. All patients will receive dual checkpoint
      blocking antibody (DCBA) therapy with established doses currently being used in phase III
      trials of ipilimumab (1mg/kg) and nivolumab (3mg/kg) given at three week intervals, two times
      before, and two times following &quot;immunotransplant&quot; in which T cells (in whole PBMCs) are
      cryopreserved and re-infused (adoptive T cell transfer or ATCT) following lymphodepleting
      chemotherapy regimen, currently being employed in adoptive T cell therapies.

             device within 28 days of the first dose of treatment.

          2. Has a diagnosis of immunodeficiency or is receiving systemic steroid therapy or any
             other form of immunosuppressive therapy within 7 days prior to the first dose of trial

             Day 1 or who has not recovered (i.e., ≤ Grade 1 or at baseline) from adverse events
             due to agents administered more than 28 days earlier.

          6. Has had prior chemotherapy, targeted small molecule therapy, or radiation therapy
             within 14 days prior to study Day 1 or who has not recovered (i.e., ≤ Grade 1 or at

             to the first dose of trial treatment and any neurologic symptoms have returned to
             baseline), have no evidence of new or enlarging brain metastases, and are not using
             steroids for at least 7 days prior to trial treatment. This exception does not include

             drugs). Replacement therapy (e.g. thyroxine, insulin, or physiologic corticosteroid
             replacement therapy for adrenal or pituitary insufficiency, etc.) is not considered a
             systemic treatment. Subjects on stable dose of corticosteroids less than or equivalent
             to 10mg of prednisone daily for more than 3 months may be enrolled, and continue their
             stable dose through treatment.

             participation for the full duration of the trial, or is not in the best interest of
             the subject to participate, in the opinion of the treating Investigator.

         13. Has known psychiatric or substance abuse disorders that would interfere with
             cooperation with the requirements of the trial.

         14. Is pregnant or breastfeeding, or expecting to conceive or father children within the
             projected duration of the trial, starting with the pre-screening or screening visit
             through 120 days after the last dose of trial treatment (roughly two and a half years
             after enrollment).

         15. HIV positive with detectable viral load, or anyone not on stable anti-viral (HAART)
             regimen.

         16. Has known active Hepatitis B (e.g., HBsAg reactive) or Hepatitis C (e.g., HCV RNA
             [qualitative] is detected).

         17. History of allogeneic stem-cell (or other organ) transplantation.

         18. Has received a live vaccine within 30 days of planned start of study therapy. Note:
             Seasonal influenza vaccines for injection are generally inactivated flu vaccines and
             are allowed; however intranasal influenza vaccines (e.g., Flu-Mist®) are live
             attenuated vaccines, and are not allowed.
