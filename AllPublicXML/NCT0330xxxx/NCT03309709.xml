      This prospective randomized study will compare the regression rates of women managed with
      watch-and-wait approach and of those treated with 3 cycles of luteal 25mg subcutaneous
      progesterone from 18 to 25 days of menstrual cycle

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In premenopause, 25% of endometrial polyps regresses spontaneously in 1 year. According to
      guidelines, given that most premenopausal polyps are not malignant, there is an option for
      expectant approach with no surgical intervention. Studies on the efficacy of medical
      treatments for endometrial polyps are also recommended by gynaecologic societies, with the
      aim of finding cost-saving not invasive strategies to manage this common pathology. Up to
      now, nobody has investigated the effect of progestin administration on polyps, but molecular
      and clinical data suggest that the antiestrogenic effect of this hormone can be exploited to
      increase and speed-up their regression rate. Our preliminary results on the effect of three
      months of progesterone demonstrated a regression rate of 47,5% in women treated vs 12,5% in
      those don't receiving treatment.

      Accordingly, in this prospective randomized study we aim to compare the regression rates of
      women managed with watch-and-wait approach and of those treated with 3 cycles of luteal 25mg
      subcutaneous progesterone from 18 to 25 days of menstrual cycle

    <time_frame>three months after the starting of treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Effect of progestogen therapy on symptoms possibly present in patients with endometrial polyps, assessed with PBAC (Pictorial blood loss assesment chart) score.
Patients will be asked to fill in the PBAC score during the first menstrual period following diagnosis and during the three months of medical treatment or watch and wait approach. The &quot;8-days PBAC score&quot; is an objective method used to quantify menstrual blood loss; according to this method, each patient records the extent of uterine bleeding during the first 8 days of menstrual cycle, quantizing it in terms of daily change in diapers and number/size of the clots. Each option has a numeric value (1=no bleeding; 2=spotting; 3=1-8 diapers per day; 4=heavy bleeding) and, based on the result obtained, the monthly PBAC score varies from 0 (amenorrhea) to &gt; 500 (heavy bleeding). Menorrhagia occurs when PBAC score is &gt;100 during a menstrual cycle, corresponding to a blood loss greater than 80 ml.</description>
