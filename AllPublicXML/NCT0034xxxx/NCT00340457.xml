  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Incidence rates of renal cell cancer have increased rapidly in the U.S. and other countries.
      In particular, rates among African Americans have risen more sharply than any other cancer
      site. We propose to conduct a population-based case-control study of renal cell cancer in
      areas of the U.S. with a high proportion of African American residents. We will include two
      study centers and one data coordinating center and will recruit study participants over a
      period of four years. We plan to conduct in-person interviews with 2,100 cases (1,400 whites
      and 700 blacks) and 2,800 controls (1,400 each of whites and blacks) to elicit information on
      demographic background and history of exposures. A 40 ml blood sample will be collected from
      living cases and controls to measure certain environmental exposures and for genetic
      analyses. Two buccal cell samples will be collected from living cases and controls for
      genetic analyses. Tumor tissue blocks will be collected from as many cases as possible for
      assays of tumor mutations. Diagnostic slides will be collected for standardized
      reclassification of tumors into clear cell, papillary, and other histologic subtypes. Medical
      records for all cases will be reviewed for health insurance coverage, concomitant conditions,
      presenting symptoms, tumor stage, size and grade, and methods leading to diagnosis of renal
      cell cancer.

      Incidence rates of renal cell cancer have increased rapidly in the U.S. and other countries.
      In particular, rates among African Americans have risen more sharply than any other cancer
      site. We propose to conduct a population-based case-control study of renal cell cancer two
      areas of the U.S. with a high proportion of African American residents: Detroit, Michigan
      (Wayne State University), and Chicago, Illinois (University of Illinois at Chicago). Westat,
      Inc. is the coordinating center. Participants are being recruited over a period of four
      years. A total of 2,100 cases (1,400 Caucasian Americans and 700 African Americans) and 2,800
      controls (1,400 each of Caucasian and African Americans) will be recruited. In-person
      interviews are conducted with cases and controls to elicit information on demographic
      background and history of exposures. A 40 ml blood sample and a buccal cell sample are
      collected from cases and controls for genetic analyses. Tumor tissue blocks will be collected
      from as many cases as possible for assays of tumor mutations. Diagnostic slides will be
      collected for standardized reclassification of tumors into clear cell, papillary, and other
      histologic subtypes. Medical records for all cases will be reviewed for presenting symptoms,
      tumor stage, size and grade, and methods leading to diagnosis of renal cell cancer. Telephone
      interviews are conducted with the nest-of-kin of eligible cases who died before we could
      interview them. Permission is being sought from the next-of-kin to assess the case's medical
      records and obtain tumor tissue samples.

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA - CASES:

        Residents of the study areas who are diagnosed with histologically confirmed renal cell
        carcinoma at ages 20 to 79 years over a four year study will be potentially eligible for
        the study.

        In addition, only eligible patients who are mentally/physically able to provide informed
        consent and undergo interviews will be approached for participation.

        INCLUSION CRITERIA - CONTROLS:

        Population-based controls will be frequency-matched to the cases by study center, race, age
        and sex, at the ratio of one control per case for non-African Americans and two controls
        per case for African Americans.

        Controls aged 65 years and older will be identified from Health Care Financing
        Administration (HCFA) files.

        Controls under age 65 years will be identified from residents of the study areas by random
        telephone digit dialing (RDD).
