  <brief_title>Study of the Ability of a Flu Vaccine to Prevent Flu Infection</brief_title>
  <official_title>A Prospective, Randomised, Double Blind, Placebo-Controlled Study to Assess the Efficacy of a Trivalent (A/New Caledonia/20/99, A/Panama/2007/99, B/Jiangsu/10/20) DNA Influenza Vaccine Administered by Particle Mediated Epidermal Delivery (PMED) Against a Controlled Influenza Virus Challenge.</official_title>

  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate how effective the vaccine is at preventing subjects
      developing flu symptoms after they are directly exposed to flu virus. The study will also
      evaluate how well the vaccine is tolerated at sites where administrations are given, any
      effects it may have on subjects' wellbeing and whether it can produce antibody responses in
      the body

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Influenza is a contagious disease of the upper airways and the lungs. It rapidly spreads
      around the world in seasonal epidemics, killing hundreds of thousands of people and having
      high economic consequences due to healthcare costs and lost productivity. Each year
      governments recommend groups who are at risk of influenza or its complications to receive
      influenza vaccination. Current vaccine supply is not sufficient to meet the demand if this
      recommendation were to be taken up by all. This study will evaluate PowderMed's Particle
      Mediated Epidermal Delivery (PMED) DNA vaccine for influenza as a potential alternative to
      existing vaccine technologies. This study will assess how effective two different PMED
      vaccine combinations are at preventing subjects developing influenza following exposure to
      flu virus 56 days after a single dose of vaccine.
