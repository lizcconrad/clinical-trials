      This study, sponsored by the National Institutes of Health and the University of Bamako in
      Mali, Africa, will examine factors that may protect against progression of malaria from mild
      to severe disease. Infection with the malaria parasite causes disease ranging in severity
      from mild or no symptoms to severe. A better understanding of what factors protect against
      disease progression may help scientists develop improved methods of disease prevention and
      treatment. The objectives of this study are to:

        -  Identify differences in protective factors for severe malaria in Malinke children
           residing in two Mali villages, Kela and Kangaba. Genetic variations in hemoglobin
           proteins called HbS and HbC appear to confer protection against severe disease in some
           children but not others. HbC appears to protect young Malinke children living in Kela,
           but not in nearby Kangaba, while HbS protects children in Kangaba but not in Kela. In
           addition, deficiency of an enzyme produced by red blood cells called G6PD protects
           males, but not females, from severe malaria.

        -  Investigate how fetal hemoglobin (HbF) may protect against malaria in infants and
           determine how HbS, HbC, G6PD deficiency, and beta-thalassemia trait affect the rate of
           HbF decline during the first 2 years of life.

      Children under 11 years of age who seek medical care at Kangaba or Kela health centers for
      symptoms of malaria may be eligible for this study. Each will be screened with a medical
      history, physical examination and blood test. In addition, healthy infants born to women
      referred to field site clinics may be enrolled for the newborn study. Participants undergo
      the following procedures:

      Children with mild malaria are treated with artesunate and amodiaquine. Those with severe
      malaria are treated with quinine. Blood is collected by finger prick every day for 4 days to
      evaluate the response to treatment and for genetic testing. Some blood is stored for future
      research related to malaria.

      Newborns have a heel or finger prick at 1, 3 and 6 months to collect a small blood sample for
      genetic testing. In addition, at the time of birth, a small amount of blood is collected from
      one of the blood vessels of the placenta. Some infants may be followed up to 2 years, with
      additional drops of blood taken at 12, 18 and 24 months. Some of the blood is stored for
      future research related to malaria.

      Our previous case-control study (protocol #01-I-N020) established that hemoglobin (Hb) C
      protects against severe malaria in the Dogon ethnic group of Mali, West Africa. We believe
      that abnormal display of major parasite virulence antigens (PfEMP-1) on the surface of HbC
      erythrocytes accounts for this protection. Whether this mechanism mediates protection by
      other mutant erythrocytes remains to be investigated. The principal objective of the current
      protocol has been to investigate whether HbC also protects against severe malaria in the
      Malinke of Kela, which historically gave rise to the Dogon. Our preliminary data from
      protocol #02-I-N285 suggest that HbC but not HbS (sickle trait) protects the young Malinke
      children of Kela, with the opposite being true for the Malinke children of Kangaba, a nearby
      village. To confirm these novel preliminary findings and to investigate candidate mechanisms
      of protection, our ongoing case-control study requires an additional 150 severe malaria
      patients who are less than 5 years old, of Malinke ethnicity, reside in either Kangaba or
      Kela villages, and have normal G6PD activity. Children less than 11 years old and diagnosed
      with either severe (case) or uncomplicated (control) malaria will be tested for
      hemoglobinopathies and G6PD deficiency. Severe and uncomplicated malaria patients will be
      treated with parenteral quinine or oral artemisinin combination therapies, respectively,
      which are standard of care in Mali. Principal outcome measures will include a comparison of
      the frequency of HbC, HbS, and G6PD deficiency between cases and controls; with odds ratios
      and 95% confidence intervals determining the degree and statistical significance of severe
      malaria protection.

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:

               1. All malaria patients enrolled in the case-control study will be less than 11
                  years old.

               2. Uncomplicated malaria: Axillary temperature greater than 37.5 degrees Celsius or
                  history of fever, signs and symptoms of malaria (e.g. headache, body aches,
                  malaise), asexual parasite density less than 500,000 per microliter of blood, no
                  criteria of severe malaria (see next paragraph), and no other etiologies of
                  febrile illness (e.g. respiratory tract infection, cellulitis) on clinical
                  examination.

               3. Severe malaria: Asexual parasite density greater than or equal to 100,000/uL or
                  parasitemia of any density plus any one of the following: coma (defined as
                  Blantyre coma score less than or equal to 2), convulsions (witnessed by
                  investigator), severe prostration, severe anemia (hemoglobin less than 5 g/dL),
                  respiratory distress, hypoglycemia (serum glucose less than 40 mg/dL),

                  cool extremities), cessation of eating and drinking, repetitive vomiting.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:
