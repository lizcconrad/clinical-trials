  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients admitted on this protocol will have, or be suspected of having, one of the lymphatic
      filarial infections affecting humans. After routine clinical evaluation they will be studied
      in depth immunologically, and their blood cells and/or serum will be collected to provide
      reagents (eg., specific antibodies, T cell clones, etc.) that will be used in the laboratory
      to address the broader questions of immunodiagnosis, immunoregulation, immunopathology and
      immunoprophylaxis. Careful observations of the patients' clinical and immunologic responses
      to therapy will be made, as well as long-term follow-up of these changes. It is anticipated
      both that the patients will receive optimal clinical care for their infections and that the
      specimens collected from them will prove to be valuable reagents for the laboratory studies
      of the immunologic responses unique to filarial or other helminthic infections.

      This study is designed to determine the presence of and the immune response to filarial and
      stronglyloides infections in an area endemic for both infections in South India. This study
      will aim to examine the presence of filarial and Strongyloides stercoralis infection at a
      community level as well as in hospital settings. After routine clinical evaluation and
      screening, individuals enrolled in this protocol will be studied in depth immunologically,
      and their blood cells and/or serum will be collected to address the broader questions of
      immunodiagnosis, immunoregulation and immunopathology. Careful observations of the individual
      s clinical and immunologic responses to therapy will be made, as well as long-term follow-up
      of these changes. In addition to infected individuals, this protocol will also be used to
      study individuals with filarial pathology and endemic normal individuals. This will enable us
      to characterize the immunological profiles of infected, uninfected and diseased individuals
      in an endemic area and provide greater insight into the pathogenesis of lymphatic filarial
      disease as well as the immunology of strongyloides infection.
