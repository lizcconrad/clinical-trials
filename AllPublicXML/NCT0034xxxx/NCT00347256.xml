  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the efficacy of concurrent chemotherapy and
      radiotherapy pre-operatively in patients with advanced paranasal sinus cancer. The main
      objectives of this study are: 1) to measure the rate of complete response to preoperative
      chemoradiation and 2) to study the efficacy of combining preoperative chemoradiation and
      surgery in terms of local control of the cancer two years post treatment.
