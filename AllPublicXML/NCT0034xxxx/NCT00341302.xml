  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      By the end of 1999, it was estimated that 1.2 million children were living with HIV
      infection. During 1999 alone, 600,000 children were newly infected with HIV, mostly in
      less-developed countries. Most HIV-infected children are infected by transmission from mother
      to child during pregnancy, at birth, or through breast milk. Antiretroviral medications,
      cesarean section before rupture of membranes, and avoidance of breastfeeding are ways to
      reduce the risk of transmission. This study will determine mother-to-child transmission rates
      and the effects on infants of exposure to antiretroviral medications and mode of delivery.

      Approximately 180 to 240 HIV-infected pregnant women in Mexico and Argentina will be enrolled
      during the first year of this 5-year study. HIV-infected women will be evaluated during
      pregnancy, during delivery, and 6 months after delivery. At each visit, a history will be
      taken and physical examination given; blood will be collected for laboratory tests.

      HIV-exposed infants will be evaluated through 6 months of age. At each of 2 visits, a history
      will be taken and physical examination given; blood will be collected for laboratory tests;
      and growth will be assessed.

      Prospective cohort study to describe the characteristics of HIV-infected pregnant women and
      HIV-exposed, uninfected children followed at participating Latin American sites, and to
      characterize adverse events during pregnancy and the postpartum period (HIV-infected women)
      and during childhood (HIV-exposed, uninfected children) according to receipt of/exposure to
      antiretroviral drug(s) .

      The study population is comprised of HIV-infected pregnant women and HIV-exposed
      infants/children.

      HIV-infected Women: The study enrolled HIV-infected pregnant women receiving medical care at
      participating clinical sites who: 1) plan to deliver at the clinical site; and 2) plan to
      continue postpartum and routine medical care for up to 5 years at the clinical site or
      associated outpatient facility.

      The Pediatric Cohort consists of HIV-exposed, uninfected children born to enrolled
      HIV-infected women. They were followed for up to 5 years. (HIV-exposed children ultimately
      determined to be HIV-infected were offered enrollment in a separate study, if eligible.)

      In addition, the NISDI study is using data from a locally conducted, single-site
      maternal-child health cohort study in Brazil (enrolled HIV-uninfected pregnant women and
      their HIV-unexposed infants) for NISDI analyses that benefit from making comparisons to
      healthy controls
