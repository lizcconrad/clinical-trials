  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to develop and test a web-based system intended to help women
      going through menopause make more informed choices regarding menopause treatments. The system
      will do this by giving women personalized feedback on the risks and benefits of these
      treatments.

      Most women are not satisfied with the counseling they receive about menopause. To improve
      menopause counseling and help menopausal women more actively participate in the decision
      making process, we have developed a novel prototype web-based decision aid. Our immediate
      goal is to develop this prototype technology into a comprehensive Menopause Interactive
      Decision Aid System (MIDAS) that provides personalized feedback about menopausal symptoms,
      risks for common conditions, and the effects of different treatment options on the short- and
      long-term consequences of menopause.

      Our main study hypotheses are that MIDAS can: 1) lead to better decisions and improve the
      quality of menopausal counseling; 2) improve compliance with a chosen menopausal plan; and 3)
      reduce medical errors associated with the use of menopausal therapies.

      We propose a 2-phase study conducted over 3 years. Phase I will transform the prototype
      application into a comprehensive MIDAS, completing its content and risk assessment
      instruments, and exploring its optimal design. This will be accomplished through conduct of
      focus groups and usability tests. Phase II will formally evaluate the impact of MIDAS in a
      randomized, controlled, multi-center clinical trial involving diverse patient populations and
      clinician settings. We will measure the impact of MIDAS on the decision-making process as
      well as its effect on providers and outcome measures related to menopause, including
      compliance, quality of life, and medical errors related to menopausal therapy. Analyses will
      evaluate the extent to which the impact of MIDAS on these outcomes varies according to
      patient, practice, and physician characteristics.
