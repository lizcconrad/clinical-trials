  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The prevention of contrast-mediated nephropathy (CMN), which accounts for considerable
      morbidity and mortality, remains a vexing problem. Contrast induced renal vasoconstriction is
      believed to play a pivotal role in the CMN mechanism. The aim of this study is to examine the
      efficacy of the prostacyclin analogue iloprost (dose 1ng/kg/min) in preventing CMN in
      high-risk patients undergoing a coronary procedure.
