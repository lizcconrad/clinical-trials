      The purpose of this study is to compare the safety and efficacy of Preservon(TM) treated
      allograft bone dowels to traditional freeze-dried allograft bone dowels (control) for fusion
      of degenerated cervical intervertebral discs in the treatment of cervical radiculopathy or
      myelopathy.

      Patient follow-up will be conducted at 6 weeks, 3 months, and 6 months. At 3 months after
      surgery, the implanted bone dowels will be assessed for subsidence; at 6 months after
      surgery, the implanted bone dowels will be assessed for fusion. Patients will complete
      questionnaires and x-rays taken at each visit.

      The degree of subsidence and rate of fusion will be assessed based on the evaluation of the
      x-rays taken. The x-ray evaluation will be conducted by a neurosurgeon who is blinded to the
      type of treatment that each patient has received.
