    <textblock>
      This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled multi-center study will carry out to assess
      the efficacy of GB-0998 in the treatment of the systemic sclerosis based on the changes in
      modified Rodnan total skin thickness score (TSS) as primary endopoint, and in addition, to
      assess the safety of GB-0998.
