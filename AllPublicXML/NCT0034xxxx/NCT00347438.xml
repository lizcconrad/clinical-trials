    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the safety and effectiveness of capecitabine before
      surgery.

      The study will also help gain more information about the effects of the capecitabine on
      physical and emotional well-being and how well the participants on capecitabine follow the
      study drug plan.

    <measure>Overall Clinical Response Rate (OCR)</measure>
    <time_frame>After the first three cycles of therapy, an average of 9 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Overall clinical response rate (OCR) was defined as a proportion of patients with a best response of Complete Clinical Response (CCR) or Partial Clinical Response (PCR). CCR was defined as complete disappearance of all measurable malignant disease, and no new malignant lesion, disease-related symptoms, or evidence of evaluable disease. PCR was defined as reduction by at least 50% of the sum of the products of the longest perpendicular diameters of all measurable lesions.</description>
