  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Glaucoma, an optic neuropathy characterized by progressive visual field loss, is the leading
      cause of irreversible blindness worldwide. The condition has a substantial heritable basis,
      as illustrated by the numerous loci and genes identified to date, and the large proportion of
      patients having a family history.

      Interleukin-1 (Il-1) is an important mediator of inflammation. There are 2 pro-inflammatory
      cytokines, Il-1 alpha and Il-1 beta. The genes encoding Il-1 are located within a 430kb
      region on chromosome 2q14.2. The role of Il-1 in glaucoma is a subject of recent interest. It
      has been shown that Il-1, produced endogenously by glaucomatous cells, inhibits the apoptotic
      response to oxidative stress, and Il-1 has also been reported to increase outflow facility by
      stimulating the _expression of matrix metalloproteinase enzymes, which in turn reduces extra
      cellular resistance. Recently, polymorphisms in Il-1 (particularly +3953T of the Il-1 β) were
      found to reduce the risk of primary open angle glaucoma. In this pilot study, we aim to
      investigate the role of Il-1 polymorphisms in both normal tension and high pressure glaucoma
      in our glaucoma patients. Both open and closed angle glaucoma will be studied. This is a
      pilot study of the role of immune system related polymorphisms and depending on the results,
      we may embark on a larger investigation of other immune genes in glaucoma

      Aims:

      Primary objective: To investigate if polymorphisms in the Il-1 gene cluster are protective
      for glaucoma in Asian populations.

      Secondary objective: To determine if there are differences in single nucleotide polymorphisms
      of the Il-1 gene cluster in normotensive glaucoma patients versus high-pressure glaucoma
      patients.

      Background

      The glaucomas are a group of heterogeneous optic neuropathies characterized by progressive
      loss of axons in the optic nerve. Based on WHO Global Data Bank on Blindness, glaucoma
      accounts for 5.1 million of the estimated 38 million blind in the world.1Glaucoma affects
      approximately 70 million people worldwide and is the leading cause of irreversible blindness
      in the world2. As the number of elderly in the world rapidly increases, glaucoma morbidity
      will rise, causing increased health care costs and economic burden. This has important public
      health implications for a condition in which visual loss, once established, cannot be
      reversed. The major risk factor in glaucoma is elevated intraocular pressure due to reduction
      in aqueous outflow.

      Previous studies have shown that glaucoma is a major cause of visual morbidity in
      Singapore3-5. In a population based survey conducted on Chinese Singaporeans in the Tanjong
      Pagar district, the age-standardized prevalence of glaucoma was found to be 3.2% (95%
      confidence interval, 2.3-4.1) in the population 40 years and older.3

      Glaucoma has a major genetic basis, estimated to account for a third (range 20 - 60%) of all
      glaucoma cases, 6-8 although a recent report suggests that this is an underestimate.9 Genetic
      heterogeneity is illustrated by the more than 15 loci and 7 glaucoma-causing genes identified
      to date, 10 including 2 genes identified for POAG.11-12 A diverse variety of genetic
      mechanisms have been found to induce open angle and developmental glaucomas and these include
      coding mutations, particularly in transcription factors, 13 altered gene dosage14 and
      dominant negative effects.15

      Interleukin-1 is an important mediator of inflammation. There are 2 pro-inflammatory
      cytokines, Il-1 alpha and Il-1 beta. Both are produced by monocytes, macrophages and
      epithelial cells as host responses to tissue injury. The genes encoding Il-1 are located
      within a 430kb region on chromosome 2q14.216. Polymorphisms of the Il-1 gene cluster have
      been shown to alter protein _expression. Single nucleotide polymorphisms have been linked to
      other diseases such as pre-eclampsia among other medical conditions17.

      _Expression of the endothelial leukocyte adhesion molecule-1 (ELAM-1) in trabecular meshwork
      cells has been identified to be a diagnostic marker of glaucoma18. _Expression of ELAM-1 is
      controlled by activation of Il-1 autocrine feedback loop, which is controlled through
      transcription factor NF-Kappa –Beta. It has been shown that Il-1 produced endogenously by
      glaucomatous cells inhibits the apoptotic response to oxidative stress18. Il-1 has also been
      reported to increase outflow facility by stimulating the _expression of matrix
      metalloproteinase enzymes, which in turn reduces extra cellular resistance19-22. The effect
      of Il-1 on the synthesis of Nitric oxide causing a relaxation in ciliary muscle tone may also
      be contributory in increasing aqueous outflow23.

      Recently, Wang et al has shown that Il-1 variants result in increased secretion of Il-1 and
      thus reduces the risk of primary open angle glaucoma (POAG) 24. This was presented at the
      recent ARVO meeting 2005 in Florida, USA, under “ New ideas in glaucoma”. The group led by Dr
      Elizabeth Fini from Bascom Palmer Eye Institute, Miami, identified genetic variants (+3953T)
      of the Il-1 β, which is a protective factor against POAG. They assessed genomic DNA from 100
      POAG patients and 104 normal controls in the Caucasian population over 40 years. The allele
      frequency of Il-1 Beta (+3953T) was significantly higher in normal controls than in the POAG
      group (28% versus 17%, p=0.01). They also found that the allele frequency of Il-1 alpha
      (-889T) was higher in normal controls than in the POAG group at borderline significance (39%
      versus 29%, p=0.06). This may prove to be significant with a larger sample size.

      In this project, we hope to determine if polymorphisms in the Il-1 gene cluster found in the
      Caucasians are also protective for glaucoma patients in Asian populations. We also aim to
      determine if there are differences in the distribution of polymorphisms of the Il-1 gene
      cluster in normotensive glaucoma patients versus high-pressure glaucoma patients. Both
      primary angle closure and primary open angle glaucoma patients will be studied. The study
      will be the first to investigate such changes in PACG, a major cause of blindness in Asia,
      and considered to be an IOP-dependent disease. The study findings may have implications on
      the genetic basis of glaucoma, placing the focus on the role of the immune system in IOP
      response and glaucoma pathogenesis. This is a pilot study of the role of immune system
      related polymorphisms and depending on the results, we may embark on a larger investigation
      of the role of other immune genes in glaucoma.

      Methods

      Patient Recruitment:

      At least 300 patients with primary glaucoma will be recruited in the study from glaucoma
      clinics at Singapore National Eye Centre. This will consist of PACG, POAG and NTG patients.
      There will be another 100 control patients with no clinical evidence of glaucoma recruited
      from the general clinics. Individuals with secondary angle closure and other ocular diseases
      will be excluded.

      Patient assessment and examination Examination, of both eyes, will include best-corrected
      Snellen visual acuity, goniscopy, intraocular pressure measurement by Goldmann applanation
      tonometer, slit-lamp examination of the anterior segment, lens, vitreous and retina. In
      addition, a scanning laser ophthalmoscope, the Heidelberg retina tomograph (HRT, Heidelberg
      Engineering, Heidelberg, Germany) will be used to image the optic disc in all subjects.
      Global and segmental disc and cup areas will be analysed directly by means of HRT software
      (version 2.01b) using the standard reference plane. Rim area will be calculated by
      subtracting the cup area from the disc area. Glaucoma severity will be classified by global
      indices in the visual fields as well as by HRT neuroretinal rim area. Axial length will also
      be measured with the IOL-Master (Carl Zeiss Jena GmbH, Jena, Germany). 10 mls of blood will
      be obtained from each patient by venepuncture.

      Standardized inclusion criteria for glaucoma will be used, which is the presence of
      glaucomatous optic neuropathy (defined as loss of neuroretinal rim with a cup:disc ratio of
      0.7 or greater) with compatible visual field loss. PACG will be defined as the presence of at
      least 180 degrees of angle in which the trabecular meshwork is not visible on gonioscopy with
      the presence of glaucomatous optic neuropathy. POAG patients will have open angles on
      gonioscopy; POAG patients with a mean IOP without treatment that is consistently less than 21
      mm Hg on diurnal testing will be classified as NTG.

      DNA Preparation and Genotyping

      Genomic DNA will be extracted from leukocytes of the peripheral blood using Nucleon DNA
      Extraction kits. The Il-1alpha (-889), Il-beta (-511), and Il-1beta (+3953) variants will be
      detected by specific polymerase chain reaction (PCR) (using primers in Table 1), followed by
      digestion with restriction enzyme digests as described in Table 1. Confirmation of
      polymorphisms would be carried out by direct sequencing.

      The methodology is fairly straightforward and the lab work can be performed by Dr Alicia How
      (Registrar, SNEC) during her research session each week. Dr How has undergone basic molecular
      genetics lab training and will be supervised by Dr Aung Tin.
