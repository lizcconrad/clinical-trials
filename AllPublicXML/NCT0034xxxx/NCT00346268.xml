  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to demonstrate the opioid-sparing efficacy of
      parecoxib 40 mg intravenously given as a loading dose followed by 20 mg intravenously in the
      24 hours after the end of surgery.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study was terminated due to lack of recruitment due to competing alternative operation
      methods on 13September 2010. The decision to terminate the trial was not based on any safety
      concerns.

    <measure>Opiate Related Symptom Distress Scale (OR-SDS) Questionnaire: Overall Composite Score</measure>
    <time_frame>24 and 48 hours post surgery</time_frame>
    <description>Participant-rated scale assessed 10 common opiate related symptoms by 3 ordinal measures: frequency (1 to 4 scale: rarely to almost constantly), severity (1 to 4 scale: slight to very severe) and bothersomeness (1 to 5 scale: not at all to very much). Frequency and severity items assigned numeric scores 1 to 4. Bothersomeness items scaled in order to assign numeric scores 0.8 to 4.0 (not at all scored=0.8, a little bit=1.6, somewhat=2.4, quite a bit=3.2, and very much=4.0). Overall composite score=mean of each 10 individual mean symptoms' OR-SDS scores; ranged from 1 to 4.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  The patient's ASA physical status is 1 or 2 and he has a low risk (i.e.,&lt;10%) of
             developing an acute coronary event within the next 10 years according to the PROCAM
             risk assessment calculator.

          -  The patient is scheduled to undergo routine radical prostatectomy performed under a
             standardized regimen of general anesthesia, and is expected to experience moderate to
             severe postsurgical pain in the absence of postoperative analgesia.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  The patient has a history of uncontrolled chronic disease or a concurrent clinically
             significant illness or medical condition such as a diagnosed chronic pain condition,
             which, in the Investigator's opinion, would contraindicate study participation or
             confound interpretation of the results

          -  The patient has a history or current presence of congestive heart failure (NYHA
             II-IV), established ischaemic heart disease, peripheral arterial disease and / or
             cerebrovascular disease.

Frequency and severity items assigned numeric scores 1 to 4. Bothersomeness items scaled in order to assign numeric scores 0.8 to 4.0 (not at all scored=0.8, a little bit=1.6, somewhat=2.4, quite a bit=3.2, and very much=4.0). Overall composite score=mean of each 10 individual mean symptoms’ OR-SDS scores; ranged from 1 to 4.</description>
