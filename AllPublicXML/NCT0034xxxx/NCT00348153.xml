  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      TNF alpha Inhibitors have been very effective in treating rheumatologic diseases as well as
      uveitis. Adalimumab is the first member of a new class of TNF antibody compounds developed to
      contain exclusively human sequences. We want to test the efficacy and safety of the TNF alpha
      Inhibitor Adalimumab in patients with active uveitis despite standard immunosuppressive
      therapy.

      TNF alpha Inhibitors like Infliximab and Etanercept have been very effective in treating
      rheumatologic diseases. They have been used to treat severe uveitis by several groups, Suhler
      and coworkers have published the largest series in 2005. Adalimumab, a recombinant,
      full-length immunoglobulin, is the first member of a new class of TNF antibody compounds
      developed to contain exclusively human sequences. The duration of therapeutic efficacy of
      other TNF antibodies, which contain non-human sequences, may be limited to a greater extent
      by antibody responses raised in subjects over time. We want to test the efficacy and safety
      of the TNF alpha Inhibitor Adalimumab in patients with active uveitis despite standard
      immunosuppressive therapy requiring systemic corticosteroids &gt; 7,5mg prednisolone.
