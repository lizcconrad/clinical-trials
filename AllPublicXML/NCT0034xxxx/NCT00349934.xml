      Open label, non-randomized, fixed dose-escalation phase I study, performed in ambulatory
      setting in patients receiving as a first line chemotherapy for metastatic breast carcinoma
      the standard 6 cycles of weekly paclitaxel (80 mg/m² at D1, D8 and D15 of a 4-week cycle).
      Three IMP321 doses (0.25, 1.25 and 6.25 mg) will be tested and given at D2 and D16 of this
      4-week cycle, for 6 courses.

      This study is an open label, non-randomized, fixed dose-escalation phase I study, performed
      in ambulatory setting with patients receiving as a first line chemotherapy for metastatic
      breast carcinoma the standard 6 cycles of paclitaxel (80 mg/m² at D1, D8 and D15 of every
      4-week cycle). Twenty mg i.v. dexamethasone will be given in the first cycle before each
      paclitaxel infusion. Corticosteroids will not be administered after the first chemotherapy
      cycle if the first 3 i.v. infusions of paclitaxel have been well tolerated.

      Three IMP321 dose levels (0.25, 1.25 and 6.25 mg) will be evaluated in three cohorts of at
      lesat 8 patients. At any given dose level the patients will be administered one dose every
      two weeks for a total of 24 weeks (12 injections in total), separated by 13-day intervals
      free of IMP321 administration.

      The study drug will be given by subcutaneous injection:

        -  Cohort A: 0.25 mg s.c.

        -  Cohort B: 1.25 mg s.c.

        -  Cohort C: 6.25 mg s.c.

      The repeated single doses will be administered on D2 and D16 of the 4-week cycles, on the day
      which follows chemotherapy.

      After a screening performed between Week -2 and Day 1, patients will enter the main study
      period. Upon having completed the 6 cycles of IMP321 treatment at Week 23, they will have an
      ambulatory 'post-study' examination (at Week 25).

      Cohort B will be undertaken once the safety and tolerability results of Cohort A have been
      satisfactory; the investigator will take his decision for involving the last 8 patients of
      the study after the 6th administration (Week 13 assessment) of the fifth patient of Cohort A.
      All cohorts will follow the same schedule

      Standard clinical and laboratory safety examinations, CT scan and pharmacodynamic (PD) blood
      tests will be performed. A complete examination will be carried out at Week 13 (after the 6th
      drug dosing) and Week 25.
