        Ambulatory Diastolic Blood Pressure ≥ 85 mmHg

          -  Patient must have an absolute difference of ≤ 10 mmHg in their office Mean Sitting
             Diastolic Blood Pressure between Visit 2 and 3.

          -  Male or female patients are eligible. Female patients must be either post-menopausal
             for at least one year, surgically sterile or using effective contraceptive methods

             study drug discontinuation.

          -  Patients who are eligible and able to participate in the study, and who consent to do
             so after the purpose and nature of the investigation has been clearly explained to
             them (written informed consent).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Severe hypertension [Office Mean Sitting Diastolic Blood Pressure ≥ 110 mmHg and/or
