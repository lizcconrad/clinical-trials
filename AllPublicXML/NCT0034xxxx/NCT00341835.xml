      This study will search for genes that greatly increase the risk of developing lung cancer in
      conjunction with cigarette smoking or other environmental agents, or both. Lung cancer is the
      second most common cancer diagnosed among men and women and the leading cause of cancer death
      in the United States. It has been frequently given as an example of cancer determined only by
      the environment, certain occupations, and dietary habits. Yet researchers have long had a
      hypothesis that people vary in their risk of becoming affected when exposed to these factors.
      Also, some evidence has shown that lung cancer in families may be due to the combined effects
      of inheritance of a major gene and cigarette smoking.

      Individuals who have a confirmed diagnosis of lung cancer or a family history of lung cancer
      may be eligible to enroll their families in the study.

      Family members will be asked to do one or more of the following:

        -  Complete a questionnaire about personal medical history, lifestyle, and diet.

        -  Have blood drawn from a vein in the arm.

        -  If a family member has had a biopsy or is scheduled for one, give permission to obtain
           medical records and a portion of the stored tissue.

        -  If any relatives have died of cancer, sign a release form to allow researchers to get
           copies of medical and pathology records, and tissue samples from surgery.

      If the family members agree, they may be recontacted to answer questions about their health
      and those of their family, during an annual telephone conversation. Follow-up questionnaires
      may be sent to participants, to determine if any new cancers have developed in the family. In
      the event of a new cancer, the classification of the family may change from the low-risk to
      intermediate risk-level and from the intermediate-risk to high-risk level. Follow-up will
      continue, to get information about tumors and death. Also, a newsletter for lung cancer
      families will occasionally be distributed to participants. In the future, the Internet will
      also provide information for families.

      Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death in the US, and represents a significant
      burden on health care resources. Accumulated evidence suggests that there are genetic
      susceptibility components in lung cancer, and that gene-environment interactions are
      important. While major breakthroughs have been made in understanding the genetic
      susceptibility basis of other cancers, studies to identify specific major loci affection lung
      cancer risk are notably lacking. The high case fatality rate (14 percent 5-year survival
      rate) and low resection rate (25 percent) makes the study of lung cancer families
      particularly challenging because it is difficult to collect adequate numbers of biospecimens
      for DNA analysis. Only a collaborative effort to identify, accrue, and genotype familial lung
      cancer (FLC) families will be successful in characterizing the genetic basis of familial lung
      cancer.

      This project is part of a multi-center, multi-investigator, interdisciplinary team highly
      experienced in genetic epidemiology, gene mapping, lung biology, and cancer molecular
      genetics, known as the Genetic Epidemiology of Lung Cancer Consortium (GELCC) formed to
      identify a lung cancer susceptibility gene(s) and to estimate gene-environment interaction in
      the etiology of this neoplasm in order to elucidate a strategy for the prevention, control
      and clinical management of this disease through identification of genetically high-risk
      individuals.

      Confirmation of a genetic predisposition for lung cancer may be possible by using linkage
      analysis to localize the putative susceptibility gene to a specific chromosomal region. The
      strength of linkage analysis is dependent upon the recruitment of multiple large kindreds for
      which tissue samples are available and the history of tumor incidence exists for two,
      preferably more, generations. Our strategy is to combine the most informative pedigrees but
      preferably eventually up to 500 pedigrees. This strategy yields a substantial increase in
      power and cost-effectiveness over the usual strategy of each site working independently and
      genotyping many marginally informative families. To date this strategy appears successful, in
      that results from our first 52 genotyped families resulted in significant evidence in favor
      of linkage to a region on chromosome 6q and suggestive evidence for several other regions. We
      believe that ongoing data collection and analysis of these preliminary results will also be
      fruitful. Recently, the National Cancer Institute funded this ongoing project in a
      competitive renewal (5 years) of our multi-center R01 that supports data collection and work
      at all sites besides NHGRI and NCI.

      All data collection is under the direction of each P.I. at the data collection sites and
      funded by their respective grants and contracts. NHGRI investigators do not have any contact
      with study subjects and no NHGRI employees receive any funds from these grants. Because this
      disorder is complex and has a high likelihood of being caused by multiple loci, multiple
      parametric and non-parametric methods of analysis will be employed. Heterogeneity will be
      taken into account during these analyses, as will environmental covariates, such as the
      effect of smoking. Only statistical analyses are performed at the NHGRI site, but laboratory
      work ranging from genotyping, sequencing, array CGH, model organism experiments and other
      methods occurs at other sites as part of this collaboration.

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:

        All individuals with a histologically confirmed diagnosis of lung cancer or a family of
        lung cancer are eligible to enroll their family in the study. Five major histologic types
        of lung cancer, i.e., adenocardinoma, squamous cell, small cell, large cell, and
        unspecified nonsmall cell carcinoma will be included. In addition to lung cancer patients,
        LSU will also contact patients newly diagnosed with bronchus or tracheal cancer in target
        hospital areas to request their enrollment in their study. In addition, several sites
        including LSU, Mayo Clinic and Karmanos Cancer Institute also collect DNA samples from
        unaffected, geographically and ethnically matched controls.

        For the purposes of this study, an eligible family must meet the minimum criteria for
        familial lung cancer: at least 2 first-degree relatives in the family have had lung cancer.
        Priority will be given to more highly loaded pedigrees and to families in which the
        affected persons had onset of the disease at an early age (less than 50 years). Lung cancer
        cases may be living or deceased. Relatives with lung cancer are defined as first- o
        second-degree relatives or cousins of index cases will be eligible to participate in the
        study because their familial relationships might provide useful linkage information.

        Adult participants must be physically able to tolerate removal of 25 to 40 ml of blood, or
        buccal brush sampling of their cheek. Children above 5 years old must be able to physically
        tolerate an amount of blood drawn that is equal to 4ml/kg of their weight. Adults must be
        willing to complete a self-administered environmental exposure questionnaire, and all
        participants must be able to consent to the study procedures (or have appropriate
        assent/parental consent). Biological specimens, including blood samples, archived tumor
        blocks and other medical records will be obtained from patients treated at the various
        hospitals and collection sites and from individuals with strong family history of lung
        cancer (either affected or unaffected) who have either been self-referred or physician
        referred to the study.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

        Excluded from the study are families or individuals within the family who do not meet the
        minimum criteria described above. Individuals who do not sign the Consent Form will be
        excluded, and families for whom all necessary members do not sign the Consent Form may be
        excluded. MAYO also excludes patients who (1) do not speak English, (2) are non-US citizens
        or residents and (3) are diagnosed with an uncommon tumor type that is not among the above
        specified types (e.g.) mixed cell or unspecified non-small cell lung cancer, carcinoids,
        sarcomas and lymphomas of the lung and bronchus). This is done at MAYO because the family
        study is piggy-backed onto a case-control study. No fetuses, prisoners or institutionalized
        individuals will be enrolled. While this study does not target pregnant women, because
        contact with many of the families will be by mail we will not be able to exclude pregnant
        women. Additionally, the participant's own physician or health care clinic will draw blood
        samples from long-distance participants and therefore can determine if there is any risk to
        the woman or her fetus. UMHS also excludes children as research participants in their site.
