      RATIONALE: Giving healthy volunteers sulindac capsules or sulindac tablets may help doctors
      learn which form of the drug may be more effective in preventing cancer.

      PURPOSE: This randomized clinical trial is studying sulindac capsules to see how well they
      work compared with sulindac tablets in healthy volunteers.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Compare the systemic exposure of sulindac tablets vs sulindac capsules in healthy
           volunteers.

      Secondary

        -  Compare the terminal half-life and time of peak drug concentration of sulindac tablets
           vs sulindac capsules.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized study. Participants are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Participants receive one sulindac capsule followed 7-10 days later by one
           sulindac tablet.

        -  Arm II: Participants receive one sulindac tablet followed 7-10 days later by one
           sulindac capsule.

      Blood is collected periodically during treatment for pharmacokinetic studies.

      After completion of study therapy, participants are followed at 7-10 days.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 28 participants will be accrued for this study.
