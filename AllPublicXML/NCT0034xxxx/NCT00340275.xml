  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Bacterial vaginosis is a syndrome manifested by adverse alterations in vaginal microbial
      flora. It is present in 10 to 25% of women in the general population, and is the most common
      vaginal infection. It has been associated with a number of adverse sequelae in reproductive
      health including acquisition of HIV, pelvic inflammatory disease, cervical dysplasia, and
      complications of gynecological procedures. During pregnancy it has been associated with an
      increased risk of preterm birth an postpartum maternal infection. However, the vaginal
      microbial flora remains poorly understood. Information on variation in microbial flora and
      its association with BV from a longitudinal study is unavailable. This prospective
      observational study aims to advance our knowledge of the natural history and abnormal
      alteration in vaginal microbial flora, and to identify risk factors that are associated with
      these changes. A total of 5500 healthy, non-pregnant women of reproductive age will be
      enrolled and followed up in Birmingham, Alabama, for one year (baseline visit plus once every
      three months afterwards, totaling 5 visits). Detailed information on sociodemographic status,
      medical history, hygiene practice, sexual behavior and psychosocial stress will be collected
      through in-person interviews. Routine gynecological and dental examinations will be carried
      out during the study visits. Samples of vaginal secretion and blood will be collected.
      Laboratory tests to quantify vaginal microbial flora and to identify infection of bacterial
      vaginosis as well as common sexually transmitted diseases will be conducted. This project is
      expected to complete in 5 years.

        -  ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA:

          -  Females, age 15-44.

          -  Since bacterial vaginosis is primarily a condition of reproductive-age women, this
             study will be restricted to women regarded by demographers as reproductive age.

          -  Non-pregnant women whose last menstrual period is later than expected will undergo a
             urine pregnancy test. Women who become pregnant while on study will complete their
             next regularly scheduled study visit, following which their participation will
             terminate.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

          1. Immunocompromised status

             Receiving or expected to receive in the next 12 months cytotoxic or immunosuppressive
             drugs.

             Receiving or expected to receive in the next 12 months one or more 30-day courses of
             corticosteroids.

             Congenital or acquired immune deficiency; known HIV positivity.

          2. Primary or secondary affective disorder, psychosis, emotional or intellectual
             limitations that preclude informed consent.

          3. Non-fluency in English.

          4. Post-menopausal (natural or surgical).

          5. Status post hysterectomy or expected to undergo hysterectomy in the next 12 months.

          6. Status post pelvic radiotherapy, or expected to undergo pelvic radiotherapy in the
             next 12 months.

          7. Receiving or expected to receive chronic (daily for at least 30 days) antibiotics in
             the next 12 months.

          8. Planning to move out of the area in the next 12 months.

          9. Participating or expected to participate during the next 12 months in a clinical trial
             in which antibiotics or topical microbicides will be administered in a blinded manner.

         10. Women who unexpectedly develop one of these conditions during their participation will
             continue to be followed, unless a specific contraindication arises.
