      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as ifosfamide, etoposide, and carboplatin, work
      in different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by
      stopping them from dividing. Monoclonal antibodies, such as rituximab, can block cancer
      growth in different ways. Some block the ability of cancer cells to grow and spread. Others
      find cancer cells and help kill them or carry cancer-killing substances to them. Giving
      colony-stimulating factors, such as G-CSF, helps stem cells move from the patient's bone
      marrow to the blood so they can be collected and stored for peripheral stem cell transplant.
      Giving more chemotherapy, such as cyclophosphamide, carmustine, and etoposide, and total-body
      irradiation prepares the patient's bone marrow for the stem cell transplant. The stem cells
      are then returned to the patient to replace the blood-forming cells that were destroyed by
      the chemotherapy and radiation therapy. More radiation therapy is given after transplant to
      kill any remaining cancer cells.

      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well autologous peripheral stem cell transplant
      works in treating patients with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma or Hodgkin's lymphoma.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Determine the disease-free survival and overall survival of patients with non-Hodgkin's
           or Hodgkin's lymphoma treated with autologous peripheral blood stem cell transplantation
           (PBSCT).

        -  Verify the safety and efficacy of autologous PBSCT in patients with HIV disease and
           relapsed lymphoma.

      Secondary

        -  Evaluate immune reconstitution in HIV-positive patients undergoing autologous PBSCT and
           compare to immune reconstitution in HIV-negative patients.

        -  Predict the adequacy of peripheral blood stem cell (PBSC) harvest prior to flow analysis
           of a PBSC yield.

        -  Determine the time to engraftment for neutrophils and platelets.

      OUTLINE:

        -  Peripheral blood stem cell (PBSC) mobilization with filgrastim (G-CSF) alone: Patients
           not requiring further disease reduction receive G-CSF subcutaneously (SC) once daily on
           days 1-8. Patients undergo PBSC collection by leukapheresis on days 5-8. Patients who do
           not adequately mobilize with G-CSF alone proceed to chemo-mobilization.

        -  Chemo-mobilization: Patients requiring further disease reduction receive 1 of 2
           chemo-mobilization regimens.

             -  Patients with CD20+ non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) or lymphocyte predominant
                Hodgkin's lymphoma: Patients receive rituximab intravenously (IV) over 6-8 hours on
                day 1, ifosfamide IV over 2 hours and etoposide IV over 30 minutes on days 2-4, and
                carboplatin IV over 1 hour on day 2. Patients receive G-CSF SC once daily beginning
                on day 5 and continuing until leukapheresis is completed. Patients undergo PBSC
                collection by leukapheresis on days 12-15.

             -  All other patients: Patients receive ifosfamide IV over 2 hours and etoposide IV
                over 30 minutes on days 1-3 and carboplatin IV over 1 hour on day 1. Patients
                receive G-CSF SC once daily beginning on day 4 and continuing until leukapheresis
                is completed. Patients undergo PBSC collection by leukapheresis on days 12-15.

        -  Autologous PBSC transplantation (PBSCT) (Patients with NHL undergoing irradiation):
           Patients receive cyclophosphamide IV over 2 hours on days -7 and -6. Patients undergo
           total body irradiation (TBI) twice daily on days -4 to -1. Patients undergo autologous
           PBSCT on day 0. Patients receive G-CSF SC once daily beginning on day 5 and continuing
           until blood counts recover.

        -  Autologous PBSCT (Patients with Hodgkin's lymphoma or NHL not undergoing irradiation and
           cyclophosphamide): Patients receive camustine IV over 2 hours on days -6, etoposide IV
           over 2 hours twice daily on days -5 to -2, and melphalan over 1 hour on day -1. Patients
           undergo autologous PBSCT on day 0. Patients receive G-CSF SC once daily beginning on day
           5 and continuing until blood counts recover.

        -  Autologous PBSC transplantation (PBSCT) (Patients with HL not undergoing irradiation):
           Patients receive cyclophosphamide IV over 2 hours on days -6 to -3, camustine IV over 2
           hours on day -6, and etoposide IV over 4 hours twice daily on days -6 to -4. Patients
           undergo autologous PBSCT on day 0. Patients receive G-CSF SC once daily beginning on day
           5 and continuing until blood counts recover.

        -  Post-transplant irradiation: Patients undergo post-transplant irradiation beginning on
           day 28. Persisting nodal masses ≥ 2 cm are treated with additional localized external
           beam irradiation.

        -  Post-transplant Rituximab therapy: patients with CD20+ NHL may undergo Rituximab
           maintenance starting between day +45 and +90 and being repeated at day +180 ± 14 days.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 300 patients will be accrued for this study.
