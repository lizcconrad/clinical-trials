  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Vaccination is currently the most effective mean of controlling influenza and preventing its
      complications and mortality in persons at risk. Because of the variable nature of influenza
      viruses, the composition of influenza vaccines changes almost every year, to target the 3
      main circulating strains. Each year the influenza vaccine formulation may thus be different
      and clinical studies are mandated to ensure that the immunogenicity and safety of the vaccine
      formulated from the three annual circulating strains are similar to what was observed during
      the previous years.

      This study is designed to test the immunogenicity and reactogenicity of the Fluarix™ vaccine
      containing the influenza strains recommended for the 2006-2007 season.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  A male or female aged 18 years or above at the time of the vaccination;

          -  Healthy subjects or with well-controlled chronic diseases;

          -  If the subject is female, she must be of non-childbearing potential

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Use of any investigational or non-registered product other than the study vaccine(s)
             within 30 days preceding the vaccination or planned use during the study period.

          -  Chronic administration (defined as more than 14 days) of immunosuppressants or other
             immune-modifying drugs within six months prior to the first vaccine dose.

          -  Administration of immunoglobulins and/or any blood products within the three months
             preceding the administration of the study vaccine or planned during the study.

          -  Administration of an influenza vaccine within 6 months preceding the study start.

          -  Administration of an influenza vaccine other than the study vaccine during the entire
             study

          -  Clinically or virologically confirmed influenza infection within 6 months preceding
             the study start

          -  History of allergic disease or reactions likely to be exacerbated by any component of
             the vaccine.

          -  Acute disease at the time of enrolment.

          -  Acute clinically significant pulmonary, cardiovascular, hepatic or renal functional
             abnormality, as determined by physical examination or laboratory screening tests.

          -  Not stabilized or clinically serious chronic underlying disease

          -  Lactating female.

          -  History of chronic alcohol consumption and/or drug abuse.

          -  Any confirmed or suspected immunosuppressive or immunodeficient condition, based on
             medical history and physical examination

          -  Any condition which, in the opinion of the investigator, prevents the subject from
             participation in the study.
