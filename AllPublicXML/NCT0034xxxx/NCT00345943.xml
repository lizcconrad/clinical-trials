  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this project is to use both multimodal MRI and behavioral measures to investigate
      how changes in frontostriatal neural systems contribute to the development and persistence of
      Bulimia Nervosa (BN). Findings from this study will have wide-ranging importance for our
      understanding of the development and treatment of BN.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with Bulimia Nervosa (BN) have difficulty regulating impulsive behaviors as
      suggested by their binge-eating and purging, as well as the high incidence of drug abuse and
      shoplifting in this population. Understanding dysfunction in the frontostriatal circuitry
      that mediates self-regulatory control processes will aid development of new therapeutics for
      the impulsivity associated with BN. We are conducting a longitudinal study to better
      understand the development and persistence of BN.

      Participation in this study includes 4 sections: Neuropsychological Tests, Diagnostic
      interviews, Pregnancy Test, and MRI scan. All efforts are made to coordinate procedures into
      one day, and they require between 4 and 5 hours of the participant's time. The option of
      splitting participation into two study days is also offered for participants who find it more
      convenient. Participants are compensated with $100 in the form of a check, which is mailed to
      their home address. Participants will be invited back for follow-up visits.

          -  Current or prior DSM IV diagnosis of Bulimia Nervosa or Sub-threshold Bulimia Nervosa
             (those who meet all DSM-IV criteria for BN, but engage in subjective binge-eating
             episodes and binge/purge at a frequency of at least once per week for 3 months,
             whereas meeting full DSM-IV criteria for BN requires binge eating and purging twice
             per week for 3 months)
