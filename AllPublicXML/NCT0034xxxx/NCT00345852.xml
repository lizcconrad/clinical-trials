  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a study to compare two treatments (amnioreduction vs. selective fetoscopic laser
      photocoagulation [SFLP]) in patients with severe twin to twin transfusion syndrome.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      We hypothesize that treatment of the underlying chorioangiopagus by selective fetoscopic
      laser photocoagulation will not only improve the survival of twins but will reduce the
      incidence of neurologic, cardiac, and developmental sequelae of twin-twin transfusion
      syndrome (TTTS). We propose to test this hypothesis by a prospective randomized multicenter
      trial to compare serial amnioreduction with selective fetoscopic laser photocoagulation in
      cases of severe (stage II-IV) twin-twin transfusion syndrome (TTTS). Primary Outcomes:
      Survival of donor twin at 30 days after birth and no treatment failure; Survival of recipient
      twin at 30 days after birth and no treatment failure; Secondary Outcomes: Survival times of
      each twin in utero or after birth (which may be censored at 30 days after birth); Gestational
      age at delivery; Placental insufficiency; Cardiac outcome: echocardiographic evidence of
      cardiac compromise; Neurologic outcome: evidence of brain injury preceding birth by MRI;
      Postnatal comorbidity

          -  Single placental mass

          -  Thin intertwin membrane

          -  Oligohydramnios in donor twin (deepest vertical pocket of â‰¤ 2 cm)

        Exclusion Criteria:
