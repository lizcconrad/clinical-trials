      This study will compare the effectiveness of counseling plus use of a nicotine patch with
      counseling alone for helping pregnant women quit smoking. Smoking during pregnancy is the
      most preventable cause of fetal and newborn health problems such as low birth weight, fetal
      growth retardation, sudden infant death syndrome, spontaneous abortion, decreased lung
      function and premature delivery.

      African-American and Hispanic women 18 years of age or older, smoke cigarettes, and live in
      the District of Columbia metropolitan area may be eligible for this study. Candidates are
      recruited from the George Washington University and Providence Hospital prenatal health
      clinics. They are screened with a review of their medical records and a survey that includes
      questions about their age, residency, race and ethnicity, educational level and employment
      status, number of weeks pregnant, and exposure to cigarette smoke and other types of tobacco.

      Participants answer questions about their smoking behavior, then receive a 10-minute
      counseling session and watch a videotape about quitting smoking. Women who are not able to
      quit smoking in 1 week are then randomly assigned to one of two treatment groups. One group
      continues to receive counseling sessions during the remainder of their pregnancy; the second
      group receives nicotine patches as well as the counseling sessions. In addition, all
      participants watch a video about smoking and receive a guide to help them quit. Women who
      receive the patches must stop smoking completely. If they cannot stop immediately, their
      participation in the study ends. The behavioral counseling sessions for all the women are a
      series of conversations between the women and a trained counselor to help the woman through
      the process of quitting.

      Participants are followed during the study with six clinic visits and three telephone calls.
      During the first visit, the women answer a series of questions about their smoking habits and
      health concerns. A portion of the urine sample they provide during their routine prenatal
      visit is used by this study to assess their cotinine (a breakdown product of nicotine)
      levels. Saliva and breath samples to test for cotinine and carbon monoxide levels are
      collected at each visit. Saliva is collected by brushing the inside of the cheek with a
      cotton swab, and breath samples are collected by having the woman blow into a tube connected
      to a machine. Participants are evaluated four times during the study with questions about
      their smoking behavior.

      With the women's permission, their medical records, health, and treatments during pregnancy
      are reviewed. At the end of the pregnancy, the infant's weight and health are also reviewed.

      The overall focus of the proposed concept submitted by the George Washington University
      Medical Center investigators is &quot;The Efficacy of NRT to Reduce the Risk of Nicotine Exposure
      in Pregnant Minority Smokers.&quot; Prenatal smoke exposure to the fetus and environmental tobacco
      smoke exposure of infants and children causes significant harm in both the short- and
      long-term. Smoking during pregnancy is the foremost preventable cause of perinatal morbidity
      and mortality. There is strong evidence that these exposures are associated with low birth
      weight (LBW) and infant mortality, respiratory illness, ear infections, tonsillectomy and
      adenoidectomy, asthma, and sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS), developmental delay, and
      increased health care utilization and hospitalizations.

      George Washington University Medical Center investigators are submitting two concept papers
      that aim to test the efficacy of innovative intervention methods tailored to reduce fetal and
      infant exposure to nicotine secondary to maternal smoking and environmental tobacco exposure.
