      Providing Access to the Visual Environment is a pediatric low vision grant which has the
      ability to provide comprehensive, interdisciplinary low vision rehabilitation services to
      every child in Tennessee with a vision impairment. Children, ages 3-21, with best-corrected
      vision of 20/50 or worse in the better seeing eye are prescribed optical devices to improve
      their visual functioning and trained to use the devices.

      Subjects are enrolled each school year based on referrals from school systems in Tennessee,
      ophthalmologists, and optometrists. A total of 90 new students are enrolled each year.
      Students are provided a comprehensive low vision rehabilitation evaluation by a low vision
      optometrist and prescribed optical devices to improve distance appreciation, near reading,
      and other tasks based on individual needs. Students are then trained to use the devices
      efficiently by master's level teachers of the visually impaired. The teachers travel to the
      students environment (school/home/work) for the training.

      Variables such as ocular disease, age, visual acuity, visual improvement with optical
      devices, type of optical device, and reading speed are defined for each student. Providing
      Access to the Visual Environment also provides...
