  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Despite evidence of high rates of concurrent substance use and anger problems among problem
      gamblers, until recently there have been no empirically evaluated treatments for these
      co-morbid problems. A recent study (Korman, Collins, McMain, &amp; Skinner, 2005) found that an
      emotion and behaviour regulation treatment (EBRT) was more effective than a gambling-only
      treatment-as-usual in engaging clients in treatment and in reducing gambling, anger, and
      substance use. This study is a replication of Korman et al's study and will compare an
      emotion and behaviour regulation treatment (EBRT) for problem gambling, anger and substance
      use to a manualized cognitive behavioural treatment (CBT) for problem gambling.

      80 participants will be randomly assigned to either an emotion and behaviour regulation
      treatment (EBRT) or to a cognitive behavioural treatment (CBT). Randomization will be
      stratified by the presence of substance dependence disorder. Both treatment conditions will
      consist of 12 one-hour weekly outpatient individual sessions. Participants will be assessed
      at baseline, end of treatment, and 3-months, 6-months and 12-months follow-up.
