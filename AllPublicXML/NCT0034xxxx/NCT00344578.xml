      To evaluate the clinical outcomes of AcrySof® ReSTOR® IOL for the Faculty Practice at UTSW
      Medical Center at Dallas

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The AcrySof® ReSTOR® intraocular lens (IOL) is the latest advance in vision surgery. This IOL
      has been uniquely designed to improve vision throughout the entire visual spectrum, up close,
      far away and everything in-between. Thus, giving cataract patients their best chance ever to
      function free of glasses.

      The pre-operative and post-operative data from ReSTOR® IOL implant cataract surgeries will be
      analyzed to determine whether the desired outcome was achieved, i.e. excellent vision with no
      correction. Variables to be studied include patient age, gender, number of ReSTOR® IOL
      implants, ocular comorbidities, preoperative and postoperative corrected and uncorrected
      visual acuities, keratometry readings, and corneal topography readings. A patient survey will
      also be sent to patients having undergone the surgery to measure their level of satisfaction.

      Project Goals: The ultimate outcome of this project is to learn more insight on the
      following:

        1. Visual acuity with and without correction of distance and near at 3-6 months

        2. Percent of patients requiring keratorefractive surgery

        3. Ocular comorbidity subgroup analysis

        4. Monocular implantation subanalysis (prior to LASIK)

        5. Comparison of post-op spherical equivalent to target refraction

        6. Posterior capsule opacity that may be treated with laser procedure known as a YAG laser
           capsulotomy?

        7. Subjective patient satisfaction

        8. Validated questionnaire assessing visual function and quality of life
