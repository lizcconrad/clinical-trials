      The purpose of this clinical trial is to find out whether or not the combination of NOV-002
      with chemotherapy (paclitaxel and carboplatin) is better at improving overall survival time
      when compared to chemotherapy alone in people with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).

      Earlier clinical trials in NSCLC showed that patients treated with NOV-002 in combination
      with chemotherapy had a better response (their tumors got smaller in one United States Phase
      1/2 trial) than patients who received chemotherapy alone; and in two Phase 2 trials done in
      Russian patients, at the end of one year, patients treated with NOV-002 with chemotherapy had
      a better survival rate than patients who did not receive NOV-002 with their chemotherapy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      NSCLC is a widespread disease with extremely high mortality and morbidity. Even the most
      widely accepted standard of care chemotherapy in advanced NSCLC, platinum-based doublets, are
      only palliative, providing marginal efficacy as measured by survival. In addition, such
      chemotherapy is accompanied by severe, sometimes life-threatening, toxicities which often
      limit its application. Thus, there is a clear need for new, more effective and safer
      therapies for advanced NSCLC. In Phase 2 trials, NOV-002 demonstrated a higher response rate
      and improved survival compared to chemotherapy alone in patients with advanced NSCLC, and was
      well-tolerated in this patient group. Thus, we are conducting a large Phase 3 trial of
      NOV-002 to better define its clinical profile and potential benefit in advanced NSCLC
      patients.

      The overall design of this Phase 3 trial reflects major elements of the previous Russian and
      US clinical trials in advanced NSCLC - it is an open label, randomized controlled trial
      comparing NOV-002 in combination with first-line chemotherapy (paclitaxel + carboplatin) to
      first-line chemotherapy alone. Furthermore, it is designed and powered to be a pivotal,
      registrational trial, sufficient for approval. As its primary efficacy endpoint, this Phase 3
      trial aims to demonstrate that the combination of NOV-002 with paclitaxel and carboplatin
      results in improved overall survival when compared with paclitaxel and carboplatin alone. In
      addition, several secondary efficacy endpoints will be assessed, including progression free
      survival, tumor response rate and duration of response, quality of life, myelosuppression and
      immunomodulation. Overall survival was chosen as the primary endpoint of this trial in the
      context of FDA (Draft) Guidance (&quot;Clinical Trial Endpoints for the Approval of Cancer Drugs
      and Biologics&quot;, April 2005). This Guidance indicates that an improvement in overall survival
      should be evaluated in randomized controlled trials and is of unquestioned clinical benefit.
      It indicates that the endpoint is precise and easy to measure, documented by the date of
      death, and states that bias is not a factor in endpoint measurement, and blinding is not
      essential. This Phase 3 randomized, controlled, open-label trial thus conforms to this
      Guidance.

    <description>Paclitaxel and carboplatin: (All randomized patients)
All randomized patients will follow the established 21-day cycle of paclitaxel and carboplatin including the administration of pre-medications for these products per the package inserts. Paclitaxel and carboplatin cycles will be administered until documented disease progression or completion of 6 cycles of paclitaxel and carboplatin in the absence of response or unacceptable related toxicity, whichever comes first.
The initial dose of chemotherapy for every patient in the trial is 200 mg/m2 of paclitaxel,as a 3 hour infusion, followed by carboplatin at an area under the curve (AUC) of 6 mg/mL/min using the Calvert equation for carboplatin dosing.</description>

Two 60mg intravenous boli given 3 hours apart administered the day prior to the first administration of paclitaxel and carboplatin cycle one
For each nominal 21-day paclitaxel and carboplatin cycle:
60mg given intravenously on Day 1, given one hour prior to paclitaxel and carboplatin
followed by 60mg subcutaneously daily for the next 20 days. If there is a delay in chemotherapy cycles, the patient will continue with daily, subcutaneous administration of NOV-002 until the next cycle of chemotherapy begins.
Patients randomized to NOV-002 Group A, will receive NOV-002 until disease progression, unacceptable NOV-002 related toxicity, or discontinuation of paclitaxel and carboplatin, whichever comes first.</description>
