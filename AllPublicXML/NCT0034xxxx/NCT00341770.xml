  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Obesity is the consequence of an imbalance between energy intake and energy expenditure.
      Recent studies have suggested that the sympathetic nervous system (SNS) may be an important
      determinant of the rate of energy expenditure in man. Indirect assessments of the sympathetic
      nervous activity in Pima Indians have recently shown impaired SNS-mediated energy expenditure
      in this obesity-prone population. We plan to perform direct microelectrode nerve recording of
      the sympathetic innervation of the lower leg to directly assess SNS activity and examine its
      potential role in the regulation of metabolic rate and the development of obesity.
      Measurements will be performed in the basal state, in response to glucose feeding (75 g OGTT)
      and in response to glucose/insulin infusion. These studies also will help to disassociate the
      effect of insulin and glucose on the stimulation of SNS activity. Energy expenditure
      measurements will be performed over 24 hours in the respiratory chamber and for 2 1/2 hours
      before and during the euglycemic clamp. Results also will be used to determine possible
      racial differences between Pimas and Caucasians, since the risk for obesity is markedly
      different in these populations. To exclude the possibility of a &quot;normal&quot; SNS activity but
      with peripheral resistance to the action of norepineprine, we will perform adrenergic
      stimulation by isoproterenol to measure peripheral adrenergic sensitivity.

      potential role in the regulation of metabolic rate and the development of obesity.
      Measurements will be performed in the basal state, in response to glucose feeding (75 g
      OGTT), in response to a standard meal, and in response to glucose/insulin infusion. These
      studies also will help to disassociate the effect of insulin and glucose on the stimulation
      of SNS activity. The association between postprandial changes in SNS activity and subjective
      ratings of hunger and fullness also will be studied. Energy expenditure measurements will be
      performed over 24 hours in the respiratory chamber and for 2 1/2 hours before and during the
      euglycemic clamp. Results also will be used to determine possible racial differences between
      Pimas and Caucasians, since the risk for obesity is markedly different in these populations.

      peripheral adrenergic sensitivity.
