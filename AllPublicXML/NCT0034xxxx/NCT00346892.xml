  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      &quot;The primary objective of this study was to demonstrate that co-administering HRV vaccine
      with OPV does not induce a significant decrease in poliovirus immune response one month after
      the third dose of combined vaccines.

      The primary objective was reached if one month after the third dose of polio vaccine, upper
      limit of the 95% CI for the difference in Seroprotection rate between the group B and C
      pooled and (minus) the group A was below 10% for each polio serotype.&quot;

      The study had three groups: Group A: HRV + OPV + DTPa/Hib; Group B: HRV + placebo OPV +
      DTPa-IPV/Hib; Group C: HRV Placebo + OPV + DTPa/Hib. Two cohorts: Subjects enrolled before
      the 2002 RV season were to receive two doses of HRV or placebo at approximately 6 and 10
      weeks of age (first cohort) and subjects enrolled after the 2002 RV season received
      vaccinations at approximately 10 and 14 weeks of age (second cohort). Routine EPI
      vaccinations were to be administered concomitantly with the study vaccines.
