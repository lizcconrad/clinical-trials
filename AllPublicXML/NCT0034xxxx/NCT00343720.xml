  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to establish the objective response rate (complete response +
      partial response), following treatment with Alimta plus VELCADE, Alimta alone, or VELCADE
      alone in patients with locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who
      have failed prior preventative therapy for Stage IIIb/IV NSCLC. The Alimta alone treatment
      group will be used as the control. The VELCADE single-agent treatment group will be used to
      determine if VELCADE administered weekly can demonstrate response rates.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Men or women, 18 years of age or older

             NSCLC

          -  Failed one prior line of systemic antineoplastic therapy for Stage IIIb/IV NSCLC (one
             additional prior line allowed if given as neoadjuvant, or adjuvant therapy to tumor
             resection)

          -  Subject must have documented progressive disease (PD) since previous systemic
             antineoplastic therapy

          -  Has measurable disease per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST)
             criteria

          -  Has an ECOG performance status score of 0 or 1

          -  Has a life expectancy greater than 3 months

          -  Female subjects must be postmenopausal (for at least 6 months), surgically sterile,
             abstinent, or, if sexually active, be practicing an effective method of birth control
             (e.g., prescription oral contraceptives, contraceptive injections, intrauterine
             device, double-barrier method, contraceptive patch, male partner sterilization) before
             entry and throughout the study; and have a negative serum or urine β-human chorionic
             gonadotropin (hCG) pregnancy test at screening.

          -  Subjects (or their legally acceptable representatives) must have signed an informed
             consent document indicating that they understand the purpose of and procedures
             required for the study and are willing to and able to comply with the protocol
             requirements and participate in the study before any study-related procedure not part
             of normal medical care is conducted.

          -  In countries where health authorities have approved the pharmacogenomic and protein
             testing, subjects (or their legally acceptable representatives) must have signed an
             informed consent for testing indicating that they agree to participate in the genetic
             part and protein testing part of the study; participation in the genetic and protein
             testing component is mandatory for testing, but optional for future research.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Has peripheral neuropathy of Grade 2 or greater intensity, as defined by the National
             Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE Version

          -  Has received 2 or more prior lines of antineoplastic therapies for Stage IIIb/IV NSCLC

          -  Any prior systemic antineoplastic therapy for NSCLC (i.e., prior chemotherapy,
             radiation therapy, prior monoclonal antibodies or any investigational drug or any
             major surgery) within 4 weeks before randomization

             resected or completely eliminated by radiation therapy and/or chemotherapy, or
             clinical or radiographic evidence that they have recurred. Subjects with a history of
             brain metastases are required to have had a brain computed tomography (CT) or magnetic
             resonance imaging (MRI) scan conducted within 1 month of enrollment to verify the
             continuing absence of brain metastases.
