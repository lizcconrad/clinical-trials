      The purpose of this study is to determine whether post-operative concurrent chemoradiation
      with paclitaxel/carboplatin is effective and safe in the treatment of high risk cervical
      cancer patients.

      Stage Ib to IIa cervical cancer can be treated effectively with either radioterapy or radical
      hysterectomy plus pelvic lymph node dissection. However, several pathological risk factors
      have been identified to compromise the treatment outcome. They include lymph node metastasis,
      the involvement of vaginal resection margin, and the parametrial invasion. In these patients,
      postoperative RT is commonly recommended and has been demonstrated to improve the local
      control, but not survival rate. Recently, It is reported that the additon of concurrent
      chemotherapy to postoperative RT reduced pelvic failures and enhanced progression free
      survival. In addition, paclitaxel/platinum combination chemotherapy was demonstrated to have
      superior progression-free survical over single agent platinum in a primary treatment of stage
      IV or recurrent cervical cancer.

      Based on this obseration, we evaluated the efficacy and safety of CCRT with
      paclitaxel/carboplatin in patients with postoperative high risk factors.
