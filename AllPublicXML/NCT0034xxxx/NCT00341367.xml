  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study attempts to identify genes that may increase or decrease the likelihood of sciatic
      pain (shooting pain down the leg) persisting 1 year after treatment of a herniated spinal
      disc. Many proteins in the nerves, spinal cord, and brain are involved in processing pain.
      These proteins vary slightly in different people. Animal studies have shown that rats and
      mice with certain types of proteins experience chronic pain after sciatic injury while those
      with other types do not. Better information about the role of genes in pain processing may
      lead to a test for the risk of chronic pain for specific individuals and more effective
      treatment approaches.

      This study will include people who participated in the Maine Lumbar Pain Study of the natural
      history of spinal pain. The Maine study included patients treated for sciatic pain caused by
      a herniated disc. In this study, patients who did not improve with medical treatment were
      referred for surgery to remove the disc. Of those referred for surgery, 275 elected to have
      the operation, and 232 did not. One year after surgical consultation, leg pain was reduced in
      81 percent of patients who underwent surgery. Of those who declined surgery, 56 percent
      improved after 1 year. This study will look for genetic differences in the non-surgical group
      that might reveal differences among those who improved and those who did not.

      Participants will provide a blood sample (approximately 2 tablespoons) for genetic testing.
      They will also provide information on the ethnic background of their parents and
      grandparents. Different gene variants occur in different ethnic groups, so information on
      ethnic background will help researchers know what gene variants to look for. Participants
      will complete a questionnaire about their smoking history, because the same protein in the
      brain that responds to nicotine may also play a part in decreasing or increasing pain. Also,
      some surgeons believe that smoking can interfere with spinal bone healing. Information from
      this study will help resolve this question.

      Many patients have persistent pain one year after herniated lumbar disc even when the disc is
      surgically removed or shrinks spontaneously. We hypothesize that the risk of persistent pain
      is modified by common variations in genes related to inflammation and pain processing. We
      propose to collect blood for DNA analysis from up to 500 patients who have been followed for
      10 years after the onset of severe sciatica in the Maine Lumbar Spine Study. Based on the
      pain research literature, Human Genome databases, and gene studies in NIAAA's Laboratory of
      Neurogenetics, we will prioritize approximately 100 candidate genes with variants that affect
      the function of their proteins. We will type patients' DNA for these variants and compare
      their clinical data with their genotype at each candidate gene to see if common variants
      increase or decrease the risk of chronic pain. The primary phenotype variable will be the
      amount of persistent leg pain one year after pain onset, Identification of such associations,
      if replicated in future studies, may help to prioritize targets for drug treatments or
      identify genetic tests that can predict the prognosis of acute sciatica and assist in
      treatment choice.
