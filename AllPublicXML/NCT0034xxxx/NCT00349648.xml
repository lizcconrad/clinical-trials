  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Study hypothesis: The impingement syndrome of the rotator cuff is a common cause of shoulder
      pain for which the most effective treatment is unknown. Steroid injections and
      anti-inflammatory analgetics are considered as effective methods. Physiotherapy and
      acromioplasty are commonly used treatments.

      Hypothesis: Arthroscopy and acromioplasty in addition to conservative treatment is equally
      effective as conservative treatment alone for shoulder impingement syndrome.

      The aim of this study was to examine the effectiveness of arthroscopic acromioplasty in the
      treatment of the shoulder impingement syndrome. Nonoperative treatment consisted of
      information given by a trained physiotherapist. The patients were supervised with a
      progressive programme to improve the mobility and muscle strength of the shoulder region
      which was regularly controlled. The exercises aimed at strengthening the stabilising muscles
      of the glenohumeral joint (m. trapezius, m. deltoides, m. supraspinatus and m. infraspinatus)
      and activating the decompressive muscles of the the subacromial space (m. teres major and
      minor, m. subscapularis). The programme lasted for three months. In addition the patients
      were given advice for daily home exercise.

      In the surgical group the patients underwent an arthroscopic examination and acromioplasty
      done by one experienced orthopaedic specialist. Postoperatively the patients received similar
      physiotherapeutical information and training programme than in the conservative treatment
      group.

      The follow-up evaluations were performed at 3, 6 and 12 months from the beginning of each
      treatment in addition at 24 months counted from the randomization. A trained research
      physiotherapist who was blinded to the treatment group and had not been involved in their
      treatment performed a standardized assessment of all patients. The range of motion, muscle
      strengths and Neer´s tests were recorded. At each evaluation the patients completed a
      structured questionnaire.
