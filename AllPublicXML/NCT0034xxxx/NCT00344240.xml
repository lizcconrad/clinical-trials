  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the project is to better understand how exercise and education will help
      mobility and health in older adults with diabetes. The investigators are trying to learn what
      type of exercises and classes are needed to help older adults stay active. This knowledge
      will eventually prove useful in helping patients and doctors understand what is needed to
      keep older adults with Type 2 diabetes as healthy as possible.

      1. Information and health screening: Interested persons are screened for eligibility and
           undergo a directed medical history and examination, echocardiogram (if not done within
           one year), limited ABI test, and maximal treadmill test with oxygen kinetics.

        2. Measure fitness level at the beginning of the exercise training, at 10 and 20 weeks:
           DEXA scan, body fat analysis, strength and balance measurements, and blood tests.

        3. Train for 10 weeks in a supervised small group format. Classes meet three times a week
           for an hour. Participants are randomly assigned to:

      1) Flexibility and toning exercises + health education, or 2) Functional circuit training +
      home activities + tailored physical activity guidance.

      4. Follow-up phone calls for an additional 10 weeks.
