  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Early pregnancy is associated with numerous physiologic alterations - many of which are
      required to establish normal pregnancy outcome. Three-dimensional ultrasound may provide new
      opportunities to better characterize some of these early changes. This noninvasive method
      allows one to arbitrarily scan through a digital ultrasound volume data, visualize organs
      from different perspectives, and render anatomical features through computer processing.
      Retrospective measurement of distances and volumes are even possible in the physical absence
      of the patient.

      New information provided by three-dimensional ultrasound may lead to improved understanding
      about how to counsel parents regarding early pregnancy complications such as bleeding. For
      example, vaginal bleeding complicates approximately 15-20% of first trimester pregnancies. A
      common association is subchorionic hemorrhage which is associated with increased risk for
      miscarriage, preterm delivery, preterm premature rupture of membranes, stillbirth, and
      placental abruption. Several studies have attempted to characterize subchorionic hemorrhage
      by conventional two-dimensional ultrasound which is not particularly well-suited for accurate
      measurement of small irregular hematomas. Consequently, there has been considerable debate
      about the significance of this finding especially in asymptomatic women who undergo prenatal
      ultrasound examination for other reasons.

      This protocol will attempt to identify prognostic indicators of adverse pregnancy outcome. A
      maximum of 400 pregnant women up to 20 weeks' gestation with sonographically detected
      subchorionic hemorrhage will be serially studies to characterize sac volume, placental
      volume, hematoma volume, and placental blood vessel patterns by 3DUS techniques. These
      results will be correlated with pregnancy outcome, hormonal markers, and placental pathology.
      This information is expected to improve our understanding of the natural history of
      subchorionic bleeding and spontaneous miscarriages as well as prognostic factors influencing
      pregnancy outcome in both symptomatic and asymptomatic women.

      Miscarriage is the most common outcome of pregnancy. Vaginal bleeding complicates up to 25%
      of all pregnancies, and this clinical sign is associated with an increased risk of
      spontaneous abortion (also known as miscarriage) and other adverse pregnancy outcomes, such
      as spontaneous preterm labor, preterm premature rupture of the membranes, pre-eclampsia and
      intrauterine growth restriction. Despite the importance of vaginal bleeding in clinical
      obstetrics, there is inadequate understanding about the mechanisms leading to vaginal
      bleeding, and of tests to predict pregnancy outcome in the majority of cases.

      A common finding in patients with first trimester vaginal bleeding is subchorionic
      hemorrhage, which is associated with an increased risk of miscarriage, preterm delivery,
      preterm premature rupture of membranes, stillbirth, and placental abruption. Previous
      attempts to characterize subchorionic hemorrhage have used two-dimensional ultrasound, which
      is not well-suited for accurate measurement of the volume irregular hematomas. It is not
      surprising that there has been debate about the significance of subchorionic hemorrhage,
      especially in asymptomatic women undergoing prenatal ultrasound examination for other reasons
      in which an intrauterine hematoma is found. Three-dimensional ultrasonography has the
      potential to improve the characterization of volume and location of intrauterine hematomas.
      This information may be of value in predicting pregnancy outcome.

      The Perinatology Research Branch proposes that first trimester bleeding is one of the great
      obstetrical syndromes; conditions characterized by a collection of signs and symptoms (in
      this case vaginal bleeding and cramping), with multiple etiologies. We propose that first
      trimester bleeding may be the result of a hemostatic disorder of the prenatal endometrium
      (deciduas), caused by pathologic factors including (1) genetic disorders such as chromosomal
      abnormalities which often is the result in miscarriage in the first trimester of pregnancy;
      (2) congenital or acquired hemostatic abnormalities due to thrombophilic mutations; (3)
      abnormal endocrine processes which may lead to dysregulation of endometrial events required
      for successful pregnancy; (4) abnormal immunological responses in the maternal/embryo/fetal
      interface. These abnormalities, which could have clinical significance, cannot be
      investigated with ultrasound. This protocol describes a comprehensive and systematic study of
      women who present with bleeding during the first trimester of pregnancy, to improve
      understanding of the relationship between the location and the size of hematomas (with
      three-dimensional ultrasounds) and the other factors that may determine the subsequent
      development of adverse pregnancy outcome.

      The Branch will execute this protocol by establishing a first-trimester clinic to study
      patients who present with this common complication of pregnancy. First trimester bleeding is
      a common and important complication of pregnancy which has been a neglected area of
      investigation by private and public agencies. We intend to address what has been an orphan
      area of clinical research.

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:

        All pregnant subjects will be recruited under informed consent at Hutzel Hospital. The
        study population for both arms of this protocol will involve pregnant women between the
        ages of 15 years-old and older at Hutzel Hospital. The ethnic backgrounds are estimated to
        involve approximately 60 percent Caucasian and 40 percent African American between both
        sides.

          -  Accurate pregnancy dating criteria.

          -  Estimated gestational age less than or equal to 20 weeks' gestation.

          -  Visible fetus with normal heart rate and rhythm.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

          -  Poor visualization of the fetus due to technical factors (e.g. obesity).

          -  Risk factors that increase risk for not keeping serial ultrasound appointments.

          -  Desire not to have vaginal ultrasound scans.
