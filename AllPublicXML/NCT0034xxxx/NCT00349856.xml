      The purpose of the study is to evaluate the fit and performance of an investigational soft
      contact lens in comparison with a currently marketed lens. Both lenses will be worn on a
      continuous wear basis, which means the lenses will be worn while sleeping.

             protocol-specified schedule of follow-up visits.

          5. Is correctable with the prescription of the available lenses (-1.00 to -4.00 DS in
             0.50D step).

          6. Is correctable to at least 20/40 distance visual acuity with contact lenses in each
             eye.

          7. Is a current soft contact lens wearer (both daily wear and extended wear experience
             allowed).

          8. Has refractive astigmatism of &lt;= 1.00 diopters

          9. Has clear corneas and ocular clinical findings considered to be &quot;normal&quot;.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Has any systemic disease affecting ocular health.

          2. Is using any systemic or topical medications that will affect ocular health.

          3. Has any ocular pathology or severe insufficiency of lacrimal secretion (dry eyes) that
             would affect the wearing of contact lenses.

          4. Has any clinically significant lid or conjunctival abnormalities, neovascularization,
             corneal scars or corneal opacities.

          5. Has limbal injection, bulbar injection or corneal staining that, in the Investigator's
