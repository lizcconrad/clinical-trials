  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an observational, exposure-registration and follow-up study, to be conducted in the
      United States (US). The AMEVIVE® Pregnancy Exposure Registry is designed to monitor pregnant
      subjects and fetuses exposed to AMEVIVE® in order to detect any potential increase in the
      risk of major birth defects.

      The AMEVIVE® Pregnancy Exposure Registry is sponsored by Astellas Pharma Global Development
      and will be managed by INC Research. The Registry will be monitored by an independent
      Advisory Committee of external experts in relevant specialties of teratology, epidemiology,
      maternal and fetal medicine, and infectious disease medicine (external member details
      available upon request).

  <detailed_description>

      Prospective reports will be collected from pregnant subjects, health care provider (HCP), or
      Astellas Product Safety Management staff. Data from the pregnant subjects will be collected
      at 4 to 5 months of pregnancy by telephone interviews with the Registry. The Registry will
      also contact the subject at 2 months and 12 months after the estimated delivery date (EDD)
      for post-natal &amp; pediatric follow-up. The Registry will confirm the information collected
      from the subject with the HCP by telephone interviews with the Registry, forms mailed/faxed
      to the Registry, electronic forms/queries sent to the Registry, or a combination of these
      methods. If a live birth is reported, the infant's HCP will be contacted for the Pediatric
      Follow-Up at 2 months and 12 months of age. If a birth defect is reported, targeted follow-up
      will be conducted.
