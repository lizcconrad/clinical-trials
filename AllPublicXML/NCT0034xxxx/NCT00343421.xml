      The purpose of this study is to evaluate safety and immunogenicity of Pediacel® in infants
      and toddlers when given at 2,3,4 and 12-18 months of age.

      Primary Objectives:

        -  To compare the post-dose 3 immunogenicity of Pediacel® to Infanrix®-IPV+Hib when both
           are co-administered with Prevenar®.

        -  To describe the post-dose 3 pertussis antibody responses.

      Secondary Objectives:

        -  To compare the post-dose 4 immunogenicity of Pediacel® to Infanrix®-IPV+Hib when both
           are co-administered with Prevenar®.

        -  To describe the safety after each vaccination following co-administration with
           Prevenar®.

          -  Moderate or severe acute illness with or without fever

          -  Participation in another clinical trial in the 30 days preceding first study
             vaccination
