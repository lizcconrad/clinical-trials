      Study Hypothesis Evaluation of the durability of the combination Tenofovir and Hydroxyurea to
      maintain viral suppression below 50 copies/ml in volunteers who have achieved viral
      suppression on a standard HAART regimen.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a 48 week open-label, randomized study comparing the safety and durability of a
      highly active de-intensified therapy (Tenofovir/Hydroxyurea) to a simplified standard of care
      therapy (Tenofovir plus 3TC or Emtriva plus Sustiva or Nevirapine) to maintain a durable
      viral suppression.

      Up to 20 subjects with chronic HIV-1 infection, suppressed on highly active antiretroviral
      therapy, and without evidence of viral resistance will be enrolled in this study. Their
      present HAART therapy will be stopped.

      Half of the 20 volunteers will be randomized to the Tenofovir 300 mg qd/Hydroxyurea 500mg qd
      arm and those subjects will have Hydroxyurea added to their current screening regimen for 4
      weeks prior to de-intensifying to Hydroxyurea and Tenofovir. The other half will be
      randomized to Sustiva 600 mg qd or Nevirapine 200 mg twice a day); Tenofovir 300 mg qd, 3TC
      300 mg qd or Emtriva 200 mg once a day. Volunteers will continue on this regimen for 48
      weeks. Patients will be monitored for immunological and virological parameters as well as the
      incidence of toxicity and side effects during the study. If a patient's viral load reaches
      &gt;400 copies/ml on 3 consecutive measurements over a 6 week period, they will be terminated
      from the study and started back on their HAART.
