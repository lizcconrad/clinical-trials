      The purpose of this application is to request permission to use a bank of biological
      specimens and clinical information collected by the investigators prior to their joining the
      intramural program. The samples have been gathered under the sponsorship and approval of the
      Human Investigations Committees at Yale University, Wayne State University and Pennsylvania
      Hospital in the United States, the &quot;Sotero del Rio Hospital&quot;, the Hospital of the
      &quot;Universidad de Chile&quot; and the &quot;Universidad Catolica de Chile&quot;, in Chile. The investigators
      have generated a bank of amniotic fluid, maternal blood and urine, and fetal blood obtained
      at the time of delivery (from the umbilical cord and by cordocentesis), neonate's urine and
      sonographic examinations of the fetus, including echocardiography, stored on video-tapes.
      Clinical information with patient identifiers is available for these samples and sonographic
      examinations.
