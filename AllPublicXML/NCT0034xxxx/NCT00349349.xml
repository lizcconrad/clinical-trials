    <description>Par. with complete remission (CR), nodular partial remission (nPR), and partial remission (PR) were classified as responders, while those with stable disease (SD) and progressive disease (PD) were classified as non-responders. Per the NCIWG guideline (1996): CR; no lymphadenopathy/hepatomegaly/splenomegaly/constitutional symptoms, normal hematology, bone marrow sample as normocellular for age, &lt;30% lymphocytes (LC), no lymphoid nodule; PR: a &gt;=50% decrease in LC/lymphadenopathy; nPR: persistent nodules in bone marrow; PD: new lesion or increase by &gt;=50% from baseline; SD: no CR, PR, or PD.</description>

    <measure>Duration of Response</measure>
    <time_frame>Start of treatment (Week 0 of Visit 2) until Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>Duration of response is defined as the time from the initial response (first visit at which response is observed) to progression or death. If the participant had progression between scheduled visits, no progression at the end of the trial, treatment discontinuation for undocumented progression, treatment discontinuation for toxicity or other reason, new anti-cancer treatment, and experienced death or progression after two or more missed visits in a row the endpoint was censored.</description>

    <time_frame>Start of treatment (Week 0 of Visit 2) until Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>PFS is defined as the time from randomization until progression/death. Per the IRC, if the participant had progression between scheduled visits, died before the first assessment, or died between adequate visits, the endpoint was considered progressed. If there was no progression at the end of the trial, treatment discontinuation for undocumented progression, treatment discontinuation for toxicity/other reason, new anti-cancer treatment, and death/progression after 2 or more missed visits in a row, the endpoint was censored. Clinical progression is not considered as progression endpoint.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline (Visit 2) to Week 28</time_frame>
    <description>Improvement in thromb. is defined as a decrease from Visit 2 by &gt;=1 National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria (NCI CTC) grade. Thromb. is defined as low platelet counts resulting from refractory CLL, damage from prior treatment, advanced age, or reduced bone marrow function and can be considered as an adverse condition. Adverse events (AEs) such as thromb. in a cancer indication are graded on a scale determined by the NCI called the NCI CTC: lowest, grade 1; highest, grade 5 (death). Changes in this grading can assess improvements or declines in the severity of the AE.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants With Complete Resolution of Hepatomegaly</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Visit 2) until Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>Participants with complete resolution of enlarged liver (hepatomegaly) were defined as those with an enlarged palpable liver at baseline followed by the absence of hepatomegaly post- baseline (i.e., the liver was of normal size). Liver size was assessed by physical examination and documented as &quot;centimeters&quot; under the costal margin with relative changes in spleen size in 1 dimension calculated based on palpated numeric measurements (as per the 1996 NCIWG guidelines).</description>

        <description>The peripheral blood for each participant was collected and analyzed for CD5+CD19+ cell counts. CD is “cluster of differentiation,” is a cell surface marker for immunophenotyping, and, in this case, is a surrogate for B cell malignancy (indicates malignant B cells).

        <title>Number of Participants With Improvement on the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance Status Scale at Week 24</title>
        <description>ECOG performance status is a measure of the participant’s ability to carry out activities of daily living on 6-point scale (0=fully active, 1=restricted in physically activity, ambulatory, 2=ambulatory [&gt;50% of waking hours], 3=capable of only limited self care, 4=completely disabled, 5=Dead). Improvement in ECOG performance status is defined as a decrease from baseline by at least one score on the ECOG scale.</description>

        <population>FAS. Data were provided for participants (par.) with an ECOG score &gt;0 at baseline attending each visit. Par. withdrawn from the study were not analyzed. (55 par. had an ECOG performance status of 0 at baseline and therefore did not have the opportunity to improve. No par. with an ECOG score of 0 at baseline worsened during the trial.)</population>

        <description>The number of participants (par.) who were positive, negative, or had missing data for the following prognostic factors indicative of altered responsiveness to treatment and/or survival was measured: 17p-, 11q-, +12q, 6q-, 13q-. Par. were assessed by FISH for these chromosomal abnormalities known tobe prognostic for time to treatment and survival when detected at diagnosis. Par. were categorized by the chromosomal abnormality detected: 17 p deletion, 11q deletion (but not 17 p deletion), 12 q trisomy (but not 17 p or 111q deletion), 13q deletion only, and no chromosomal abnormalities found.</description>

        <description>Improvement in thromb. is defined as a decrease from Visit 2 by &gt;=1 National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria (NCI CTC) grade. Thromb. is defined as low platelet counts resulting from refractory CLL, damage from prior treatment, advanced age, or reduced bone marrow function and can be considered as an adverse condition. Adverse events (AEs) such as thromb. in a cancer indication are graded on a scale determined by the NCI called the NCI CTC: lowest, grade 1; highest, grade 5 (death). Changes in this grading can assess improvements or declines in the severity of the AE.</description>

          <title>Number of Participants Who Experienced Any Adverse Event</title>
          <description>An adverse event (AE) was defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a participant administered a pharmaceutical product and which did not necessarily have a causal relationship with the treatment. A list of AEs experienced in the study with a frequency threshold of 5% can be found in the AE section of this results record.</description>
