    <measure>Number of Subjects Without Mucosal Ulceration at Week 12</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>Subjects were to have undergone up to 4 endoscopies to evaluate the presence or absence of mucosal ulceration: at Screening, at Week 12 (subjects who moved to open label (OL) drug between Week 8 and Week 12 because of disease flare or non-response were evaluated by endoscopy prior to receiving OL dosing), at the time of switch from blinded study drug to OL adalimumab at any time after Week 12, and at Week 52 or Early Termination. Subjects who remained blinded for the entire 52-week trial or switched to OL adalimumab between Week 8 and Week 12 were to have undergone 3 endoscopies.</description>

At Week 52, all remaining subjects were allowed to switch to the Open-Label portion of the study.</description>

             must be documented.

          -  Endoscopic documentation of ulceration at Screening corresponding to a score of 2 or 3
             in at least one of the five segments of the colon on the Ulcerated Surface subscore of

             professional who can inject the study medication.

          -  Subjects with a poorly controlled medical condition and any other condition which, in
             the opinion of the Investigator or the sponsor, would put the subject at risk by
             participation in the protocol.

          -  Subject who has previously used infliximab or any anti-TNF (anti tumor necrosis
             factor), even investigational, within 8 weeks of Baseline.

        <description>Subjects were to have undergone up to 4 endoscopies to evaluate the presence or absence of mucosal ulceration: at Screening, at Week 12 (subjects who moved to open label (OL) drug between Week 8 and Week 12 because of disease flare or non-response were evaluated by endoscopy prior to receiving OL dosing), at the time of switch from blinded study drug to OL adalimumab at any time after Week 12, and at Week 52 or Early Termination. Subjects who remained blinded for the entire 52-week trial or switched to OL adalimumab between Week 8 and Week 12 were to have undergone 3 endoscopies.</description>
