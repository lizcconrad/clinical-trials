      The purpose of this study is to determine the safety and tolerability of bavituximab when
      administered via an arm vein as multiple infusions and to examine how bavituximab behaves in
      the body and how it effects the amount of hepatitis C virus and immune modulators in
      individuals with chronic infection.

    <textblock>
      Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is a world wide public health concern and is the most
      common chronic bloodborne infection in the United States and the leading indication for liver
      transplantation. Laboratory and animal studies have demonstrated that bavituximab binds
      viruses and virally infected cells and prolongs survival in lethally infected animals. This
      study will examine the safety and tolerability of bavituximab when administered as multiple
      infusions to patients with chronic HCV infection. Groups of patients will be treated with
      escalating doses of bavituximab twice weekly for 2 weeks and followed for 12 weeks.
