      The study tests the hypothesis that nitric oxide availability is changed in congestive heart
      failure with regard to the regulation of renal hemodynamics, renal sodium excretion and
      release of vasoactive hormones. The study tests these hypotheses by comparing the effects of
      systemic nitric oxide inhibition with L-NMMA in congestive heart failure patients with
      healthy subjects on renal hemodynamics, blood pressure and plasma levels of vasoactive
      hormones.

      The purpose of the study is to investigate the effects of systemic treatment with
      Ng-monomethyl-l-arginine in congestive heart failure and healthy controls on:

        -  glomerular filtration rate and renal plasma flow

        -  blood pressure and heart rate

        -  plasma levels of vasoactive hormones

        -  lithium clearance

      The study is randomized and placebo controlled

             screening

          -  Current medication

          -  Drugs or alcohol abuse
