  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate safety, reactogenicity and immunogenicity of GSK Biologicals'
      pneumococcal conjugate vaccine compared to Prevenar™ when co-administered with DTPw-HBV/Hib
      and OPV or IPV vaccines, according to 2 different schedules: 6-10-14 weeks or 2-4-6 months of
      age.

      The study has 2 groups.

        -  One group of subjects will receive a 3-dose primary vaccination with the GSK
           Biologicals' pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (three different lots will be used and
           randomly allocated).

        -  The 2nd group of subjects will receive a 3-dose primary vaccination with Prevenar™.

      All children will receive concomitantly DTPw-HBV/Hib and OPV or IPV vaccines. This protocol
      posting deals with objectives &amp; outcome measures of the primary study. The objectives &amp;
      outcome measures of the Booster study are presented in a separate protocol posting (NCT
      number =00547248).
