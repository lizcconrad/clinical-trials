  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The booster phase of the study will evaluate the safety of Hib-MenCY-TT vaccine compared to a
      control group receiving licensed Hib conjugate vaccine at 12 to 15 months of age.

      This protocol posting deals with objectives &amp; outcome measures of the booster phase. The
      objectives &amp; outcome measures of the primary phase are presented in a separate protocol
      posting (NCT number = NCT00345579).

      No new recruitment will take place during this booster phase of the study. The Protocol
      Posting has been updated in order to comply with the FDA Amendment Act, Sep 2007.

    <textblock>
      Hib-MenCY-TT = GSK Biologicals' Haemophilus influenzae type b and Neisseria meningitidis
      serogroups C and Y-tetanus toxoid conjugate vaccine.

      The study will be conducted in a single blind manner up to 30 days after administration of
      the booster dose; the extended safety follow-up after the booster dose will be conducted in
      an unblinded manner.

      All subjects will receive Prevnar, M-M-R II and Varivax as study vaccines, preferencially
      co-administered with the booster dose of Hib-MenCY-TT/PedvaxHIB.

      Note: This protocol posting deals with the objectives &amp; outcome measures for the booster
      phase of the study. The objectives &amp; outcome measures for the primary phase are presented in
      a separate protocol posting (NCT00345579)

This study begins 10 months after the first vaccination in the primary phase.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>Of the 4021 subjects enrolled, 4020 received a booster vaccination and 3986 completed the booster phase (2985 in the Menhibrix Group and 1001 in the ActHIB Group)</pre_assignment_details>
