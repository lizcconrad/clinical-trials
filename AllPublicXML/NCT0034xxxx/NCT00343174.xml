  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Treatment of acute stroke is still difficult and the only specific drug approved (rtPA) can
      only be administered if treatment starts within 3 hours after onset of symptoms. This results
      in a still too small number of patients treated with rtPA ( &lt; 15% in best clinical care
      institutions ). Ancrod is a differently acting biological drug which has been used for a long
      time but not for acute stroke treatment. STAT was the first RCT of medium size to show a
      significant benefit/risk ration if treatment starts within 3 hours. ESTAT was designed
      closely related to STAT but with a longer 6 hours window and specifically extended
      inclusion/exclusion criteria to avoid secondary complications possibly related to a longer
      time window.
