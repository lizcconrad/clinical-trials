      Primary:

      To assess the safety of SL77.0499-10 10mg administered once daily for one year in patients
      with lower urinary tract symptoms related to BPH.

      Secondary:

        -  To provide the information on the efficacy of SL77.0499-10 10mg administered once daily
           for one year in patients with lower urinary tract symptoms related to BPH.

        -  To document the plasma concentration of SL77.0499-10 after repeated administration of
           SL77.0499-10 10mg administered once daily in patients with lower urinary tract symptoms
           related to BPH.
