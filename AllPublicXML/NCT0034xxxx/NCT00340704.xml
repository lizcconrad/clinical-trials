          <title>Tamsulosin - Low Dose Level (PK Study)</title>
          <description>Subjects randomized to low dose level (0.001–0.002 mg/kg) of tamsulosin hydrochloride, dependent on a subject's body weight.
In PK study, all subjects were titrated to their randomized dose level that they needed to receive which was based on their weight. Depending on the results of the Leak point pressure (LPP) results, subjects could remain on that dose if it was found to be efficacious or go back to a lower efficacious dose or titrate up in hopes that the higher dose would provide some efficacy.
Subjects with body weight of 12.1-25.0 kg received low dose of 0.025 mg qd (once daily), body weight of 25.1–50.0 kg received low dose of 0.05 mg qd and body weight of 50.1–100.0 kg received low dose of 0.1 mg qd by sprinkling the content of the capsule(s) over teaspoon of apple sauce or yogurt taken 30 minutes after breakfast.</description>

Group D-527.51 Rollover: Leak point pressure (LPP) Response at (response defined as a subject who achieves an LPP pressure &lt;40 cm H2O) last value of the treatment based on two confirmatory values. The last value on treatment included any final value prior to discontinuation of treatment, regardless of the length of treatment. Detrusor leak point pressure (LPP) recorded in cm H2O which was obtained using a standard urodynamic technique, a cystometrogram. Descriptive statistics were used to assess this endpoint. This Outcome Measure was only pre-specified for Group D-Denovo and Group D-527.51 Rollover subjects, so results of these two groups are provided.</description>

          <description>Early responders who maintained their detrusor leak point pressure (LPP) below 40 cm H2O during the study. Timeframe for Group D-Denovo: Low dose: Week 1, 3 &amp; 4 prior to dose and Week 2, 9 &amp; 26 (optional), 13(additional) &amp; 52 post dose. Medium dose: Week 1, 2 &amp; 4 prior to dose and Week 3, 9(optional), 13(additional), 26 (optional) &amp; 52 post dose. High dose: Week 1, 2 &amp; 3 prior to dose administration and Week 4, 9(optional), 13(additional), 26 (optional) &amp; 52 post dose. Group D-527.51 Rollover: Week 1, 2,3 &amp; 4 prior to dose and Week 9 &amp;26 (optional),13 (additional) &amp; 52 post dose. This Outcome Measure was only pre-specified for Group D-Denovo and Group D-527.51 Rollover subjects, However this endpoint was not analysed for Group D-527.51 Rollover as very limited data were collected due to early termination of the study &amp; no alternative endpoint was defined in the Group D-527.51 rollover, so only the results for Group D-Denovo is provided.</description>

        <description>Response defined as stabilization or improvement of hydroureter measured by renal ultrasound compared to baseline by treatment group (subjects are classified according to the treatment they were taking at Week 52 or end of treatment) at week 52 for Group D-Denovo and (subjects are classified according to the treatment they were taking at the end of treatment) at last value on treatment for Group D-527.51 Rollover. Baseline assessments were obtained from trial 527.51 for Group D-527.51 Rollover. The overall treatment duration was not sufficient to reach any meaningful conclusions regarding improvement or stabilization of hydroureter in the Group D-527.51 Rollover. Hydroureter response is defined as improvement or stabilization based upon the presence or absence of hydroureter at end of treatment compared to baseline. This Outcome Measure was only pre-specified for Group D-Denovo and Group D-527.51 Rollover subjects, so results of these two groups are provided.</description>

In Group D-Denovo, all subjects started the study at the Low Dose level, with the exception of the children with a body weight between 9 kg and 12 kg (they started at the Medium Dose level), and titrated up to higher dose levels on a weekly basis until an efficacious level was reached. The subjects remained on their efficacious dose level for the remainder of the study.
Subjects with body weight of 9.0–12.0 kg received medium dose of 0.025 mg qd as their starting dose, body weight of 12.1-25.0 kg could have titrated to a medium dose of 0.05 mg qd, body weight of 25.1–50.0 kg could have titrated to a medium dose of 0.1 mg qd and body weight of 50.1–100.0 kg could have titrated to a medium dose of 0.2 mg qd by sprinkling the content of the capsule(s) over teaspoon of apple sauce or yogurt, taken 30 minutes after breakfast.</description>
