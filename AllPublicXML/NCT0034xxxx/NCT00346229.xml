      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as liposomal doxorubicin, work in different ways
      to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from
      dividing. Hyperthermia therapy kills tumor cells by heating them to several degrees above
      normal body temperature. Giving temperature-sensitive liposomal doxorubicin together with
      hyperthermia may kill more tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of
      temperature-sensitive liposomal doxorubicin when given together with hyperthermia in treating
      women with locally recurrent breast cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the maximum tolerated dose of temperature-sensitive liposomal doxorubicin
           (ThermoDox™) when used in combination with local-regional hyperthermia in women with
           locally recurrent breast cancer.

        -  Determine the pharmacokinetic profile of ThermoDox™ when used in multiple-course dosing.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of temperature-sensitive liposomal doxorubicin
      (ThermoDox™).

      Patients receive ThermoDox™ IV over 30 minutes immediately followed by hyperthermia to the
      chest wall/axilla over 1-2 hours on day 1. Treatment repeats every 21-35 days for up to 6
      courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of ThermoDox™ (with or without standard-dose
      granulocyte colony-stimulating factor [G-CSF] support) until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD)
      is determined. The MTD without G-CSF support is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2
      of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity (DLT). At least 6 patients are
      treated at the MTD. If the only DLT is neutropenia in &gt; 1 of 6 patients treated at any dose
      level, then additional cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of ThermoDox™ with
      G-CSF support (standard-dose G-CSF or standard-dose pegfilgrastim) until the MTD is
      determined. The MTD with G-CSF support is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3
      or 2 of 6 patients experience DLT after the addition of G-CSF support.

      Quality of life and pain are assessed at baseline, prior to courses 3 and 5, and at 21-42
      days after completion of therapy.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically for 5 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 30 patients will be accrued for this study.
