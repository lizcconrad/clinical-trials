      The research objectives of this study are to determine if small incision Deep Lamellar
      Endothelial Keratoplasty (DLEK) is able to further reduce the degree of corneal astigmatism
      and shorten the time course of corneal topography stabilization compared to standard full
      thickness corneal transplant (PKP) surgery.

      Split thickness lamellar corneal transplants have been performed for many years to replace
      the front part of the cornea and have been highly successful. What is different about this
      study is that the surgical procedure involves replacement of the back layers of the cornea
      rather than the front layers of the cornea. This replacement is done through a small pocket
      incision to avoid changes in the front surface of the cornea. By leaving the front surface in
      the cornea without sutures or incisions there is felt to be an advantage in healing and
      recovery time for the patient. In addition, this particular study will use a pocket incision
      that is even shorter and smaller in length than the one used in previous DLEK surgeries to
      try to make healing time even faster and more predictable. This procedure has been
      successfully performed on patients in the Netherlands for over five years. The procedure has
      also been successfully performed by doctors in the United States. Subjects participating in
      this study will be among the first patients to undergo this procedure in the The University
      of Texas Southwestern Medical Center at Dallas.

        Inclusion Criteria: Subjects enrolled in this study will have endothelial dysfunction to a
        level generally accepted as requiring standard PKP for treatment. Subjects will be offered
        the alternative surgery of this protocol. All subjects will be between the ages of 21 and
        95. Males and females are eligible.

        Exclusion Criteria: Central corneal scars, presence of a filtering bleb and uncontrolled
        glaucoma.
