                  only if there are no ocular manifestations of their disease (ie diabetics with
                  normal retinal exams)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  · Known contraindication to any study medication or any of their components

               -  Uncontrolled systemic disease

               -  Required use of ocular medications other than the study medications during the
                  study

               -  Abnormal pre-operative OCTs if obtainable

               -  Diabetic patients with a history of macular edema or diabetic retinopathy

               -  AMD patients with less than a 20/20 surgical outcome expectation, epi-retinal
                  membranes, retinal vein occlusion, or any pre-existing macular disease
