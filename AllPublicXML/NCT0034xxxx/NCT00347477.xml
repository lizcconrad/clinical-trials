  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Therapeutic hypothermia after cardiac arrest har shown to improve the rate of survival in a
      significant way. However hypothermia also causes leak of fluid into the surrounding tissue.
      This edema could lead to damage to the same tissue, not beneficial for the patients. We
      therefore try to evaluate if hyperosmolar, hyperoncotic fluid as an alternative to std.
      treatment (NaCl/RA)could affect the edema in a positive way, and result to a better outcome
      neurological for the patients.

      After the patients are admitted to our hospital we randomise them to either std. fluid
      therapy (NaCl/RA) or HyperHAES. After PCI we state the rate of cerebral edema by carrying out
      a cerebral MRI before the cooling starts. We treat the patients with the different fluids for
      24 hours. We then evaluate the edema after 24 and 72 hours by the same method. In addition we
      state the rate of peripheral capillary leak by Wick`S method. The capillary leak is
      calculated every 8.th hour for the 1. day the patients are treated in our ICU. AFter 1 year,
      those who survive are invited to a follow-up where we test the patient using Mini MEntal
      Status, SF-36, in addition to neurophysiological tests as EEG and the P300-test. We then
      relate the results to the fluid given initially after the cardiac arrest.
