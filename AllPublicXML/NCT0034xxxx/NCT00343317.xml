    <textblock>
      Postpartum infections are among the leading causes of maternal mortality world-wide,
      particularly in under-resourced countries. Available data suggests that HIV infected women
      are at greater risk of postpartum complications than uninfected women. In South Africa,
      HIV/AIDS and related infections are now cumulatively the leading causes of maternal deaths
      (though indirectly), with puerperal sepsis among the 5 most common causes.

      This was a prospective longitudinal cohort of HIV infected (n = 675) and uninfected (n = 648)
      women. These were women in whom vaginal delivery was anticipated, and were recruited at &gt; 36
      weeks of gestation during the antenatal period.

      Hypothesis - HIV infected women are at increased risk of postpartum infectious morbidity and
      this morbidity can be reduced by use of prophylactic intrapartum antibiotics.

      INTRODUCTION The World Health Organisation (WHO) estimates that 582 000 women die world-wide
      each year due to pregnancy related conditions that could be prevented. Most of these deaths
      occur in developing countries1. Some of the underlying causes of increased maternal morbidity
      and mortality are HIV-related. In South Africa the antenatal HIV seroprevalence surveys
      report an infection rate of 32%, the highest among the Sub-Saharan countries2. According to
      the Saving Mothers Report (NCCEMD) pregnancy-related sepsis was the fourth commonest cause of
      maternal mortality, while AIDS was the second leading cause3. Of the 67 women who died of
      HIV/AIDS in 1998, 41 died from puerperal sepsis of which 54% had a vaginal delivery and 46%
      had a caesarean section. It is not clear from the report to what extent HIV infection had
      contributed to the severity of sepsis.

      The clinical impression is that women with HIV infection have a higher incidence of post
      delivery morbidity than HIV-negative women. Proposed contributory factors include, low CD4
      count and associated impaired immunological function, other obstetric complications and
      sexually transmitted infections3.

      The puerperal sepsis rate is about 2-6 % in most studies. It is however much higher in women
      with bacterial vaginosis (14%)2 and those who deliver out of health institutions (18%)3.
      Women with HIV infection are more likely to harbour BV and other sexually transmitted
      infections. For this and other reasons it is generally accepted that HIV-positive women are
      at increased risk of puerperal infectious morbidity and mortality independent of the mode of
      delivery and antiretroviral therapy.

      Di Lieto et al4 reported a 33.8 % incidence of infectious morbidity following emergency
      caesarean delivery. The incidence of infectious morbidity has been reported to be higher in
      HIV positive women compared to HIV negative women (Semprini et al. 1995)5.

      The role of prophylactic antibiotics in obstetric complications has been previously
      investigated especially in women with preterm labour, prelabour rupture of membranes, cardiac
      disease and women delivered by caesarean section. There is good evidence that prophylactic
      antibiotics significantly reduce postpartum morbidity. In these studies prophylactic
      antibiotics were largely administered intra-operatively. The question that remains is whether
      prophylactic antibiotics need to be given to only women identified as at risk or to all women
      with HIV infection.

      The identification of biochemical (laboratory)/immune markers will be of value in the timing
      of clinical interventions. The markers that can be used to predict sepsis will be to
      determine the level of apoptosis in neutrophils, neutrophil function, C-Reactive protein
      levels, ESR and the levels of the following cytokines viz. TNF-, IL-1, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10.
      Less clear is the role that apoptosis and it's dysregulation may play in pathological immune
      states like sepsis, autoimmune disease, or immunosuppressed states. The potential role of
      apoptosis and the pathogenesis of sepsis have resulted in some unanswered questions- (1)
      whether impairment of apoptosis as a method of down-regulating pro-inflammatory cells
      causally results in inappropriate persistence of inflammation under septic conditions and (2)
      whether increased apoptosis of immune effector cells results in immunosuppression and
      increased susceptibility to overwhelming infection? Neutrophils are the first immune cells to
      migrate to sites of inflammation and major functions include phagocytosis of
      bacteria,apoptosis of neutrophils may be one of the mechanisms of limiting tissue injury at
      sites of inflammation and phagocytosis of apoptotic neutrophils inhibits the release of
      pro-inflammatory cytokines from monocytes. Lower absolute neutrophil counts are associated
      with increased risk of hospitalization for serious infection among HIV infected patients.
      Because neutrophils are functionally impaired, we hypothesize that sepsis observed in HIV
      infection might be a result of accelerated apoptosis. This study will therefore try to define
      the mechanisms, direct or indirect, by which HIV infection may dysregulate apoptosis and
      cytokine production in the pathogenesis of sepsis.

      In summary puerperal sepsis remains a major cause of maternal mortality in South Africa. The
      clinical experience in Durban, is that postpartum infections are on the increase particularly
      in view of the high prevalence of HIV. Clear guidelines are needed for the role of
      antibiotics among women at risk for postdelivery morbidity associated with infections.
      Current recommendations by the NCCEMD of SA indicate that all women with AIDS and women
      having caesarean sections be treated prophylactically with antibiotics. However, guidelines
      regarding timing of antibitiotic prophylaxis remain unclear6. This study therefore sets out
      to establish reliable data on the incidence of postdelivery morbidity including puerperal
      sepsis, associated risk factors, laboratory markers and an effective antibiotic regimen to
      reduce the risk of postdelivery morbidity.

      AIM To evaluate the role of intrapartum prophylactic antibiotics in HIV infected women in
      reducing the incidence of postdelivery morbidity as assessed by clinical and immunological
      markers.

      HYPOTHESIS Antibiotics administered during labour can reduce postdelivery morbidity in HIV
      infected women STUDY OBJECTIVES Primary: To reduce the incidence of post-delivery infections
      by use of prophylactic antibiotics.

      Secondary: To investigate immunological parameters as markers of post-delivery infections.

      To identify risk factors for post-delivery infections. PRIMARY ENDPOINTS The primary efficacy
      endpoints for this study will be the incidence of post-delivery infectious morbidity
      diagnosed between delivery and 6 weeks post-delivery.

      STUDY DESIGN This is a prospective double blind, randomised placebo-controlled trial of
      prophylactic antibiotics for delivery.

      STUDY POPULATION The study will be conducted at King Edward VIII Hospital, Durban and Umtata
      Hospital, Transkei over a 2 year period.

      Women who have been counselled and tested for HIV during the antenatal period, and who have
      agreed to know their results, will be enrolled during the antenatal period. Informed written
      consent for participation in the study will be obtained from all voluntary participants.

      Immunological studies will be conducted in a subsample (25%) of patients in each study group.

      Inclusion Criteria

        -  Women with known HIV status as documented by routine rapid HIV tests, following pre-test
           voluntary counselling and testing (VCT).

        -  Women who gave informed study consent. Exclusion Criteria

        -  Women on antibiotic therapy less than 2 weeks prior to study enrolment.

        -  Women planned for elective caesarean delivery.

        -  Obstetric complications such as preterm prelabour rupture of membranes, cardiac disease,
           antepartum haemorrhage.

      Randomisation will occur on admission to the labour ward. The following tests will be
      performed prior to randomisation i.e at enrolment: full blood count(FBC), CD4 count and
      ano-genital swabs for microbiology. The women will be randomly assigned to one of the three
      groups, depending on HIV status:

      Group 1: HIV-POSITIVE given antibiotics (Cefoxitin 2g IVI stat dose) Group 2: HIV-POSITIVE
      given placebo Group 3: HIV-NEGATIVE (no placebo or cefoxitin = control group) Rationale for
      placebo and choice of antibiotic: The current standard practice is not to give prophylactic
      antibiotics for delivery to women without risk factors irrespective of HIV status. This
      justifies a placebo-controlled design. In this unit the current standard practice is to
      administer intravenous cefoxitin (2g stat dose) to women for whom prophylactic antibiotic is
      indicated. We therefore intend to use cefoxitin for the study.

      Sample Size: Considering a 15% puerperal sepsis rate among HIV positive women following
      vaginal and emergency caesarean section delivery a sample size of 343 will be required in
      each group (placebo and study group) to observe a 33% reduction in the sepsis rate. This
      would detect a significant difference at 5 % level (p &lt; 0.05) with the power of 90%.
      Therefore the appropriate sample sizes are:

      Group 1 ( HIV-positive, antibiotic): 343 Group 2 (HIV-positive, placebo): 343 Group 3
      (HIV-negative, 686 )

      INVESTIGATION PLAN Study procedure at each visit Visit 1 (baseline and enrolment) will take
      place at the antenatal clinic at the respective sites.

      This will occur after the mother has received post-test counselling. At the baseline the
      mother will be informed of the study, both verbally and in writing, she will then sign the
      informed consent form.

      Demographic data, maternal medical history and HIV related symptoms and signs will be
      documented and HIV disease staging will be carried out, pap smears and CD 4 counts will be
      done at enrolment. A physical and obstetrical examination will be done and the mothers will
      be randomised into one of 3 groups depending on their HIV status and the antibiotic regimen
      to be given.

      Visit 2 (labour/delivery) A diagnosis of labour will be made clinically. Women with HIV and
      confirmed to be in labour will be randomised into either the antibiotic or placebo group. A
      single dose of mefoxin or a similarly looking placebo will be administered. All women with
      HIV infection will be given a single dose of nevirapine ( and their newborns will receive
      0.6ml of nevirapine 24-72 hours post-birth). During labour artificial rupture of membranes
      will be delayed; and invasive monitoring, use of instruments for delivery and episiotomy will
      be avoided where possible. Women will also be advised on the benefits and risks of exclusive
      breastfeeding and formula feeding and they will be further informed on their choice of an
      appropriate feeding method.

      Blood will be taken for the following: apoptosis of neutrophils, neutrophil function, FBC,
      C-reactive protein. Serum samples will also be stored for the determination of cytokines
      levels. A cervical vaginal swab will also be done, for microbilogical evaluation. Urine will
      be analysed by means of dipstix, and microscopy and culture will be reserved for symptomatic
      patients on significant findings on dipstix. CD4 counts will be done by a private
      pathologist. The reason for this is that the mothers will be enrolled during the day and
      night and will thus need a 24-hour service for the CD4 counts and the FBC.

      Visit 3 (24-48 hours post delivery) An infection symptom review and physical examination will
      be done. In addition blood samples will be take for the evaluation of apoptosis, neutrophil
      function test, FBC and C-reactive protein. Serum will be stored for cytokines assays. A wound
      swab will be done where indicated.

      Visit 4 This will take place 1-week post delivery. A physical and obstetrical examination
      will be carried . A wound swab will also be done. An infant evaluation including laboratory
      parameters will also be carried out during this visit.

      Visit 5 This will take place 2 weeks post-delivery. A physical and examination and an
      infection symptoms review will be carried out at this visit. A wound swab will also be done,
      where indicated.

      Visit 6 This will take place 6 weeks post-delivery. A physical and infection symptom review
      will be done. Blood samples will be taken for CD4 counts and FBC. When necessary, a pap smear
      and wound swab will also be done at this stage.

      Adherence to protocol Mothers will be encouraged to make every attempt to complete the
      protocol as specified, and will be reimbursed for transport.

      Dropouts and Withdrawals Patients have the right to withdraw from the study at any time or
      may be withdrawn if they fail to comply with the study requirements or investigators
      instructions.

      OUTCOME MEASURES The primary outcome measure will be puerperal sepsis defined as a
      temperature of 38C on two separate occasions due to genital tract infection and
      endometritis. Secondary measures will include other clinical infections, neonatal sepsis,
      duration of hospital stay and surgery for puerperal sepsis. Clinical infections include
      urinary tract infections, pneumonia and wound sepsis.

      DATA COLLECTION AND MONITORING A standard data form will be completed for each subject. Study
      participants will not be identified by any name on any of the study documents. Subjects will
      be identified by a Study Identification Number. The data will be entered into a computerised
      database EPI info version 6 software program. The same shall be used for statistical
      analysis.

      The study co-ordinator will be responsible for the accuracy of the database and to determine
      that all regulatory requirements surrounding the trial are met. A data safety and monitoring
      team will meet quarterly to assess the safety and accuracy of the data collected.

      Ethical Approval This protocol and the informed consent and any subsequent modifications will
      be reviewed by the Ethics Committee of the University of Natal. Written informed consent will
      be obtained from the participants. The informed consent form will describe the study, the
      procedures to be followed and the risks and benefits of the participation. A copy of the
      informed consent form will be given to the subjects.

      Subject confidentiality All laboratory specimens, reports, study data collection, process and
      administrative forms will be identified by a study number to maintain confidentiality. All
      local databases must be secured with a password protected access systems. Forms, lists,
