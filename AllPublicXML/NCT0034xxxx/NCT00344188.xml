      This study will examine the natural history of Leishmanial infections and their treatments.
      It will provide an opportunity for NIAID staff to learn more about leishmaniasis and perhaps
      to improve diagnostic tests for these infections. Patients between 2 and 80 years of age with
      known or suspected leishmaniasis are eligible for this study.

      Participants will have routine blood tests and a biopsy to confirm leishmanial infection. The
      biopsy procedure will be determined by the type of infection local cutaneous leishmaniasis
      (LCL), mucocutaneous leishmaniasis (MCL) or visceral leishmaniasis (VL). CL will be confirmed
      with a punch biopsy, in which a cookie-cutter type razor is used to remove a small circular
      piece of skin tissue. MCL will be confirmed using a thin flexible tube inserted into the
      nose. This tube is used to examine the nose and upper airway and to remove a tissue sample,
      if an affected area is seen. VL will be confirmed with either a bone marrow or liver biopsy
      or a splenic aspirate. For these procedures, a small tissue sample is withdrawn through a
      needle placed in the hipbone, liver or spleen, respectively. Some patients may also have a
      skin test for leishmaniasis similar to tuberculin skin testing.

      Treatment and length of hospital stay are determined by the type of infection. CL may be
      treated with Pentostam, amphotericin, amphotericin B, itraconazole or ketoconazole; ML with
      amphotericin B, or encapsulated amphotericin; and VL with Pentostam or encapsulated
      amphotericin. Pentostam is infused daily for 18 to 28 doses, most as an outpatient. Blood is
      drawn 3 times a week for safety tests and an electrocardiogram is done 2 to 3 times a week to
      monitor heart rhythm. Amphotericin B is infused every day or every other day for about 30
      doses, all on an inpatient basis. Patients undergo hydration (infusion of a large amount of
      fluid) just before and immediately after each infusion to protect the kidneys. Blood is drawn
      every other day and urine samples are collected occasionally for routine urinalysis.
      Encapsulated amphotericin is infused every other day, on an outpatient basis. Blood is
      generally drawn every other day to every 2 days and urinalyses are done periodically.
      Itraconazole and ketoconazole are taken orally for at least 1 to 3 months, with blood drawn
      every 2 to 3 weeks.

      Patients may be asked to have photographs taken before, during and after treatment to
      document progress. They may also be asked to provide extra blood samples for research
      purposes, either through a vein in the arm or through apheresis, a method for collecting
      large numbers of cells. For apheresis, whole blood is collected through a needle in an arm
      vein and circulated through a machine that separates it into its components. The desired
      cells are then removed, and the rest of the blood is returned to the body, either through the
      same needle used to draw the blood or through a second needle in the other arm.

      Patients with cutaneous leishmaniasis will have a follow-up clinic visit 2 weeks to 3 months
      after treatment is completed. If there are no complications, their participation will end at
      that time. Patients with mucocutaneous leishmaniasis and visceral leishmaniasis will be
      followed every 3 to 6 months indefinitely for routine evaluations and re-treatment if the
      infection recurs.

      The major objectives of the protocol are to diagnose, obtain patient isolates, determine the
      immune responses of the host to infection, provide treatment and study the natural history of
      the treated infections. Another objective is to provide training for the NIH medical staff.
      Most cutaneous lesions caused by Leishmania tend to self-heal so no treatment may be the most
      prudent course. Both local treatments and systemic drugs can be effective depending on the
      species, geographic origin of the Leishmania, and the number and location of the lesions. The
      goal of treatment is to hasten healing, prevent damage/scarring on the face, sexual organs or
      other critical regions and cutaneous superinfection, and possibly lessen the chance of spread
      to the mucosa of the upper respiratory tract and mouth. Visceral leishmaniasis is rarely seen
      in the U.S. and always requires treatment when clinically evident. A number of systemic
      medications may be used but their effectiveness also depends on the species and geographic
      origin of the infecting Leishmania, potential sequelae of the infection, the health status of
      the patient, the ease of administration and the efficacy, morbidity and toxicities of the
      medication. Miltefosine (Impavido) and Ambisome are the only drugs approved by the CDC to
      treat cutaneous and visceral leishmaniasis, respectively. Ketoconazole, fluconazole and other
      azoles as well as other treatments are readily available and have efficacy in some forms of
      the infection.

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:

        Individuals of either sex must be between the ages of 2 and 80 years.

        Likely or proven diagnosis of leishmaniasis. Some patients have a suggestive history, were
        exposed at the same time as diagnosed patients and have suggestive lesions, or have a
        convincing history or compatible histopathology.

        Weigh at least 66 lbs if treated with miltefosine.

        Agree to use 2 methods of birth control (pills or barrier method and abstinence) and delay
        pregnancy/fatherhood during treatment and for 6 months after the treatment ends if treated
        with miltefosine.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

        Individuals who are pregnant or breast feeding, who do not have a life-threatening form of
        this disease, will be excluded from this protocol until termination of pregnancy (birth or
        otherwise). Those with life-threatening leishmaniasis will be offered treatment.

        Those who refuse recommended treatments, evaluations, or follow up

        Presence of other life threatening-illness and non serious leishmaniasis

        When treatment is not in the best interest of the patient s well being

        Option of treatment: Not all patients with leishmaniaisis require treatment such as some
        patients infected with Leishmania major, a species that has few if any severe sequelae.
        These may be diagnosed and confirmed by culture, PCR, or histopathology at NIH and then
        given the option of treatment or no treatment.

        Other patients have a healing lesion, which at the discretion of the physician and patient
        may not require treatment.
