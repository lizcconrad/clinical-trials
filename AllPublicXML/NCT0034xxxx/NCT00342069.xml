      This study will examine how women think and feel about prenatal testing (amniocentesis and
      chorionic villus sampling), how those thoughts and feelings change over time, and how they
      contribute to the decision whether or not to undergo prenatal testing.

      Prenatal diagnostic testing is offered to pregnant women at increased risk of carrying a baby
      affected with a genetic or chromosomal abnormality. Although these tests are well
      established, standard-of-care procedures, much remains unknown about how best to ensure that
      women make decisions about whether or not to undergo testing that are consistent with their
      beliefs and values. This study will explore the extent to which women are ambivalent about
      prenatal testing and determine how they might benefit from counseling aimed at improving the
      quality of their decision-making.

      Women 18 years of age and older who are scheduled for a prenatal genetics visit at clinics in
      Baltimore, MD; Minneapolis, MN; Binghamton, NY; Salt Lake City, UT; Washington, DC; and
      Bellevue, WA, and are at increased risk for having a baby with trisomy 21 (Down syndrome) may
      be eligible for this study.

      Participants complete two short questionnaires and a telephone interview about their thoughts
      and feelings regarding prenatal testing. The first two surveys examine the women's thoughts
      and feelings before and after prenatal counseling. Both are completed at the prenatal
      clinic-one before and one after the counseling session. The third survey is done by telephone
      a few weeks after the prenatal visit to find out if the participant did or did not have
      prenatal testing and learn about her thoughts and feelings regarding her decision.

      The proposed study seeks to estimate the prevalence of ambivalence about undergoing
      diagnostic testing among women referred for prenatal genetic counseling, and the predictors
      and decisional consequences of such ambivalence. Women seen at six different U.S. prenatal
      clinics for genetic counseling at increased risk for carrying a fetus with trisomy 21 [N=240]
      will be asked to complete a questionnaire on three occasions: prior to counseling;
      immediately after counseling, and later by telephone. These data will be used to describe the
      extent to which a sample of U.S. women referred for prenatal counseling based upon maternal
      age or results of a screening test are ambivalent about prenatal testing and might benefit
      from interventions aimed at improving the quality of decision-making.

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:

        Women must be equal to or greater than or equal to 18 years of age, speak English and be
        competent to consent to participate in the study.

        Participants must be pregnant women at increased risk for carrying a fetus with trisomy 21
        determined by maternal age or an abnormal screening test, such as ultrasound and/or triple
        tests.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

        Women will be excluded form participation if they have ever previously undergone prenatal
        (in current pregnancy or in a past pregnancy) or participated in prenatal genetic
        counseling.

        Women will also be excluded from the study if they have a family history (at least one
        first degree relative) of a genetic condition and are seeking prenatal testing for genetic
        indication including trisomy 21.

        Women at increased risk for other chromosomal or genetic conditions will be excluded.

        Children and men are excluded as women are the patients in prenatal genetics clinic and the
        ultimate decision-makers about prenatal testing.
