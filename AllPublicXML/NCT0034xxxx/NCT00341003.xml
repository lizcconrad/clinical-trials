      This study, conducted by the National Center for Malaria Control of Cambodia's Ministry of
      Health, the Guangzhou University of Traditional Chinese Medicine in the People's Republic of
      China, and the U.S. National Institutes of Health, will explore why some people with mild
      malaria progress to a severe form of the disease and why some malaria parasites are resistant
      to treatment.

      Malaria is caused by a parasite that is transmitted to humans through a mosquito bite. It can
      cause fever, aches, and weakness. Left untreated, it can cause severe illness and even death.
      Malaria can be cured when it is treated with effective medicine, but some malaria parasites
      are resistant to medicine.

      Children and adults with malaria symptoms and parasites in their blood will be recruited for
      this study from the Pursat Regional Health Center in Cambodia and the Thai-Cambodian border
      area within Pursat Province.

      Participants are hospitalized for 4 to 6 days at the Pursat Regional Health Center. A small
      blood sample is collected for genetic study and to look for substances in the blood, such as
      certain proteins, that may help protect against severe malaria. Patients are then treated
      with two doses of Artequick(Registered Trademark) (artemisinin-piperaquine), the first dose
      upon arrival at the hospital and the second the next day. (Participants who are pregnant will
      be treated with either quinine or artesunate-mefloquine instead of Artequick.)

      Patients undergo fingersticks several times during their hospital stay to collect a small
      drop of blood to monitor parasite counts. They are discharged from the hospital when their
      symptoms resolve and parasites can no longer be detected in their blood. After discharge,
      patients return to the clinic once a week for 3 weeks for a blood test to monitor for
      parasites, as some parasites may be slightly resistant to the medication. Patients in whom
      symptoms or parasites reappear undergo treatment with artesunate and mefloquine.

      Hemoglobin E (HbE) is distinguished from normal HbA by a single amino acid mutation (beta26:
      Glu to Lys). High allele frequencies in some areas of Cambodia are believed to have been
      naturally selected by life-threatening manifestations of malaria. Few epidemiological studies
      support this hypothesis, however, and in vitro studies have not clearly defined a mechanism
      of protection. The prevalence of drug-resistant malaria is alarmingly high along the
      Thai-Cambodian border, such that chloroquine, quinine, or mefloquine can no longer effect
      acceptable cure rates. Recently, prolonged parasite clearance times after artemisinin
      treatment have been documented in Battambang and Pailin provinces in Cambodia. Combinations
      of artemisinins and other drugs (e.g., mefioquine, piperaquine) are now used as standard
      first-line treatments for P. falciparum malaria in Southeast Asia. Further decreases in the
      effectiveness of these drugs would constitute a disaster, making some cases of malaria
      essentially untreatable. The molecular basis for parasite resistance to these antimalarials
      has not been firmly established. The main aims of this study are to (1) determine whether HbE
      protects against severe P. falciparum malaria, (2) identify genetic determinants associated
      with parasite resistance to antimalarial drugs, and (3) determine whether HbE and other
      erythrocyte polymorphisms influence parasite clearance times after artemisinin treatment. To
      meet these aims, we are conducting an unmatched case-control study comparing the prevalence
      of HbE in patients with severe and uncomplicated P. falciparum malaria. Cambodians who
      complain of fever and/or symptoms of malaria are recruited from Pursat Regional Health Center
      and surrounding districts within Pursat Province. Patients with uncomplicated malaria are
      treated with weight-based doses of artesunate given orally each day for 3 days, followed by
      weight-based doses of mefloquine given orally each day for 2 days. Patients with severe
      malaria will be treated with artemisinin compounds given parenterally for 5 consecutive days,
      followed by artesunate plus mefioquine treatment, as above. We will also collect parasitized
      blood samples from malaria patients prior to antimalarial drug administration. These
      parasites will be tested in short-term in vitro culture experiments to determine their
      susceptibility to antimalarial drugs. Genome-wide typing of drug-sensitive and drug-resistant
      P. falciparum isolates (using microsatellite and single nucleotide polymorphism markers) and
      genetic association studies will be used to identify genes that determine parasite responses
      to various antimalarial drugs.

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:

        Uncompleted malaria: Age greater than 10 years axillary, temperature greater than 37.5
        degrees Celsius or history of fever, signs and symptoms of malaria (e.g. headache, body
        aches, malaise), asexual parasitemia greater than or equal to 10000/ul, NO criteria of
        severe malaria and NO other etiologies of febrile illness (e.g., respiratory tract
        infection) on clinical examination, and NO history of antimalarial drug use for present
        symptoms.

        Severe malaria: Age greater than or equal to 10 years, asexual parasitemia greater than or
        equal to 10000/uL, NO history of antimalarial drug use for present symptoms, and any one of
        the following: coma (defined as Glasgow coma score less than or equal to 9 in adults, or
        Blantyre coma score less than or equal to 2 in children), convulsions (witnessed),
        prostration, severe anemia (hemoglobin less than 5 g/dL), respiratory distress,
        hypoglycemia (serum glucose less than 40 mg/dL), jaundice/icetrus, renal insufficiency
        (anuria for 24 hours or more), hemoglobinuria, state of shock (systolic blood pressure less

        vomiting.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

        Individuals who live in malaria endemic areas and are asymptomatic or have anon-malaria
        illness can sometimes be incidentally noted to be parasitemic, patients who are parasitemic
        yet are found by clinical examination to have another etiology of febrile illness (e.g.
        respiratory tract infection) will be excluded from the protocol, but will be treated by the
        Cambodian Ministry of Health staff for both malaria and their coexisting infection.
        Pregnant women will also be excluded from this protocol but will be treated by study

        trimester).
