      The purpose is to determine the extent of genetic damage in oral mucosal lesions ascertained
      in the study, whether specific genotypes are associated with genetic damage observed in the
      oral mucosal lesions, whether the extent of genetic damage changes over time, and what
      factors (e.g. smoking) contribute to those changes. Genetic damage indicators will include
      among others DNA adduct formation, particularly related to tobacco smoke carcinogens such as
      polycyclic aromatic hydocarbons. The genotypes of interest will be focused on these affecting
      carcinogen metabolism, (e.g., (CYP family), but may also include those related to growth
      factors, cell cycle control, and DNA repair. Microsatellite instability is another key
      indicator of damage that we plan to examine. This study was undertaken due to the paucity of
      data on the types of oral lesions seen in general dental practice and the limited knowledge
      of the natural history of these lesions.

      Persons were enrolled who had red and/or white oral lesions identified at 6 Dental Clinics at
      VA Medical Centers. The VA Centers involved were: Washington, DC; Atlanta, GA; Durham, NC;
      San Francisco, CA; Danville, IL; and San Antonio, TX.

      When a dentist found a red or white lesions in the course of routine outpatient examinations
      and care, obvious causes such as denture frictional lesions could be ruled out, and the
      normal standard of care for the lesion was biopsy, the patient was considered for enrollment
      into the study. The study was described to the patient, the consent for was signed, the
      patient received an intraoral examination to identify and characterize the oral lesions, the
      lesions were photographed, an oral epithelial cell sample was taken from the site and from
      the rest of the oral mucosa, and the patient was interviewed using a standard questionnaire
      that requested information about sociodemograhic, medical, and lifestyle factors,
      particularly tobacco and alcohol use all as part of the study protocol, and the patient
      received a biopsy as part of normal care. The biopsy report was obtained as was a small piece
      of the biopsy material that was not needed for patient diagnostic purposes. The subjects
      returned every 4-6 months for reassessment of the lesion or to determine that the lesion had
      not returned. The patients completed a questionnaire at each of these visits so that
      lifestyle factors such as tobacco and alcohol use could be reassessed. Also oral epithelial
      cell scrapings were obtained at each of these visits.

      This study is particularly valuable because longitudinal data was collected and because the
      data were collected over time using standard procedures.

      The Biomarkers for Oral Cancer study was undertaken to better understand the role of genetic
      and lifestyle factors in the natural history of these oral premalignant lesions. The purpose
      of this study is to determine the extent of genetic damage in oral mucosal lesions
      ascertained in the study, whether specific genotypes are associated with genetic damage
      observed in the oral mucosal lesions, whether the extent of genetic damage changes over time,
      and what factors (e.g. smoking) contribute to those changes. This study is particularly
      valuable because longitudinal data was collected over time using standardized procedures.

      Persons were enrolled in the study who had red and/or white oral lesions identified at 6
      Dental Clinics at VA Medical Centers. When a dentist found a red or white lesion in the
      course of routine outpatient examinations and care, obvious causes such as denture frictional
      lesions could be ruled out, and when the normal standard of care for the lesion was biopsy,
      the patient was considered for enrollment into the study. The study was described to the
      patient, the consent form was signed, the patient received an intraoral examination to
      identify and characterize the oral lesions, the lesions were photographed, an oral epithelial
      cell sample was taken from the site and from the rest of the oral mucosa, and the patient was
      interviewed using a standard questionnaire that requested information about sociodemographic,
      medical, and lifestyle factors, particularly tobacco and alcohol use all as part of the study
      protocol. The patient s lesion was biopsied as part of his normal care. The biopsy report was
      obtained, as was a small piece of the biopsy material that was not needed for patient
      diagnostic purposes. The subjects returned every 4-6 months for reassessment of the lesion or
      to determine that the lesion had not returned. The patients completed a questionnaire at each
      of these visits so that lifestyle factors such as tobacco and alcohol use could be
      reassessed. Also, oral epithelial cell scrapings were obtained at each of these visits.

      Analysis is focusing on the loss of heterozygosity and microsatellite instability as
      indicators of genetic damage and the relationship of damage to smoking and genotypes as well
      as how well findings from the oral rinses and brushes correspond to those in lesion tissues.
