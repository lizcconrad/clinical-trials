  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a pilot study designed to determine a dose and schedule of Tucaresol that can be
      administered to HIV-1 infected subjects on HAART (highly active antiretroviral therapy) with
      viral suppression without occurrence of significant adverse events and that results in
      significant changes in cell mediated immunity.
