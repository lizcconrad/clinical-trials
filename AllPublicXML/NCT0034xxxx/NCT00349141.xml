      The objective of this study is to assess the safety and immunogenicity of 4 different doses
      of adjuvanted and non-adjuvanted mock-up pandemic influenza vaccine. Subjects will be
      enrolled sequentially into 3 study cohorts with 4 escalating doses of H5N1 hemagglutininin
      antigen (3.75 µg adjuvanted, 7.5 µg adjuvanted/non-adjuvanted, 15 µg
      adjuvanted/non-adjuvanted, 30 µg adjuvanted). Starting with the lowest dose level, subjects
      will receive 2 vaccinations (21 days apart) at the dose to which they were assigned. Subjects
      will be monitored for safety and for antibody response to the vaccine. A data safety
      monitoring board will review and evaluate all the safety data obtained for a dose level
      before allowing administration of the next (higher) dose.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Male and femal subjects who

             consent prior to study entry;

          -  are clinically healthy, as determined by medical history and physical examination;

          -  agree to keep a daily record of symptoms;

          -  if female and capable of bearing children, have a negative urine pregnancy test result
             at study entry and agree to employ adequate birth control measures for the duration of
             the study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Subjects who

          -  are at high risk of contracting H5N1 influenza infection (e.g. poultry workers);

          -  suffer from a significant neurological, cardiac, pulmonary (including asthma),
             hepatic, rheumatic, autoimmune, hematological or renal disorder;

          -  suffer from any kind of immunodeficiency;

          -  suffer from a disease or are undergoing a form of treatment that can be expected to
             influence immune response. Such treatment includes, but is not limited to, systemic or
             high dose inhaled (&gt;800µg/day of beclomethasone dipropionate or equivalent)
             corticosteroids, radiation treatment or other immunosuppressive or cytotoxic drugs;

          -  have a history of inflammatory or degenerative neurological disease (e.g. Guillain
             Barré);

          -  have a history of severe allergic reactions or anaphylaxis;

          -  have a rash, dermatologic condition or tattoos which may interfere with injection site
             reaction rating;

          -  have received a blood transfusion or immunoglobulins within 90 days of study entry;

          -  have donated blood or plasma within 30 days of study entry;

          -  have received any live vaccine within 4 weeks or inactivated vaccine within 2 weeks
             prior to vaccination in this study;

          -  have undergone systemic corticoid therapy within 30 days prior to study entry;

          -  have a functional or surgical asplenia;

          -  have a known or suspected problem with alcohol or drug abuse;

          -  were administered an investigational drug within six weeks prior to study entry or are
             concurrently participating in a clinical study that includes the administration of an
             investigational product;

          -  are a member of the team conducting this study or are in a dependent relationship with
             the study investigator. Dependent relationships include close relatives (i.e.,
