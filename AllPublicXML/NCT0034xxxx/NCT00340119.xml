  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study, done in collaboration with Johns Hopkins University School of Public Health in
      Baltimore, Maryland, will examine the role of genes in the development of atherosclerotic
      cardiovascular disease (CVD) in patients undergoing kidney dialysis. The rate of illness and
      death from CVD among patients on dialysis is extraordinarily high, accounting for about 50
      percent of deaths. Blood levels of inflammatory markers are elevated in these patients,
      strongly predicting illness and death from CVD. The discovery of gene variants related to the
      inflammatory process in atherosclerotic CVD may lead to better medical treatments and
      improved survival in patients with end-stage kidney disease.

      Participants of John's Hopkins University's CHOICE (Choices for Healthy Outcomes in Caring
      for End-Stage Renal Disease) program are included in this study. Blood samples previously
      collected from these patients will be analyzed in the laboratory for genes that might be
      associated with the inflammatory process and atherogenesis.

      Background:

      The CHOICE (Choices for Healthy Outcomes in Caring for End stage renal disease) study is a
      national prospective cohort study of 1,041 incident dialysis patients aged 19 to 95 recruited
      in 81 dialysis clinics between October 1995 and June 1998, and is overseen by the Johns
      Hopkins University School of Public Health.

      The discovery of genetic associations offers the potential to direct clinical management in
      order to prevent ASCVD (Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Disease) and improve survival in
      patients with end stage renal disease (ESRD).

      Objectives:

      In Collaboration with investigators of the CHOICE cohort, we propose to assess the role of
      variants in genes related to the inflammatory process on atherosclerotic cardiovascular
      disease (ASCVD) incidence.

      Eligibility:

      Eligibility is independent of age, race, ethnicity, and gender. However, no participants in
      this cohort are less than 19 years of age.

      Design:

      Frozen buffy coats from 871 patients will be sent to the LGD, and DNA will be extracted.

      Singles nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within coding regions, upstream or downstream
      regulatory regions or in intronic regions of candidates genes will be genotyped.

      The first candidate genes under study include IL6, IL10, TGFB1, Beta Fibrinogen, LTA, and
      STAT3.

      Blood samples and relevant clinical data will be provided by Johns Hopkins University School
      of Public Health, Department of Epidemiology with only numerical code which links samples and
      clinical data. While Johns Hopkins University will retain patient identifier information, the
      LGD will have no way of identifying the person from whom the blood, subsequent DNA, and
      clinical data are obtained.

      The samples are maintained in our repository and curated through our central Laboratory
      database.

      Destruction or loss of clinical samples or data will be recorded in our database and cannot
      impact the study participants in any way.

      At the completion of this protocol, we will retain the samples for future use. We understand
      that studies subsequent to the completion of this protocol will require additional OHSR/IRB
      approval prior to commencement.
