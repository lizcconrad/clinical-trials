  <brief_title>Safety Study of an Influenza Vaccine Against a Potential Pandemic Strain of Flu</brief_title>
  <official_title>A Randomised Double Blind Dose-Ranging Study to Assess the Safety, Tolerability and Immunogenicity of a Monovalent H5 DNA Influenza Vaccine (A Vietnam/1194/2004) Administered by Particle Mediated Epidermal Delivery (PMED) to Healthy Adults</official_title>

  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate how well the vaccine is tolerated at sites where
      administrations are given, any effects it may have on subjects' wellbeing and whether it can
      produce antibody responses in the body that may protect against the subjects catching a
      pandemic strain of flu

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Pandemic influenza occurs when a strain of influenza to which the human population has not
      been exposed develops the ability to infect man and spread from person to person. Some
      pandemics can have very severe health impacts and be widespread. This study will evaluate
      PowderMed's Particle Mediated Epidermal Delivery (PMED) DNA vaccine for pandemic influenza as
      a potential alternative to other vaccine technologies. This study represents the first study
      with this vaccine and will provisionally assess its safety and immunogenicity (ability to
      generate an immune response) at four different dose combinations. The vaccine will be given
      as a prime-boost regimen with vaccination on Days 0 and 28
