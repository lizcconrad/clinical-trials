      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effects of low-dose androgen on the motor and
      cognitive development of boys with Klinefelter syndrome.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Klinefelter syndrome (KS), a genetic disorder that affects males only, is characterized by
      having an extra X chromosome. The phenotype — or physical and learning features — includes
      testicular failure, tall stature, and specific cognitive and behavioral attributes such as
      diminished motor function, language-based learning difficulties, poor self-image, and
      shyness. The KS phenotype may be the result of androgen deficiency in utero, infancy, and
      childhood. For individuals with KS, androgen replacement is standard treatment in adolescence
      and adulthood but has not been used earlier in childhood or included in the standard medical
      care of KS children ages 4 to 12.

      The purpose of this study is to examine the effects of androgen on learning and development
      in boys with KS. Researchers also want to determine if low-dose androgen replacement at an
      early age will improve some of the learning difficulties associated with the disorder. The
      overall goal of this study is to address questions regarding the relationship of early
      androgen deficiency to learning and motor function.

      Participants in the study will be randomized to one of two treatment groups, receiving either
      oxandrolone (low-dose androgen) or placebo, for two years. All participants will be evaluated
      for safety at the beginning of the study and at 3, 6, 12, 18, and 24 months. Also at the
      beginning of the study and every 3 to 6 months thereafter (for a total of 6 visits), the
      researchers will perform a careful history and physical examination and a bone age X-ray, and
      obtain a blood sample.

      Participation in the trial will last two years and includes 6 clinic visits.
