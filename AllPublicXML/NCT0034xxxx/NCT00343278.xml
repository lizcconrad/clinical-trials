  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Valaciclovir (VACV), the L-valyl ester prodrug of aciclovir (ACV), is extensively converted
      to ACV and L-valine after oral administration. In subjects with normal renal function, ACV is
      predominantly eliminated unchanged in the urine, with a small proportion metabolized to
      9-carboxymethoxymethylguanine (CMMG). The metabolism of ACV to CMMG is thought to involve
      aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH). On the basis of a high proportion of the Japanese population
      having low-activity ALDH, it can be hypothesized that the conversion of ACV to CMMG is
      decreased, thereby leading, in patients with renal impairment, to higher plasma
      concentrations of ACV. This pilot study was conducted to investigate potential relationships
      between genetic polymorphisms of ALDH2, an isozyme of ALDH, and the plasma pharmacokinetics
      (PK) of VACV, ACV and CMMG in subjects with end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis.

        Inclusion criteria:

          -  Japanese subjects with chronic renal failure undergoing hemodialysis regularly three
             times a week for at least 12 weeks prior to the start of the study.

        Exclusion criteria:

          -  Subjects with current alcohol dependence.

          -  Subjects with gastrointestinal dysfunction that may affect drug absorption.

          -  Subjects who have received an organ transplant (However, subjects with a corneal
             transplant or any other organ transplant that may not affect the objectives of the
             study will be eligible for inclusion in this study).
