  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      NDV is a virus tht is harmful in chicken, but harmless in man. There are 2 major sub-strains
      of NDV, one oncolytic and one non-oncolytic. Oncolytic NDV (MTH-68H) preferentially homes and
      replicates in cancer cells and therefore, administration of NDV intravenously or
      preferentially intra-tumor, either by direct injection or by injection into an afferent
      artery results in direct lysis of tumor cells. NDV activates apoptotic mechanism in cancer
      cells and thus, results in natural cell death.

      Both oncolytic and non-oncolytic NDV were used clinically in hundreds of patients with
      different types of cancer worldwide. NDV were proved harmless in man. Clinical studies were
      done for more than a decade and the efficacy of NDV was documented on pre-clinical animals
      models as well as in man.

      For a large number of patients with metastatic cancer and chemotherapy resistant
      hematological malignances, no cure can be provided by conventional anti-cancer modalities,
      new treatment options are urgently indicated. The goal of the study is to use NDV, in order
      to provide such treatment for patients in need.
