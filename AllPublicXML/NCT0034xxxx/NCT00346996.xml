  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Severe hypoglycaemia is hampering the lives of many diabetic patients. The effect on the
      occurrence of severe hypoglycaemia during two different insulin regimens are to be
      investigated. In total, 250 hypoglycaemia prone type 1 diabetic patients will be randomised
      to receive analogue and human insulin for one year in random order. Outcomes will be number
      of episodes of severe hypoglycaemia

  <detailed_description>

      The primary objective is to evaluate the effects of insulin analogue and human insulin on
      incidence of severe hypoglycaemia in type 1 diabetic patients prone to
      hypoglycaemia.Secondary endpoints are effect on incidence of symptomatic and asymptomatic
      documented hypoglycaemia.

      Study Design: An open, randomised, controlled, cross-over multi-centre study. Each treatment
      period lasts for one year. Patients will be randomised to treatment with basal bolus therapy
      with insulin detemir / aspart and insulatard / actrapid in random order. Endpoints will be
      assessed during the last 9 months of each treatment arm.

      Patient population: 250 type 1 diabetic patients with a history of two or more episodes of
      severe hypoglycaemia during the preceding year.

      Interventions: Basal bolus therapy with insulin detemir / aspart and insulatard / human
      actrapid in random order. Each treatment period lasts 12 months.

      Methods: Patients will record all events of severe hypoglycaemia, documented symptomatic and
      asymptomatic hypoglycaemia in a diary and report all events of severe hypoglycaemia by
      telephone within 24 hours. All patients will be instructed to do and record home blood
      glucose monitoring (SMBG) i.e. 7 point profiles twice per week and nocturnal measurements
      once every month.

      Outcomes: Severe hypoglycaemia, documented symptomatic and asymptomatic hypoglycaemia
      Efficacy: Number of reported episodes of severe, documented symptomatic and asymptomatic
      hypoglycaemia during the last 9 months of treatment - during daytime and night time.

      Safety: Adverse reactions
