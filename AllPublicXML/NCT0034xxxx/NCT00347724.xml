  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the analgesic efficacy of oral, once-daily tramadol
      ER 300 mg and 200 mg to placebo in patients with moderate to severe chronic low back pain
      requiring daily analgesic treatment. The study hypothesis is that tramadol ER is effective in
      the treatment of moderate to severe chronic low back pain.

    <textblock>
      Immediate release (IR) tramadol has demonstrated efficacy in several pain conditions
      including: obstetrical, gynecological, orthopedic, abdominal, and oral surgery. The short
      elimination half-life of IR tramadol necessitates every 4-6 hour dosing in order to maintain
      optimum levels of analgesia in chronic pain. The study medication in this study is a
      once-daily, extended release (ER) tramadol formulation. This is a multicenter, double-blind,
      randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study. At the Screening Visit, patients
      eligible for study participation by medical history, physical exam and other evaluations will
      enter a 2-7 day washout period during which time analgesics will not be allowed. At Visit 2,
      patients with a pain intensity &gt;= 40 mm on a 100 mm visual analog scale (VAS) and who meet
      all other eligibility criteria will be admitted into a 3-week, open-label, run-in period
      during which time they will receive tramadol ER 100 mg once daily (QD) for at least 3 days.
      On Day 4, the dose will be increased to tramadol ER 200 mg QD, based on tolerability.
      Patients must be maintained on a minimum dose of tramadol 200 mg QD by the beginning of
      Week-2 (Visit 3); the dose may be increased to tramadol ER 300 mg QD at Visit 3, based on
      tolerability. Patients must increase their tramadol ER dose to 300 QD by the beginning of
      Week - 1 (Visit 4); this dose must be maintained for one week. Patients with pain
      unresponsive to appropriate dose adjustments or with unacceptable side effects will be
      discontinued from the study and an alternative analgesic therapy will be initiated. Patients
      receiving tramadol ER 300 mg QD at the end of the run-in period (Visit 5, Week 0) will enter
      a 12-week, double-blind period during which they will be randomized to receive tramadol ER
      300 mg, tramadol ER 200 mg, or placebo QD. No dose adjustments will be permitted during the
      double-blind period of the study. Patients will return for safety and efficacy evaluations at
      Weeks 1, 2, 4, 8 and 12 or early termination. Study medication will be discontinued at Week
      12 and patients will return after one week for a post-treatment visit (Week 13).

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with a history of chronic low back pain &gt;= 6 months requiring treatment with
             NSAIDs, acetaminophen, opioid analgesics, COX-2 selective inhibitors, and/or muscle
             relaxants for at least 60 of the 90 days preceeding the screening visit; in good
             health as determined by the investigator on the basis of medical history, physical
             exam and screening labs; patient's low back pain intensity measures &gt;= 40 mm on a
             visual analog scale (VAS) at the start of the run-in peroid after the 2-7 day washout;
             patients who are able to discontinue treatment with NSAIDs, COX-2 selective
             inhibitors, tramadol, muscle relaxants, opioids, and/or other analgesics during the
             2-7 day washout period and all other analgesics throughout the entire study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with a diagnosis of a complex regional pain syndrome, significant
             inflammatory pain, or clinically significant active fibromyalgia; patients with a
             history of lumbar surgery or chemonucleolysis; patients undergoing transcutaneous
             electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) or spinal manipulation for low back pain; patients
             with an uncontrolled medical condition or a clinically significant condition that
             would, in the investigator's opinion, preclude study participation; patients using
             analgesics or other agents during washout that could confound the analgesic response.
