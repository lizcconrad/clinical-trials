  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Our group has shown that HAART increases the thymic production of naïve T cells in the
      healthy adult, thereby boosting the immune system. We propose to investigate the amount of
      and length of Nelfinavir therapy necessary to increase those cells in adults. Subjects will
      be treated with Nelfinavir, and blood will be sampled at variable times to determine the
      immune response in peripheral blood.

      Blood will be collected at several time points during the study. DNA will be isolated from
      peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) and assessed for signal point (sj) TREC content relative
      to genomic CCR5 copies by real time PCR in a spectoflourometic thermal cycler. TREC values
      will be expressed as TREC copy number per copies of CCR5 or TREC/PBLs.

      We anticipate that we will confirm our previous observations that nelfinavir therapy will
      increase TRECs, indicating naive T cell production from the thymus. The proposed study will
      determine the time course of the anticipated increase in TREC/PBLs.
