      The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the continued efficacy of modafinil
      treatment, compared to placebo treatment, in children and adolescents with
      attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) who are responders to modafinil treatment, as
      assessed by the change from baseline (in this current study) in the total score from the ADHD
      Rating Scale, Fourth Edition (ADHD-RS-IV) (Home Version) at endpoint (week 6 or last
      double-blind post-baseline visit).

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients must be currently enrolled in a Cephalon-sponsored clinical study and have
             completed at least 12 months of continuous modafinil treatment. Patients will be
             included in the study if they continue to meet all applicable criteria in their
             previous study and all of the following criteria are met:

               -  Written informed consent/assent is obtained.

               -  The patient is currently enrolled in study C1538d/312/AD/US or C1538/3044/AD/US
                  and received modafinil treatment, continuously, for at least 12 months.

               -  The patient meets the protocol criteria for response at each of the last 2 visits
                  of their previous study. Patients from study C1538d/312/AD/US must have at least
                  a 25% reduction in Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder Rating Scale - IV
                  [ADHD-RS-IV] (Home Version) total score compared with the original baseline (this
                  must be the baseline for a previous double-blind, placebo-controlled study of
                  modafinil in ADHD). Patients from study C1538/3044/AD/US must have at least a 25%
                  reduction in total score of the ADHD Index subscale of the Conners' Parent Rating
                  Scale: Revised, Short Form (CPRS:R-S), compared with the baseline value from
                  study C1538/3044/AD/US.

               -  The patient is in good health (except for diagnosis of ADHD) as determined by
                  medical and psychiatric history, physical examination, electrocardiograms (ECGs),
                  serum chemistry, hematology, urinalysis, and vital signs.

               -  Girls who are post-menarche or sexually active must have a negative urine
                  pregnancy test at the baseline visit, must be using a medically acceptable method
                  of birth control, and must agree to continue use of this method for the duration
                  of the study (and for 30 days after participation in the study). Acceptable
                  methods of birth control include the following: barrier method with spermicide;
                  steroidal contraceptive (eg, oral, transdermal, implanted, or injected) in
                  conjunction with a barrier method; intrauterine device (IUD); and abstinence.

               -  The patient has a parent or legal guardian who is willing to participate in the
                  study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients are excluded from participating in this study if 1 or more of the following
             criteria are met:

               -  The patient has a history or current diagnosis of pervasive developmental
                  disorder, schizophrenia, or other psychotic disorders, or positive clinical
                  assessment of current suicide risk or ideation.

               -  The patient has any current psychiatric co-morbidity that requires
                  pharmacotherapy, including but not limited to depression or other mood disorder,
                  anxiety disorder, or pervasive mental disorder.

               -  The patient currently uses any other prescription medication, other than
                  modafinil, for ADHD (eg, amphetamine, dextroamphetamine, methylphenidate,
                  pemoline, atomoxetine).

               -  Previous exposure to modafinil caused any clinically significant (drug-related)
                  adverse reaction that led to withdrawal from the study, or which the investigator
                  considers likely to put the patient at risk.
