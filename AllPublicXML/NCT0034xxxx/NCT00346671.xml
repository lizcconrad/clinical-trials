  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Complementary therapies such as Reiki are becoming popular. Reiki is a practice used for
      relaxation and pain management that involves physical touch and social contact with a
      trained, empathetic practitioner. Unlike many relaxation therapies, Reiki requires no
      participation by the patient, a feature that makes Reiki particularly attractive in the
      hospital setting, where patients are often extremely anxious, depressed, in pain, or sedated.
      Our primary research questions are to determine whether physiological changes are induced
      during a Reiki session and whether a Reiki session affects responses to a subsequent acute
      stressor. Secondary research questions include assessing which benefits result from placebo
      or unique abilities of &quot;attuned&quot; Reiki practitioners and assessing background characteristics
      of recipients that are associated with acceptance and responsiveness. Based on its use to
      reduce pain and anxiety, we will study potential mechanisms by which Reiki decreases activity
      of the sympathetic nervous system and other stress pathways. Comparison of the responses in a
      Reiki group with those in supine-control and sham groups will allow us to gain insights into
      mechanisms by which Reiki effects are mediated. Information obtained from the proposed
      studies will provide detailed information on physiological pathways affected by Reiki. Should
      Reiki decrease stress pathways or reduce physiological responses to stressful situations, it
      could be a useful adjunct to traditional medicine and have significant health and economic
      benefits.
