      RATIONALE: Diagnostic procedures, such as positron emission tomography (PET) scan and
      computated tomography (CT) scan, may help doctors predict a patient's response to treatment
      and may help plan the best treatment. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as doxorubicin and
      ifosfamide, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the
      cells or by stopping them from dividing. Giving chemotherapy before surgery may make the
      tumor smaller and reduce the amount of normal tissue that needs to be removed.

      PURPOSE: This clinical trial is studying how well PET scan combined with CT scan predicts
      response in patients undergoing chemotherapy and surgery for soft tissue sarcoma.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Determine whether measurements of fludeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography
           (PET)/CT imaging can accurately predict disease-free survival of patients with soft
           tissue sarcoma who are receiving neoadjuvant chemotherapy.

      Secondary

        -  Correlate histological response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy for soft tissue sarcomas
           with FDG-PET/CT imaging findings.

      Tertiary

        -  Determine the changes in FDG-PET/CT imaging over time as each course of chemotherapy is
           given.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive 1 of 2 standard chemotherapy regimens:

        -  Preferred regimen: Patients receive pegylated doxorubicin HCl liposome IV on day 1,
           ifosfamide IV continuously on days 1-6, and pegfilgrastim subcutaneously (SC) on day 8.
           Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 4 courses in the absence of disease
           progression or unacceptable toxicity.

        -  Alternative regimen: Patients receive doxorubicin hydrochloride IV continuously on days
           1-7. Patients also receive ifosfamide and pegfilgrastim as in the preferred regimen.
           Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 4 courses in the absence of disease
           progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      All patients undergo a fludeoxyglucose positron emission tomography/CT scan at baseline,
      after course 1, and after completion of chemotherapy. Patients undergo surgery within 4-6
      weeks after completion of chemotherapy.

      After completion of study treatment and surgery, patients are followed every 6 months for 5
      years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 62 patients will be accrued for this study.

    <description>The overall histologic response will be defined as:
% histologic response = 100 - % viable tumor in the central slice as assessed histologically It should be noted that the % histologic response is different from % tumor necrosis as it includes an assessment of the % tumor necrosis along with the degenerative changes</description>
