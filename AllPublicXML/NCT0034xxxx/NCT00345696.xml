      To look for a new chemotherapy management to get less acute and chronic toxicity and/or an
      easier administration treatment line.

      This study tries to demonstrate an alternative chemotherapy scheme,continuous
      polychemotherapy regimen with less dose with the added effect of the monoclonal antibody
      Bevacizumab.
