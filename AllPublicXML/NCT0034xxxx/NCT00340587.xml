  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      At fertilization, the binding of sperm to the zona pellucida induces the acrosome reaction
      releasing lytic enzymes that facilitate the passage of the sperm through the zona. The sperm
      then fuses with the egg's plasm membrane and enters the egg's cytoplasm. The zona pellucida,
      an extracellular matrix composed of three glycoproteins (ZP1, ZP2, ZP3), mediates the
      species-specific binding of sperm to egg. Although homologous proteins are present in mouse
      and humans, human sperm will not bind to the mouse zona pellucida and when the zona pellucida
      is experimentally removed, human sperm will not bind or fuse to the mouse egg's plasm
      membrane. We have created transgenic mouse lines that express one or more human zona
      proteins. We wish to determine if human sperm will bind to these chimeric zonae and if this
      binding will induce the human sperm acrosome reaction. Sperm and devitalized eggs will be
      collected by collaborating institution(s) under protocols and consent forms approved by that
      institution's IRB. Only procedures already being performed on subjects for diagnostic or
      treatment purposes will be used.

      At fertilization, the binding of sperm to the zona pellucida induces the acrosome reaction
      releasing lytic enzymes that facilitate the passage of the sperm through the zona. The sperm
      then fuses with the egg s plasma membrane and enters the egg s cytoplasm. The zona pellucida,
      an extracellular matrix composed of three or four glycoproteins, mediates the
      species-specific binding of sperm to egg. Although homologous proteins are present in mouse
      and humans, human sperm will not bind to the mouse zona pellucida and when the zona pellucida
      is experimentally removed, human sperm will not bind or fuse to the mouse egg's plasma
      membrane. We have established transgenic mouse lines that express one or more human or rat
      zona proteins. We wish to determine if human sperm will bind to these chimeric zonae and if
      this binding will induce the human sperm acrosome reaction. Sperm and devitalized eggs will
      be collected by collaborating institution(s) under protocols and consent forms approved by
      that institution's IRB. Alternatively, anonymous fertile human sperm will be obtained from a
      commercial sperm bank using a donor consent agreement. Only procedures already being
      performed on subjects for diagnostic or treatment purposes will be used.
