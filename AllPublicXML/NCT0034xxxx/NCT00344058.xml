  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Magnesium sulfate is used for seizure prophylaxis in pregnancies complicated by preeclampsia.
      There is debate as to how long to continue this therapy after delivery of the pregnancy.
      Different schemes have been offered to shorten the exposure to magnesium sulfate after
      delivery, with little data. We seek to investigate the effect of shortened magnesium sulfate
      therapy on the post-partum recovery phase of mild preeclampsia. Our hypothesis was that
      shortened therapy (12 hours versus the traditional 24 hours post-partum) has no effect on
      disease course, and will result in significantly shorter exposure to magnesium sulfate.

      The study has been completed at this time.

      Consenting women with suspected mild preeclampsia (new onset/exacerbated hypertension with
      proteinuria) were randomly assigned 12 (12-hour) or 24-hours (24-hour) of postpartum MgSO4.
      Treatment was continued beyond the initially assigned time period for new findings of severe
      preeclampsia. Clinical and laboratory data were collected. Analysis was by intent to treat,
      utilizing Fisher’s exact, chi-square, and Student’s t-tests where appropriate
