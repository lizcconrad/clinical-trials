    <textblock>
      This study will identify genetic factors associated with the development of progressive
      multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) in patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome
      (AIDS). PML is a life-threatening infection of the brain that affects about 5 percent of
      untreated patients with AIDS. Its symptoms include mental deterioration, vision loss, speech
      disturbances, ataxia (inability to coordinate movements), paralysis, and coma. PML is caused
      by a polyomavirus called the JC virus.

      It is estimated that up to 80 percent of the human population has been exposed to the JC
      virus, but the disease is very rare. The virus only becomes active in people who have
      compromised immune systems, such as those undergoing immune suppressive chemotherapy for
      cancer and those with damaged immune systems due to HIV.

      Patients who have participated in the Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study may be eligible for this
      study, as well as healthy normal volunteers who will serve as controls. The study will review
      clinical information from patients and analyze genetic factors from both patients and control
      subjects to investigate genes associated with AIDS and JC virus infection.

      The purpose of this study is to identify host genetic factors that contribute to the
      development of Progressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy (PML) associated with JC virus. JC
      virus is one of many opportunistic infections that arise in AIDS patients. JC virus is widely
      distributed in the general population, with estimates of population exposure ranging from
      30-80%. JC virus remains latent in the host, and in profoundly immunosuppressed patients, JC
      virus can cause PML, a fatal disease associated with neurotropic JC virus that lytically
      infects oligodendrocytes. In untreated AIDS populations, the frequency of PML has been
      estimated at roughly 5%. This study will identify host genetic factors that may contribute to
      the development of PML in the AIDS population.
