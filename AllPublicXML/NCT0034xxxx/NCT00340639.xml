  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This 1-year study will explore the influences of family and peers on how diabetic adolescents
      manage their disease, focusing on adolescent developmental transitions. The management of
      diabetes is a complex process involving daily self-care activities, problem-solving, and
      decision-making. It is particularly challenging during adolescence when youth are
      experiencing physiological, social and psychological changes, and coming under increasing
      peer influence and decreasing parental supervision. Although it is expected that the
      responsibility for diabetes management will gradually shift from the parent to the child
      during adolescence, research indicates that many children may be given responsibility for
      managing their illness too early, without adequate parental monitoring. Specifically, this
      study will examine the following issues:

        -  The relationship of peers, parents and school support to successful diabetes management;

        -  The influence of the adolescent's self-image and personal goals on diabetes management;

        -  The influence of the adolescent's and parents' attitudes, capability and environment on
           the balance of responsibility for diabetes management.

      Children between 10 and 16 years of age receiving treatment for diabetes type 1 at Georgetown
      University Medical Center's pediatric diabetes clinic may be eligible for this study. The
      children must have been diagnosed with diabetes at least 1 year before entering the study and
      must require insulin treatment. One parent of each child will also participate in the study.

      Children and their parents will complete the following procedures:

      Home Interviews: Parents and children will complete two at-home face-to-face interviews 6
      months apart. At each interview, children will answer questions about their responsibility
      for and adherence to their diabetes management, treatment outcome expectations, optimism,
      self-esteem, self-consciousness, personal goals, social support, perceived barriers to
      diabetes management, family routine and family conflict, their parents' involvement in their
      diabetes management, and parenting style. Parents will evaluate their child's ability to
      manage his or her diabetes, level of maturity, self-esteem, and transition of responsibility;
      their family routine and family conflict, parent-child communication, their parenting goals,
      and their involvement in and responsibility for their child's diabetes management. Three days
      after the 6-month interview, a randomly selected group of parents and children will complete
      a brief, additional telephone interview covering some of the same issues.

      Telephone Interview: At 12 months, parents and children will complete a telephone interview
      that will include questions about adherence to diabetes management and the responsibility of
      parents and children for diabetes management.

      Management of diabetes is a complex process involving the conduct of daily self-care
      activities, problem-solving, and decision-making. It is particularly challenging during
      adolescence when youth are experiencing a variety of physiological, social, and psychological
      changes at the same time that they are taking increased responsibility for their own diabetes
      care. This study examines the influence of family, social, and adolescent developmental
      transitions. Over the course of 12 months, a sample of 135 parent-child dyads will provide
      information on individual efficacy, maturity, family and social support, attitudes toward
      diabetes management, and diabetes management behaviors. One goal of this pilot study is to
      identify factors that predict the adherence of individual youth and parents during this
      transition period.
