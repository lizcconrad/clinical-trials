      This study is intended to support the registration of IMOVAX Polio in China.

      The primary objective of this Pase III trial is to compare IMOVAX Polio to the current
      Chinese standard of care (OPV) that is administered following a schedule of 2-3-4 months. The
      objective is to demonstrate that after the 3 doses primary series, in terms of seroprotection
      rates, IMOVAX Polio is not inferior to OPV. The safety of IPV will be assessed after each IPV
      dose.
