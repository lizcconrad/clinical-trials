  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a retrospective one, exploring the hypothesis that a person's genotypic makeup
      may be associated with a clinical response or toxic effect to a drug. Genetic polymorphisms,
      that is, states of being able to assume different forms, that are in drug-metabolizing
      enzymes, transporters, and receptors may affect a patient's response to drug therapy. To
      date, there have been limited studies looking at a drug-metabolizing genotype (genetic
      makeup) or phenotype (result of the genotype's interaction with the environment). However, it
      is often wondered if the variations in a drug's action, that is, pharmacokinetic effect, come
      from the genotype phenotype relationship.

      Participants who entered previous clinical trials at the National Cancer Institute, as
      approved by the Central Institutional Review Board, may be eligible for this study. Studies
      for which pharmacokinetic analyses were or are being performed will be the source of the
      patient population.

      Genotyping experiments will be performed through genomic DNA isolated from stored frozen
      serum. The genotyping results will be compared with pharmacokinetic data and clinical
      outcomes. Clinical data will consist of what is obtained during the course of the principal
      pharmacokinetic study. The results of the retrospective analyses will provide no direct
      benefit to the participants.

      Background

      Genetic polymorphisms in drug-metabolizing enzymes, transporterss/receptors, and
      transcription factors might affect an individual s response to drug therapy.

      Inter-individual differences in efficacy and toxicity of cancer chemotherapy are especially
      important given the narrow therapeutic index of these drugs.

      During analysis of investigational agents, inter-individual variances in pharmacokinetics and
      pharmacodynamics are often noted. It is often wondered if these variances might in part be
      explained by genetic differences in drug metabolizing enzymes, transporters, or other
      criticial regulators of gene expression.

      Objectives

      To better understand the genotype-phenotype relationship, additional analysis correlating
      pharmacokinetic data with relevant genotyping.

      Eligibility

      All individuals previously enrolled on IRB approved clinical trials at the National Cancer
      Institute.

      Design

      In these retrospective studies, the association between an individual s pharmacokinetic
      profile and the genetic variation in their drug metabolizing enzymes and other critical
      regulators of gene expression will be investigated.

      The hypothesis that an individual s genotypic constitution may be associated with clinical
      response and/or toxicity will be explored.

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:

        In this retrospective study, any cancer patients entered on IRB approved clinical trials at
        the National Cancer Institute are eligible. Studies for which pharmacokinetic analyses
        were/are being performed will be the source of the patient population. At this time
        enrollment will be limited to patients with pharmacokinetic samples obtained during
        treatment on protocol 00-C-0033, 00-C-0080, 01-C-0049, 01-C-0124, 01-C-0215, 02-C-0061,
        02-C-0083, 02-C-0130, 02-C-0149, 02-C-0215, 02-C-0218, 02-C-0229, 03-C-0030, 03-C-0157,
        03-C-0176, 03-C-0284, 04-C-0132, 04-C-0257, 04-C-0262, 04-C-0273, 04-C-0280, 05-C-0022,
        05-C-0049, 05-C-0167, 05-C-0186, 06-C-0083, 06-C-0088, 06-C-0164, 06-C-0221, 07-C-0047,
        07-C-0059, 07-C-0106, 07-C-0107, 08-C-0030, 08-C-0074, 94-C-0169, 95-C-0015, 97-C-0135,
        97-C-0171, and 98-C-0015.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

        A patient will be excluded if there is an insufficient quantity of sample available to
        perform the genotyping procedure. This is not anticipated to be of significance for this
        study since the methodology does not require a large serum sample.
