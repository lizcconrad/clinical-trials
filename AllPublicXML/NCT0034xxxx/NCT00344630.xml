  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To compare the relative efficacy and safety of the TAXUS Express2 stents and the Cypher
      stents among a broad, unselected patient population treated in a nationwide, multi-center
      clinical registry representative of 'real-world,' contemporary clinical practice. A secondary
      objective is to examine performance of the two stents in pre-specified subgroup populations
      and examine regional and national patterns in outcomes.
