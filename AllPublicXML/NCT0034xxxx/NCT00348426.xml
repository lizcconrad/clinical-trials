  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A second botulism outbreak in Northern Thailand was reported in 2006. 192 people were exposed
      to raw meat and the gut of deer, 83 suffered from diarrhea. Of these 5 developed respiratory
      failure, 1 impending respiratory failure.

      We analysed the clinical findings and electrophysiologic findings in this second episode of
      large botulism outbreak in northern Thailand.

      PRELIMINARY REPORT Northern Thailand's big botulism outbreak occurred again on 30 June 14,
      2006, [16.00pm] affecting 83 from 192 people who exposed to raw dear meat and gut [1 night
      preserved with ice pack of whole body of dear before disection and distribution ]. Of these,
      3 developed respiratory failure, 1 developed impending respiratory failure, 83 of 192 whom
      developed fatique and diarrhea after ingestion of raw dear meat and gut on 26-30 June 2006. 3
      patients were refered to 2 high facility hospitals for severe respiratory failure. Physical
      examination of 3 patients in ICU of Chiang Kum general hospital revealed ptosis [3/3] mild
      ophthalmoparesis [2/3] Proximal muscle weakness [2/3] abdominal paradoxical respiration [3/3]
      pupil dilate [1/3] and negative inspiratory pressure [NIP] less than 15 mmHg [3/3] were
      observed. Neurological electrophysiologic study of 2 patients revealed low amplitude compound
      muscle action potential [CMAP] of Abductor digiti minimi [ADM] muscle with decrement response
      after repetitive stimulation with low frequency [3Hz], increment response of ADM muscle after
      stimulation with high frequency [10Hz, 20Hz, and 30Hz.].The electrophysiologic findings
      support diagnosis of presynaptic neuromuscular dysfunction with respiratory failure, Botulism
      is most likely diagnosis. After treated with botulinum antitoxin [on July,1 ,2006 [mixed-type
      botulinum antitoxin --donated from Japan at Nan Hospital's botulisum outbreak on March
      14,2006], 3 patients in ICU showed improvement of over all clinical outcomes. Active survey
      by Ministry of Public Health of Thailand and CDC-USA to identify the high risk patient who
      may develop respiratory failure , and immunologucal vs microbiological diagnosis were
      performed. This outbreak may be the second hit of botulisum in the northern Thailand but less
      amount of severe cases was observed.
