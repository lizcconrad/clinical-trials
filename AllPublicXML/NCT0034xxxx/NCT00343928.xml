      serotonin function in individuals who have recovered from anorexia nervosa.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Anorexia nervosa is a serious psychiatric disorder resulting in psychosocial distress for
      patients and their families, potentially severe medical consequences, and substantial
      long-term mortality. A major emphasis in current therapeutic research in anorexia nervosa is
      exploration of new interventions to stabilize recovery and prevent relapse. Although the
      etiology of anorexia nervosa is unknown, altered regulation of the neurotransmitter serotonin
      in the central nervous system is thought to contribute to preoccupation with body shape and
      weight, dysregulated eating patterns, persistent anxiety, and frequent mood fluctuations. The
      goal of this exploratory project is to assess the behavioral effects of an amino acid mixture
      thought to influence serotonin function in individuals who have recovered from anorexia
      nervosa. It is hypothesized that this brief intervention will help diminish residual eating
      disorder symptoms.

      All participants in this crossover study will attend eight sessions over a 9-week period.
      Participants will spend approximately 2 weeks in each phase, during which they will receive
      an amino acid mixture and the control condition.
