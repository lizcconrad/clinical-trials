  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this phase IIIb study is to determine whether children who have not received a
      3-dose primary vaccination with the pneumococcal conjugate vaccine before their 6 months of
      age, can receive the vaccine as part of a catch-up immunization schedule. The immunogenicity,
      safety and reactogenicity of GSK Biologicals' pneumococcal conjugate vaccine will be
      evaluated for four different age groups with different schedules:

      &lt; 6 months of age group: 3-dose primary vaccination + a booster dose. 7 to 11 months of age
      group: 2-dose primary vaccination + a booster dose. 12 to 23 months of age group: 2-dose
      vaccination; no booster dose. 24 months to 5 years of age group: 1-dose vaccination; no
      booster dose. Children below 6 months of age will receive concomitantly a DTPa-IPV/Hib
      vaccine.
