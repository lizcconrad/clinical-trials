  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Studies have shown that there is a significant association between serum bilirubin
      concentrations and risk of coronary artery disease (CAD). So far, no linkage analysis in
      humans between serum bilirubin and DNA markers has been reported. The purpose of this
      protocol is to identify chromosome regions that contain quantitative trait loci (QTL)
      involved in serum bilirubin metabolism and bilirubin concentration. In the Framingham Study,
      a 10cM genome scan (about 400 markers) has been conducted in more than three hundred
      families. Serum bilirubin was measured in the first and second exams of the Framingham
      Offspring. These data provide us the opportunity to undertake linkage analyses to map QTL of
      serum bilirubin.

      Many studies showed that there is a significant relationship between serum bilirubin levels
      and risk of coronary artery disease (CAD). We carried out a genome-wide scan for quantitative
      trait loci of serum bilirubin through the 330 extended Framingham families and found
      significant evidence of linkage of serum bilirubin to chromosome 2q telomere where an
      important candidate gene, Uridine diphosphate glycosyltransferase 1 gene (UGT1A1), resides.
      The purposes of this protocol are to confirm linkage between serum bilirubin and UGT1A1,
      mathematical modeling and association studies between the genotypes of UGT1A1 and CAD.
