  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Because AVI-4020 Injection was found to cross the blood-brain barrier, and because AVI-4126
      (RESTEN-NG) has potential medical benefit to people with a variety of diseases, including
      cancers, this study is being performed to find out if AVI-4126 also crosses the blood-brain
      barrier. If it does, then additional investigations could be performed, such as in people
      with certain types of cancer.
