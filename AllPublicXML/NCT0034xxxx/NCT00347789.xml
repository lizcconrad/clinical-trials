  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Transconjunctival mitomycin-C in needle bleb revision may be an effective procedure to treat
      cases with a previously failed trabeculectomy. We will investigate approximately 100
      consecutive cases with follow up of up to 9 years. We anticipate that this procedure is an
      effective, safe, and appropriate option for successful glaucoma treatment.

      The healing process after filtering surgery for glaucoma may cause an unsuccessful outcome
      for the trabeculectomy procedure. In order to control the rising intraocular pressure due to
      the failed trabeculectomy, medications may be restarted and/or filtering surgery may need to
      be repeated. Our primary research showed that transconjunctival mitomycin-C in needle bleb
      revision may be an effective procedure to control this situation.

      This retrospective study will follow over 100 patients from May 1997 to May 2006. This
      long-term follow up will help assess the future role of this technique in glaucoma practices.
