      The Building Futures for Youth (BFY) project is a pilot intervention program for 6th grade
      students and their parents in the District of Columbia public school system. The full
      intervention will include students in the 6th, 7th and 8th grades. The primary overall goal
      of the project is to help students learn to make healthy life choices and delay sexual
      initiation.

      Sixth-grade children and parents in four Washington, D.C., public schools will be recruited
      for this study. Children from two schools will participate in the BFY intervention program
      and children from two other schools will serve as controls. Participants are guided through
      three study phases, with each phase spanning one school year, as follows:

      Sixth-grade students are given a foundation in goal setting, decision-making and
      communication skills. They gain knowledge about puberty, reproduction, and the negative
      consequences associated with having a child at a young age. They learn strategies for getting
      out of situations in which they feel pressured to engage in sexual activity. Through lessons,
      activities, and discussions they are given tools to answer the following questions:

        -  Who am I? Students engage in self-reflection activities and discussions that allow them
           to become aware of their values, beliefs and strengths, increasing self-esteem and a
           positive self-image.

        -  What do I want for my life? Students engage in goal-setting activities, creating
           short-term and long-term goals and mapping out the necessary steps to achieve the goals.

        -  How do I get there? Students are instructed in decision-making, problem-solving and
           communication skills.

        -  How can having sex too early affect my life and the goals I want to achieve? Students
           explore the negative impact that engaging in sexual activity too early and getting
           pregnant or getting someone pregnant can have on their emotional, social and financial
           lives.

      Seventh grade students are given the tools and skills necessary to deal with a variety of
      challenges they may experience during their developmental years. They receive comprehensive
      sex education, in conjunction with life skills such as relationship negotiation, dating
      skills, violence prevention and problem-solving skills.

      Eighth grade students are guided through a series of activities that encourage students to
      translate knowledge gained in the 6th and 7th grade phases into long-term behavioral changes
      and risk reduction. Activities include writing and performing skills, creating an
      informational pamphlet, designing T-shirts and creating poetry that affirms the BFY message.

      In addition, students participate in a program of community service projects, such as the
      Anacostia River clean-up coordinated by the Earth Conservation Corps and Martin Luther King
      Day events coordinated by Howard University's Community Association and Project Change.

      Parents are provided skills training and information on a variety of issues relating to
      adolescent sexuality, parental monitoring and parent-child communication.

      The Adolescent Pregnancy Prevention Project, or Building Futures for Youth, is embarking on a
      pilot year in order to test the effectiveness of a revised children's intervention for Grade
      6. Although there was some evidence of a positive effect of the intervention for girls during
      Phase II, there were no significant effects for boys. In light of these findings, BFY will
      spend the current project year piloting a revised classroom intervention as well as a newly
      adapted after-school intervention component.
