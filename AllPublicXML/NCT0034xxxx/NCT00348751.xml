    <textblock>
      Indirect evidence show alerting physicians with clinical decision support systems (CDSS) seem
      to change behaviour more than requiring users to actively initiate the system. However,
      randomized trials comparing these methods in a clinical setting are lacking. In this study we
      compare the effect of Alerting physicians with a CDSS or actively requiring initiation of
      CDSS on the adherence of Dutch general practitioners to the Cholesterol guideline of the
      Dutch college of General Practitioners.

      compare the effect of Alerting physicians with a CDSS or actively requiring initiation of
      CDSS on the adherence of Dutch general practitioners to the Cholesterol guideline of the
      Dutch college of General Practitioners, using a clinical decsion support system called
      CholGate. This system has the functionality to provide both Alerting and On-Demand decision
      support. Users are free to negate the advise provided by the decision support system. The
      trial will have a cluster randomized structure.
