  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We propose to conduct a population-based case-control study of facial clefts (cleft lip or
      palate) in Norwegian newborns. Cleft lip and palate are one of the most common type of birth
      defect, and both genetic and environmental causes have been suspected. This project will
      combine tests of recently-discovered genes associated with facial clefting and personal
      interviews of the mothers soon after birth. With this information we expect to be able to
      assess the combined role of genetic susceptibility and environmental exposures in causation
      of facial clefts. We plan to enroll 750 cases and 1100 controls over five years. This will
      provide a 2:1 ratio of controls to cases for the largest sub-category of facial clefts (cleft
      lip with or without cleft palate).

      This study is being conducted as a collaboration between the US National Institute of
      Environmental Health Sciences, and the Norwegian Institute of Public Health/Medical Birth
      Registry. Norway offers a unique opportunity for carrying out such a study. First, all
      Norwegian babies with facial clefts are treated at one of two medical centers at the expense
      of the national government. Our collaboration with these two clinics will provide access to
      virtually every case born in the country. Second, the Medical Birth Registry maintains a file
      of all newborn babies, from which control infants can be randomly drawn from the whole
      population. Random population controls are the gold standard for such studies, but are seldom
      feasible. Third, blood samples from all Norwegian newborns are sent to one laboratory for
      analysis of PKU. Our collaboration with the PKU laboratory will permit mothers of control
      infants to consent to the study of their baby's blood without having to submit their baby to
      an additional needle stick.

      Mothers of cases and controls will be initially contacted through their physicians, and will
      be asked to participate in a telephone interview. With their consent, the mothers will also
      be asked to provide biological samples for analysis of genes that predispose to facial
      clefts. We will collect cheek swabs from control mothers and their infants. Case mothers will
      be asked to provide additional blood samples and cheek swabs for more intensive study of
      genetic factors within their family. Protection of privacy will be paramount. Mothers of case
      infants will be given the option of receiving individual results, but only if a consulting
      panel of ethicists and other experts agree that such information will be beneficial.

      Analysis and presentation of data will be carried out jointly by US and Norwegian
      investigators.

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:

        We expect to be able to recruit the mothers of virtually all Norwegian babies born with
        facial clefts during the study period (1995-1999).

        Controls will be chosen randomly from all Norwegian live-births through the Medical Birth
        Registry.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

        There will be no exclusion by race, sex or ethnic group.
