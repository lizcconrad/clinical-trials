      This study is designed to generate clinical data as outlined in the Note for Guidance on
      harmonization requirements for influenza vaccine marketing authorization by the European
      Medicines Agency.

      The objectives of the trial are:

        -  To evaluate the compliance, in terms of immunogenicity, of the inactivated, split-virion
           influenza vaccine Northern Hemisphere 2006-2007 formulation with the requirements of the
           European Medicines Agency

        -  To describe the safety of the inactivated, split-virion influenza vaccine, Northern
           Hemisphere 2006-2007 formulation.
