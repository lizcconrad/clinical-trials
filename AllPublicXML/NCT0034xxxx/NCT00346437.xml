    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether a single intracoronary infusion of Ad5FGF-4
      is effective in improving exercise capacity measured by exercise treadmill testing, angina
      functional class, patient symptoms, quality of life, and cardiovascular outcomes. Two doses
      will be studied, 2.87 x 10(8) and 2.87 x 10(9) viral particles, to evaluate the dose-response
      of Ad5FGF-4. Short-term and long-term safety of Ad5FGF-4 will also be evaluated.
