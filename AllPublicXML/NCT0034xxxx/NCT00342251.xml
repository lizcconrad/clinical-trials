  <brief_summary>

      Age-related macular degeneration (ARMD) affects older Americans and can lead to irreversible
      blindness. Although the cause if ARMD is unclear, it appears to be a condition that is
      affected by both genetic and environmental influences.

      The purpose of this study is to examine an Amish community to investigate genetic factors in
      the development of ARMD.

      Study participants will be 1,000 members, ages 50 and older, of the Old Order Amish community
      in Lancaster and Franklin counties in Pennsylvania. Each will undergo a 30-minute dilated eye
      exam during which an ophthalmologist or optometrist will take digital images of the macula
      and optic disc. Depending on the results of their eye exam, participants may be asked to give
      a blood sample as well. They will also complete a brief questionnaire about personal exposure
      related to occupation, sunlight and smoking.

      Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is a leading cause of visual impairment in the United
      States. Available evidence suggests that AMD is a complex disorder with a significant genetic
      component as well as potential environmental influences. In this study we propose to examine
      3,000 members, ages 50 and older, of the Old Order Amish community in the Lancaster and
      Franklin counties area in Pennsylvania. We plan to detail the epidemiology of AMD in this
      population isolate in attempt to elucidate genetic factors which may confer susceptibility
      and predispose some Amish individuals and their families to develop AMD. All study
      participants agreeing to enroll and providing informed consent will undergo a complete,
      dilated eye examination during which digital stereo images of the macula and optic disc
      regions will be acquired. Study participants will also be asked to complete a brief
      questionnaire inquiring about personal exposures related to occupation, sunlight, and
      smoking. AMD will be determined by an independent reading of the digital fundus photographs
      by the University of Wisconsin Fundus Photography Reading Center according to the AREDS AMD
      classification scheme. We will employ standard statistical genetics methods of parametric and
      non-parametric linkage analysis, association analysis, and transmission disequilibrium tests,
      with allowances for environmental (i.e. non-genetic) factors to determine if we can identify
      any candidate regions or candidate genes that predispose Amish individuals to an increased
      risk of AMD. Ultimately, we hope to follow up any regions that show suggestive evidence of
      linkage on the genome-wide scan with fine mapping in those regions, leading to eventual
      cloning and sequencing of a gene or genes.

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:

        All Amish individuals, ages 50 and older, who either respond in the affirmative to the
        letter of invitation or are self-referred to the Amish clinic for participation in the AMD
        study, will be eligible.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

        Individuals who decline participation, who are unwilling to sign the Consent Form, and who
        are not recognized by the Amish as being Amish will be excluded.

        There are no clinical inclusion/exclusion criteria.
