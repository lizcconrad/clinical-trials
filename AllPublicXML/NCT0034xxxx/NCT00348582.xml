                  normal retinal exams)

               -  Ability to provide informed consent and likely to complete all study visits

        Exclusion Criteria:

               -  Uncontrolled systemic disease

               -  Required use of ocular medications other than the study medications during the
                  study

               -  Abnormal pre-operative OCTs if obtainable

               -  Use of oral NSAIDS

               -  Patients with ocular disease (macula degeneration, glaucoma, corneal disease)
                  which reduces the potential visual rehabilitation (patients will ocular disease
                  that will no preclude achievement of a 20/20 visual outcome may be included)..
