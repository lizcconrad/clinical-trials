  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Viral Epidemiology Branch (VEB) of the National Cancer Institute (NCI) conducts research
      on viral infections and their associations with various diseases including AIDS and cancer.
      For some research questions, specimens are available from &quot;case&quot; subjects as part of ongoing
      protocols but are not available from normal &quot;control&quot; subjects (i.e., those without the
      infection or disease under study) to whom the case subjects can be compared. This protocol is
      to obtain routine specimens (usually peripheral venous blood, occasionally other body fluid
      such as saliva, urine, or tears) from healthy volunteers.
