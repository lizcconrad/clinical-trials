  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Nasopharyngeal carcinoma is a rare tumor among Caucasians which occurs with high incidence
      among individuals of Chinese descent. The disease is believed to have a multifactorial
      etiology with genetic, viral, and other environmental factors being involved. Little is
      known, however, about the genetic component of this disease.

      We have recently completed subject recruitment for a case-control study of NPC in Taiwan.
      Using information obtained from the NPC cases recruited into this NCI-sponsored case-control
      study as well as from a parallel cross-sectional study conducted by our Taiwanese
      collaborators, we have been able to identify 120-150 families with multiple family members
      affected with NPC.

      The purpose of the study described herein is to determine the role of inherited genetic
      factors in the etiology of NPC and to examine the effect of these genetic susceptibility
      factors on risk associated with environmental exposures.

      Families will initially be contacted via the proband who previously participated in our
      case-control and cross-sectional studies. Subsequently, informative family members will be
      asked to visit the study clinic to participate in the study. A family history questionnaire
      will be administered to the proband from each of the families selected for study. In
      addition, a risk factor questionnaire will be administered to all participating family
      members, and 30-40 ml of blood and an oral sample will be obtained from each study
      participant. Additional study components include medical record review to verify the
      diagnosis of NPC, retrieval of tumor tissue blocks as a source of DNA for study, and clinical
      exams on a sample of unaffected individuals to exclude the possibility of prevalent,
      undetected disease among family members.

      Oral and laryngeal cancer families will also be recruited in a manner similar to that
      described for NPC families, in an attempt to elucidate genetic factors linked to the
      development of these two cancers.

      We previously completed a case-control study of NPC in Taiwan. Using information obtained
      from the NPC cases recruited into this NCI-sponsored case-control study and parallel sources,
      we have been able to identify 250 families with multiple family members affected with NPC.
