    <textblock>
      The proposed study will investigate the role of self-control in smoking cessation and whether
      interventions that improve self-control can help reduce the risk of lapsing among smokers who
      wish to quit. Our model predicts that the regular practice of self-control should lead to a
      building of strength and a general improvement in self-control performance. Hence, smokers
      who practice self-control prior to quitting should be more likely to succeed in their
      cessation attempt than smokers who do not practice self-control
