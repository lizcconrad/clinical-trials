  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will examine how the body metabolizes micronutrients, such vitamins, during
      pregnancy and how genetic make-up influences their metabolism. Vitamin B12 and folate levels
      in pregnancy have been linked to birth defects, such as neural tube defects, orofacial
      clefts, and congenital heart disease. Other micronutrient levels may be related to other
      birth defects or pregnancy complications. This study will characterize the patterns of
      micronutrient status during pregnancy and compare it with genetic variants and biochemical
      parameters. Information about the relationship between genes and vitamin metabolism may help
      doctors advise women about their nutritional requirements during pregnancy to protect their
      health and the health of their babies.

      This study is a collaboration between NIH and Trinity College in Dublin, Ireland. Women of
      Irish origin 18 years of age or older who are receiving prenatal care at the Coombe Women's
      Hospital in Dublin may be enrolled. Fathers also may participate.

      Upon entering the study, female participants complete a questionnaire relating to their food
      and vitamin intake, alcohol consumption, smoking behavior, and use of medications, and
      provide a blood sample. Additional blood samples are collected during routine clinic visits
      at about 24 and 34 weeks of pregnancy, and again at delivery and from 6 weeks to 2 months
      after the baby's birth. Permission will be requested to obtain a blood sample from the
      umbilical cord at birth after it has been removed from the baby.

      Fathers of the babies are also asked to answer a short questionnaire and to provide a DNA
      sample for genetic studies. To collect the DNA, sterile cotton swabs are rubbed around the
      inside of the mouth to obtain cheek cells from which the DNA is extracted.

      A number of genetic polymorphisms influence human folate, vitamin B12 and related
      micronutrient levels. Vitamin B12 and folate levels in pregnancy have been linked to birth
      defects including neural tube defects, orofacial clefts, and congenital heart disease.
      Additionally, related analytes, such as homocysteine, may be related to birth defects and
      pregnancy complications. The behavior of maternal serum micronutrients and related analytes
      throughout human pregnancy is not well described. In this study, we aim to characterize the
      patterns of micronutrient status during pregnancy. We plan to perform biochemical analyses on
      serial blood samples collected from 500 pregnant women at five intervals spanning early
      pregnancy and the post partum period. We will also characterize neonatal micronutrient status
      using a specimen of umbilical cord blood. These blood specimens, as well as buccal swab
      specimens collected from the fathers, will also be evaluated to measure the influence of
      genetic variants on metabolite levels. The major outcomes measured will be longitudinal
      maternal micronutrient levels and aggregate alleel frequencies among family triads.
      Comparisons will be made between the presence of genetic variants, biochemical parameters,
      and clinical phenotype. At a later date we also plan to study the same metabolic and genetic
      parameters in a large cohort of healthy individuals. Characterizing these biochemical and
      genetic variants should provide insight into the metabolic processes of normal and
      complicated pregnancies.

        -  Eligible participants will be women of Irish origin (older than 18) presenting for
             prenatal care to the Coombe Women's Hospital, Dublin, Republic of Ireland. Non-Irish
             women (a small proportion of the population) will be excluded because the prevalence
             of genetic polymorphisms can vary greatly among different populations; we already have
             an estimate of the distribution of this genotype in the Irish women. Members of the
             only minority group native to Ireland, the Travelers, will not be excluded. While
             culturally distinct, the Travelers are genetically similar to the majority population.
             Women with multiple pregnancy (more than one fetus) and users of IV drugs will be
             excluded. Women will be asked for permission to obtain a cord blood sample from the
             infant at delivery. Women will be asked to assist with recruitment of their partners
             (father of the fetus), who will be included if they consent.
