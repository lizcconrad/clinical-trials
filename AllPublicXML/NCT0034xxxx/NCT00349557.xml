  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the acute and late toxicities from radiation
      therapy in combination with bevacizumab (given every 2 weeks for 16 weeks then every 3 weeks
      for 12 weeks), bicalutamide (every day for 16 weeks) and goserelin (every 3 months for 2
      years).

      Although there is no data on the toxicity with concurrent bevacizumab and hormonal therapy,
      the combination is not expected to increase toxicity seen when given as a single agent.
      Abnormal tumor microenvironments, tumor progression, and metastatic spread are major factors
      contributing to treatment failures in radiotherapy. Anti-VEGF agents (e.g. bevacizumab) can
      help overcome these factors through several different mechanisims.

      Studies also demonstrate prolonged use of anti-VEGF agents with radiation therapy was more
      effective at preventing metastases from irradiated tumors compared to a short course.
      Patients generally start hormonal therapy and daily radiotherapy at the same time. This study
      will delay the start of radiotherapy until 8 weeks after the start of hormonal therapy and
      bevacizumab.

          -  ECOG performance status of 0, 1 or 2

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Concurrent or prior treatment with radiation, cytotoxic, biologic therapy for prostate
             cancer; any major surgery within four weeks, prior hormonal therapy (except
             finasteride for obstructive voiding symptoms)

          -  Major surgical procedure, open biopsy, or significant traumatic injury within 28 days
             prior to Day 0, anticipation of need for major surgical procedure during the course of
             the study; Minor surgical procedures such as fine needle aspirations or core biopsies
             within 7 days prior to Day 0

          -  Presence of central nervous system or brain metastases

          -  Blood pressure of &gt;150/100 mmHg

          -  History of myocardial infarction within 6 months

          -  History of stroke within 6 months

          -  Current, recent (within 4 weeks of the first infusion of this study), or planned
             participation in an experimental drug study other than a Genentech-sponsored
             bevacizumab cancer study
