      Our purpose is to evaluate the changes in quality of life parameters after LASIK surgery. We
      intend to create a questionnaire to delineate the changes that occur in LASIK patients at the
      pre-operative visit and at the 1-month and 3-month post-operative visits. Additional
      questionnaires will be administered to demonstrate the validity of the new questionnaire. The
      approximate time the patient will be required to spend in clinic will be approximately 45
      minutes at each of the three visits.
