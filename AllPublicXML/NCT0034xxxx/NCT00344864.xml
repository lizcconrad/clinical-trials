  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      High order aberrations (HOA) are visual phenomena that decrease quality of vision. Examples
      of high order aberration are glare, halos, decreased contrast sensitivity and shape
      distortion. They are caused by slight imperfections or distortions in the corneal surface.
      HOA are currently measured using a variety of FDA approved devices. For this study, the
      LADARWave (Alcon) will be used to measure HOA. This device uses a harmless beam of light. It
      is FDA approved and non-invasive. Contact lens induced high order aberrations have never been
      measured and reported in the literature. This work may provide information to guide future
      contact lens design.

      Patients will be recruited from the Aston optometry clinic. The pool of patients included in
      the study will be from those who have voluntarily scheduled appointments for contact lenses.
      During the patient's initial visit, the study will be explained to them and they will have a
      choice of whether or not to take part with no penalty for refusal. If a patient agrees to
      take part in the study, they will have their HOA measured with the LADARWave instrument prior
      to contact lens insertion and right after contact lens insertion. Patients will then return
      for visits both one week and one month later for follow up measurements at the time of their
      regularly scheduled visits.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        All patients of any race and sex between the ages of 18-35 years of age who are not
        currently wearing contact lenses at their initial presentation. Only patients who
        voluntarily agree to participate in the study will be included. These potential subjects
        would be selected after reviewing and signing the Informed Consent (IC) as well as HIPAA
        authorization forms. The Principal Investigator (PI) or his designee will introduce the
        study to the patient, thoroughly explaining the details of the study. Copies of the forms
        will be placed in the patient medical record as well as given to study patient.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Patients under the age of 18 or over the age of 35 will be excluded. Patients with any
        ocular pathology, previous eye surgery and/or uveitis will be excluded. Also, any patient
        who does not choose to participate will be excluded.
