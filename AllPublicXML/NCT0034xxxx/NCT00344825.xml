      300 patients, starting a new pharmacological treatment for B-CLL, were enrolled by 36 Italian
      Centres for assessing the Quality of Life (QoL). A descriptive analysis of QoL and the
      correlation of the age, sex, stage of disease, Time from first B-CLL diagnosis, Number of
      previous B-CLL treatments, reason of starting of the new B-CLL treatment: therapeutic
      Regimen, type of Centre, B-CLL treatment lasting, response to B-CLL treatment.
