      The purpose of the study is to compare the safety and effectiveness of alfimeprase to a
      placebo in restoring function of occluded central catheters.

      Primary Outcomes: The ability to withdraw at least 3 ml of blood and infuse more at least 5
      mL of sterile saline through the occluded catheter lumen at 15 minutes after receiving
      initial instillation of study drug.

      Secondary Outcomes:

      The ability to withdraw at least 3 mL of blood and infuse at least 5 mL of sterile saline
      through the occluded catheter lumen at 30 minutes following a single instillation of study
      drug and at 30 minutes following a second instillation of study drug if patency is not
      restored within 30 minutes of the first instillation.

      Safety:

        -  Adverse events

        -  Major bleeding events

        -  Change in laboratory values.

          -  Hemodynamically stable

          -  Available for follow-up assessments

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Inability to infuse at least 2 mL of saline through the catheter

          -  Catheter placed less than 48 hours prior to detection of occlusion

          -  Catheter used for hemodialysis of pheresis

          -  Evidence of mechanical or nonthrombotic occlusion

          -  Receipt of any thrombolytic agent within 24 hours of randomization

          -  In the opinion of the investigator, subject is at &quot;high risk&quot; for bleeding events of
             embolic complications, or has a condition for which bleeding constitutes a significant
             hazard

          -  Increased risk for drug extravasation

          -  Pregnant, lactating, or actively menstruating women and women of child-bearing
             potential who are not using adequate contraceptive precautions (e.g. intrauterine
             device, oral contraceptives, barrier methods, or other contraception deemed adequate
             by the investigator)

          -  Known right-to-left cardiac shunt, patent foramen ovale, or atrial/ventricular septal
             defect

          -  Participation in any other study of an investigational device, medication, biologic,
             or other agent within 30 days before enrollment and until the 30-day follow up visit

          -  Any other subject feature that in the opinion of the investigator should preclude
             study participation
