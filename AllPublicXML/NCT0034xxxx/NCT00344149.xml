  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) is an autoimmune disorder characterized
      thrombocytopenia.

      Splenectomy is the standard treatment for patients who fails the first-line treatment:
      corticosteroid. Rituximab, has recently emerged as a promising treatment for ITP. The aim of
      the study is to determine whether early treatment with Rituximab can result in durable
      remissions, and consequently, lead to the avoidance of splenectomy in a significant number of
      patients.

    <textblock>
      ITP is an autoimmune disorder characterized by formation of autoantibodies against platelet
      antigens leading to premature platelet destruction and persistent thrombocytopenia often
      resulting in bleeding.

      The goal of treatment is to raise the platelet count to a hemostatically safe level.

      Treatment with corticosteroids rarely results in durable responses, and most of the patients
      will ultimately require a second-line treatment. Splenectomy results in a high rate of
      sustained remissions. However, the procedure is invasive and is associated with considerable
      short and long term morbidity and mortality. Rituximab, a chimeric anti-CD20 antibody with a
      B-cell depleting effect, has recently emerged as a promising treatment for ITP.

      The study aims to determine whether early treatment with Rituximab can result in durable
      remissions, and consequently, avoidance of splenectomy in a clinical significant number of
      patients.

      The main objective of this study is to assess the rate of treatment failure (splenectomy or
      meeting criteria for splenectomy after week 12) at 1.5-year in a prospective, randomized,
      placebo-controlled, double-blind, multi-centre

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. ITP with platelet count &lt;30 x 109 /l after 2 weeks of treatment with prednisolon or
             during prednisolon tapering period i.e. from week three of prednisolon initiation.
             Patients with platelet count between 30 -50 are eligible if a higher platelet count is
             considered necessary, because of : concomitant medical illness predisposing to
             bleeding (hypertension, GI bleeding, bleeding diathesis, previous history of bleeding)
             concomitant medical condition requiring platelet blocking agents/ anticoagulation,
             persistent bleeding despite platelets &gt; 30 x 109 /l, prior to surgery, or because of
             other patient related factors necessitating higher platelet count as occupation,
