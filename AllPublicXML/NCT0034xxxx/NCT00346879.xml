    <textblock>
      This is a prospective open-label study comparing two dosing regimens of fondaparinux, which
      is used to prevent deep vein thrombosis, in morbidly obese volunteers.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The incidence of obesity is growing at an alarming pace and has reached epidemic proportions.
      Subjects who are more than 100 pounds over their ideal body weight are classified as being
      morbidly obese and are considered to carry a high risk for multiple chronic medical
      conditions that impact quality of life and shorten life span. As a result of obesity, these
      individuals are also at a higher risk for developing life-threatening blood clots. Such risk
      is further elevated with exposure of obese subjects to the stress of surgery. In fact, the
      most common cause of death after major surgery in morbidly obese subjects is the migration of
      blood clots to the lung and heart. With the current rise in popularity of weight loss
      surgery, it has become imperative that we identify a medication that is safe and effective in
      preventing the formation of blood clots. Fondaparinux has the potential for being an
      effective anti-clotting drug. It is superior to other similar drugs because it is completely
      utilized by the body, and has a more predictable action. The problem, however, is that the
      recommended doses for fondaparinux were obtained after studies on lean individuals. This is a
      fixed dose that is administered universally, regardless of the size of the subject.
      Presently, we have no information on what the recommended doses should be for morbidly obese
      subjects, who are in the most need for effective anti-clotting medication. This study will
      attempt to determine whether a fixed dose or a weight-related dose is appropriate for
      morbidly obese subjects, and also investigate the safety of administering weight-based dosing
      to these individuals.
