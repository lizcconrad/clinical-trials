  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine how well newly diagnosed multiple myeloma patients
      respond to an experimental regimen of Vincristine, DOXIL (doxorubicin HCl liposome injection)
      and Dexamethasone (VDD) versus the standard treatment of Vincristine, Doxorubicin and
      Dexamethasone (VAD).

    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, open label study comparing the efficacy, clinical benefit, toxicity and
      safety of the combination of Vincristine, DOXIL® (doxorubicin HCl liposome injection), and
      Dexamethasone (VDD) to the standard regimen of Vincristine, Doxorubicin and Dexamethasone
      (VAD) in patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma. Approximately 200 patients with
      newly diagnosed multiple myeloma will be randomized to receive either VDD or VAD. This study
      will determine and compare the objective response rate (the percentage of patients who attain
      an Objective Status of Complete Remission, Remission or Partial Remission) for patients
      receiving VDD vs. VAD. This study will also evaluate and compare the clinical benefit of VDD
      vs. VAD for the following measures: Hospitalization; Documented sepsis; Antibiotic use; Grade
      3 or 4 neutropenia or neutropenic fever.

      VDD: Vincristine 1.4 mg/m2 IV on Day 1; Doxil® 40 mg/m2 IV on Day 1; Dexamethasone 40 mg/day
      oral Days 1-4; VAD: Vincristine 0.4 mg/day continuous infusion Days 1-4; Doxorubicin 9.0
      mg/m2/day continuous infusion Days 1-4; Dexamethasone 40 mg/day orally on Days 1-4; Every 28
      days for 4 cycles
