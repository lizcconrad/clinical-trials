      RATIONALE: Dose-dense scheduling with (peg)filgrastim support may improve the clinical and
      pathologic complete response rate (pCR) and safety profile of single agent neoadjuvant
      docetaxel therapy.

      PURPOSE: To evaluate whether dose-dense scheduling with (peg)filgrastim support may improve
      the clinical and pathologic complete response rate (pCR) and safety profile of single agent
      neoadjuvant docetaxel therapy. To determine the changes in molecular markers that occurs with
      single agent docetaxel, tissue will be obtained at the end of the four cycles of docetaxel
      (either by repeat biopsy or definitive surgery).

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Pathologic complete response rate (pCR) of dose dense docetaxel in the neoadjuvant
           setting.

      Secondary

        -  Safety and toxic effects of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Tumor response rate (as measured by ultrasound) in patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine whether early changes in markers of cell cycle position, proliferation, or
           apoptosis correlate with pathologic complete response rate in these patients.

        -  Determine whether the molecular profile that predicts for chemoresponsiveness also
           predicts for response to radiotherapy (as measured by local recurrence) in these
           patients.

        -  Determine whether tumors that demonstrate the greatest degree of change in protein
           expression patterns from pre- to post-docetaxel treatment will also be those that are
           most sensitive to chemotherapy (as measured by pathologic response rate) in these
           patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a nonrandomized, open-label, pilot study.

        -  Tissue Collection: Patients undergo tumor core biopsy (6-8 cores) and blood collection
           prior to initiating neoadjuvant docetaxel.

        -  Neoadjuvant docetaxel with hematopoietic support: Patients receive docetaxel IV over 1
           hour on day 1. Patients also receive pegfilgrastim subcutaneously (SC) on day 1 or 2 of
           each course OR filgrastim (G-CSF) or sargramostim (GM-CSF) SC daily beginning between
           day 2-4 of each course and continuing until blood counts recover. Treatment repeats
           every 14 days for up to 4 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
           toxicity.

        -  Surgery: Within 4-6 weeks after completion of neoadjuvant docetaxel, patients undergo
           definitive surgery.

      Patients undergo tumor biopsy and blood collection periodically for pharmacokinetic, genetic,
      and molecular biomarker correlative studies. Samples are examined for changes in p21 protein
      expression (and/or p21 phosphorylation) and the protein expression profile.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed at least every 6 months for 3
      years and then annually thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 50 patients will be accrued for this study.

    <description>Not all participants necessarily have an adverse event, thus not everyone will be accounted for in worst-grade toxicities. Likewise, one participant can potentially have more than one event in various grades 1-5 which accounts for the difference in number of patients analyzed and total number in the worst-grade toxicity tables. Tables represent the number of patients with worst-grade toxicity at each of five grades (grade 1, least severe; to grade 5, most severe) following NCI Common Toxicity Criteria</description>

    <description>Progressive disease (PD): &gt;=20% increase in sum of longest diameter (LD) of target lesion(s), taking as reference smallest sum LD recorded since treatment started. Complete response (CR): disappearance of all target lesions. Partial response (PR): &gt;=30% decrease in sum of LD of target lesion(s), taking as reference baseline sum LD. Stable disease (SD): neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify as PR nor sufficient increase to qualify as PD.</description>
