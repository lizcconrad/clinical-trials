  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There are about 300-500 million cases of malaria worldwide each year, with 2-3 million
      deaths. Plasmodium falciparum, one of four types of malaria, is responsible for most of these
      deaths. Because of increasing resistance of this parasite to drugs and of mosquitoes to
      insecticides, a vaccine would be valuable in the fight against malaria.

      Don gu bougou, Mali, is an area of seasonal malaria transmission that is being investigated
      as a possible suitable site for testing investigational malaria vaccines. The goal of this
      study is to characterize the population of this site in terms of common hematologic (blood)
      and biochemistry parameters that may be used to determine eligibility for participation in
      vaccine trials. The study will also assess the prevalence of preexisting medical conditions
      that might affect assessments of vaccine safety and efficacy. Also, the natural immunity to
      antigens in the investigational malaria vaccines will be determined.

      Don gu bougou, Mali, was chosen because of its high malaria rates. Data will be collected at
      four time-points. At least 50 individuals will be recruited from each of the following age
      groups: 6 months-5 years; 6-10 years; 11-15 years; and 16-45 years. Village-wide consent will
      be obtained and about 25 of the 111 family compounds will be randomly selected. Individual
      consent will also be obtained.

      Enrolled volunteers will undergo a baseline medical history and physical examination. Blood
      will be collected for various tests, and, for women of childbearing age, urine pregnancy
      tests will be administered.

      At each of three followup visits, a brief medical history and physical exam will be
      conducted. Blood will be drawn for tests. Also, blood, urine, and/or stool tests not done at
      baseline will be done at one of the followup visits.

      Doneguebougou, Mali, is an area of seasonal malaria transmission that is being investigated
      as a suitable site for testing investigational malaria vaccines. The overall goal of this
      study is to characterize the population of this site in terms of common hematologic and
      biochemistry parameters that may be used to determine eligibility for participation in
      vaccine trials, as well as in terms of preexisting medical conditions and preexisting
      immunity to potential malaria vaccine antigens, both of which might impact on the assessment
      of vaccine safety and efficacy. The development of high quality laboratory proficiency to
      assess these parameters in Mali will also be achieved by this study.
