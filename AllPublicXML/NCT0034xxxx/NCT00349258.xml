  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To compare the incidence of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS) and implantation rate
      between high responder patients using Gonadotropin releasing GnRH) agonist or human chorionic
      gonadotropin (hCG) to trigger final oocyte maturation.

    <textblock>
      OHSS is an iatrogenic complication of controlled ovarian hyperstimulation, which in its
      severe form, may result in significant morbidity. Although, there have been significant
      advances in in-vitro fertilization (IVF) protocols over the years, the incidence of OHSS have
      remained stable and there is currently no effective way of preventing this disorder.

      hCG is commonly used as a substitute for the endogenous LH surge to induce final oocyte
      maturation in IVF. Unfortunately, hCG results in a prolonged luteotropic effect because of
      its long half-life which may result in a potential risk of OHSS in high-risk patients. In
      contrast, induction of endogenous LH surge with a GnRH agonist may result in a reduced risk
      of OHSS. This is due both to the shorter half-life of the endogenous LH surge and the
      subsequent pituitary suppression leading to early luteolysis. However, previous studies have
      suggested that this approach may impair implantation rates.

      There are no randomized studies assessing the effect of GnRH agonist to induce oocyte
      maturation on the occurrence of OHSS and implantation rates in high-risk patients. The aims
      of this study are to compare the incidence of OHSS and implantation rates among high-risk
      patients who used either GnRH agonist or hCG to trigger oocyte maturation after prevention of
      premature LH surge with either a GnRH antagonist protocol or the dual pituitary suppression
      protocol, respectively.

      High risk patients include women with polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) or PCO morphology
      (PCOM) on ultrasound without the clinical or biochemical evidence of the syndrome, and
      patients with previous high response to gonadotropins.
