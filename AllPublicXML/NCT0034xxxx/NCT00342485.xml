  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) will be collected from healthy volunteers and
      patients who present with different diseases that involve or implicate the immune system
      dysregulation (HIV infection, autoimmune diseases and cancer). These PBMC will be studied in
      vitro for a number of functional parameters, including generating soluable factors that
      inhibit HIV infection, developing patterns of immune dysregulation, and inducing apoptotic T
      cell death. The purpose of such studies is to obtain insight into the mechanisms of natural
      resistance to viral infections, AIDS pathogenesis, and disease-induced immune dysregulation.
