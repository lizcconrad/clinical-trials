  <brief_title>Repeat Doses Of A New Medication (GW642444) In Asthmatic Patients</brief_title>
  <official_title>Multi-centre, Randomised, Double-blind, Placebo-controlled, Four-way Incomplete Block Crossover Study, to Examine Efficacy, Safety, Tolerability, Pharmacodynamics and Pharmacokinetics of Single and Repeat Administration of Three Inhaled Doses (25, 100 and 400 mcg Once Daily) of GW642444</official_title>

  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In order to obtain information on a wider range of doses of GW642444 (a possible new
      medication to treat asthma) than has been previously examined in asthmatic patients, this
      current study will be conducted at doses of 25 100 and 400 mcg of GW642444 and will be
      compared with salmeterol (50 mcg twice daily). This study will be conducted in a similar
      manner to a study that has already been completed (study number B2C101762) which examined
      repeat doses of 50, 100 and 200 mcg of GW642444. The data obtained will compliment the data
      from study B2C101762 and will provide confidence (or not) that the desired bronchodilation
      can be achieved and maintained without undesirable side effects.

    <measure>Mean change from Baseline (pre-dose on Day 1) in the mean of 23 and 24 hour (h) visit (pre-bronchodilator and pre-dose) trough FEV1 after repeat dosing over 14 days</measure>
    <time_frame>From Baseline (pre-dose on Day 1) and up to 14 days</time_frame>
    <description>The forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) is the amount of air exhaled in one second after an forceful inspiration. Change from Baseline is the value at indicated time point minus the Baseline value. Baseline was defined as the value recorded pre-dose (before dosing) on Day 1. Least square mean change along with standard error has been presented.</description>

    <description>The forced expiratory volume in one second is the amount of air exhaled in one second after an forceful inspiration. Change from Baseline is the value at indicated time point minus the Baseline value. Baseline was the pre-dose value recorded on Day 1. Weighted means have been presented as least square means. Analysis performed using mixed effect ANCOVA with fixed effects covariates of baseline FEV1, center, sex, age, treatment period, treatment and the mean of the participants Baseline values. Participant was fitted as a random coefficient.</description>

    <description>The forced expiratory volume in one second is the amount of air exhaled in one second after an forceful inspiration. Change from Baseline is the value at indicated time point minus the Baseline value. AM PEFR values were measured by electronic flow meter. PEFR is maximum speed of expiration of participant as measured by the device and AM PEFR was calculated in each morning, over period.
