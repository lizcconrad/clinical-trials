  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cystic fibrosis(CF) is an inherited disease affecting children, adolescents and young adults
      with dysfunction of secretory glands.It is caused by mutations in the protein-coding gene
      which function as the cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator (CFTR), responsible for the
      secretion of chloride ions in epithelial cells, adenocytes, sweat gland cells, pancreatic
      ducts,alimentary and respiratory tracts and eye. Assessment of the relationship between the
      inflammatory processes and apoptosis in the eye in the course of cystic fibrosis will allow
      determination of immunological exponents which may facilitate diagnosis.

      The aim: To assess the role of chosen parameters of immunological response in the induction
      of ocular changes in cystic fibrosis patients, particularly chosen chemokine concentrations
      in the tear fluid and analysis of chosen apoptotic markers expression on conjunctival
      epithelial cells.
