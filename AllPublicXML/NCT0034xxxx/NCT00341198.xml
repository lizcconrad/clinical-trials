  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Autoimmune diseases may involve nearly any organ and are characterized by abnormal activation
      or response of certain cells. Evidence suggests that farm work, exposure to silica from
      farming activities and exposure to pesticides may contribute to the development of autoimmune
      disease. Associations between autoimmune diseases and farming, however, have not been
      extensively investigated, and exposure data in the currently available studies are extremely
      limited.

      One of the major challenges in conducting population-based research on autoimmune diseases is
      case ascertainment. Self-report of previous diagnosis has proven to be unreliable. This
      protocol outlines a strategy to confirm self-reported diagnoses of systemic autoimmune
      diseases (rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, scleroderma, and Sjogren
      syndrome) within the Agricultural Health Study group (AHS; a group of licensed pesticide
      applicators and spouses who completed a questionnaire). The confirmed cases will constitute a
      refined case group to allow analyses of pesticides and other farming-related exposures as
      possible risk factors for these diseases using data that have already been collected.

      Subjects will be selected from participants in the AHS who reported one of the diseases being
      studied. A short telephone interview will be conducted with participants, who will be
      requested to provide written consent for review of information from medical records. To
      confirm the self-diagnosis, participants' physicians will be contacted. Specific information
      will be requested in the form of a checklist. Responses will be reviewed for evidence of
      diagnosis and classified as confirmed, probable, physician-diagnosed, or unconfirmed.

      Secondary objectives of this study are to:

        -  assess the correct interpretation of conflicting self-reports that are provided at two
           different times.

        -  evaluate the usefulness of specific questions that could potentially be used in future
           studies to validate self-reported cases of rheumatoid arthritis in men.

      Farming-related exposures (including pesticides and silica) may contribute to the etiology of
      autoimmune diseases. However, associations between autoimmune diseases and farming have not
      been extensively investigated, and exposure data in the currently available studies is
      extremely limited. One of the major challenges in conducting population-based research on
      autoimmune diseases is case ascertainment. Self-report of previous diagnosis has been shown
      to be very unreliable. This protocol outlines a strategy to confirm self-reported diagnoses
      of systemic autoimmune diseases (rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus,
      scleroderma, and Sjogren syndrome) within the Agricultural Health Study (AHS) cohort. The
      confirmed cases will constitute a refined case group to allow etiologic analyses of
      pesticides and other farming-related exposures as possible risk factors for these diseases
      using data that have already been collected. The codes can also be used in a nested
      case-control study that could be designed to collect additional exposure data (for example,
      on silica-related exposures).
