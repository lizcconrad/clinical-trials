  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This project involves evaluation of post operative contrast sensitivity and wavefront
      aberration results among patients implanted with standard monofocal lenses (Acrysof
      SN60AT/SN60WF) and the new presbyopic correcting multifocal lens (Acrysof ReSTOR). Higher
      Order aberrations are visual phenomena such as glare and haloes. They are more prevalent
      after cataract surgery and can affect night driving.

      The Project involves evaluation of contrast sensitivity and higher order aberrations in
      patients implanted with SN60AT, SN60WF and ReSTOR intraocular lenses. Patients in the
      department of Ophthalmology will be asked to participate in the study on a routine
      postoperative visit at least 3 months after cataract surgery. Patients will be asked to sign
      a consent form prior to participation. Wavefront analysis involves the patient resting their
      chin in a device similar to a slit lamp; they focus on a distant light and the machine
      performs the measurements in mesopic and scotopic conditions (light and dark). Contrast
      sensitivity is a measure of how faded or washed out an image can be before it becomes
      indistinguishable from a uniform field; it involves the patient identifying patterns on a
      chart. Wavefront analysis and contrast sensitivity are noninvasive tests that do not employ
      sedation or anesthesia and does not expose the patient to x-rays or microwaves. The proposed
      research will not alter usual standard postoperative care and can be done on a routine office
      visit.
