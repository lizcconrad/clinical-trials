             have a negative pregnancy test and must refrain from breastfeeding. Women who are
             postmenopausal [two years since last menstrual cycle], surgically sterilised or who
             have undergone a hysterectomy are considered not to be of childbearing potential

          -  Hospitalised patients with acutely decompensated heart failure

          -  Left ventricular ejection fraction less than or equal to 30 % as assessed using
             echocardiography, radionuclide ventriculography or contrast angiography within 12
             months

          -  Clinical need for intravenous inotropic support as evidenced by insufficient response
             to intravenous diuretics and/or vasodilators (nitroglycerin, nitroprusside) and at
             least one of the following at screening:

               -  oliguria (mean urine output &lt; 30 ml/h for at least 6 hours) and not a result of
                  hypovolemia

               -  dyspnoea at rest or mechanical ventilation for heart failure

               -  haemodynamic impairment in those patients with Swan-Ganz catheter inserted (PCWP
                  ≥ 18 mmHg and/or Cardiac Index ≤ 2.2 l/min/m2)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Severe obstruction of ventricular outflow tracts such as haemodynamically significant
             uncorrected primary valve disease or hypertrophic cardiomyopathy or impaired
             ventricular filling such as restrictive cardiomyopathy

          -  Weight ≥ 160 kg

          -  Cardiac surgery within 30 days before screening

          -  Stroke within 3 months before screening

          -  Systolic blood pressure persistently less than 85 mmHg at screening or at baseline

          -  Heart rate persistently 130 bpm or greater at screening or at baseline

          -  Serum potassium less than 3.5 mmol/l at screening

          -  Administration of any inotropic agent (e.g. dobutamine, milrinone, amrinone,
             enoximone, epinephrine, norepinephrine) except digitalis or dopamine (with dose of
             less than or equal than 2 mg/kg/min) during the current hospitalisation

          -  Hypersensitivity to levosimendan or dobutamine or any of their excipients

          -  A history of Torsades de Pointes

          -  Severe renal insufficiency (serum creatinine &gt; 450 mmol/l [5.0 mg/dl]) or on dialysis

          -  Significant hepatic impairment at discretion of the investigator

          -  Acute bleeding

          -  Severe anemia (haemoglobin &lt; 8 g/dl) at screening

          -  Septicaemia or septic shock

          -  Other serious diseases limiting life expectancy considerably (e.g. end-stage cancer)

          -  Participation in a clinical trial with any experimental treatment within 30 days prior
             to screening or previous participation in the present study

          -  Administration of levosimendan within 30 days prior to screening
