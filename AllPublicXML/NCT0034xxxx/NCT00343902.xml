        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Ambulatory individuals 18 years and older who had been diagnosed with CHF (NYHA
             functional classes II-IV) for &gt; 3 months

          -  Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of ≤ 40 percent

          -  Receiving indicated standard therapy (if not contraindicated or intolerant for &gt; 3
             months) defined as a diuretic, an ACE-inhibitor or an angiotensin receptor blocker
             (ARB) and a beta-blocke

          -  Patients with NYHA class III or IV symptoms were also required to receive
             spironolactone. Doses of these drugs had to be stable for ≥ 3 months, except for
             diuretics, for which ≥ 1 month of stability was required.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Hemodynamically severe uncorrected primary valvular disease

          -  Active myocarditis

          -  Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy

          -  Restrictive cardiomyopathy

          -  Myocardial infarction, stroke, unstable angina, coronary artery bypass graft surgery,
             valvular surgery, or angioplasty &lt; 3 months before randomization

          -  Symptomatic or sustained ventricular tachycardia not controlled by antiarrhythmic
             drugs or an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator

          -  Any condition other than heart failure that would be expected to limit exercise (e.g.,
             angina, peripheral vascular disease, pulmonary disease, arthritis, or an orthopedic
             problem severe enough to limit exercise)

          -  Nursing mothers, pregnant women and those planning a pregnancy during the study period
