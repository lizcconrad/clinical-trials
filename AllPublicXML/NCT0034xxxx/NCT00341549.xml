      This study will try to identify the gene or genes responsible for myopia (nearsightedness)
      and to examine the relationship between myopia and near work. Myopia is the most common eye
      disorder in the world, affecting one in four Americans. Several studies indicate that myopia
      is inherited. The condition tends to cluster in families, so that studying families with this
      condition may facilitate finding the exact cause.

      Caucasian Americans and African Americans with myopia who are in general good health may be
      eligible for this study. People with a family history of myopia through several generations
      along one parent s side only, and in which more than one sibling has myopia are preferred.
      People who have severe diseases that involve myopia, such as Stickler s or Marfan syndromes,
      retinitis pigmentosa or diabetic retinopathy may not participate.

      Participants will undergo the following tests and procedures:

        -  Eye examination, including refraction

        -  Blood draw for genetic studies and possibly establishment of cell lines (collection of
           cells grown in the laboratory from an original tissue specimen) for future research

        -  Myopia Family Study Questionnaire and personal medical information questionnaire to
           provide information about other medical conditions that may influence the development of
           myopia; the vision status of their spouse and children, parents and siblings, and spouse
           s parents and siblings

        -  Risk Factor Questionnaire (for Jewish Orthodox community only) to assess the amount of
           near work activity done in childhood

      Myopia or nearsightedness, a condition that results in the inability to see distant objects
      clearly, affects one in four Americans and is the most common eye disorder in the world with
      an enormous public health and economic impact. Depending on epidemiologic definition, 3-19%
      of acquired blindness has been ascribed to myopia. Evidence exists that myopia is a complex
      disorder with a significant genetic component as well as potential environmental influences.
      Implicating genetic factors, Sorsby et al. found that the trait correlation for monozygotic
      twins was nearly twice that for dizygotic twins and zero for control pairs. A study, by Chen
      et al., of Chinese twin pairs found a higher concordance rate of myopia (92.2%) for
      monozygotic twins with concordant close-work habits, or differences of less than one hour per
      day spent studying or reading, as compared to monozygotic twins with discordant close-work
      habits (79.3%). The two studies suggest additive interaction between zygosity and close-work
      habits.

      Since there is a tendency of myopia to cluster in families, studying families with myopia
      opens the possibility to identify any gene(s) responsible for the pathogenesis of myopia.
      These genes could provide molecular tools for investigation of inherited myopia and may also
      provide a starting point for elucidating mechanisms for the influence of near work on the
      progression of myopia. The goal of this proposal is to identify regions of the human genome
      that contain the genes responsible for non-syndromic myopia utilizing pedigrees identified by
      the Myopia Family Study and genotypes generated by Dr. Dwight Stambolian's laboratory at the
      University of Pennsylvania as well as by the Center for Inherited Disease Research. Pedigree
      collection is ongoing in several geographic regions including Lakewood, NJ, for the
      collection of Orthodox Jewish families, Lancaster County, PA for the collection of Amish
      families, and Philadelphia, for recruitment of families of African American or Chinese
      American background. Pedigrees of Caucasian descent have also been collected in Philadelphia.
      All data collection is under the direction of Dr. Stambolian and funded by his grant from the
      NEI; no NHGRI funds are being used for data collection, and NHGRI investigators do not have
      any contact with study subjects. Because this disorder is complex and has a high likelihood
      of being caused by multiple loci, multiple parametric and non-parametric methods of analysis
      will be employed. Heterogeneity will be taken into account during these analyses, as will
      environmental covariates, such as the effect of near work, when possible.

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:

        The subject population will be adult individuals and their children, in good health with
        the exception of myopia.

        Subjects will be chosen based upon vision history of their extended family.

        Preferred subjects will be those who have a family in which myopia passes through several
        generations along one parent s side only, in which more than one sibling is affected with
        myopia, but in which no more than one parent is affected.

        Specific eligibility requirements for the index case include:

          1. Cycloplegic refraction of 1.00 spherical equivalent (as long as there was 1.00D or
             higher in each meridian if astigmatism is present) or worse in both eyes in those
             under age 50 to be considered myopic;

          2. Manifest refraction of 1.00 spherical equivalent (as long as there was 1.00D or higher
             in each meridian if astigmatism is present) or worse in both eyes in those over age 50
             to be considered myopic;

          3. No history of systemic or ocular disease which might predispose to myopia including
             premature birth;

          4. The index case should have a familial history of myopia in either their parents or
             children or other close relatives (suggesting a genetic influence);

          5. In the event that the parents of the index case have myopia, it is preferred that only
             one parent be affected with myopia.

        Some of these bilineal families may be collected if necessary to achieve the desired sample
        size, but unilateral families are preferred.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

        Excluded from the University of Pennsylvania study are those who have severe diseases that
        involve myopia, such as Stickler s or Marfan syndromes, ocular disease such as Retinitis
        Pigmentosa, and those with diseases that may secondarily cause myopia such as diabetes or
        retinopathy of prematurity. Records of eye examinations obtained prior to the onset of
        systemic or ocular disease will be accepted.

        Individuals who complete the Risk Factor Questionnaire and who state that they were born
        more than a month prematurely will not be included in the study.

        Individuals who are myopic in one eye and unaffected in the other (ulnilateral myopes) will
        not be included in the study.

        Individuals who do not sign the Consent Form will be excluded, and families for whom all
        necessary members do not sign the Consent Form will be excluded.

        No fetuses, pregnant women, prisoners or other institutionalized individuals will be
        enrolled.

        Generally, myopia itself is not associated with mental impairment, although careful
        consideration will be given to determining the cognitive understanding of any such
        potentially impaired person appropriate for enrollment in order to assure that protection
        of human rights is optimized.
