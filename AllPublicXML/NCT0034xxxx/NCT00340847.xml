  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The proposed research intends to construct a set of tissue microarrays containing different
      types of normal and lung cancer tissues for the study of genes associated with lung cancer.
      Thus far we have generated a lung cancer tissue arrayusing paraffin embedded archival tissues
      from 300 lung turmors tissues and 100 adjacent normal tissues. Four- micrometer thickness
      sections have been cut from the tissue array and were used to survey gene expression status
      in arrayed tumors using immunohistochemistry methody. We are currently performing IHC studies
      ot 1) determine protein expression and its correlation with gene expression patterms ovserved
      using cDNA arrays. 2) Analyze protein expression in the chromosome remodeling pathyway in
      non-small cell lung cancer. And 3) determine the association of gene expression with lung
      tumor stage and clinical outcome. The current protocol is needed to complete the above
      studies and for the production of neuroendocrine tumors.

      The proposed research intends to construct a set of tissue microarrays containing different
      types of lung cancer tissues for the study of genes associated with lung cancer. In this
      study, lung tissue arrays will be generated using paraffin embedded archival tissues
      containing adjacent normal tissues and tumors from approximately 300 non-small cell lung
      cancers and 100 neuroendocrine tumors of the lung. Corded tissues of 0.6 um in diameter will
      be taken from each tumor and arrayed onto recipient paraffin blocks to generate a lung tumor
      specific microarray. Four-micrometer thickness sections will be cut from the tissue array and
      used to survey gene expression status in arrayed tumors using fluorescence in situ
      hybridization (FISH, in situ hybridization, and/or immunohistochemistry methods.
      Additionally, approximately 20 sections will be cut from each primary tumor block to isolate
      genomic DNA for the analysis of genetic changes in the arrayed tumor samples. The goals of
      this proposal are 1) to generate a single tissue block containing multiple tumors, 2) allow
      rapid and efficient analysis of gene expressions in a large number of samples using a single
      tissue section, and 3) to correlate the molecular changes in the tumors with the clinical and
      pathological features of the disease. Due to the experimental nature of the research and the
      fact that all tumors obtained are archival tissues at AFIP, the investigators will not report
      the result of gene expression back to the subject.

      To date, all samples needed for the protocol have been reached and there will be no more
      patient accrual but survival status of the patients as well as molecular analysis using the
      constructed lung tissue microarrays will continue for the foreseeable future.

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA

        The human tissue microarrays will include existing archival tissues of normal lung, non
        small-cell lung cancer, and combined histological types of lung cancer samples. All tissue
        samples are already in existence at the Armed Forces Institute of Pathology.

        The primary selection criteria will be the type of cancer, the quality of the tumor block,
        and the availability of the sample without regard to age, race, ethnic origin, and gender
        of the patient.

        Only tissue blocks of suitable fixation quality and proper diagnosis will be used to
        generate the lung tissue microarrays.
