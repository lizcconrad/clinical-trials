    <textblock>
      Growth retardation in utero may be caused by uteroplacental vascular insufficiency. When
      Doppler ultrasound studies of the umbilical artery are abnormal pathological intrauterine
      growth restriction (IUGR) can be diagnosed. IUGR fetuses have a higher mortality and
      morbidity, both perinatally and on the longer term. This is probably due to chronic
      malnourishment and hypoxia due to placental insufficiency. This placental dysfunction causes
      generation of harmful free oxygen radicals in the fetus. The IUGR fetus has a diminished
      antioxidative capacity which means these free radicals cannot be buffered sufficiently. This
      leads to fetal oxidative stress.

      Previous studies have shown that allopurinol can inhibit the cascades that lead to generation
      of free radicals. High dosed allopurinol also scavenges radicals and binds free iron without
      adverse effects on the fetus or mother.

      As IUGR is associated with placental insufficiency and excessive production of free radicals
      we hypothesize that antenatal allopurinol administration could lead to a decrease in
      oxidative stress in the mother and fetus and subsequent improvement of the maternal and/or
      neonatal outcome.
