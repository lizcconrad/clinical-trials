          -  Is a current soft contact lens wearer.

          -  Has no clinically significant anterior eye findings.

          -  Has no other active ocular disease.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Has any systemic disease that might interfere with contact lens wear

          -  Is using any systemic or topical medications that will affect ocular health.

          -  Has any pre-existing ocular irritation that would preclude contact lens fitting.

          -  Has any ocular pathology or severe insufficiency of lacrimal secretion (dry eyes) that
             would affect the wearing of contact lenses.

          -  Has undergone corneal refractive surgery.
