  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The evaluation of efficacy is performed by laboratory monitoring of bone density and
      resorption markers and clinical monitoring of bone density improvement. This is a
      prospective, randomized, parallel group, single blind study of one year treatment with
      zoledronic acid every 6 months as compared to one year treatment with zoledronic acid every 3
      months and to placebo every 3 months in patients with hemoglobin syndromes and risk of
      skeletal complications.
