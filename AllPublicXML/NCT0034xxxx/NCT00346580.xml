  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sepsis is the leading cause of death in critically ill patients in the United States. It
      develops in approximately 750,000 Americans annually, and more than 210,000 of them die.
      Despite improvements in supportive treatment, mortality has changed very little, and until
      recently, no sepsis-specific treatments were available. Protease inhibitors have seemed to
      have an immune benefit that extends beyond their ability to prevent HIV replication. T cells
      in those patients treated with protease inhibitors have reduced rates of death than in those
      patients not receiving therapy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Our hypothesis is that protease inhibitor therapy will prevent apoptosis associated with
      sepsis, and this will be manifested as improved clinical outcome, as assessed by 28-day
      mortality, APACHE II and III, and SOFA scores. All patients enrolled in the study will
      receive the standard of care for sepsis at Mayo Clinic Rochester. Patients will receive 1250
      mg of Nelfinavir/placebo twice each day for seven days with regularly scheduled blood draws
      (Days 0, 4, and 7).
