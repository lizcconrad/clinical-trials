  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In a collaborative effort with the Health Research Board, the national organization for
      medical research in the Republic of Ireland, individuals with neural tube defects (NTDs) or
      facial cleft defects and their parents will be studied. With the exception of a few
      well-described syndromes most cases of NTDs and facial clefts are not inherited in a
      Mendelian fashion. Nearly all incident cases occur in families with no prior history of the
      defects. The observed recurrence risk in families with an NTD child is 10-12 fold higher than
      the general population suggesting that inherited factors modify this risk. Historically, the
      incidence of NTDs in Ireland was 5-8 fold higher than the USA. The aim of this study is to
      identify the gene(s) involved in these defects using standard genetic epidemiology
      approaches, transmission disequilibrium testing and gene mapping strategies. We will
      initially evaluate genes known to be involved in folate metabolism and pattern formation
      (development of the body). The major outcomes measured will be aggregate allele frequencies
      in case groups compared to controls. Biochemical parameters in red cells and plasma will also
      be measured. Comparisons will be made between the presence of genetics variants, biochemical
      parameters and clinical phenotype. Characterizing the genes associated with these defects
      should provide insight into the etiology and metabolic processes that may be involved,
      furthering prevention and intervention efforts.

      higher than the general population incidence suggesting that inherited factors modify this
      risk. Historically, the incidence of NTDs in Ireland was 5-8 fold higher than the USA. The

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:

        Eligible participants are children and adults with an NTD and their parents residing in the
        Republic of Ireland, Northern Ireland and the United Kingdom

        NTDs are defined to include all forms of spina bifida aperta (meningocele,
        meningomyelocele), encephalocele, anencephaly, rachischisis, iniencephaly and
        lipomeningocele. Hydrocephalus, hydranencephaly, dermal sinus and spina bifida occulta do
        not qualify as NTDs.

        For oral clefts, eligible participants are children and adults with a facial cleft in
        Ireland and their parents.

        All families with NTDs or clefts will be recruited for the study.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

        Those with known syndromes will be excluded or analyzed separately.

        Cases for whom both biologic parents are not available will be excluded from some
        components of triad (case, mother and father) analysis, although the data from the NTD case
        may be useful for other study components.
