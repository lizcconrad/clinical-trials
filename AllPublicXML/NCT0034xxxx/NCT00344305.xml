      Open label, single arm, multicenter study of the shedding and safety of a single dose of

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This was a Phase 2, open-label, single-arm, multicenter study designed to evaluate vaccine
      virus shedding and safety of trivalent influenza virus vaccine live, intranasal in children 6
      to &lt; 60 months of age. Enrollment of approximately 200 participants was stratified by age,
      with 100 participants 6 to &lt; 24 months of age (who reached their sixth month but not their
      second year birthday) and 100 participants 24 to &lt; 60 months of age (who reached their second
      year but not their fifth year birthday). Baseline medical history data collection included
      the participants prior receipt of influenza vaccine or history of laboratory-confirmed
      influenza illness in the previous influenza season.

    <description>Viral shedding is defined as the detection of virus by viral culture and vaccine-type virus was confirmed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) based assays. Viral shedding (A/New Caledonia/20/99 [H1N1]; A/Wyoming/03/2003 [H3N2] (A/Fujian/411/2002-like); B/Jilin/20/2003 B/Shanghai/361/2002-like]) was measured from samples obtained from nasal swabs daily from Days 1 to 7 post vaccination and approximately every other day thereafter from Days 9 to 28. Participants whose Day 25 or 28 shedding sample was positive for vaccine virus had additional shedding samples collected approximately every 7 days, or as soon as possible upon awareness of culture positivity, until 2 consecutive samples were negative for vaccine virus.</description>

    <description>The genetic and phenotypic stability of shed vaccine virus was evaluated by determination of genomic sequence and assessment of the cold-adapted (ca) and temperature-sensitive (ts) phenotypes. Viruses were considered ts if their titer at 39 degrees Celsius (°C) was at least two logs (100-fold) lower than their titer at 33°C. Viruses were considered ca if they replicated at 25°C to a titer that was no more than two logs (100-fold) lower than the titer at 33°C. After additional phenotypic and genotypic analyses, all evaluable samples retained the ca and ts phenotypes.</description>

    <description>An SAE was an AE resulting in any of the following outcomes or deemed significant for any other reason: death; initial or prolonged inpatient hospitalization; life-threatening experience (immediate risk of dying); persistent or significant disability/incapacity; congenital anomaly. An SNMC is defined as a newly diagnosed medical condition that was of a chronic, ongoing nature and was assessed by the investigator as medically significant.

        <description>Viral shedding is defined as the detection of virus by viral culture and vaccine-type virus was confirmed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) based assays. Viral shedding (A/New Caledonia/20/99 [H1N1]; A/Wyoming/03/2003 [H3N2] (A/Fujian/411/2002-like); B/Jilin/20/2003 B/Shanghai/361/2002-like]) was measured from samples obtained from nasal swabs daily from Days 1 to 7 post vaccination and approximately every other day thereafter from Days 9 to 28. Participants whose Day 25 or 28 shedding sample was positive for vaccine virus had additional shedding samples collected approximately every 7 days, or as soon as possible upon awareness of culture positivity, until 2 consecutive samples were negative for vaccine virus.</description>

        <description>An SAE was an AE resulting in any of the following outcomes or deemed significant for any other reason: death; initial or prolonged inpatient hospitalization; life-threatening experience (immediate risk of dying); persistent or significant disability/incapacity; congenital anomaly. An SNMC is defined as a newly diagnosed medical condition that was of a chronic, ongoing nature and was assessed by the investigator as medically significant. SNMCs included, but were not limited to, diabetes, asthma, autoimmune disease (lupus, rheumatoid arthritis), and neurological disease (epilepsy, autism).</description>
