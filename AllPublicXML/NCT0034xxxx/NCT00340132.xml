  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Pima Indians of Arizona have the highest prevalence and incidence of type 2 diabetes of
      any population in the world. Prospective analyses in this population have identified insulin
      resistance and a defect in early insulin secretion as risk factors for the development of the
      disease. A recent longitudinal analysis which tracked the development of diabetes in 17 Pima
      Indians demonstrated that both insulin action and early insulin secretion deteriorate as
      individuals progress from normal to impaired glucose tolerance and then to diabetes. These
      results suggest that both inherent (apparent in normal glucose tolerant subjects who progress
      to diabetes and likely to have a genetic basis) and acquired (evident as individuals progress
      from NGT to IGT to diabetes and possibly environmental in origin) defects in insulin action
      and secretion contribute to the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes. To identify the genetic and
      environmental determinants of diabetes we plan to study Pima Indian families to determine:
      (1) if there are genes that segregate with metabolic risk factors for diabetes which might
      therefore be genetic markers for type 2 diabetes and (2) the mechanisms mediating genetic and
      environmental determinants of insulin resistance and impaired insulin secretion.

      Volunteers for this study will be admitted to the clinical research ward where they will
      undergo several tests to determine body composition, oral and intravenous glucose tolerance
      and in vivo insulin action. In addition, in selected subjects, adipose and/or skeletal muscle
      tissue will be obtained by percutaneous biopsy for in vitro studies of gene expression and
      insulin action in these tissues. A transformed lymphocyte cell line will be established for
      each subject as a permanent source of DNA for genetic studies. Genetic markers for type 2
      diabetes and insulin resistance will be sought by typing each individual at positional and
      functional candidate loci in the hopes of finding an association between these loci and
      obesity, insulin secretion, insulin resistance and/or type 2 diabetes.

      Insulin resistance and a defect in early insulin secretion are risk factors for the
      development of type 2 diabetes mellitus. A recent longitudinal analysis which tracked the
      development of diabetes demonstrated that both insulin action and early insulin secretion
      deteriorate as individuals progress from normal to impaired glucose tolerance and then to
      diabetes. These results suggest that both inherent (apparent in normal glucose tolerant
      subjects who progress to diabetes and likely to have a genetic basis) and acquired (evident
      as individuals progress from NGT to IGT to diabetes and possibly environmental in origin)
      defects in insulin action and secretion contribute to the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes. To
      identify the genetic and environmental determinants of diabetes we are continuing to
      determine: (1) if there are genes that segregate with metabolic risk factors for diabetes
      which might therefore be genetic markers for type 2 diabetes and (2) the mechanisms mediating
      genetic and environmental determinants of insulin resistance and impaired insulin secretion.

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:

        Volunteers from all racial and ethnic backgrounds will be invited to participate if they
        are:

        Ages: 18 - 55 years old

        Gender: male or female.

          -  Each subject who volunteers will be assigned to the clinical research ward physician
             who made the initial contact and he/she will be responsible for completion of all
             tests (see below) and compilation of data. This physician will consult with the
             subject's personal physician or other health care personnel involved with the patient
             in Sacaton. This includes sending a carefully written discharge summary to appropriate
             health care workers at the time of discharge.

          -  All medications and alcohol consumption are to be stopped for two weeks prior to
             admission. A urine drug-screening test for drugs such as narcotics, marijuana, and
             barbiturates will be performed on everyone to exclude from the study people whose
             urine show active or recent drug use. A positive drug test could confound the results
             of the study in an unpredictable manner. The results of this test will become a part
             of the patient s medical records and may be released if requested (please see page 6
             of the consent for details regarding medical records release).

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

        Subjects will be excluded who are on chronic medications for problems such as seizure
        disorders.

        Exclusions for occasional medications will be at the discretion of the interviewing
        physician.

        Women who are currently pregnant or breastfeeding will be excluded from the study.
