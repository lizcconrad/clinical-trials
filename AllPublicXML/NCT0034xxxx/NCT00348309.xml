  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Rosiglitazone (RSG) has been tested in clinical studies and is approved by the FDA as a
      treatment for type II diabetes mellitus, a disease that occurs when the body is unable to
      effectively use glucose. RSG XR, the investigational drug used in this study, is an
      extended-release form of RSG.

      This study tests whether RSG XR safely provides clinical benefit to people with mild to
      moderate Alzheimer's disease (AD) when combined with the currently approved AD medication,
      Aricept (donepezil). RSG XR is a new approach to AD therapy and this study tests a new way to
      treat AD by testing whether one's genetic makeup affects their response to the study drug.
      Clinical data suggesting that RSG may benefit AD patients was first seen in a small study
      performed at the University of Washington and then from a larger GSK study conducted in
      Europe and New Zealand. In the first study, subjects receiving RSG once daily for 6 months
      scored significantly better on 3 tests of memory and thought than those who did not receive
      RSG. In the GSK study, those that appeared to benefit most from treatment with RSG XR had a
      specific genetic pattern. They did not have the gene that caused them to produce the protein
      apolipoprotein E e4 (APOE e4). Subjects who have the APOE e4 gene may have two copies, one
      from each parent, or they may have only one APOE e4 gene meaning that they inherited either
      the APOE e2 or APOE e3 version of the gene, instead of APOE e4, from one of their parents.
      Subjects with one copy of the APOE e4 gene remained at their same level of thinking ability
      while those with two copies of the APOE e4 gene, continued to worsen during the 6-month
      treatment. The current study will more directly test the effectiveness or RSG XR on people
      who either have or lack the APOE e4 gene.

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale - Cognitive Subscale (ADAS-Cog) Total Score at Week 48</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Week 0) and Week 48</time_frame>
    <description>ADAS is a performance-based test that measures specific cognitive and behavioral dysfunctions in participants with Alzheimer's Disease. The cognitive subscale of the ADAS (ADAS-Cog) comprises 11 items that are summed to a total score ranging from 0 to 70, with lower scores indicating less severe impairment. Change from baseline is calculated as Week 48 value minus the baseline value. APOE4 negative, All except E4/E4's: comprised of APOE4 negative and E4 heterozygote and full population was analyzed for this outcome measure. A hierarchical testing procedure was used to control for the two rosiglitazone dose groups and the genetic subgroups. Least square mean is entered for adjusted mean.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Disability Assessment for Dementia Scale (DAD) Total Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Week 0), Week 8, 16, 24 and 48</time_frame>
    <description>The DAD measures instrumental and basic activities of daily living in participants with Alzheimer's Disease (AD). This scale assesses a participants' ability to initiate, plan, and perform activities related to hygiene, dressing, continence, eating, meal preparation, telephoning, going on an outing, finance and correspondence, medications, leisure, and housework. The scale includes 23 items relating to instrumental activities of daily living and 17 items relating to basic self-care. Each item can be scored as 1 = yes, 0 = no, non applicable = NA. Total score was obtained by adding the rating for each question and converting this total score out of 100. The total score ranged from 0 to 100, where higher score indicated better function and lower score indicated greater severity of symptoms; a positive change from baseline indicated an improvement. Change from baseline is calculated as endpoint value minus the baseline value.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in the Domains of the Resource Utilization in Dementia Scale (RUD)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Week 0), Week 12, 24, 36 and 48</time_frame>
    <description>The RUD instrument was developed as a comprehensive tool to assess the amount of resource use among demented patients. RUD assessd both formal and informal resource use of the patient and the primary caregiver, making it possible to calculate costs from a societal perspective. Q1 corresponds to the number of hours during the last month the caregiver spent assisting the patient with toilet visits, eating, dressing, grooming, walking and bathing and Q2 corresponds to the number of hours during the last month the caregiver spent assisting the patient with shopping, food preparation, housekeeping, laundry, transportation, taking medication and managing financial matters. Change from Baseline was calculated as value at scheduled time point minus Baseline value. Baseline was defined as value at Week 0. Estimated value was calculated by Active treatment minus Placebo. The adjusted means were presented.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline (Week 0), Week 12, 36 and 48</time_frame>
    <description>The EQ-5D Proxy is a two part scale that evaluated the participant's health status via Thermometer and Utility scores. The Thermometer score was the caregiver's rating of the participant's overall health status on a VAS (0 [&quot;worst possible status&quot;] to 100 [&quot;best imaginable status&quot;]). The Utility score was a caregiver rating of health status on dimensions of mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression] where '1' indicated better health state (no problems); '3' indicated worst health state (&quot;confined to bed&quot;). Total possible score was the sum of individual items, ranged from 5 to 15; lower score indicated a better health state and higher score indicated greater severity of symptoms. A positive change from baseline indicated improvement in the Thermometer score and a negative change from baseline indicated improvement in the Utility score. Change from baseline is calculated as endpoint value minus the baseline value.</description>

             criteria apply:

          -  Male or female subject with a clinical diagnosis of probable Alzheimer's disease in
             accordance with NINCDS-ADRDA criteria.

        (Note: National Institute of Neurological and Communicative Disorders and Stroke (NINCDS)
        and Alzheimer's Disease and Related Disorders Association (ADRDA).)

          -  Subject has mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease as defined by a MMSE score 10 to 26
             inclusive at Screening.

          -  Hachinski Ischemia Score ≤ 4 at Screening.

          -  Age ≥50 and ≤90 years.

          -  At least 6 months of ongoing donepezil therapy for Alzheimer's disease, with stable
             dosing for at least the last 2 months (and with no intent to change for the duration
             of the study).

          -  Current use of medication is in accordance with the criteria listed in Table 2
             (Permitted Medications,).

          -  Female subjects must be post-menopausal (i.e. &gt;1 year without menstrual period),
             surgically sterile, or agree to use adequate method of contraception for the duration
             of the study. Female subjects who are pre-menopausal or who have been post-menopausal
             for &lt;1 year must undertake pregnancy testing (urine test) at Visit 1, which must be
             negative.

          -  Brain CT or MRI scan performed within the past 12 months or at Screening, showing no
             evidence of any other potential cause of dementia other than Alzheimer's disease.

        (Note: Questionable CT or MRI scans should be discussed with the medical monitor, using
        central imaging guidelines.)

          -  Neurological exam without focal changes (excluding changes attributable to AD or
             peripheral trauma).

          -  Subject has the ability to comply with procedures for cognitive and other testing.

          -  Subject lives with (or has substantial periods of contact with) a regular caregiver
             who is willing to attend all visits, oversee the subject's compliance with
             protocol-specified procedures and study medication, and report on subject's status.

        Note: A non-cohabiting caregiver must spend sufficient time with the subject so that, in
        the opinion of the Investigator, the caregiver can reliably assess cognitive function,
        activities and behavior, and report on the subject's compliance and health. As caregiver
        time spent with a potential subject is anticipated to be highly variable across countries
        and cultures, GSK will consider a variety of different measures by which this stipulation
        may be met, and GSK should be consulted if adequacy of a caregiver situation is in doubt.
        However, as guidance, the ability for a caregiver to meet his/her expected responsibilities
        for this study would normally be possible when the caregiver spends no less than 10 hours
        per week with the subject, divided over multiple days.)

          -  Subject has provided full written informed consent prior to the performance of any
             protocol-specified procedure; or if unable to provide informed consent due to
             cognitive status, full written informed consent on behalf of the subject has been
             provided by a legally acceptable representative.

        (Note: Consent by legally acceptable representative is allowed where this is in accordance
        with local laws, regulations and ethics committee policy.)

          -  Caregiver has provided full written informed consent on his/her own behalf prior to
             the performance of any protocol-specified procedure.

          -  Subjects considered for enrolment must have a QTc (either QTc B (Bazett's correction)
             or QTc F (Fridericia's correction)) &lt;450msec at Visit 1, with the exception of
             subjects with bundle branch block (for whom either QTc B or QTc F must be &lt;480msec).

          -  (Note: For the purposes of these criteria, QTc B is defined as (QT interval [msec]) /
             (square root of RR interval [seconds]); and QTc F is defined as (QT interval [msec]) /
             (cube root of RR interval [seconds]).)

        Exclusion criteria:

          -  A subject will not be eligible for inclusion in this study if any of the following
             criteria apply:

          -  Diagnosis of possible, probable, or definite vascular dementia in accordance with
             NINDS-AIREN criteria.

        (Note: National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) and Association
        Internationale pour la Recherche et l'Enseignement en Neurosciences (AIREN).)

          -  History or evidence of any other CNS disorder that could be interpreted as a cause of
             dementia: e.g. cerebrovascular disease (stroke, hemorrhage), structural abnormality,
             epilepsy, infectious or inflammatory/demyelinating CNS conditions, Parkinson's
             disease.

          -  Evidence of the following disorders: current vitamin B12 deficiency, positive syphilis
             serology, or active thyroid dysfunction (particularly that suggestive of
             hypothyroidism), including abnormally high or low serum levels of thyroid stimulating
             hormone (TSH) that are clinically significant in the opinion of the investigator.

        (Note: Testing is required for each parameter only when no result is available from
        previous 12 months.)

          -  History of Type 1 diabetes mellitus or secondary diabetes mellitus.

          -  Type 2 diabetes mellitus where the subject is being treated with insulin, a PPARγ
             agonist, or an insulin secretagogue (e.g. a sulfonylurea or glitinide).

          -  Any patient with an HbA1c ≥8.5%. (See Section 6.3.7.4 for Safety Measures for Enrolled
             Subjects with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus.)

          -  History or clinical/investigational evidence of congestive heart failure defined by
             the New York Heart Association criteria (Class I to IV cardiac status;).

          -  History of cardiovascular event within the last 6 months (i.e. intervention,
             percutaneous coronary intervention, vascular surgery, acute coronary syndrome [non
             Q-wave myocardial infarction, Q-wave myocardial infarction, unstable angina] or
             significant arrhythmia; or major intervention (e.g. cardiac surgery or angiography
             plus stenting) scheduled).

          -  History of significant psychiatric illness such as schizophrenia or bipolar affective
             disorder that in the opinion of the Investigator would interfere with participation in
             the study, major depressive disorder (according to DSM-IV) in the past year, or
             current active depression requiring initiation of treatment.

        (Note: If not currently treated, but active depression is suspected, the Cornell Scale for
        Depression in Dementia (CSDD) can be used by the Investigator as a guide for deciding
        whether a prospective subject requires treatment. If the subject has a CSDD score &gt;7, the
        Investigator should decide if the subject has depression in need of prescribed medication,
        and a CSDD &gt;12 is considered a strong indicator that treatment is needed. Subjects will be
        allowed to re-screen after their depression has been adequately managed for &gt;3 months.)

          -  History or presence of gastro-intestinal, hepatic, or renal disease or other condition
             known to interfere with the absorption, distribution, metabolism, or excretion of
             drugs, or any other clinically relevant abnormality, medical or psychiatric condition,
             which, in the opinion of the Investigator, makes the subject unsuitable for inclusion
             in the study.

          -  Clinically significant peripheral edema at the time of screening.

          -  Current or recent drug or alcohol abuse or dependence (defined by DSM-IV criteria for
             substance-related disorders), or recent or remote history of the same if that could be
             a contributing factor to the dementia.

          -  Systolic blood pressure &gt;165 or &lt;90 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure &gt;95 or &lt;60 mmHg
             at the time of screening.

          -  Clinically significant anemia (i.e. hemoglobin &lt;11 g/dL for males or &lt;10 g/dL for
             females) or presence of hemoglobinopathies which would prevent accurate assessment of
             HbA1c.

          -  Abnormal kidney function tests (&gt;1.5 the upper limit of normal (ULN)).

          -  ALT, AST, or alkaline phosphatase values &gt;2.5 times the ULN, total bilirubin values
             &gt;1.5 times the ULN, or history of severe hepatobiliary disease (e.g. hepatitis B or C,
             or cirrhosis, Child-Pugh Class B/C).

        (Note: For subjects with a diagnosis of Gilberts Syndrome and an isolated increase in total
        bilirubin &gt;1.5 ULN, fractionation should be performed. If all of the following conditions
        are met, the patient may enter or remain in the study, even if total bilirubin &gt;1.5 ULN:

          -  an elevated unconjugated (indirect) bilirubin;

          -  the percentage of direct bilirubin &lt;35%;

          -  ALT, AST, and alkaline phosphatase &lt;2.5 ULN if subject is in screening (&lt;2.0 ULN for
             Canadian subjects only), or ≤3 ULN if subject is already randomized into the study)

          -  History of a bone marrow transplant.

          -  Subject is unable (with assistance, if appropriate) to take study medication as
             prescribed throughout the study or is at risk of non-compliance with study medication
             or procedures.

          -  Subject is an immediate family member or employee of the participating Investigator,
             of any of the participating site staff, or of GSK.

          -  In France, a subject is neither affiliated with nor a beneficiary of a social security
             category.

          -  The French subject has participated in any study using an investigational drug during
             the previous 30 days or 5 half-lives (whichever is longer).

          -  Cognitive tasks prescribed for cognitive rehabilitation and performed under medical
             supervision are prohibited for 6 months prior to Screening, as well as for the
             duration of the study.

        <title>Change From Baseline in Alzheimer’s Disease Assessment Scale – Cognitive Subscale (ADAS-Cog) Total Score at Week 48</title>
        <description>ADAS is a performance-based test that measures specific cognitive and behavioral dysfunctions in participants with Alzheimer's Disease. The cognitive subscale of the ADAS (ADAS-Cog) comprises 11 items that are summed to a total score ranging from 0 to 70, with lower scores indicating less severe impairment. Change from baseline is calculated as Week 48 value minus the baseline value. APOE4 negative, All except E4/E4’s: comprised of APOE4 negative and E4 heterozygote and full population was analyzed for this outcome measure. A hierarchical testing procedure was used to control for the two rosiglitazone dose groups and the genetic subgroups. Least square mean is entered for adjusted mean.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Clinical Dementia Rating Scale - Sum of Boxes (CDR-SB) at Week 48 for APOE E4</title>
        <description>CDR-SB is a semi-structured interview of participants and their caregivers. Participant’s cognitive status is rated across 6 domains of functioning, including memory, orientation, judgment/problem solving, community affairs, home/hobbies, and personal care. Severity score assigned for each of 6 domains; Total score (SB) ranges from 0 to 18. Higher scores indicate greater disease severity. Change from baseline is calculated as Week 48 value minus the baseline value. APOE4 negative, All except E4/E4’s: comprised of APOE4 negative and E4 heterozygote and full population was analyzed for this outcome measure. A hierarchical testing procedure was used to control for the two rosiglitazone dose groups and the genetic subgroups.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Disability Assessment for Dementia Scale (DAD) Total Score</title>
        <description>The DAD measures instrumental and basic activities of daily living in participants with Alzheimer's Disease (AD). This scale assesses a participants’ ability to initiate, plan, and perform activities related to hygiene, dressing, continence, eating, meal preparation, telephoning, going on an outing, finance and correspondence, medications, leisure, and housework. The scale includes 23 items relating to instrumental activities of daily living and 17 items relating to basic self-care. Each item can be scored as 1 = yes, 0 = no, non applicable = NA. Total score was obtained by adding the rating for each question and converting this total score out of 100. The total score ranged from 0 to 100, where higher score indicated better function and lower score indicated greater severity of symptoms; a positive change from baseline indicated an improvement. Change from baseline is calculated as endpoint value minus the baseline value.</description>

        <description>The NPI is a questionnaire that quantifies behavioral changes in dementia. For each of 12 behavioral domains there are 4 scores: Frequency (scale:1=occasionally to 4=very frequently), Severity (scale:1=Mild to 3=Severe), Total (frequency x severity), Caregiver distress (scale: 0=not at all distressing to 5=extremely distressing).The NPI Psychosis Subscale consists of the two domains of Delusions and Hallucinations, calculated by adding the Individual Item Scores, to yield a possible total score of 0 to 24. Lower score=less severity. Change from baseline is calculated as endpoint value minus the baseline value.</description>

          <title>Change From Baseline in Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI) Total Score</title>
          <description>The NPI is a questionnaire that quantifies behavioral changes in dementia. For each of 12 behavioral domains there are 4 scores: Frequency (scale:1=occasionally to 4=very frequently), Severity (scale:1=Mild to 3=Severe), Total (frequency x severity), Caregiver distress (scale: 0=not at all distressing to 5=extremely distressing).The NPI Psychosis Subscale consists of the two domains of Delusions and Hallucinations, calculated by adding the Individual Item Scores, to yield a possible total score of 0 to 24. Lower score=less severity. Change from baseline is calculated as endpoint value minus the baseline value.</description>

        <description>The MMSE consists of 11 tests of orientation, memory (recent and immediate), concentration, language and praxis. The scale was completed by the investigator, based on the performance of the participant, and took approximately 5 to 10 minutes to administer. The scores from 11 tests were combined to obtain the total score. The total scores range from 0 to 30, with lower scores indicating greater cognitive impairment and higher score indicating better outcome; a positive change from screening indicated an improvement. The total MMSE score for participants at screening was between 10 and 26, inclusive, in order to be eligible to participate in the trial.

        <title>Change From Baseline in the Domains of the Resource Utilization in Dementia Scale (RUD)</title>
        <description>The RUD instrument was developed as a comprehensive tool to assess the amount of resource use among demented patients. RUD assessd both formal and informal resource use of the patient and the primary caregiver, making it possible to calculate costs from a societal perspective. Q1 corresponds to the number of hours during the last month the caregiver spent assisting the patient with toilet visits, eating, dressing, grooming, walking and bathing and Q2 corresponds to the number of hours during the last month the caregiver spent assisting the patient with shopping, food preparation, housekeeping, laundry, transportation, taking medication and managing financial matters. Change from Baseline was calculated as value at scheduled time point minus Baseline value. Baseline was defined as value at Week 0. Estimated value was calculated by Active treatment minus Placebo. The adjusted means were presented.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in European Quality of Life-5 Dimensions Proxy Version (EQ-5D Proxy) Scale Total Score Assessed by Thermometer (Visual Analog Scale [VAS]) and Utility</title>
        <description>The EQ-5D Proxy is a two part scale that evaluated the participant’s health status via Thermometer and Utility scores. The Thermometer score was the caregiver’s rating of the participant’s overall health status on a VAS (0 [“worst possible status”] to 100 [“best imaginable status”]). The Utility score was a caregiver rating of health status on dimensions of mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression] where ‘1’ indicated better health state (no problems); ‘3’ indicated worst health state (&quot;confined to bed&quot;). Total possible score was the sum of individual items, ranged from 5 to 15; lower score indicated a better health state and higher score indicated greater severity of symptoms. A positive change from baseline indicated improvement in the Thermometer score and a negative change from baseline indicated improvement in the Utility score. Change from baseline is calculated as endpoint value minus the baseline value.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in ADAS-Cog Total Score for Observed Cases at Weeks 8, 16, 24, 36 and 48</title>
        <description>ADAS is a performance-based test that measures specific cognitive and behavioral dysfunctions in patients with Alzheimer's Disease. The cognitive subscale of the ADAS (ADAS-Cog) comprises 11 items that are summed to a total score ranging from 0 to 70, with lower scores indicating less severe impairment. Change from baseline is calculated as endpoint value minus the baseline value.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in CDR-SB Score for Observed Cases at Weeks 12, 24, 36 and 48</title>
        <description>CDR-SB is a semi-structured interview of participants and their caregivers. Participant’s cognitive status is rated across 6 domains of functioning, including memory, orientation, judgment/problem solving, community affairs, home/hobbies, and personal care. Severity score assigned for each of 6 domains; Total score (SB) ranges from 0 to 18. Higher scores indicate greater disease severity. Change from baseline is calculated as endpoint value minus the baseline value.</description>

        <title>Change in ADAS-Cog Total Score for Observed Cases at Week 54 Compared to Week 48</title>
        <description>ADAS is a performance-based test that measures specific cognitive and behavioral dysfunctions in patients with Alzheimer's Disease. The cognitive subscale of the ADAS (ADAS-Cog) comprises 11 items that are summed to a total score ranging from 0 to 70, with lower scores indicating less severe impairment. Change was calculated as endpoint value (Week 54) minus Week 48 value.</description>

        <description>CDR-SB is a semi-structured interview of participants and their caregivers. Participant’s cognitive status is rated across 6 domains of functioning, including memory, orientation, judgment/problem solving, community affairs, home/hobbies, and personal care. Severity score assigned for each of 6 domains; Total score (SB) ranges from 0 to 18. Higher scores indicate greater disease severity. Change was calculated as endpoint value (Week 54) minus Week 48 value.</description>

        <title>Mean Change From Baseline in Short Term Memory Assessment Score</title>
        <description>Short term memory assessment score was based on ADAS-Cog questionnaire (Question 1 and 7). ADAS is a performance-based test that measures specific cognitive and behavioral dysfunctions in participants with AD. Question 1 (Word Recall) and Question 7 (Word Recognition) of the ADAS-Cog questionnaire were summed to get a short term memory assessment score. Word recall task consist of the participants score was the mean number of words not recalled on three trials (maximum score 10) and word recognition task, to score this item the number of incorrect responses was counted (maximum error score was 12). The total score ranged from 0 to 22 with 0 indicating absence of symptoms and higher scores indicating greater dysfunction; a negative change from baseline indicated improvement. Change from Baseline in short term memory assessment was calculated as endpoint value minus the baseline value.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Alzheimer’s Carer Quality of Life Instrument (ACQLI) Total Score</title>
        <description>The ACQLI was an assessment of caregiver quality of life. This instrument consists of 30 questions exploring various aspects of carer’s quality of life. Each of the questions had a two point response and the 30 questions were summed to provide a total score. Items are assumed to be unidimensional (i.e., represent a single variable) and are scored 0/1 (false/true) before summation into a total score with a 0–30 range. The total score ranged from 0 to 30, where 0 indicated absence of symptoms and higher score indicated worse outcomes; a negative change from baseline indicated improvement. Change from baseline was calculated as endpoint value minus the baseline value.</description>
