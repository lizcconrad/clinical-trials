      To evaluate the efficacy of NeuroVision NVC vision correction technology to improve the
      vision of subjects with Low and Moderate Myopia in Asian eyes in Singapore
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      NeuroVision has developed a novel vision correction technology, which is a scientifically
      based treatment to improve vision based on new principles of visual psychophysics.
      NeuroVision NVC Vision Correction Technology is a non-invasive, patient-specific treatment
      based on visual stimulation and facilitation of neural connections responsible for vision.
      The treatment involves a programmed series of interactive visual exercises in front of a
      computer, and does not involve any form of prescription medications, or surgical treatment.

      The technology has been proven in both Israel and Singapore's pilot study to work for myopia
      -1.50D and below.

      This study is a clinical trial for Singapore Ministry of Defence personnel to evaluate the
      efficacy of this treatment beyond the proven myopia range. There will be 2 phases in the
      study; Phase 1 will include low myopes from -0.50D to -1.50D while Phase 2 covers moderate
      myopes from -1.75D to -3.00D. Subjects will be randomised into treatment and placebo group in
      the ratio of 3:1.

      A randomized double masked controlled trial conducted in 2 Phases:

      Phase I will involve 140 study subjects with low myopia randomized in a 3:1 randomization to
      receive NVC treatment versus placebo treatment.

      It is assumed that the withdrawal rate will not exceed 20%, so that at least 112 study
      subjects will complete the treatment phase.

      Interim analysis with stopping rule will be conducted after 3/4 of the patients complete the
      treatment phase.

      Phase II will involve 180 study subjects with moderate myopia randomized in a 3:1
      randomization to receive NVC treatment versus placebo treatment.

      The 2 phases will be separate RCTs, with recruitment of Phase II subjects subsequent to
      completion of Phase I NVC treatments.

        Inclusion Criteria for Phase I NVC-AM1 (Low Myopia):

          1. The subject's cycloplegic spherical equivalence in the worst eye is within the range
             of -0.50DS to -1.50DS of myopia, and astigmatism does not exceed 0.75DC in either eye.

          2. The subject's refractive status is stable, with no increase beyond 0.5D in sphere or
             cylinder over the last six months.

          3. The subject's age is between 17-55 years.

          4. The subject's uncorrected visual acuity in both eyes should be between 0.1 and 0.7
             logMAR.

          5. The subject's best corrected visual acuity 0.05 LogMar (either eye)

          6. The subject is cognitively intact and is able to follow multiple step instructions.

             the end of the treatment period. The subject is able to cease contact lens wear for at
             least a week before attending the Baseline examination, Post-treatment evaluation and
             Persistence evaluation.

          8. The subject is able and willing to attend all study sessions and visits at the
             required frequency:

               1. The total number of treatments is individual, approximately 30.

               2. The required pace for the treatment sessions is at least 3 sessions per week.
