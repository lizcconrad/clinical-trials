      This study will use functional magnetic resonance imaging to compare appetite-related brain
      activity in women with anorexia nervosa before and after receiving treatment for the
      disorder.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Anorexia nervosa (AN) is a serious eating disorder that is characterized by an extreme loss
      of appetite. People with AN view themselves as overweight and cannot bring themselves to eat,
      even though most are dangerously thin. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is a
      technique that can be used to determine which parts of the brain are activated by physical
      stimuli. When a certain stimulus is introduced, blood flow to the corresponding area of the
      brain increases. This increase in blood flow is depicted on the fMRI scan. A person with AN
      may have different responses to food when evaluated prior to treatment versus after
      treatment. This study will use fMRI to compare appetite-related brain activity in women with
      AN before and after receiving treatment for the disorder.

      Participants in this study will undergo two fMRI scans. Participants with AN will have one
      scan before entering the &quot;weight gain phase&quot; of treatment for AN and another scan upon
      completion of treatment. Healthy volunteers will undergo scans during a similar time frame.
      Participants will not be allowed to eat from midnight on the night before the scan until
      after the fMRI procedure, but they may drink water. During the scan, participants will be
      shown various objects and real foods; they will also be asked to touch the objects and food
      with their eyes closed. Each visit will last approximately 45 minutes. Ear protectors will be
      provided to reduce scanner noise.
