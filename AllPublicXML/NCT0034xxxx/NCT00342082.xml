  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This collaborative investigation between NIEHS, Duke University, and the University of North
      Carolina (UNC) will study red blood cells of babies born to HIV-infected women receiving
      anti-retroviral treatment. Studies have shown that newborn mice whose mothers were given
      anti-HIV medications during pregnancy had abnormal red blood cells circulating in their blood
      stream, indicating genetic damage to the cells caused by the anti-HIV medications. It is not
      known if similar red blood cell abnormalities develop in human infants whose mothers received
      anti-HIV medication during their pregnancy. This study will examine red blood cells from
      infants exposed to anti-HIV medications and from non-exposed infants to look for differences
      between them involving this specific genetic damage.

      Healthy pregnant women and HIV-infected pregnant women who received antiretroviral treatment
      during their last trimester of pregnancy and during labor may be eligible for this study.
      Babies of HIV-infected women are also included in the study. Candidates will be recruited
      from medical centers at Duke University and the UNC. HIV-infected mothers must plan to have
      their baby followed by either the UNC or the Duke Pediatric Infectious Disease clinic.

      All women in the study will have 1 milliliter (less than 1/2 teaspoon) of blood collected for
      this study during delivery at the same time that other blood samples are obtained for their
      medical care. In addition, 5 ml (1 teaspoon) of umbilical cord blood will also be collected
      for this study at the time of delivery after the cord is no longer attached to the baby. This
      concludes participation of non-HIV infected women.

      Babies born to HIV-infected mothers will have 1 ml of blood drawn between 0 to 3 days of
      life, between 4 to 6 weeks of life, and between 4 to 6 months of life. These bloodsamples
      will be collected at the same time as other routine scheduled blood draws.

    <textblock>
      This is an observational study of pregnant women and their newborns. The population will
      include 10 HIV infected women on any antiretroviral regimen and their newborn infants and 10
      healthy women on no antiretroviral regimen and their newborn infants.

      Primary Objective: To determine if micronucleated erythrocytes can be detected more
      frequently in cord blood of infants exposed to zidovudine in utero and intrapartum compared
      to cord blood from infants not exposed.

      Secondary Objectives:

        -  To determine if micronucleated erythrocytes can be detected in pregnant women on any
           antiretrovial agents.

        -  To determine if micronucleated erythrocytes change in frequency in infants exposed to
           antiretrovial agents over the first 6 weeks of life, during the time the infant is
           exposed to Zidovudine.

        -  To determine the change in micronucleated erythrocytes in the infants after cessation or
           Zidovudine (6 months).
