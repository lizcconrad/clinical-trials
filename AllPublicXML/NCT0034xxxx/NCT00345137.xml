      The study tests the hypothesis that systemic and renal nitric oxide availability is changed
      in polycystic kidney disease and chronic glomerulonephritis.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In a randomized, placebo controlled design, the effects of systemic treatment with
      monomethyl-L-arginine are studied on:

        1. renal hemodynamics

        2. renal sodium excretion and lithium clearance

        3. blood pressure and heart rate

        4. plasma levels of vasoactive hormones

      in patients with adult polycystic kidney disease and chronic glomerulonephrits. The results
      are compared with a group of healthy control subjects
