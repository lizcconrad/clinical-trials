  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to determine if daily teriparatide reduces back pain more
      effectively than weekly risedronate in women with osteoporosis who have chronic back pain due
      to a spinal bone fracture.

    <description>24-hour worst back pain severity scores recorded daily on an 11-point numeric rating scale, an ordinal scale ranging from 0 (no pain) to 10 (worst possible pain). The 11-point scale is used for assessment of worst back pain in the preceding 24 hours and is evaluated daily in the week prior to each scheduled study visit. Responders are defined as participants with at least a 30% reduction in the severity of worst back pain from baseline to the 6-month last observation carried forward (LOCF) endpoint.</description>

    <description>QUALEFFO is an osteoporosis-specific health instrument developed specifically for participants with vertebral deformities used to evaluate the effect of back pain and treatment on quality of life. The QUALEFFO questionnaire includes 41 items in 5 domains: pain, physical function, social function, general health perception, and mental function. The total score is calculated according to the scoring algorithm developed by the International Osteoporosis Foundation. Total scores are reported from 0 to 100, with lower scores corresponding to better quality of life.</description>

          <title>Number of Vertebral Fractures</title>
          <description>A minimum of at least one moderate osteoporotic vertebral fracture was radiologically detected and vertebral fracture status was documented. A moderate vertebral fracture was defined as at least a 25% decrease in anterior, central, or posterior vertebral height (T4 to L4) as compared to the average height of adjacent vertebrae. This measure categorizes the number of vertebral fractures for each participant.</description>

          <description>QUALEFFO is an osteoporosis-specific health instrument developed specifically for participants with vertebral deformities used to evaluate the effect of back pain and treatment on quality of life. The QUALEFFO questionnaire includes 41 items in 5 domains: pain, physical function, social function, general health perception, and mental function. The total score is calculated according to the scoring algorithm developed by the International Osteoporosis Foundation. Total scores are reported from 0 to 100, with lower scores corresponding to better quality of life.</description>

The QUALEFFO questionnaire includes 41 items in 5 domains: pain, physical function, social function, general health perception, and mental function. The total score is calculated according to the scoring algorithm developed by the International Osteoporosis Foundation.

        <title>Change From Baseline to 18-Month Endpoint in the Roland-Morris Disability Questionnaire.</title>
        <description>Roland-Morris Disability Questionnaire (RMDQ-24) is completed by the participant and measures the degree of disability due to back pain. The questionnaire consists of 24 statements and the participant is instructed to put a mark next to each appropriate statement. The number of statements marked are added up by the clinician and a total score is given. The total score ranges from 0 (no disability) to 24 (severe disability). Pooled site, baseline glucocorticoid usage status (yes/no) and baseline score were controlled for.</description>

        <description>QUALEFFO is an osteoporosis-specific health instrument developed specifically for participants with vertebral deformities used to evaluate the effect of back pain and treatment on quality of life. The QUALEFFO questionnaire includes 41 items in 5 domains: pain, physical function, social function, general health perception, and mental function. The total score is calculated according to the scoring algorithm developed by the International Osteoporosis Foundation. Total scores are reported from 0 to 100, with lower scores corresponding to better quality of life.</description>
