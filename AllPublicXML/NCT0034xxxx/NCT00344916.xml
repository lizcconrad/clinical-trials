  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Phase 1 study of the effects of nitric oxide inhibition with L-NMMA in patients with liver
      cirrhosis and healthy controls. It is hypothesized that nitric oxide availability is
      increased in liver cirrhosis.

    <textblock>
      In a randomized, placebo controlled design the acute effects of Ng-monomethyl-L-arginine are
      studied on:

        -  renal hemodynamics (GFR and RPF)

        -  blood pressure and heart rate

        -  lithium clearance

        -  plasma levels of vasoactive hormones
