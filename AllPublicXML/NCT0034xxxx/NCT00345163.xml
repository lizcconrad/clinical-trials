  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase II, open-label, multicenter, randomized, non comparative study consisting of
      two concurrent single-arms. Approximately 160 subjects will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to
      Arm 1 (bevacizumab alone) or Arm 2 (bevacizumab + irinotecan).

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Signed Informed Consent Form

          -  Age ≥ 18 years

          -  Histologically confirmed GBM in first or second relapse

          -  Radiographic demonstration of disease progression following prior therapy

          -  Bi-dimensionally measurable disease with a minimum measurement of 1 cm (10 mm) in one
             diameter on MRI performed within 14 days prior to first treatment (Day 0)

          -  An interval of ≥ 4 weeks since prior surgical resection

          -  Prior standard radiation for GBM

          -  Prior chemotherapy: first-relapse subjects

          -  Prior chemotherapy: second-relapse subjects

          -  Recovery from the effects of prior therapy, including the following: 4 weeks from
             cytotoxic agents (except 6 weeks from nitrosoureas, 3 weeks from procarbazine, 2 weeks
             from vincristine); 4 weeks from any investigational agent; 1 week from non-cytotoxic
             agents; 8 weeks from radiotherapy to minimize the potential for MRI changes related to
             radiation necrosis that might be misdiagnosed as progression of disease, or 4 weeks if
             a new lesion, relative to the pre-radiation MRI, develops that is outside the primary
             radiation field

          -  Prior therapy with gamma knife or other focal high-dose radiation is allowed but the
             subject must have subsequent histologic documentation of recurrence, unless the
             recurrence is a new lesion outside the irradiated field

          -  Karnofsky performance status ≥ 70

          -  Life expectancy &gt; 12 weeks

          -  Use of an effective means of contraception in males and in females of childbearing
             potential

          -  Ability to comply with study and follow-up procedures

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Prior treatment with irinotecan, bevacizumab, or another VEGF or VEGFR-targeted agent

          -  Prior intracerebral agents

          -  Need for urgent palliative intervention for primary disease (e.g., impending
             herniation)

             exceptions: Presence of hemosiderin; Resolving hemorrhagic changes related to surgery;
             Presence of punctate hemorrhage in the tumor

          -  Received more than two treatment regimens for Grade III and/or Grade IV glioma

          -  Blood pressure of &gt; 150 mmHg systolic and &gt; 100 mmHg diastolic

          -  History of hypertensive encephalopathy

          -  New York Heart Association (NYHA) Grade II or greater CHF

          -  History of myocardial infarction or unstable angina within 6 months prior to Day 0

          -  History of stroke or transient ischemic attack within 6 months prior to study
             enrollment

          -  Significant vascular disease (e.g., aortic aneurysm, aortic dissection) or recent
             peripheral arterial thrombosis within 6 months prior to Day 0

          -  History of abdominal fistula, gastrointestinal perforation, or intra-abdominal abscess
             within 6 months prior to Day 0

          -  History of intracerebral abscess within 6 months prior to Day 0

          -  Major surgical procedure, open biopsy, or significant traumatic injury within 28 days
             prior to Day 0, anticipation of need for major surgical procedure during the course of
             the study

          -  Minor surgical procedures (excluding placement of a vascular access device),
             stereotactic biopsy, fine needle aspirations, or core biopsies within 7 days prior to
             Day 0

          -  Serious non-healing wound, ulcer, or bone fracture

          -  Pregnancy (positive pregnancy test) or lactation

          -  Known hypersensitivity to any component of bevacizumab
