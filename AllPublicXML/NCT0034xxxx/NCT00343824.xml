        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Burn wounds with flux values, measured by Laser Doppler Imaging, corresponding with
             expected healing time between 7 and 21 days, flux values between 200 and 1000
             (red-pink or pink-yellow-green colour)

          -  Wounds treated with a hydrocolloid paste prior to LDI

          -  Possibility to follow the complete treatment schedule until wound healing and
             participation on complete follow-up schedule

          -  Informed consent

          -  Partial thickness burns with TBSE &lt; 40%

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Mean flux values &lt; 200 or &gt; 1000

          -  TBSA &gt; 40%

          -  Impossibility to debride necrotic skin prior to LDI measurement

          -  Wounds treated with any topical ointments or dressings other than hydrocolloid prior
             to LDI

          -  Not following the complete treatment schedule or missing some evaluations during the
             follow-up period

          -  Patient has any condition that seriously compromises the patient's ability to complete
             the study

          -  Patient has participated in another study using an investigational drug within the
             previous 30 days

          -  Patient has one or more medical condition(s)that in the opinion of the investigator
             would make the patient an inappropriate candidate for this study

          -  The plastic surgeon decides that surgery is necessary due to unusual circumstances

          -  Patient wish to decline from the study

          -  No informed consent
