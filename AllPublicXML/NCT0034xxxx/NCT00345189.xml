      Heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90) is an ubiquitous molecular chaperone protein that is involved
      in folding, activation, and assembly of many proteins, including key mediators of signal
      transduction, cell cycle control, and transcriptional regulation. In cancer cells that are
      dependent upon Hsp90 client proteins, the degree to which clients are inhibited correlates
      closely with induction of growth inhibition and apoptosis with Hsp90 inhibitory drugs. The
      active pharmaceutical ingredient of CNF2024, CF1983 mesylate, is a synthetic, new chemical
      entity designed to inhibit Hsp90. CF1983 hada strong affinity for tumor derived Hsp90 and
      weaker affinity for Hsp90 isolated from normal cells or recombinant Hsp90.
