  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to see what kinds of breast tumors will respond to lapatinib.
      Lapatinib is an experimental medicine which may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking
      some of the enzymes needed for cell growth.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Histologically or cytologically-confirmed by either core or fine needle biopsy primary
             invasive carcinoma of the breast;

          -  AJCC T2-T3 disease (&gt;2.0 cm without chest wall or skin invasion) by at least one
             imaging modality (either mammogram, ultrasound, or MRI) - entry criteria is based on
             radiologic staging and not final pathologic staging;

          -  ECOG performance status 0-1 (Karnofsky ≥ 70%

          -  Any lymph node status, hormone receptor status, and level of erbB2 expression

          -  No prior chemotherapy, hormonal therapy or radiation therapy to the affected breast
             for current or previous malignancy;

          -  Cardiac ejection fraction &gt;50% or within the institutional range of normal;

          -  Patients must have normal organ and marrow function defined as: Leukocyte count
             &gt;3000/uL; Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥ 1,500/mm3, platelets &gt; 100,000/mm3, and
             hemoglobin ≥ 8 gm/dl; Serum creatinine ≤ 1.5 times ULN, or 24-hour creatinine
             clearance ≥ 75 cc/min; Serum bilirubin ≤ 1.5 times ULN; SGOT ≤ 2.5 times ULN; alkaline
             phosphatase ≤ 2.5 ULN times ULN.

          -  The effects of lapatinib on the developing human fetus at the recommended therapeutic
             dose are unknown. For this reason, women of child-bearing potential and men must agree
             to use adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control;
             abstinence) prior to study entry and for the duration of study participation. Should a
             woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while participating in this study,
             she must inform her treating physician immediately.

          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign written informed consent document.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  AJCC T1, T4, or stage 4 disease;

          -  Patients may not have undergone incisional or excisional biopsy of their tumor;

          -  Patients may not be receiving any other investigational agents;

          -  Absolute contraindication to MRI imaging (cardiac pacemaker or any non-removable
             metallic foreign object in the body);

          -  On chronic therapy with any known inducer or inhibitor of CYP3A4

          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac
             arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with
             study requirements.

          -  Pregnant or lactating women are excluded from this study because lapatinib is a
             tyrosine kinase inhibitor with the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects.
