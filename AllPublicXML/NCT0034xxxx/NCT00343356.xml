      Biochemotherapy (combined immunotherapeutic drugs and chemotherapeutic drugs) has shown
      virtue than that use chemical or biological drugs alone in the treatment of some malignant
      tumor. Here we investigated the efficacy of sequential intravesical therapy with EPI and BCG
      to EPI or BCG alone in patients with transitional cell carcinoma of bladder cancer after
      surgical management.

      Methods From July 1996 to November 2003, a total of 138 cases of bladder cancer underwent
      TURBT or partial cystectomy were entered the trail. They were divided into 3 groups randomly:
      1, EPI plus BCG; 2, use BCG alone; and 3, use EPI alone. All the patients have been followed
      up for 28-40 months after surgery (average time was 36 months), and the frequency of
      bacterial, chemical cystitis and other local side effects were also observed.Results After a
      median follow up of 36 months, the number of recurrences in group 1 was significantly reduced
      than group 2 and 3 (p&lt;0.05 vs group 2 and 3, x2-test). The frequency of bacterial, chemical
      cystitis and other local side effects was similar in group 1 and 2, whereas significant
      severe side effect was found in group 3 (p&lt;0.05 vs group 2 and 1, x2-test). Allergic
      reactions, including skin rash, were more frequent in group 3, and other systemic effects
      were more frequent in group 1. Conclusion Biochemotherapy by single dose EPI plus sequential
      BCG intravesical is markedly effect in preventing the recurrence of bladder cancer after
      surgical management. Its side effects are low. This method is of high clinical value.
