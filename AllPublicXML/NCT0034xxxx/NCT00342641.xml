  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will investigate the possible relationship between infection with hepatitis C
      virus (HCV) and the development of certain hematologic cancers (Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma,
      Hodgkin's lymphoma, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, multiple myeloma) and thyroid cancer. HCV
      causes chronic hepatitis, cirrhosis, and liver cancer. It is transmitted primarily through
      injection drug use and transfusion of infected blood. Studies have shown that HCV may also be
      linked to hematologic cancers and thyroid cancer.

      This retrospective study will examine medical records from veterans with and without HCV
      infection who previously received treatment in the Veterans Administration medical system.
      Data collected on each subject will include the subject's race, sex, age and era of military
      service, presence of liver disease or thyroiditis at their baseline clinic visit, number of
      inpatient visits in the past 5 years and outpatient visits in the past year, and the presence
      of various specified cancers. The prevalence of cancer and other conditions among
      HCV-infected subjects and non-HCV infected subjects at baseline and the subsequent
      development of the cancers of interest in these two groups will be compared and analyzed for
      a possible causal relationship.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hepatitis C virus (HCV) may be a cause of hematologic malignancies and thyroid cancer. HCV
      infection is common among U.S. military veterans receiving care in the Veterans
      Administration healthcare system. The investigators propose a retrospective cohort study
      using VA administrative databases. A cohort of approximately 147,000 HCV-infected veterans
      has been identified for the period 1997-2004. Likewise, a cohort of approximately 573,000
      HCV-uninfected veterans has been identified for the same period. These subjects are being
      evaluated for the diagnosis of hematologic malignancies, thyroid cancer, and related medical
      conditions as recorded in VA databases. The comparison of the prevalence and incidence of
      these cancers in the two cohorts will provide a test of the hypothesis that HCV infection can
      cause these cancers.

      The investigators will also evaluate the association between HCV infection and several other
      medical conditions, which might be related to HCV infection, specifically: immune
      thrombocytopenic purpura, autoimmune hemolytic anemia, cholangiocarcinoma, cholangitis, and
      pancreatic cancer.
