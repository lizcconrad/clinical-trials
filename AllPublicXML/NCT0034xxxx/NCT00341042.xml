      This study, conducted in Bamako, Mali (West Africa), will collect blood and sputum samples to
      establish normal values for laboratory test results among Malians. Researchers are starting a
      new initiative to study HIV and tuberculosis in Africa, using Mali as a model country. In
      order to perform these studies, the scientists need to know what constitutes normal
      laboratory values among the population. People in developing countries may have dramatically
      different laboratory values from those who live in developed countries, and there is
      currently little information available to distinguish normal from abnormal results in
      Malians. This study will establish normal ranges that will provide a basis for future HIV and
      tuberculosis research in Mali. Additionally it will provide blood and sputum samples to
      researchers to study different scientific questions related to HIV and Tuberculosis
      infection.

      Healthy volunteers and people infected with HIV or tuberculosis, or both, who are 18 years of
      age or older and who live in Bamako, Mali, may be eligible for this study. Candidates are
      screened with a medical history, physical examination, and blood test.

      Participants provide a blood or sputum sample, or both, for laboratory analysis. Blood is
      collected through a needle inserted into an arm vein, and sputum is collected by having the
      participant cough deeply and spit in a cup. Participants may agree to provide samples one
      time only or on a returning visit basis. Returning visits may be scheduled daily or weekly.
      Subjects may continue to participate for the duration of the 4-year study, provided their
      medical history and physical examination are updated once a year.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      HIV and tuberculosis are major health issues in the developing world - HIV and tuberculosis
      affect several million people worldwide. Individually and together these two diseases kill
      more people than any other infections, with the worst suffering occurring on the African
      continent. Mali is a West African state awakening to the reality of these issues. While
      tuberculosis has always been a major problem in Mali, more recently HIV incidence has begun
      to increase.

      We are commencing a new research initiative to study HIV and tuberculosis in Africa, using
      Mali as a model country. However, there is little baseline epidemiological, hematological,
      immunological or microbiological data to help distinguish normal from abnormal results;
      establishing normal population baseline values is necessary to facilitate future research. We
      will collect whole blood and sputum samples to establish baseline values, for the purpose of
      facilitating ongoing or future HIV and tuberculosis research. Specifically, samples will be
      used to determine normal hematological, immunological and other parameters for Malian people.
      In addition, we will use samples to optimize routine and specialized research assays. Sputum
      samples will be used in bacteriological and genetic studies intended to optimize studies
      relating to tuberculosis.
