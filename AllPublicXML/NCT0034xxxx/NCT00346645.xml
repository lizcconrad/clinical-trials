  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether Bortezomib is effective in the treatment of
      patients with non-small-cell lung cancer who have not received any prior chemotherapy regimen
      for advanced disease.

      Chemotherapy for non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), mainly Cisplatin-based combinations,
      provides a measurable but modest survival benefit for selected patients with advanced
      disease. Advanced NSCLC remains largely fatal, with the positive impact of chemotherapy
      limited by intrinsic and acquired resistance, manifested clinically by early progression and
      transient responses. Current chemotherapy regimens have limited efficacy with a magnitude of
      survival benefit that is still modest, and lead to significant toxicity, with many patients
      unable to receive this kind of treatment, even in first line setting. There is, therefore, a
      great need to provide patients with less toxic agents such as the novel targeted therapies,
      with the potential to improve the efficacy and maintain a good quality of life. Bortezomib, a
      proteasome inhibitor, has shown benefit as single agent in pretreated patients with similar
      or lesser toxicity compared to chemotherapy. The current project is a phase II trial that
      will include 46 patients with advanced NSCLC and without prior chemotherapy. An early tumor
      assessment (after 6 weeks of therapy) will be performed, combined with regular clinical and
      symptom assessment to allow for rapid and appropriate management of non-responding patients,
      with cross over to another therapy as per the investigator and patient choice. The primary
      objective is efficacy of bortezomib as determined by the rate of no progression at 6 weeks.
      Secondary objectives are efficacy of bortezomib as determined by objective response rate
      (incidence of CR and PR), disease control rate (CR, PR and stabilization), duration of
      disease control, duration of objective response, progression-free survival,overall survival,
      safety of bortezomib, rate of doublet therapy in second line.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Histologically documented, inoperable, unresectable, incurable, locally advanced,
             recurrent or metastatic (Stage IIIB or Stage IV) non-small cell lung cancer. (Note:
             Histology is the preferred method of diagnosis. However, in case only cytology is
             available, specimens from brushing, washing or needle aspiration etc. are acceptable
             for diagnosis. Sputum cytology alone is not acceptable)

          -  No prior chemotherapy or therapy with systemic anti-tumour therapy (e.g., monoclonal
             antibody therapy). Prior surgery and/or localized irradiation (palliative RT or
             curative RT) is permitted. Pre operative or post operative anti neo-plastic therapy is
             allowed if ended more than 2 years ago

          -  No prior exposure to agents directed at the HER axis (e.g. EGFR TK Inhibitors,
             Herceptin)

          -  Measurable disease as defined by RECIST criteria (attachment 1)
