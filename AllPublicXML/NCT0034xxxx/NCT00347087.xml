      In CHF impaired insulin sensitivity is a common finding characterised by elevated fasting
      insulin levels and impaired effectiveness of insulin to utilise glucose in peripheral
      tissues, mainly in skeletal muscle tissue. Additionally, impaired insulin sensitivity, i.e.
      insulin resistance, progresses in parallel to severity of CHF and relates to major clinical
      symptoms such as reduced exercise capacity and muscle fatigue. In survival analyses, insulin
      resistance is a significant predictor of mortality, independently of and additionally to
      other established prognostic markers such as age, NYHA class, peak oxygen consumption, or
      LVEF. These findings indicate that insulin resistance is involved in CHF pathophysiology.
      Importantly, insulin resistance in CHF occurs independently of ischemic etiology. In
      ischaemic heart disease, however, insulin resistance as part of the metabolic syndrome is
      also an important prerequisite for the development of arteriosclerosis. Accordingly insulin
      resistance was found worst in CHF patients with ischemic etiology compared to patients with
      CHF due to dilated cardiomyopathy and those with ischaemic heart disease without heart
      failure. On the basis of these findings we hypothesise that therapeutically improving insulin
      sensitivity may have additional beneficial effects on energy utilisation and therefore
      improve clinical symptoms such as reduced exercise capacity and muscle fatigue.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. ambulatory patients with symptomatic chronic heart failure (NAHY II-IV)

          2. ischemic etiology

          3. LVEF â‰¤ 45%

          4. standard medical treatment for CHF (such as diuretics, beta blockers, ACE inhibitors,
             aspirin or warfarin). Patients should be treated with ACI inhibitor for at least 12
             months prior to enrolment into the study. Patients should not be treated with
             angiotensin II receptor antagonists during the study other than the trial medication.
             Further medical treatment such as spironolactone, amiodarone and others are allowed if
             the patient is on a stable dose at the beginning of the trial. Dosages should be kept
             stable during the trial except adjustment is judged necessary for clinical reason.

          5. Patient should be hospitalised due to deterioration of the cardiac disease at least
             once in the last 12 months under ACE-I therapy.

          6. age &gt; 21 years

          7. informed consent

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. hospitalisation with intervention within 2 weeks of intended randomisation

          2. unstable IHD or Myocardial infarction &lt; 2 months

          3. open diagnosed diabetes mellitus / antidiabetic treatment with insulin, metformin,
             sulfonylurea, glinides

          4. COPD treated with steroids
