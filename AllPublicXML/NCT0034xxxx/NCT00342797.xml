  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A series of 1,729 retinoblastoma (RB) patients were identified from medical records at
      hospital centers in Boston (1937-84) and New York (1914-84). The study cohort consists of the
      1,604 patients who survived at least 1 year after RB diagnosis. Information was obtained from
      medical records and interviews conducted in 1987 and 1993. RB patients had a 30-fold excess
      risk of another cancer, and a 50% chance of developing a cancer if they survived to 50 years
      of age. Blood samples have been collected from 481 patients, and studies are underway to
      determine if certain mutations in the RB1 genes are associated with increased or decreased
      penetrance or with increased risk of subsequent cancer development. The study population in
      New York is being expanded currently to include patients treated since 1984, and their
      medical records are being abstracted. Blood samples will be collected from the newly
      identified patients who are returning to New York Hospital for a followup RB exam.
