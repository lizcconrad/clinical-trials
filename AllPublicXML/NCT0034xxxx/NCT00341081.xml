  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study, conducted at the Johns Hopkins University School of Public Health in Baltimore,
      Maryland, will determine how accurately injection drug users report their needle-sharing
      behavior. Needle-sharing is a major cause of blood-borne diseases, including HIV and
      hepatitis. Therefore, a better understanding of this behavior is critical for devising
      strategies to reduce disease spread in this way. Research on needle-sharing behavior has
      relied heavily on users' self-reports. This study will compare these self-reports with
      results of DNA tests that show whether a needle has been used by one or more individuals.

      Injection drug users 18 years of age or older participating in the Baltimore Needle Exchange
      Program (BNEP) have been recruited for this study. Syringes distributed to users through the
      BNEP are collected after use and tested to differentiate between single versus multiple
      users. The findings are compared with the participants' responses about whether or not they
      shared their needles and syringes.

      Participants visit the clinic every 6 months for an interview, including questions about
      their mental and physical health, drug use, sexual activity and knowledge about HIV (the
      virus that causes AIDS) and AIDS. After the interview, a small amount of blood is drawn for
      testing for HIV, hepatitis, syphilis and other infectious diseases. Some of the blood is
      stored for future testing. Participants return to the clinic 4 weeks after the interview and
      blood drawing to get their test results. At this time, they are offered referral for drug
      treatment, free condoms, advice about drug use and safer sex and an opportunity to ask
      questions about their health. Participation in the study may continue for up to 5 years.

      Needle sharing is a major cause of blood-borne diseases making understanding needle sharing
      behavior imperative to devising strategies to reduce the disease burden. A DNA-based method,
      using highly informative genetic markers of short tandem repeats (STRs) is being proposed as
      a gold standard measure to identify single-use and multi-use syringes. Self-reports of needle
      sharing, which have been the main source of sharing information for research, will be
      compared to the genotypic results to validate the responses on such risk behavior. Genotypic
      information from four autosomal STRs will be used to differentiate DNA from a single versus
      multiple individuals in syringe exudates obtained from injection drug users (IDUs) from the
      Baltimore needle exchange program (BNEP) studied by ALIVE II. Detecting three or more
      distinct alleles at an autosomal STR in the syringe exudates provides evidence that the
      syringe has been shared by at least two individuals. Matching probabilities will be used to
      match the genotypic profile of the individual(s) checking in and returning the syringe to
      allele(s) observed in the syringe exudates, and a mixture discrimination probability will be
      used to measure the likelihood of single vs. multi genome in the syringe samples. Behavioral
      surveillance to document the rapid spread of infectious disease from needle sharing among
      high-risk sub-population such as IDUs are critical for global public health along with the
      development and implementation of timely interventions.
