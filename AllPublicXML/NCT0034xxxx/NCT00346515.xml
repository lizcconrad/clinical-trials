        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  One or more of the high surgical risk criteria.

          -  Candidate for percutaneous stenting with target lesion located within common or
             internal carotid artery.

          -  Symptomatic with atherosclerotic stenosis ≥ 50% or asymptomatic with atherosclerotic
             stenosis ≥ 70% of the carotid artery by NASCET Criteria.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Allergy to Heparin.

          -  Myocardial infarction within the last 14 days.

          -  Angioplasty or PTCA/PTA procedure within the past 48 hours.

          -  Cardiac surgery within the past 60 days.

          -  Planned invasive surgical procedure within 30 days.

          -  Stroke within the past 14 days.

          -  Transient ischemic neurological attack (TIA) or amaurosis fugax within the past 48
             hours.

          -  Intracranial stenosis that exceeded the severity of an extracranial stenosis.

          -  Peripheral vascular disease of sufficient severity to prevent vascular access to the
             target lesion.

          -  Total occlusion of the target vessel.

          -  Lesion within 2cm of the ostium of the common carotid artery.

          -  A stenosis that is known to be unsuitable for stenting because of one or more of:

               1. Tortuous or calcified anatomy proximal or distal to the stenosis

               2. Presence of visual thrombus

               3. Pseudo occlusion ('string sign')

          -  Serial lesions that requires more then one stent to cover entire lesion.

          -  Procedural complication prior to introduction of the FiberNet device into the body.
