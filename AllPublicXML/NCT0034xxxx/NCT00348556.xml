    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to determine the safety and effectiveness of intrarenal
      administration of brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) in improving renal function as measured by
      glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and sodium excretion in patients hospitalized with acute
      congestive heart failure (CHF) and deterioration of kidney function (cardiorenal syndrome).

    <measure>Change in Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR) at 24 Hours</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 24 hours after start of infusion</time_frame>
    <description>Kidney function was to be measured by GFR determined by iothalamate clearance. GFR describes the flow rate of filtered fluid through the kidney measured in milliliters per minute per 1.73 m^2 of body surface area. A lower GFR means the kidney is not filtering normally. An estimated GFR of less than 60 mg/min/1.73 m^2 of body surface area is considered to be impaired kidney function.</description>

This calculation is widely used to help differentiate prerenal disease (decreased renal perfusion) from acute tubular necrosis (ATN) as the cause of acute kidney injury (AKI, formerly called acute renal failure).</description>
