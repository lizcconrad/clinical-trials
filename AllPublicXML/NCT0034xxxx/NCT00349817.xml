      This study examines the best way to teach genetics to family medicine residents. First year
      family medicine residents at the University of Toronto will be taught basic clinical genetics
      as well as a specific disease in genetics via 3 different educational methods. All
      participants will undergo an oral examination and written knowledge test 3 months after this
      education. Results between groups will be compared, and the best way to teach genetics to
      residents determined.

      An educational module will be prepared by the investigators outlining important genetic
      fundamentals and hereditary colorectal cancer. Sixty four family medicine resident
      participants will take part in this study. Participants will be divided into 4 groups. Group
      1 will be the control and receive no education. Group 2 will be given access to the
      self-study web-based educational module to do on their own time. Group 3 will be given a
      lecture on the material using the educational module, followed by a discussion. Group 4 will
      also be given this lecture and discussion, followed by an interactive standardized patient
      role-play experience.

      Three months later, all participants will complete an simulated oral examination, an written
      knowledge test and an attitude survey. By comparing the results between the 4 groups, the
      best way to teach genetics will be determined. This template can then be used to develop a
      curriculum for teaching clinical genetics to family medicine residents.
