      Primary objective: to assess the effect of AVE1625 on weight loss over a period of 24 weeks
      in abdominally obese patients with atherogenic dyslipidemia. Secondary objectives: - To
      assess the dose effect relationship of AVE1625 on HDL-cholesterol and triglycerides plasma
      levels over a period of 24 weeks - To assess the efficacy of AVE1625 on secondary parameters
      such as waist circumference and other metabolic parameters over a period of 24 weeks - To
      assess the safety and tolerabillity of AVE1625 over a period of 24 weeks.

          -  Patients with any clinically significant endocrine disease

          -  Patients on anticoagulants (heparin, warfarin) or with bleeding disorders

          -  Clinically relevant disease interfering with subject's safety or making implementation

             reduction in the 3 months prior to screening.

          -  The investigator will evaluate whether there are other reasons why a patient may not
             participate
