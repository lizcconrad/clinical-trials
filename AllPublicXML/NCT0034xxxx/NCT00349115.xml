  <brief_summary>

      Multiple Myeloma is a incurable disease. Thalidomide in combination with other agents are
      currently in trials for the newly diagnosed patients, we designed treatment of TCD, followed
      by high dose chemotherapy with autologous stem cell transplantation and TD maintenance
      therapy for the patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma.

      Phase II clinical trial for the patients with newly diagnosed. TCD (thalidomide,
      cyclophosphamide and dexamethasone) will be applied for the patients as an induction
      chemotherapy, followed by high dose chemotherpy and autologous stem cell transplantation.
      Afterthen, they will receive TD (thalidomide and dexamethasone) maintenance therapy for one
      year.
