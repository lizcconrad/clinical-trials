  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicentric, randomised, controlled study comparing Laser Iridotomy (LI) to no
      treatment in subjects with asymptomatic narrow angles (ANA).One eye of each subject with ANA
      will be randomised to undergo LI and the other eye will be left alone and will serve as an
      internal control. Subjects are proposed to be followed up once a year for 5 years.

      Objective: This study will compare LI versus no treatment in subjects with asymptomatic
      narrow angles, the anatomical trait that predisposes to primary angle closure glaucoma
      (PACG), in order to assess the effectiveness of prophylactic treatment in the prevention of
      blindness due to PACG.

      Eligibility: 1. Bilateral Narrow angles; 2. Age 50 years and above; 3. Informed consent
      obtained prior to or at baseline visit.

      Trial Design: Subjects with asymptomatic ANA undergoes randomisation after comprehensive
      ocular exam followed by randomisation to LI in one eye and no treatment in the other eye.
      Follow up is done for 5 years with yearly examination.
