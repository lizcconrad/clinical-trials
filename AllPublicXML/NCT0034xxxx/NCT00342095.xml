  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is severe, chronic, disabling autoimmune disease that
      significantly affects health status and quality of life. Since the disease occurs most often
      in young to middle-aged adults, SLE can also affect work and disability. However, there is
      currently little information on work-related disability from longitudinal, population-based
      studies of SLE.

      Participants were enrolled into the Carolina Lupus Study between February, 1997 and July
      1999. We plan to conduct two telephone contacts with patients and one telephone contact with
      controls in a follow-up study to be conducted in 2001. The first patient contact will follow
      an introductory letter that describes the follow-up study. This letter provides participants
      the opportunity (via a toll-free phone number) to decline further contact about this study.
      The first patient contact will be a short (5 minute) interview in which we determine their
      current source of lupus-related medical care, timing of next expected visit, and update
      contact information. The second contact will involve a 60-minute telephone interview covering
      medical care utilization, current health status (including a patient-administered measure of
      lupus activity), work and disability issues, psychosocial attributes (e.g. helplessness,
      social support, daily stressors including race-related issues), and changes in exposures
      since the initial interview. We will attempt to schedule the patients' interviews within 3
      months before or after the patient sees his or her own physician for SLE-related evaluation
      or treatment. A short (15 minutes or less) telephone interview will be conducted with
      controls focusing on current health, work status, and daily stresso.

      Ddisease damage will be assessed using the System Lupus international Collaborating Clinics
      (SLICC)/American College of Rheumatology (ACR) Damage Index, a standardized and validated
      instrument that is completed by the patient's physician.

      We will seek death certificates for patients and controls who have died in order to obtain
      cause of death information. Next-of-kin information from death certificates will not be used.

      This study will allow up to determine the feasibility of obtaining reliable data on disease
      damage from more than 50 physicians involved in the treatment of patients in the Carolina
      Lupus Study. This developmental work is a necessary foundation for any additional follow-up
      studies of the Carolina Lupus Study cohort. We will also be able to examine associations with
      disability in patients and in controls and to examine the contribution of various factors to
      the increased disease severity experience by African-American SLE patients.
