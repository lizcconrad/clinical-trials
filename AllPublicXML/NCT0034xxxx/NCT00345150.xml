  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study tests the hypothesis that systemic and renal nitric oxide synthesis is changed in
      essential hypertension by investigating the effects of a non selective nitric oxide inhibitor
      on renal hemodynamics and sodium excretion in patients with essential hypertension. The
      results are compared with a group of healthy subjects.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study investigates the effects of Ng-monomethyl-L-arginine (L-NMMA) on:

        1. renal hemodynamics (renal plasma flow and glomerular filtration rate)

        2. renal sodium excretion

        3. lithium clearance and fractional lithium excretion

        4. plasma levels of vasoactive hormones

        5. blood pressure and heart rate
