      Information from this study is needed to plan an eventual trial of a GAS vaccine in India if
      and when one is available. A GAS vaccine is currently a priority of the Indian Council for
      Medical Research (ICMR), and this project has been approved by the Joint Working Group (US
      and Indian Delegates) of the Vaccine Action Program, a joint effort of the ICMR and NIAID to
      implement cooperative efforts between the two countries on mutual objectives in vaccine
      development. Currently, several GAS vaccines are in development, supported by NIAID, and
      other sources, and one candidate is in phase one clinical trial authorized by the FDA.
      Information on the antigenic structure of GAS isolated in India will be needed for planning
      vaccine composition. It is the view of the Indian Ministry of Health and Indian Council for
      Medical Research that eventual prevention and control of rheumatic fever and rheumatic heart
      disease in India, now a heavy burden on the children will require a GAS vaccine, which
      requires both access to primary health care and a vaccine if and when it is available.

      Information on incidence is needed to determine the size of a future vaccine cohort in order
      to obtain a statistically significant result on vaccine efficacy. Although unrelated to
      vaccine development, information on the incidence of GAS pharyngitis is needed in India to
      implement primary and secondary acute rheumatic fever (ARF) and rheumatic heart disease (RHD)
      prevention programs as were implemented in the USA and Europe forty years ago.

      A vaccine trial is not part of this study, nor is there any intervention, other than
      antibiotic treatment of all children volunteers who develop GAS pharyngitis or impetigo.

      An additional point should be made about the importance of obtaining epidemiological data on
      streptococcal disease in India, and on the emm types of GAS that cause infections. The
      population of India is over one billion people, representing nearly twenty five percent of
      the world's population. Information on GAS epidemiology from India is scant to say the least,
      and it is sorely needed. We now know that streptococcal toxic shock syndrome and fasciitis
      that have occurred in the U. S., Europe, Australia, and Japan, with greater frequency in
      recent years are caused by several genetically similar emm types of GAS. The implication of
      such genetic and epidemiologic data is that these genetically related strains have spread
      worldwide, Current information from India is far too limited to know if these virulent
      strains of GAS occur in India, and if they do, to what extent might they be the cause of
      frequent invasive disease in hospitalized patients.

      Equally important, we do not know if a potentially high virulent GAS strain is currently
      emerging in some locale(s) in India, and what possible threat it might become, if it were to
      be transported to other worldwide geographic regions. Although not a specific aim of this
      proposal, the surveillance conducted to accomplish the aims of this protocol will provide
      essential information on the possible emergence of an unexpected emm type with pathogenic
      potential.

      This is an epidemiological study on the incidence of Group A beta hemolytic streptococcal
      (GAS) infections (both pharyngitis and impetigo) in school-age children in two rural area of
      India: surveillance in four schools, in the north in the Punjab near Chandigarh conducted by
      the medical staff of the Department of Community Medicine Post-graduate Institute for Medical
      Research and Training (PGI); and in one school in the south in Tamil Nadu near Vellore
      conducted by the medical staff of the Department of Community Medicine, Christian Medical
      College (CMC).

      Children and their teachers were questioned weekly for a history of GAS infection. On all
      children suspected from the history of a streptococcal infection of the pharynx or the skin,
      a physical examination of nose, throat, ears and skin was performed and throat culture and or
      skin culture and blood sample were taken for subsequent antibody determination. The diagnosis
      of GAS infection was made on the basis of established clinical criteria and the isolation of
      GAS from throat and skin lesion cultures.

      The surveillance of the children was completed in March '04 in Vellore, and in April '04 in
      Chandigarh. For the next year, there will be extensive analysis of the clinical data;
      analysis of the isolated GAS for emm type and other bacteriologic characteristics; and
      epidemiologic analysis in a search for patterns of distribution of GAS infections by sex,
      age, school and session.

      The general objectives have been:

      To establish population-based surveillance to determine the incidence of GAS infection in
      school children age 7-11, to characterize the M protein of the newly isolated strains of GAS
      by emm gene sequencing,

        1. to identify surrogate markers of protective immunity relevant to vaccine development
           such as serum antibody to the M type-specific peptides and cysteine protease, and

        2. to define the molecular epidemiology of GAS in terms of those characteristics that are
           relevant to vaccine-induced immunity.

      Information from this study is needed to plan an eventual trial of a vaccine(s) if and when
      one is available. Information on the antigenic structure of GAS isolated in India will be
      needed for planning vaccine composition. Information on incidence is needed to determine the
      size of a future cohort that will be needed to obtain a statistically significant result on
      vaccine efficacy.

      A vaccine trial is not part of this study, nor was there any intervention, other than
      diagnostic procedures and antibiotic treatment of all who develop a GAS infection.

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:

        All students (approximately 225-250) attending four classes in four rural schools, grades
        2-5, in rural villages near Chandigarh, and all students in classes 2-6 approximately
        225-250 attending one rural village school near Vellore were asked to participate.

        Approximately an equal number of boys and girls participated.

        Selection of the schools for the study was determined by such factors as the accessibility
        to a rural regional clinic, housing facilities for medical staff, and passable tertiary
        roads to the villages and the schools.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

        All volunteers had a history of acute rheumatic fever and acute glomerulonephritis and
        evidence of rheumatic fever and rheumatic heart disease on physical examination at the
        initial survey were excluded from the study.

        Excluded also was a child with a compromising illness such as cystic fibrosis that might
        require frequent or intermittent antibiotic treatment.
