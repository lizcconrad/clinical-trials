  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether an increase of blood haemoglobin levels
      through the substitution of erythropoietin during radiotherapy treatment of cervix cancer
      patients results in improvement for disease specific survival, tumor response and local
      control.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Definitive radiotherapy is the treatment of choice for patients with locally advanced cervix
      cancer. Low pre-therapeutic values of the intratumoral pO2 are associated with significantly
      worse therapeutic outcome and the blood hemoglobin levels correlate positively with the
      intratumoral pO2. Successful augmentation of hemoglobin levels by way of transfusion leads to
      improvement of therapeutic results. Therefore, a pre-therapeutic transfusion therapy is
      carried out routinely at a number of hospitals; however this therapy is due to its cost and
      risks limited to patients with an initial hemoglobin level of &lt; 10 g/dl. To avoid
      transfusions and to increase patients wellbeing, the efficacy and tolerability of
      erythropoietin was tested, when administered to increase the lowered hemoglobin levels in
      tumor patients. The question is, whether or not it is possible, to regularly raise the blood
      hemoglobin levels in patients with carcinoma of the cervix by administering erythropoietin.
      If a normal (&gt;12 g/dl) or rather an upper-normal (&gt;14 g/dl) hemoglobin level is reached, then
      the tumor oxygenation and thus also the response to radiation could be positively influenced.
      The objective of this study is to improve the response and control rates as well as the
      disease free survival rates in female patients with primary carcinoma of the cervix within
      the scope of the curative radiation therapy. The test hypothesis is that by administering
      erythropoietin the hemoglobin levels are increased and through this increase the response of
      the tumor to radiation therapy will be improved.

      Comparison(s): A prospective, randomized, multi-centric group of female patients treated with
      Erythropoietin is compared to a parallel stratified control group receiving no treatment.
