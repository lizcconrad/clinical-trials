  <brief_summary>

      The overall goal of this project is to understand the role of genetics in the etiology and
      prevention of upper gastrointestinal cancer, primarily esophageal cancer, but also cancers of
      the gastric cardia and body.

      Esophageal cancer is the second most common cause of cancer death in China and the seventh
      most common cause of cancer death worldwide. Evidence suggests that genetic factors may play
      an important role in the etiology of this malignancy, and identification of esophageal cancer
      susceptibility genes may allow screening of populations to identify persons at particularly
      high risk, who could then be targeted for prevention strategies (e.g., chemoprevention or
      early detection). There are several lines of evidence supporting the idea that there is
      genetic susceptibility for esophageal cancer in high-risk Chinese populations, including an
      association of positive family history with increased risk, evidence of familial aggregation
      of cases, and segregation analyses suggesting Mendelian inheritance in high-risk families.

      Several different but complementary approaches will be used to identify esophageal cancer
      susceptibility genes. (Because of etiologic similarities and for logistic reasons, parallel
      efforts will be made with gastric cardia and body cancers.) First, a tumor/non-tumor study
      will be conducted in which a biological specimen bank consisting of samples (tumor,
      non-tumor, venous blood, finger stick blood, and buccal cells) from several hundred cases of
      esophageal, gastric cardia, and gastric body cancers will be developed in Taiyuan that can be
      used for the identification of esophageal (as well as gastric cardia and body) cancer
      susceptibility genes and potential early genetic markers of these cancers. High-density
      genome-wide scans with microsatellite markers will be used in a limited number of cases to
      identify potential hot spots followed by further testing of these hot spots and other
      candidate markers in additional tumor/non-tumor samples. Premalignant morphologic lesions
      will also be examined. Second, blood samples for DNA will be collected from approximately 100
      healthy individuals from high-risk (Yangcheng County) and low-risk (Beijing) areas to examine
      potential population differences in polymorphisms for selected genomic markers. Third, a
      large case-control study with cancers of the esophagus, cardia, and body of stomach will be
      conducted to evaluate polymorphisms in the candidate markers identified in other components
      of this project, and to evaluate gene-environment interactions. Finally, a family study will
      be conducted to evaluate linkage of candidate markers with cancer in families having 2 or
      more cases with cancers of the esophagus, cardia, and/or body of stomach.

      ranging from normal to early invasive disease in order to characterize molecular progression.

        First, several hundred cases of esophageal cancer and gastric cancer (both cardia and body)
        ascertained in Taiyuan at the Shanxi Cancer Hospital. Second, several hundred healthy
        individuals from high-risk (Yangcheng County) and low-risk (Beijing) areas. Third, a large
        case-control study with cases of esophageal cancer and gastric cancer (both cardia and
        body) and neighborhood controls selected from Shanxi Province was conducted. Follow-up of
        cases from the case-control study has been conducted to determine vital status. Fourth, a
        family study is in progress with selection of families having 2 or more cases with
        esophageal cancer or gastric cancer; follow-up of family members and accrual of new
        families is ongoing in Yangcheng county, Shanxi Province. Finally, an endoscopic study has
        been conducted at Shanxi Cancer Hospital to obtain specimens from a morphologic spectrum of
        disease ranging from normal to early invasive esophageal cancer.

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:

        All patients over the age of 18 presenting to the SCHI with upper GI signs or symptoms
        requiring upper GI endoscopy over a defined calendar period (depending on prevalence of
        premalignant lesions, but estimated to be approximately 3 years) will be potentially
        eligible for participation in this study.

        Patients are eligible only if they meet one of the following two conditions: (1) a visible
        lesion unlikely to be cancer or (2) no visible lesions on routine endoscopy (without
        mucosal iodine staining) but an unstained (abnormal) lesion following iodine spraying.

        Invitation for participation will be based solely on the visual appearance of an esophageal
        abnormality without or with mucosal iodine staining, but before histologic confirmation is
        obtained, and will occur during the same clinic visit as the qualifying endoscopic
        examination.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

        Patients will not be invited to participate in this study until after they have undergone
        their routine endoscopic evaluation.
