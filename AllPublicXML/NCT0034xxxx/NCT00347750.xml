  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this proposal is based on the assumption that the HIV infected Ethiopian
      population responded in a different way in comparison to the Caucasian subjects to Lopinavir
      therapy. Our preliminary data demonstrated that Ethiopian's have different Lopinavir serum
      concentration in comparison to non-Ethiopian's. For these reasons the plan of this study is
      to investigate the pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) profile in both populations. The
      results will allow to establish a better personalised medicine for HIV infected individuals.
