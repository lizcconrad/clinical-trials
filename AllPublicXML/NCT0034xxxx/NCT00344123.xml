  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Tipranavir (TPV) plus ritonavir (RTV) is indicated for use as part of an antiretroviral
      treatment regimen for resistant HIV-1 infection in adult patients. Since significant
      cholesterol and triglyceride elevations are commonly reported during TPV/RTV treatment,
      effective treatment strategies are critical to prevent long-term cardiovascular events.
      Rosuvastatin, a potent 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitor, is
      unlikely to interact with TPV/RTV since it is not extensively metabolized, however, a formal
      drug interaction study is needed before this combination can be recommended. This study will
      examine the pharmacokinetic interactions between tipranavir/ritonavir (TPV/RTV [TPV/r] 500
      mg/200 mg twice daily [B.I.D]) and single dose rosuvastatin when the two are co-administered
      to healthy adult volunteers. The investigators hypothesize that if tipranavir 500 mg is
      co-administered with low-dose ritonavir 200 mg and rosuvastatin (10 mg) no significant
      clinical interaction will occur.

      This is a prospective, open-label pharmacokinetic study in healthy HIV seronegative adults.
      This study will examine the pharmacokinetic interactions between steady-state TPV/r 500
      mg/200 mg B.I.D. and single dose rosuvastatin 10 mg when the drugs are co-administered.

      Rosuvastatin 24 hour pharmacokinetic sampling will be performed on days 1-2 and 12-13.
      Rosuvastatin 48 hr samples will be collected on days 3 and day 14.

      Tipranavir and ritonavir 12 hour pharmacokinetic sampling will be on day 11 and 12.

      Safety assessments (physical examination, vital sign measurements, and clinical laboratory
      tests) will be performed at screening, during the study and prior to discharge. Subjects will
      be continuously monitored for adverse events throughout the duration of the study.

      On Day 1, subjects will receive a single 10 mg dose of rosuvastatin. Beginning on Day 3,
      subjects will receive a combination of TPV 500 mg/RTV 200 mg twice daily for 11 days (Days
      3-13).

      On Day 12, subjects will receive a single 10 mg dose of rosuvastatin co-administered with
      TPV/r.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects must have a body mass index (BMI) of 18 to 30 kg/m2, inclusive (BMI = weight
             (kg)/[height (m)]2) and weigh at least 50 kg.

          -  Males or females, ages &gt; 18 to &lt; 65 years.

          -  Women of childbearing potential (WOCBP) must not be nursing or pregnant. All women of
             childbearing potential (have not reached menopause nor undergone hysterectomy,
             bilateral oophorectomy, or tubal ligation) must have a negative serum human chorionic
             gonadotropin (HCG) test performed at screening (within 24 hours before the start of
             study day 1). Female subjects who are not of reproductive potential (have reached
             menopause or undergone hysterectomy, bilateral oophorectomy, or tubal ligation) or
             whose male partner has undergone successful vasectomy with resultant azoospermia or
             has azoospermia for any other reason, are eligible without requiring the use of
             contraception. Documentation of menopause, sterilization (hysterectomy, oophorectomy,
             tubal ligation, or vasectomy) and azoospermia by patient-reported history is
             acceptable. Both male and female study volunteers of reproductive potential must agree
             not to participate in a conception process (i.e., active attempt to become pregnant or
             to impregnate via sperm donation or in vitro fertilization), and, if participating in
             sexual activity that could lead to pregnancy, the female study volunteer/male partner
             must use a form of contraception as specified below while receiving protocol-specified
             medication(s) and for one month after stopping the medication(s). Male study
             volunteers will be required to use a barrier method for at least 3 months after
             completion of the study.

               -  Condoms (male or female) with or without a spermicidal agent

               -  Diaphragm or cervical cap with spermicide

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  History or current evidence of any significant acute or chronic medical illness that,
             within the investigator's discretion, would interfere with the conduct or
             interpretation of the study.

          -  History of acute or chronic pancreatitis.

          -  History of diabetes mellitus, hypertriglyceridemia, or chronic renal insufficiency.

          -  Proven or suspected acute hepatitis at the time of study entry.

          -  Current or recent (within 3 months) gastrointestinal disease which would interfere
             with the conduct or interpretation of the study.

          -  Any major surgery within 4 weeks of enrollment. Any gastrointestinal surgery that
             could impact upon the absorption of study drug.

          -  Donation of blood or plasma to a blood bank or in a clinical study (except a screening
             visit) within 4 weeks of enrollment.

          -  Inability to tolerate oral medication.

          -  Inability to tolerate venipuncture and/or absence of secure venous access.

          -  Known or suspected HIV infection or chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) or hepatitis C
             virus (HCV) infection

          -  Known active drug or alcohol abuse which, in the opinion of the investigator, makes
             study participation to completion unlikely.

             investigator.
