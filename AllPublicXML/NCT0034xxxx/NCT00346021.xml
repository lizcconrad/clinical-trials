      Purpose of the project is to develop a school-based intervention aimed at increasing hat use
      when children are outside at home and at school. The intervention is targeted to fourth grade
      children in Hillsborough County, Florida and is based on Theory of Reasoned Action and
      Planned Behavior. It is structured to accomplish the following goals: (a) increase sun
      protection knowledge of children in regards to hat use,(b) foster more positive attitudes in
      regard to wearing hats,(c) change the subjective norms of wearing hats (d) target persons
      that children perceive as controlling their behavior of wearing hats(parents,teachers) and
      increase the use of hats when children are outdoors at school(primary outcome) and when
      outdoors at times other than school(secondary outcome).

      Intervention is aimed at encouraging students to use a wide brim hat when participating in
      outdoor activities. To accomplish this goal our approach will be multifaceted and will
      include:

        1. individual sessions with school principals to facilitate a school policy that encourages
           hat use when children are outdoors.

        2. sessions with fourth grade teachers that explains the importance of sun protection and
           hat use, and that addresses potential concerns by teachers.

        3. classroom sessions with fourth grade children that improves sun protection knowledge,
           fosters more positive attitudes about hat use. and that changes the subjective norm of
           wearing hats when at school.

        4. follow-up sessions in which children are provided free hats with a customized design
           that represents their school.

        5. sun protection educational materials that are mailed to the parents of targeted
           children.
