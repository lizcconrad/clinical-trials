    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research is to compare the on-eye performance of 12 month daily wear
      versus 6-night extended wear and 30-night extended wear of novel hyper-oxygen permeable
      contact lenses by studying its effects on human eyes. Usual and customary care will be given
      in the form of eyeglasses and/or contact lenses.

      The purpose of this research is to compare the on-eye performance of 12 month daily wear
      versus 6-night extended wear and 30-night extended wear of novel hyper-oxygen permeable
      contact lenses on bacterial binding to corneal cells and central epithelial thickness. Usual
      and customary care will be given in the form of eyeglasses and contact lenses. To compare
      long-term Daily wear vs. immediate Overnight wear (Extended wear) of a new hyper-oxygen
      permeable silicone hydrogel contact lens on binding of Pseudomonas Aeruginosa to exfoliated
      human surface corneal cells collected from the eyes of human patients and on central corneal
      thickness, as follows: 1) a hyper Dk/t lens for 12 months of daily wear, 2) a hyper Dk/t lens
      for 12 months of de novo 6 night extended wear, and 3) a hyper Dk/t lens for 12 months of de
      novo 30 night extended wear.

        Inclusion Criteria: The age requirement for this study is between 18-38 years old. The
        subject has to have nearsightedness in between -1.00D and -6.00D with regular astigmatism
        of an amount in both eyes that will not necessitate the need for toric lenses. No prior
        history of any lens wear within one month of entry into the contact lens phase of the
        study. Visual acuity of 20/30 or better during test lens wear. Normal anatomy and
        physiology of the eye. No eye cosmetic use on the day of study visits. Normal appearance of
        the cornea with slit lamp examination, stable tear film and sufficient tear production.
        Intraocular pressure less than or equal to 21 mmHg by Goldmann applanation. Absence of any
        intraocular inflammation. Normal appearance of optic nerve, macula and peripheral retina by
        direct fundus examination.

        Exclusion Criteria: Patients with chronic ocular conditions are excluded from the study
        (i.e. dry eye, recurrent corneal epithelial erosion). History of allergic eye disease
        either seasonal or associated with previous contact lens wear. Use of any topically applied
        ocular medication or systemic medication specifically including but not limited to,
        antihistamines, aspirin-related drugs, or psychoactive or anti-depressant medication. Oral
        contraceptives are allowed. Currently suspected or actual pregnancy. Study terminates if
        pregnancy occurs. Patients will not be enrolled if they are currently in another ophthalmic
        research project.
