      This research is being done to help us learn about how different factors related to treatment
      affect rheumatoid arthritis (RA). This is not a treatment study. We will follow the patient
      for one year as he or she receives usual treatment from his or her rheumatologist. Up to 360
      adults with RA may join this study.
