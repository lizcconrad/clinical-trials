  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Fibroblasts can be cultured from human skin biopsies using fetal bovine serum and artificial
      growth medium. Fibroblasts cultured in this way retain the genetic characteristics of their
      donor but can be used for experiments where study conditions are much more precisely
      controlled than they can be in in vivo studies. We plan to culture fibroblasts from Pima
      Indians for two purposes. Firstly, to look for an in vitro system to measure insulin
      resistance, the underlying abnormality in Pima diabetics. Secondly, to look for biochemical
      markers of diabetes or obesity in Pimas employing two dimensional electrophoresis techniques.

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:

        We will include Pima Indians who do not meet any of the exclusion criteria.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

        We will exclude any seriously ill individuals, any known to have a bleeding diathesis or to
        be immunosuppressed or subjects who are carriers of HIV or HBV.

        Children will be excluded, as the age range for this study's participants is 18-50.

        Pregnant women will be excluded on the basis of a urinary pregnancy test.

        All other subjects are potentially included.
