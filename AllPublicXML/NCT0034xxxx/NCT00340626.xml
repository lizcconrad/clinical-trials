  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In a collaborative effort with the IBN AL-NAFEES Hospital (Damascus, Syrian Arab Republic),
      individuals from multiplex families determined to have hereditary oral clefts will be
      studied. The purpose of this study is to identify the gene(s) involved in heritable oral
      clefts by linkage analysis and gene mapping strategies. Characterization of genes involved in
      inherited oral clefts could provide important insight into the inheritance and pathogenesis
      of this disease.

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:

        Enrollment in this study will be limited to individuals with non-syndromic unilateral or
        bilateral cleft lip with or without cleft palate and their unaffected relatives, from
        families which meet the following criteria:

          1. A cluster of 2 or more affected first degree relatives, such as a parent and two
             offspring or 2 siblings, or

          2. The occurrence of oral clefts in each of 2 generations in either the proband's
             paternal or maternal lineages.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

        Families with syndromic forms of oral clefts.

        Individuals unable to provide consent, except for cases who are children and mentally
        impaired persons with consenting parents or guardians.
