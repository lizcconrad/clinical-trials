  <brief_summary>

      24 week, single center, prospective, randomized, double-blind treatment study of valsartan
      (80 mg/bid, increased to 160 mg/bid) or placebo in addition to other general medical therapy
      in patients with persistent atrial fibrillation (AF) undergoing electrical cardioversion to
      restore normal sinus rhythm (SR).

      To evaluate the efficacy of valsartan, added to standard AF therapy, to maintain sinus rhythm
      and extend the interval to first AF recurrence after cardioversion.Evaluate the efficacy of
      valsartan, begun prior to cardioversion, on the difficulty (number and total energy of CV
      attempts), the net rate of cardioversion (to SR for &gt;10 minutes), and early AF recurrence
      rate (within 24 hours)

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  The patient (male or non-pregnant female) must be &gt;18 years of age

          -  Have ECG documented AF at the time of enrollment into the study

          -  Require (be scheduled for) electrical cardioversion

          -  Female patients of childbearing potential must have a documented negative pregnancy
             test during the index hospitalization.

          -  The patient or legally authorized representative willing to give written informed
             consent, prior to the procedure, using the ICF approved by the UCR Institutional
             Review Board. Surrogate consent must be given per CV Research SOP.

          -  Have a serum potassium level between 3.5 and 5.5 meq/L

          -  If diabetic, have a hemoglobin A1C level &lt;11%

          -  NYHA I-II can be enrolled if no hospitalizations for heart failure within 6 months or
             current, known EF&lt;40%.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  The patient is unable or unwilling to cooperate with the study follow-up procedures.

          -  Pregnant and/or lactating women, and women of child bearing potential not using
             acceptable means of contraception. Women of childbearing potential must be using
             adequate measures of contraception (as determined by the Investigator) to avoid
             pregnancy and should be highly unlikely to conceive during the study period. Women of
             childbearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test at screen.

          -  Participation in any other clinical trials involving investigational or marketed
             products within 30 days prior to entry in the study.

          -  Current diagnosis of angina pectoris (no events within a period of 3 months prior to
             Visit 1 (V1)

          -  History or current diagnosis of symptomatic heart failure (NYHA classes III-IV) or

          -  documented ejection fraction of &lt; 40 %. Myocardial Infarction within 3 months;
             coronary revascularization (PCI or CABG), unstable angina within 1 month of V1.

          -  Stroke, deep vein thrombosis (DVT), pulmonary embolism (PE) or transient ischemic
             attack (TIA) within 3 months of V1.

          -  Substance or alcohol abuse within 6 months of V1

          -  Known allergy to any of the drugs administered in the study (angiotensin receptor
             blocker (ARB) or an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (ACE-I), Valsartan,
             amiodarone, flecainide or propafenone)

          -  Any other contraindication listed in the labeling of warfarin or acenocoumarol.

          -  Patients treated with ARBs or ACE-I within 1 month of V-1

          -  Impaired renal function defined as a serum creatinine &gt; 2.5 mg/dL

          -  Evidence of hepatic disease evidenced by an AST or ALT value &gt; 2 times the upper limit
             of the institution's normal values.

          -  Significant non-cardiovascular illness or condition likely to result in severe
             incapacitation or death prior to study completion.
