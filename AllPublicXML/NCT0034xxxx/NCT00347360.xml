      This is a randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, parallel group trial employing 15 cells of
      a 4x4 factorial design (no placebo)to compare the hypertensive effects in patients with Stage
      1 and Stage 2 hypertension of carvedilol (20, 40 or 80 mg daily) alone, lisinopril (10, 20 or
      40 mg daily) alone, and all combinations of the doses.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject has given signed informed consent.

          -  Subject is male or female 18 years of age at the time informed consent is signed.

          -  At the Screening visit, subject has a documented history or current presentation with
             stage 1 or stage 2 hypertension (see Section 15.1, Appendix 1 and Section 15.4,
             Appendix 4) which meets one of the following criteria. Note: All blood pressures are
             mean sitting cuff pressures:

        Documented history of hypertension and receiving two antihypertensive medications with mean
        sDBP &lt;90 mmHg or for diabetic subjects (defined as having an established diagnosis of
        diabetes or receiving treatment for diabetes), mean sDBP &lt;80 mmHg. Subjects taking beta
        blockers, clonidine, or other antihypertensive medications where abrupt discontinuation
        would be of clinical concern must be tapered off the medication during the Washout/Placebo
        Run-in phase to avoid rebound hypertension. All subjects must be able to be safely
        withdrawn from all antihypertensive treatment during the Washout/Placebo Run-in phase.
        Subjects should not be enrolled if the investigator thinks it is likely the subject's mean
        sDBP will exceed 109 mmHg or their mean sSBP will exceed 180 mmHg during the
        Washout/Placebo Run-in phase (NOTE: A combination drug containing two antihypertensive
        agents represents two antihypertensive medications [e.g., Hyzaar is losartan potassium AND
        hydrochlorothiazide, therefore, counts as two antihypertensive medications].) OR Receiving
        one antihypertensive medication with mean sDBP =109 mmHg and can be safely withdrawn from
        all antihypertensive medication during the Washout/Placebo Run-in phase. Any subject who is
        receiving beta-blockers, clonidine, or other antihypertensive medications where abrupt
        discontinuation would be of clinical concern must have the dose tapered down during the
        Washout/Placebo Run-in phase to avoid rebound hypertension. All subjects must be able to be
        safely withdrawn from all antihypertensive treatment during the Washout/Placebo Run-in
        phase. Subjects should not be enrolled if the investigator thinks it is likely the
        subject's mean sDBP will exceed 109 mmHg or their mean sSBP will exceed 180 mmHg during the
        Washout/Placebo Run-in phase.

        (NOTE: A combination drug containing two antihypertensive agents represents two
        antihypertensive medications [e.g., Hyzaar is losartan potassium AND hydrochlorothiazide,
        therefore, counts as two antihypertensive medications].

        OR Untreated/newly diagnosed subjects: mean sDBP =95 and =109, or for diabetic subjects,
        mean sDBP =85 and =109 (see Section 15.1, Appendix 1). If newly diagnosed, must have
        qualifying blood pressure confirmed on two consecutive visits with the mean sDBP value not
        differing more than 8 mmHg. (Previously untreated subjects include subjects who have not
        been treated for hypertension in the last two months.).

          -  At Baseline:

        DAY BEFORE RANDOMIZATION: Prior to having the baseline ABPM equipment placed, subject has
        mean sitting cuff DBP that is ≥93 and ≤111 mmHg (or for diabetic subjects, ≥83 and ≤111
        mmHg). Subjects who were taking antihypertensive medication at Screening and do not meet
        this criterion after one week (or 5 half-lives, whichever is longer), can return in one
        week ±1day and have his/her blood pressure evaluated again for this inclusion criterion.

        AND

        RANDOMIZATON DAY: After completion of the ABPM assessment, subject meets the following ABPM
        (both 12 hr and 24 hr) criteria (see Section 15.1, Appendix 1):

          -  Mean 12-hour daytime (9 AM to 9 PM) DBP ≥90 and ≤109mmHg (or for diabetic subjects,
             ≥80 and ≤109mmHg)

          -  At least 75% of the programmed readings properly recorded over 24-hour monitoring
             period

          -  No more than two non-consecutive hours with less than two successful readings per hour
             while awake, and no more than two consecutive hours with less than one successful
             reading per hour during the sleep period over the 24-hour monitoring period

          -  At least two successful readings per hour for three of the last four hours of
             recording (trough period i.e., 20-24 hour during which subjects must be awake) with a
             total of at least 7 successful readings over this period.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject is taking ≥3 antihypertensive medications. (NOTE: A combination drug
             containing two antihypertensive agents represents two antihypertensive medications
             [e.g., Hyzaar is losartan potassium AND hydrochlorothiazide, therefore, counts as two
             antihypertensive medications].)

             severe emphysema or chronic bronchitis) requiring long term use of inhaled oral
             bronchodilator or steroid drug therapy; also subjects with a history of bronchospastic
             disease not undergoing active therapy in whom, in the investigator's opinion,
