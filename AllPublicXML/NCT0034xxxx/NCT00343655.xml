  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to evaluate the effect of 18 months treatment with atorvastatin
      80mg or atorvastatin 10mg on the carotid vessel plaque morphology, in particular, the effect
      on evident necrotic lipid rich core of the plaque in patients.

  <why_stopped>
    The study was terminated on June 22, 2007 for inability to enroll patients within an
    appropriate timeframe. There were no efficacy/safety concerns.
