    <textblock>
      The current study is designed to measure the corticosteroid-sparing effect of certolizumab
      pegol using a defined schedule of corticosteroid tapering in subjects with moderate to severe
      Crohn's disease. Subjects had to be in remission (CDAI&lt;=150) and receiving corticosteroids at
      a dose no higher than 30 mg/day prednisone or equivalent during the week prior to
      randomization.

    <description>The Crohn's Disease Activity Index (CDAI) is used to quantify the symptoms of subjects with Crohn's disease. A CDAI score of 150 or below indicates disease remission and a score above 450 indicates extremely severe disease.</description>

    <description>The Crohn's Disease Activity Index (CDAI) is used to quantify the symptoms of subjects with Crohn's disease. A CDAI score of 150 or below indicates disease remission and a score above 450 indicates extremely severe disease. A subject with continuous remission off steroids at Week 38 is a subject in remission (CDAI =&lt; 150) from the visit when he stops taking steroids to Week 38 and is off corticosteroids until Week 38.</description>

    <description>The run in period lasted a minimum of 1 week and a maximum of 6 weeks. During this period subjects were treated with any dose or type of systemic corticosteroids the Investigator felt was appropriate. To be eligible for study randomization, subjects must have been in remission (CDAI â‰¤150 points) and receiving corticosteroids at a dose no higher than 30 mg/day prednisone or equivalent during the week prior to randomization. Subjects who did not meet these criteria were not randomized and were withdrawn from the study.</description>

    <description>The Crohn's Disease Activity Index (CDAI) is used to quantify the symptoms of subjects with Crohn's disease.

During this period subjects were treated with any dose or type of systemic corticosteroids the Investigator felt was appropriate.

Subjects who did not meet these criteria were not randomized and were withdrawn from the study.</description>
