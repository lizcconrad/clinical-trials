      This study will: 1) test the effectiveness of a program to prevent the exposure of infants to
      environmental tobacco smoke; and 2) evaluate the health effects associated with prenatal and
      postpartum exposure to tobacco smoke products and environmental tobacco smoke among infants.

      African-American and Hispanic women who are 18 years of age or older, and who are between 28
      and 35 weeks pregnant may be eligible for this study. Participants complete an interview and
      home visit assessment and are then randomly assigned to participate in Program A or Program B
      of the study, as follows:

      Program A: Involves discussions with an Infant Health Advisor about parenting skills to
      promote child safety and infant growth and development, such as ways to prevent childhood
      injuries caused by falls, poisons, and other hazards.

      Program B: Involves discussions with an Infant Health Advisor about ways to prevent infant
      tobacco smoke exposure, such as how to adopt smoke-free household rules in the home and how
      to work with friends and family members to prevent the baby from being exposed to tobacco
      smoke. In addition, participants who smoked cigarettes before becoming pregnant or while
      pregnant are given advice on how to quit smoking and how to remain a non-smoker once the baby
      is born.

      Participants come to the clinic four times- once during a regularly scheduled prenatal visit
      and again when the baby is 6 weeks, 4 months, and 6 months old - to see the Infant Health
      Advisor for the activities described above in Program A or Program B. Between visits, the
      Advisor calls the participant to check on her progress regarding the program objectives. In
      addition, the study involves the following for all participants:

        -  Telephone interview during the week after joining the study to obtain information on
           participant's background, pregnancy and family history, tobacco use and exposure to
           other people's cigarette smoke during pregnancy, strategies to reduce tobacco use and
           exposure, stressful life events, drug and alcohol use during pregnancy, and sources of
           social support. Similar interviews are repeated when the baby is 6 weeks old, and again
           when the baby is 4 months, 6 months, and 12 months old.

        -  Home visit about 1 week after entering the study to check the home for possible safety
           hazards to the baby and to place one or more nicotine air monitors (small plastic
           objects that measure the amount of tobacco smoke in the air of each room). The home
           visitor returns a week late...

      ETS exposure is a major public health concern, and tobacco use is one of the 10 Healthy
      People 2010 leading health indicators. Despite the body of evidence showing the adverse
      effects of in-utero and postnatal exposure to tobacco smoke products (TSP) and environmental
      tobacco smoke (ETS) to the respiratory health in children, studies continue to be needed to
      elucidate when TSP exposure causes the greatest damage, possible mechanisms that underlie the
      damage, and how harm to the respiratory system of infants and vulnerable children can be
      prevented. and, while some efforts to reduce prenatal and childhood ETS exposure over the
      past decade have been successful, there is a paucity of randomized, controlled, intervention
      studies in the literature targeting ETS exposure reduction among infants age 0-12 months.
      Moreover, the effectiveness of ETS exposure prevention interventions in reducing the
      occurrence or severity of health symptoms and outcomes has rarely been systematically
      evaluated.
