  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the Lifestyle Intervention Study is to investigate the influence of a
      micronutrient supplement in combination with a comprehensive lifestyle intervention program
      on retinal amyloid, among patients with Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI). Patients will be
      placed on supplement or placebo throughout their 18-month study participation. Patients will
      also be given lifestyle training on nutrition, physical activity, cognitive and social
      activity, meditation and sleep, which have all been proven to positively affect cognition
      over time. Throughout their participation, patients' cognitive functioning will be monitored
      with comprehensive imaging, neuropsychological testing, blood testing and study compliance.

    <measure>Change in retinal amyloid burden, as measured by retinal amyloid scan.</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline and 18 months</time_frame>
    <description>Patients will be given a retinal scan at baseline, 6 months, 12 months and end of study (18 months). The retinal scanner is an device that measures the buildup of amyloid proteins in the brain via imaging of the eye. The change in amyloid buildup between each time point will be measured to determine effect of the interventions.</description>
