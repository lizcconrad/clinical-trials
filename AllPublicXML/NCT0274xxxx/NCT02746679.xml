      This is a parallel arm, randomized controlled trials, according to 1: 1 ratio assigned
      intrauterine adhesions patients to mindfulness based stress reduction group and wait-list
      control group.The study compared anxiety and depression levels and quality of life in
      patients with intrauterine adhesions before and after the completion of mindfulness based
      stress reduction program.Anxiety, depression and quality of life level measured by the Zung

    <time_frame>Baseline and 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The full name of the scale called Zung Self-Rating Anxiety Scale.The ZSAS contains 20 questions. Each question is scored on a scale of 1-4 (never, some of the time, relatively often, most of the time). Fifteen questions involve the assessment of increasing anxiety levels, and five questions involve decreasing anxiety levels.Each items points accumulated as raw scores,the lowest raw score is 20 points, the highest raw score is 80 points. The raw scores multiply by 1.25, taking the integer part as the standard scores.The ZSAS standard scores were used to define four categories of anxiety severity: within normal rangeor no significant psychopathology (25-49points);presence of mild to moderate anxiety levels (50-59points); severe anxiety levels (60-69points); and presence of extreme depression (70-100points).</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline and 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The full name of the scale called Zung Self-Rating Depression Scale.The ZSDS includes 10 positively worded items and 10 negatively worded items that assess symptoms of depression. Item responses are ranked from 1 to 4, and higher scores correspond to more frequent symptoms. For each item,patients give a score according to whether the item has occurred: 1 = never/very rarely; 2 = once in a while/some of the time/occasionally; 3 = relatively often/very often/often; 4 = most of the time/always. Each items points accumulated as raw scores,the lowest raw score is 20 points, the highest raw score is 80 points. The raw scores multiply by 1.25, taking the integer part as the standard scores.The ZSDS standard scores were used to define four categories of depression severity: within normal range or no significant psychopathology (below 51points); presence of minimal to mild depression (51-60points); presence of moderate to marked depression (61-70points).</description>

    <description>The 36-item Short-Form Health Survey (SF-36) is a commonly used generic questionnaire that includes 36 items clustered into eight dimensions (bodily pain, general health, mental health, physical functioning,role-emotional, role-physical, social functioning, and vitality). The item scores for each dimension are coded, summed and transformed to a scale from 0(worst possible health status) to 100 (best possible health status). Each raw scale score is linearly transformed to t scores. The transformed scores range from 0 to 100; higher scores indicate a better health-related QoL.</description>

        <title>The Zung Self-Rating Anxiety Scale Scores Before and After the Intervention</title>
        <description>The full name of the scale called Zung Self-Rating Anxiety Scale.The ZSAS contains 20 questions. Each question is scored on a scale of 1-4 (never, some of the time, relatively often, most of the time). Fifteen questions involve the assessment of increasing anxiety levels, and five questions involve decreasing anxiety levels.Each items points accumulated as raw scores,the lowest raw score is 20 points, the highest raw score is 80 points. The raw scores multiply by 1.25, taking the integer part as the standard scores.The ZSAS standard scores were used to define four categories of anxiety severity: within normal rangeor no significant psychopathology (25-49points);presence of mild to moderate anxiety levels (50-59points); severe anxiety levels (60-69points); and presence of extreme depression (70-100points).</description>

        <title>The Zung Self-Rating Depression Scale Scores Before and After the Intervention</title>
        <description>The full name of the scale called Zung Self-Rating Depression Scale.The ZSDS includes 10 positively worded items and 10 negatively worded items that assess symptoms of depression. Item responses are ranked from 1 to 4, and higher scores correspond to more frequent symptoms. For each item,patients give a score according to whether the item has occurred: 1 = never/very rarely; 2 = once in a while/some of the time/occasionally; 3 = relatively often/very often/often; 4 = most of the time/always. Each items points accumulated as raw scores,the lowest raw score is 20 points, the highest raw score is 80 points. The raw scores multiply by 1.25, taking the integer part as the standard scores.The ZSDS standard scores were used to define four categories of depression severity: within normal range or no significant psychopathology (below 51points); presence of minimal to mild depression (51-60points); presence of moderate to marked depression (61-70points).</description>

The item scores for each dimension are coded, summed and transformed to a scale from 0(worst possible health status) to 100 (best possible health status). Each raw scale score is linearly transformed to t scores. The transformed scores range from 0 to 100; higher scores indicate a better health-related QoL.</description>

        <title>The Scores of Vitality Before and After the Intervention(One Dimensions of the 36-item Short-form Health Survey)</title>
        <description>The 36-item Short-Form Health Survey (SF-36) is a commonly used generic questionnaire that includes 36 items clustered into eight dimensions (bodily pain, general health, mental health, physical functioning,role-emotional, role-physical, social functioning, and vitality). The item scores for each dimension are coded, summed and transformed to a scale from 0(worst possible health status) to 100 (best possible health status). Each raw scale score is linearly transformed to t scores. The transformed scores range from 0 to 100; higher scores indicate a better health-related QoL.</description>

        <title>The Scores of General Health Before and After the Intervention(One Dimensions of the 36-item Short-form Health Survey)</title>
        <description>The 36-item Short-Form Health Survey (SF-36) is a commonly used generic questionnaire that includes 36 items clustered into eight dimensions (bodily pain, general health, mental health, physical functioning,role-emotional, role-physical, social functioning, and vitality). The item scores for each dimension are coded, summed and transformed to a scale from 0(worst possible health status) to 100 (best possible health status). Each raw scale score is linearly transformed to t scores. The transformed scores range from 0 to 100; higher scores indicate a better health-related QoL.</description>
