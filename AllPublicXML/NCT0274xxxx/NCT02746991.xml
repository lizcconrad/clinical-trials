    <textblock>
      This is a phase 3, multi-center, randomized, masked, controlled study to evaluate the safety
      and efficacy of an injectable fluocinolone acetonide intravitreal (FAI) insert for the
      management of subjects with chronic non-infectious uveitis affecting the posterior segment of
      the eye. Patients will be randomized to receive either a sham injection or the FAI insert and
      will be observed for three years following treatment.
