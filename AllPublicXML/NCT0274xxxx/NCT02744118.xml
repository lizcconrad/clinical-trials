      This study adapts the Public Health Service (PHS) 5As model for use with adolescent marijuana
      users and pilot the intervention to test feasibility and acceptability in pediatric primary
      care settings. The specific aims are as follows:

      Aim 1: Develop a marijuana screening and brief counseling intervention for adolescents based
      on the Public Health Service 5As model and previously developed adolescent smoking cessation
      intervention.

      Hypothesis 1: The 5As model can be adapted for use as a marijuana screening and counseling
      intervention for adolescents.

      Aim 2: Test the feasibility and acceptability of the 5As marijuana screening and brief
      counseling intervention in pediatric primary care practice.

      Hypothesis 2a: Pediatric clinicians will find the 5As intervention feasible and acceptable
      for addressing marijuana use in routine clinical visits with adolescents and their families;
      and

      Hypothesis 2b: Adolescents will find the 5As intervention delivered by their clinicians to be
      acceptable in the context of routine preventive services delivery.

      The HEMPP study involves three phases: Researchers will (1) Develop a marijuana screening and
      brief counseling intervention for adolescents, based on expert input, current literature, and
      themes gathered from focus groups with adolescents and clinicians; (2) Pilot test the
      acceptability of the 5As marijuana intervention in 2 pediatric primary care practices, where
      researchers will test the intervention and determine acceptability via in-depth interviews
      with clinicians, office staff, adolescents and parents; and (3) Pilot test the feasibility of
      the 5As marijuana intervention in 8 practices (4 intervention/4 comparable control), wherein
      each practice will enroll 100 adolescents and conduct baseline/exit interviews with all of
      them. Twenty percent of adolescents/practice (including identified marijuana users) will
      complete one follow-up interview 3-6 weeks after their practice visit. These interviews will
      assess physician-delivery of the intervention and any change in use, attitude or behavioral
      intentions toward marijuana since their clinical visit. Findings will inform the development
      of a future large-scale trial of adolescent marijuana use, screening and cessation counseling
      in pediatric primary care. The long-term goal is to improve clinical preventive services for
      adolescent marijuana cessation. Conducting this work within the AAP PROS network will lead to
      rapid dissemination of effective interventions.

    <time_frame>Baseline (doctor's visit) and 3-6 weeks after doctor's visit</time_frame>
    <description>Via a baseline survey and a phone interview 3-6 weeks later, using the Timeline Followback Method (TLFB), adolescents will be asked to report their current marijuana-use status, and will explore whether receiving the intervention affects motivation, intentions to quit and reduce use, or change in marijuana-use habits. Marijuana use will be defined as smoking or ingestion of any part of the marijuana plant; categories include: ever user, past month (current) user; past week and daily user. Addiction measures will include: compulsive use, psychoactive effects and drug-reinforced behaviors.</description>

    <measure>Health and Behavioral Outcomes Related to Adolescent Marijuana Use</measure>
    <time_frame>3-6 weeks after initial doctor's visit</time_frame>
    <description>Via a baseline survey and a phone interview 3-6 weeks later, using validated mental health and behavioral measures previously developed for longitudinal studies of neurodevelopmental impact of mercury exposure (Myers, 1995), modified for the current intervention. Specific outcomes include: cognitive and social functioning, psychomotor performance,health service utilization, development of dependence, school performance, and alcohol and other drug use. Changes in health and behaviors from before the clinical intervention will help determine short-term impact of the intervention on outcomes.</description>
