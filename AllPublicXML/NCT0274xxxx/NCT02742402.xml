  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to evaluate whether patients with early equivocal appendicitis can be
      observed instead of immediate diagnostic imaging. Half of the patients are randomly assigned
      to observation group, while the other half will undergo diagnostic imaging. The hypothesis is
      that resolving appendicitis is common in these patients. Thus, in observation group there
      will be fewer patients with appendicitis diagnosis and observation reduces the use of
      diagnostic imaging and surgery.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      For the study equivocal appendicitis is defined as clinical suspicion of appendicitis with
      Adult Appendicitis Score between 11 and 15. The estimated prevalence of appendicitis in such
      patients is around 50%.

      Diagnostic imaging is done using conditional computed tomography i.e. abdominal ultrasound
      first and computed tomography only after negative or inconclusive appendicitis after
      ultrasound.

      In observation group repeated clinical examination is done after 6-8 hours interval with
      repeated blood test for calculation of Adult Appendicitis Score. Patients with decreasing
      score value continue observation without imaging, whereas patients with the same score value
      or higher (but below 16) undergo diagnostic imaging as in other group. Laparoscopy is done
      without imaging in patients with high score (16 or higher). Antibiotics are not allowed, but
      prophylactic antibiotics during induction of anesthesia are allowed.

    <description>Clinical follow-up for at least 6-8 hours, after follow-up repeated laboratory tests and repeated clinical examination is done. Adult Appendicitis Score is calculated after observation to determine further actions. Observation is continued in patients with decreasing score. Patients with the same or higher score undergo diagnostic imaging (score 11-15) or laparoscopy (score 16 or higher). Diagnostic imaging is abdominal ultrasound first and if the result is inconclusive or negative for appendicitis abdominal computed tomography is done. Laparoscopic appendectomy is done for those patients with appendicitis in diagnostic imaging.</description>
