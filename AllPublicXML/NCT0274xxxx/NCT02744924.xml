      To develop and implement a physical activity promotion intervention for older adults with or
      without chronic disease living in an urban environment.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The World Health organization recommends that all adults should aim for 30 minutes of
      moderate physical activity on at least five days of the week. The importance of physical
      activity for promoting heath is complicated when considering inactive older adults and
      chronic conditions. A problematic cycle emerges where physical inactivity increases the
      likelihood for developing chronic conditions, and, in turn, many chronic conditions are
      associated with symptoms that make physical activity more difficult.

      The investigators aim to develop and implement a physical activity promotion intervention for
      older adults with or without chronic disease living in an urban environment that considers
      individual, interpersonal and environmental factors and makes use of a citizen-science
      approach and modern PA-monitoring devices.

    <description>The intervention is comprised of 5 steps:
Goal setting: Over a step-counter (smartphone app) participants learn about their daily average step count. They are coached to set individual goals
Fitness assessment: To recommend suitable frequency and intensity of walking program using mapped trails
Structured walking groups: Promoted and communicated via app. Participants can additionally organize walking groups of their own.
Feedback: Participants will see individual and group data over the step-counter app, and they can communicate with others via a communication app. They will be incentivized to reach goals through a gamification approach.
Invite friends: After 12 weeks, participants are encouraged to invite people who fulfil the inclusion criteria to join the project</description>
