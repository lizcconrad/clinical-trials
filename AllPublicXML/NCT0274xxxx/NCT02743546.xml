  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether duvortuxizumab and ibrutinib can be
      combined safely and to establish the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) in Part 1 and the
      recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) and to further explore the safety of duvortuxizumab in
      combination with ibrutinib at the RP2D in participants with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma
      (DLBCL), follicular lymphoma (FL), mantle cell lymphoma (MCL), and chronic lymphocytic
      leukemia (CLL) in Part 2.

      This is an open-label (identity of study drug will be known to participant and study staff),
      multicenter (when more than one hospital or medical school team work on a medical research
      study), Phase 1b study. The purpose of this study is to see if duvortuxizumab in combination
      with ibrutinib is safe and useful for treating participants with B-cell malignancies. This
      study will be conducted in 2 parts: Part 1: Dose Optimization and Part 2: Dose Expansion.
      Part 1 will determine what dose of duvortuxizumab can be given safely with the standard dose
      of ibrutinib to participants with previously treated B-cell malignancies. Part 2 will look at
      how previously treated DLBCL, FL, MCL, and CLL participants respond to a safe dose of
      duvortuxizumab in combination with ibrutinib. Part 2 will also test whether the dose from
      Part 1 is an effective cancer therapy. The study consists of a Screening Phase, an ibrutinib
      Run-In Phase (Part 2 only), a combination (duvortuxizumab plus ibrutinib) Treatment Phase
      (Day 1, Cycle 1 and continues until the completion of the End-of-Treatment Visit),
      End-of-Treatment Visit (30 days (+7 days) after the last dose of study drug), and
      Post-treatment Follow-up Phase. The end of the study will be defined as 12 months after the
      last participant has received the first dose of study treatment. Participants' safety will be
      monitored throughout the study.
