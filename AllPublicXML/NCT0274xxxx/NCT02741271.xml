  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will compare the efficacy and safety of mometasone furoate/formoterol fumarate
      (MF/F) 100/10 mcg to mometasone furoate (MF) 100 mcg, both administered twice daily (BID) by
      metered-dose inhaler (MDI), in 5- to 11-year-old children with persistent asthma. This study
      will evaluate the change in forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) from baseline as a
      measure of pulmonary function

    <description>After a 2 week run-in period on open-label mometasone furoate (MF; MK 0887), administered by MDI, 100 mcg BID, a group of eligible participants will be assigned randomly to receive double-blinded mometasone furoate/formoterol fumarate (MF/F; MK-0887A) MDI 100/10 mcg BID for 24 weeks.
Participants may use study-provided short-acting beta agonist (albuterol/salbutamol), as needed (PRN) for the relief of asthma symptoms and/or may receive study-provided systemic corticosteroid (prednisone/prednisolone) for acute asthma worsening per investigator discretion.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Has a diagnosis of asthma of ≥ 6-months duration prior to study start

          -  Has asthma that is adequately controlled, according to the clinical judgment of the
             investigator, on a stable dose of inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) combined with
             long-acting beta-agonist (LABA) ≥ 4 weeks prior to study start

          -  Is able to demonstrate at screening, an FEV1 &gt;60% and ≤90% predicted

          -  Is able to demonstrate prior to randomization an increase in absolute FEV1 of at least
             12% within 30 minutes after administration of albuterol/salbutamol.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Requires &gt;8 inhalations per day of albuterol (100 mcg per actuation), and/or &gt;2
             nebulized treatments per day of 2.5 mg albuterol on any 2 consecutive days between the
             screening visit and the study start

          -  Has a clinical worsening of asthma between the screening visit and the study start,
             that results in emergency room visit (for an asthma exacerbation), hospitalization due
             to asthma, or treatment with additional, excluded asthma medication (other than SABA).

          -  Has experienced an upper or lower respiratory tract infection within the 4 weeks prior
             to screening

          -  Is considered by the investigator to have unstable asthma at the end of the run-in
             period

          -  Has had &gt; 4 asthma exacerbations (defined as a worsening of asthma requiring systemic
             corticosteroid use and/or ≥ 24-hour stay in an emergency department, urgent care
             center, or hospital) within 1 year of the screening visit

          -  Has had a history of life-threatening asthma, including an asthma episode that
             required intubation and/or was associated with an increase in carbon dioxide levels in
             the blood requiring non-invasive ventilator support
