      This study aimed to test the effects of a 12-month Healthy Beat Accupunch (HBA) exercise
      program on the perceived health status and sleep quality of the community-dwelling older
      adults.

      Phase I: A cluster randomized controlled trial was used to test the effects of a six-month,
      instructor-led Healthy Beat Accupunch (HBA) exercise program on the perceived health status
      and sleep quality of the community-dwelling older adults. Through the use of convenience
      sampling strategy, eight community care centers with 232 older adults in Kaohsiung were
      recruited and randomly assigned based on their community care centers to a HBA experimental
      group or a wait-list control group. Participants in the experimental group received the HBA
      exercise program led by trained and certified instructors, three times per week, 40 minutes
      per practice for six months; participants in the wait-list control group continued with their
      regular daily activities. One pre-test and two post-tests, three months apart, were
      conducted. Phase II: Using the same method as in the phase I, participants from the phase I
      continued practicing the HBA exercise program, but guided by a DVD, for another six months.
      The feasibility, compliance, and effectiveness of the DVD-led HBA exercise program on the
      community-dwelling older adults were tested, and another two post-tests, three months apart,
      were conducted on the same outcome measurements as in the phase I.

    <description>The HBA exercise program includes: 1) warm-up: 5 slow and gentle exercises to regulate qi, loosen up the body, and elevate the energy for a safe transition to the next phase, 2) accupunch: 14 low-to-medium speed exercises to punch the 14 meridians to enhance the cardiovascular-respiratory workout, and 3) relaxation: 5 low-speed, muscle relaxing exercises with deep breaths to sooth the body and mind. It is conducted 3 times per week and 40 minutes per practice.</description>
