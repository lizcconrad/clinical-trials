    <textblock>
      The program will provide early access to the investigational drug gilotrif in patients with
      advanced non-small cell lung cancer who have failed at least 6 months on erlotinib or
      gefitinib.

      The Compassionate Use Programme will also provide additional safety information on gilotrif
      use.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients with pathologically confirmed diagnosis of adenocarcinoma of the lung Stage
             IV with progressive disease following at least one line of platinum-based cytotoxic
             chemotherapy

          2. Patients progressing after clinical benefit on erlotinib or gefitinib: clinical
             benefit is defined as stable disease for at least 6 months, or a complete or partial
             response, or the presence of an activating mutation of the epidermal growth factor
             (EGF) receptor family.

          3. No further treatment option is available.

          4. Male and female patients age ≥18 years.

          5. Written informed consent that is consistent with International Conference on
             Harmonisation-Good Clinical Practice (ICH-GCP) guidelines and local law.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Significant or recent acute gastrointestinal disorders with diarrhoea as a major
             symptom.

          2. Patients who have any other life-threatening illness or organ system dysfunction,
             which in the opinion of the investigator, would compromise patient safety.

          3. History of cardiac disease that is clinically significant, as judged by the
             investigator or uncontrolled cardiac disease (including congestive heart failure,
             angina, myocardial infarction, arrhythmia, including New York Heart Association (NYHA)
             functional classification of 3).

          4. Aspartate amino transferase (AST) or alanine amino transferase (ALT) ≥ three times the
             upper limit of normal (if related to liver metastases ≥ five times the upper limit of
             normal).

          5. Bilirubin ≥1.5 mg/dl

          6. Serum creatinine ≥ 1.5 times of the upper normal limit or calculated/measured creatine
             clearance ≤ 45ml/min

          7. Women of child-bearing potential or men who are able to father a child unwilling to
             use a medically acceptable method of contraception during the treatment.

          8. Pregnancy or breast feeding.

          9. Pre-existing Interstitial Lung Disease (ILD).

         10. Patients suitable to be included into afatinib clinical trials
