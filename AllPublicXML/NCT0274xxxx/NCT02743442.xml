  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Over the past 30 years, endoscopic transnasal techniques have gained a major interest, and
      anatomic limits have been widened in order to extend neurosurgical applications. For many
      years, robotic-assisted surgery using the da Vinci system (Intuitive Surgical Inc, Sunnyvale,
      California, USA) has been greatly developed, especially in urology and gynecology.

      Robotic-assisted surgery has been performed for pharyngeal and laryngeal cancers in a
      minimally invasive perspective.

      A robot-assisted preliminary series demonstrated the ability to approach the sella via oral
      approach without traumatic injury of nasal or oral cavity. Transoral approach avoids the
      complications of the endonasal resection: synechia, rhinitis sicca anterior, primary and
      secondary atrophican rhinitis, and empty nose syndrome.

      The investigators recently published a cadaveric study of transoral robotic-assisted skull
      base surgery to approach the sella turcica (Neurosurgical Rev. 2014; 37:609-17).

      In this study, the investigators will propose a new minimally invasive technique of pituitary
      surgery by transoral approach assisted by the da Vinci robot in patients with pituitary
      adenoma.
