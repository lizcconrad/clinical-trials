  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Mexican American women have significantly elevated rates of obesity and type 2 diabetes. The
      proposed study tests a novel intervention that capitalizes on an existing important family
      dyad (mothers and their adult daughters) to foster clinically significant and long-lasting
      health behavior change. If found to effective, this intervention strategy has great potential
      to address health disparities in this, and other, at-risk populations.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Approximately half of Mexican-American women report having a sedentary lifestyle, and nearly
      78% are overweight or obese. Compared to women in all other ethnic groups, Mexican-American
      women have the highest lifetime risk of type 2 diabetes. The development of culturally
      appropriate lifestyle interventions for this population is an urgent priority, and the
      proposed study accordingly will investigate a novel dyadic intervention designed to improve
      health behaviors and promote weight loss in two at-risk members of the same family: mothers
      with type 2 diabetes and their overweight/obese adult daughters who are at risk for
      developing diabetes. The intervention, Unidas por la Vida (United for Life), capitalizes on
      the importance of the family in Latino culture to mobilize an existing family dyad as a
      source of mutual support that is likely to foster greater and longer-lasting health behavior
      change. The study builds on a successful pilot study (R34 DK083500) that established the
      feasibility and acceptability of this dyadic behavioral lifestyle intervention in a high-risk
      sample of Mexican-American family members who share a risk for diabetes and its
      complications. The 16-week intervention was modeled after the Diabetes Prevention Program
      (DPP), but was adapted for use with mother daughter pairs and to be community-based and,
      thus, more easily accessible to low-income Latinas. Preliminary data from the Unidas pilot
      study indicated that the dyadic intervention promoted significant weight loss. The proposed
      study extends the successful pilot study to: 1) target weight loss &gt; 5% of baseline body
      weight and to foster maintenance using a tapered intervention, 2) add comparison groups that
      permit evaluation of the improvement uniquely associated with the partner intervention, and
      3) assess theoretically derived mediators of the intervention. Participants (N=460
      mother-adult daughter dyads) will be randomized into one of three conditions: 1) dyadic
      (mother-daughter) participation in a Unidas partner intervention (Arm 1); 2) individual
      participation (mothers alone; unrelated daughters alone) in a Unidas individual intervention
      (Arm 2); and 3) mother-daughter dyad in a usual care only condition (Arm 3).

  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Longitudinal change in dietary intake</measure>
    <time_frame>6, 12, and 18 months</time_frame>
    <description>The study will examine whether changes in dietary intake are greatest among women in the partner intervention, compared to women in an individual intervention or in usual care, and to examine whether changes in dietary intake mediate the effects of the intervention on weight status and maintenance. Dietary intake will be measured with the Spanish version of the 2005 Block Food Frequency Questionnaire (FFQ). This instrument assesses portion sizes and frequency of consumption of over 100 food items, including foods selected for their cultural appropriateness for Mexican Americans to provide validated estimates of energy intake (total kilocalories) and macronutrient intake (including fat, carbohydrates and dietary fiber).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Longitudinal change in physical activity</measure>
    <time_frame>6, 12, and 18 months</time_frame>
    <description>The study will examine whether changes in physical activity are greatest among women in the partner intervention, compared to women in an individual intervention or in usual care, and to examine whether changes in physical activity mediate the effects of the intervention on weight status and maintenance. The 7-day physical activity recall (PAR) will be used to assess physical activity at each study time point. Participants will be asked to estimate the number of hours spent each day (starting with the current day and working backwards) in sleep and in moderate, hard, and very hard physical activities.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Longitudinal change in interpersonal processes</measure>
    <time_frame>6, 12, and 18 months</time_frame>
    <description>The study will examine whether changes in theoretically-derived mediating mechanisms, such as interpersonal processes, are greatest among women in the partner intervention, compared to women in the individual intervention or in usual care to examine whether changes in these processes mediate the effects of the intervention on dietary intake and in physical activity. Well-established methods of social network and social exchange assessment will be used to obtain detailed information about the involvement of participants' social network members in health-related social support, social control, and/or social undermining. Participants will be asked to identify social network members who have helped them make healthy lifestyle changes (social support), have prompted or urged them to do more to make such changes (social control), and/or have interfered (intentionally or unintentionally) with their efforts to make such changes (social undermining).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Longitudinal change in mother-daughter processes of mutual influence</measure>
    <time_frame>6, 12, and 18 months</time_frame>
    <description>The study will examine actor-partner interdependence models to explore group differences in mother-daughter processes of mutual influence across the study arms, with this mutual influence expected to be greater and more strongly related to the primary and secondary outcomes for women in the partner intervention, compared to women in the individual intervention or in usual care.</description>
