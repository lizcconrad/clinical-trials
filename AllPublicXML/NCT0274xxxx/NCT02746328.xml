        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. In screening for, and ultimately randomized into, protocol G200802

          2. Give voluntary, written and signed, informed consent for this add-on study

          3. Age 18 to 70 years old

          4. Physically capable of mounting and riding a stationary bicycle

          5. Subject agrees to not significantly alter physical activity or current physical
             training during the study period

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Subject has a concomitant medical condition that precludes adequate study treatment
             compliance or assessment, or increases subject risk, in the opinion of the
             Investigator

          2. Subjects unwilling to or unable to comply with the protocol

          3. Any other condition which per investigators' judgement may increase subject risk
