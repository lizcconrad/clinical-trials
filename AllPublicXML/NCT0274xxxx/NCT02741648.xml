      The purpose of this trial is to study the effect that anemia and Red Blood Cell (RBC)
      transfusions have on oxygen levels in the digestive tracts of Extremely Low Birth Weight
      (ELBW) infants and to look for possible markers in a baby's blood, urine and/or stool that
      may lead to a better understanding of what makes an ELBW infant at risk for digestive tract
      problems such as necrotizing enterocolitis.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Anemia and digestive tract complications are common problems in Extremely Low Birth Weight
      infants. Anemia is a condition in which the body does not have enough red blood cells (RBC).
      RBCs are important because they contain hemoglobin, the substance that carries oxygen
      throughout the body. Transfusions of RBCs in these infants is frequently required to correct
      the anemia. Oxygen levels in the digestive tract will be measured before, during and after
      each blood transfusion using a tissue oxygen monitor called Near Infrared Spectroscopy
      (NIRS). By using this technology, better understanding can be obtained of intestinal blood
      flow patterns.

      In addition, ELBW infants are more likely to have immature digestive systems and are at risk
      for digestive tract problems such as necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC). NEC is a disease
      characterized by infection and decreased blood flow to the intestines. NEC is a major cause
      of devastating illness and death in this vulnerable preterm population. Leftover blood
      samples, urine, stool, and breast milk samples will be collected, frozen, and stored. In the
      event a baby develops a digestive tract complication they will be studied in a laboratory to
      identify markers that indicate a healthy digestive tract versus illness.

Regional Oxygenation Saturation Levels (rSO2) are measured via the INVOS 5100C Cerebral/Somatic Oximeter by applying an adhesive sensor probe to the patient's periumbilical area for mesenteric monitoring. NIRS will be performed once per week (whether transfused or not) for a 48 hour period starting each Monday (day of routine lab draw to evaluate anemia).</description>

      Residual patient blood samples (obtained for routine clinical testing), urine, stool and
      breast milk will be collected, frozen and stored. If a baby develops a digestive tract
      complication, the stored specimens will be studied in the laboratory in an effort to identify
      markers of a healthy digestive tract versus illness.

      A sample of transfused RBCs will be obtained from the RBC unit at each RBC transfusion. If
      the baby develops a digestive tract complication the stored specimens will be studied in the
      laboratory to identify changes in the biochemical compounds of the transfused blood that may
      have taken place over time.
