      Indigenous youth are disproportionately represented in new HIV infection rates in Canada.
      Limited studies have evaluated longitudinal effects of arts-based approaches to HIV
      prevention with youth. The authors present a rationale and study protocol for an arts-based
      HIV and sexually transmitted infections (STI) prevention intervention with Northern and
      Indigenous youth in the Northwest Territories (NWT), Canada. This is a multi-centre
      non-randomised cohort pilot study using a pre-test/post-test design with a 12-month
      follow-up. The target population is Northern and Indigenous youth in eighteen communities in
      the NWT. The aim is to recruit 150 youth using venue-based sampling at secondary schools.
      Participants will be involved in an arts-based intervention, Fostering Open eXpression among
      Youth (FOXY). Participants will complete a pre-test, post-test survey directly following the
      intervention, and a 12-month follow up.

      Introduction: Indigenous youth are disproportionately represented in new HIV infection rates
      in Canada. Current and historical contexts of colonization and racism, disconnection from
      culture and land, as well as intergenerational trauma resulting from the legacy of
      residential schools are social drivers that elevate exposure to HIV among Indigenous peoples.
      Peer-education and arts-based interventions are increasingly used for HIV prevention with
      youth. Yet limited studies have evaluated longitudinal effects of arts-based approaches to
      HIV prevention with youth. The authors present a rationale and study protocol for an
      arts-based HIV prevention intervention with Northern and Indigenous youth in the Northwest
      Territories (NWT), Canada.

      Methods &amp; Analysis: This is a multi-centre non-randomised cohort pilot study using a
      pre-test/post-test design with a 12-month follow-up. The target population is Northern and
      Indigenous youth in eighteen communities in the NWT. The aim is to recruit 150 youth using
      venue-based sampling at secondary schools. Participants will be involved in an arts-based
      intervention, Fostering Open eXpression among Youth (FOXY). Participants will complete a
      pre-test, post-test survey directly following the intervention, and a 12-month follow up. The
      primary outcome is new or enhanced HIV knowledge, and secondary outcomes to include: new or
      enhanced STI knowledge, and increased self-esteem, resilience, empowerment, safer sex
      self-efficacy, and cultural connectedness. Mixed effects regression analyses will be
      conducted to evaluate pre- and post-test differences in outcome measurement scores.

      Ethics and Dissemination: This study has received approval from the HIV Research Ethics Board
      at the University of Toronto (REB: 31602).

    <description>This study will evaluate an arts-based HIV prevention program, Fostering Open eXpression among Youth (FOXY) in the NWT, Canada that works with Northern and Indigenous youth to promote sexual health and reduce exposure to HIV/STI. FOXY explores sexual health, HIV/STIs, sexuality and healthy relationships with young women in the NWT. The program's goal is to use arts-based methods and peers to facilitate education and foster more open expression and communication regarding sexual health and sexuality. FOXY uses arts-based approaches in program delivery; for example, drama techniques are used to facilitate discussion and learning about healthy relationships and making positive choices in realistic sexual scenarios.</description>
