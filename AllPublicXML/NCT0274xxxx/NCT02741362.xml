  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase I-II open- label single-dose study in subjects with significant refractory
      Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA), relapsing Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) or Sharp's Syndrome
      (SS).

      This study will enroll a minimum of 20 subjects for RA, 20 subjects for SLE and 20 patients
      for SS. 6 week data of serum Tumor Necrosis Factor- alpha (TNFa), Interleukin- 6 (IL-6), C-
      Reactive Protein (CRP), Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate (ESR), Cluster of Differentiation
      (CD)4 +CD25 + Forkhead box P3(Foxp3) + regulatory T cells, Disease Activity Score for 28
      joints (DAS-28) score and pain score will be collected in all patients who are enrolled in
      the study for the RA group (Baseline and 6 weeks after). For the SLE group, Transforming
      Growth Factor- beta (TGF-β), TNFa, IL-6, Interleukin- 17 (IL-17), CD3+CD8-IL17A+ T helper-17
      (Th17) cells, CD4+CD25+Foxp3+ regulatory T cells and the Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Quality
      of Life Questionnaire (SLEQoL) score will be collected in all the subjects of this group. SS
      group will undergo the assessments of RA and SLE. Prior to the stem cell treatment, the
      patient will be assessed for 6 weeks by all the previously mentioned markers. Then, patients
      will receive the infusion of stromal vascular fraction cells containing the adult adipose
      derived stem cells 'aADSC' (single intravenous dose). The disease- modifying anti-rheumatic
      drugs (DMARDs) or the standard SLE treatment will not be interrupted with the exception of
      systemic steroids (excluding minimal maintenance dose of one steroid) during the duration of
      the study. Follow up visits will take place at 6 weeks, 3 Months and 6 Months after the cell
      infusion. Safety will be monitored on an ongoing basis, and an interim safety review will be
      conducted by the Investigator(s) and Sponsor after the first 10 patients have been enrolled
      and treated in each group.
