    <textblock>
      Phonak Hearing Systems pass through different development and study stages. At an early
      stage, feasibility studies are conducted to investigate new algorithms, features and
      functions in an isolated manner.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Speech intelligibility in percent in a quiet listening situation</measure>
    <time_frame>One week</time_frame>
    <description>The data, serving as primary outcomes are collected in a series of lab appointments. The speech intelligibility in quiet will be assessed with the aid of the german rhyme test &quot;Einsilber-Reimtest nach von Wallenberg und Kollmeier&quot; (WaKo). The result is the speech intelligibility in percent. Descriptive statistics will be executed in the form of determining the median and quartiles. Interference statistics will be executed by applying the appropriate parametric or non-parametric test, depending on the data's distribution. A significance level of 5% is pursued.</description>

    <measure>Speech intelligibility in percent in a noisy listening situation</measure>
    <time_frame>One week</time_frame>
    <description>The data, serving as secondary outcomes are collected in a series of lab appointments. The speech intelligibility in noise will be assessed with the aid of the german rhyme test &quot;Einsilber-Reimtest nach von Wallenberg und Kollmeier&quot; (WaKo). The result is the speech intelligibility in percent. Descriptive statistics will be executed in the form of determining the median and quartiles. Interference statistics will be executed by applying the appropriate parametric or non-parametric test, depending on the data's distribution. A significance level of 5% is pursued.</description>

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Initial first fit acceptance (pre-calulation) in lab</measure>
    <time_frame>One week</time_frame>
    <description>The data, serving other pre-specified outcomes are collected within the first lab appointment. The acceptance of the initial first fit will be assessed with the aid of quantitative questions within an interview. The results are points on a scale and open ended (e.g. Question: Please rate the sound quality; Answer scale: bad, poor, fair, good, excellent) . Descriptive statistics will be executed in the form of determining number of answers. Interference statistics will be executed by applying the appropriate parametric or non-parametric test, depending on the data's distribution. A significance level of 5% is pursued.</description>

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Sound quality and listening effort ratings in lab</measure>
    <time_frame>Four weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The data, serving other pre-specified outcomes are collected within the lab appointments. The sound quality and listening effort ratings will be assessed with the aid of the Multi-Stimulus Test with Hidden Reference and Anchor (MUSHRA). The results are quantitative sound quality and listening effort ratings. Descriptive statistics will be executed in the form of determining the median and quartiles. Interference statistics will be executed by applying the appropriate parametric or non-parametric test, depending on the data's distribution. A significance level of 5% is pursued.</description>
