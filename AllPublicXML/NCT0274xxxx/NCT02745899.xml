  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      the investigators hypothesis is that milk consumption, either in the acute phase and through
      prolonged exposure, does not cause or increase respiratory symptoms or airway inflammation.
      the investigators aim to objectively prove this by examining respiratory symptoms and signs
      and objectively measuring parameters of airway inflammation and hyper responsiveness after
      consumption of cow milk or soy milk substitute.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this prospective single blinded placebo controlled trial, acute milk consumption will be
      evaluated. 50 asthmatic and 50 healthy children aged 6-18 will drink 240 ml of cow milk or
      soy milk substitute. Respiratory symptoms by questionnaire and physical examination will be
      evaluated. Airway response and inflammation will be assessed by fraction of exhaled Nitric
      Oxide (FENO) and spirometry before and after the exposure.

    <measure>Fraction of exhaled Nitric Oxide (FeNO)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>single breath method: This test measures the concentration of NO in the exhaled air. In this method the patient takes a deep breath from the filter device and exhales the air at a constant rate of 50 mL / min for 12 seconds. The results of each test will be the average value of three tests.
General measurement: overall system to be measured FENO device Denox 88 (ECO Medics AG, Switzerland), and nitric oxide 88 CLD analyzer which was approved for use by the FDA's medical device approval if the Ministry of Health. The values are in parts per billion (Ppb).
children aged 5-6 years are able to perform this test.
FENO values:
Low FENO: 0-5 ppb in Children Normal FENO: 5-20 ppb in children Mild elevated FENO:20-30 ppb in children High FENO: 30-70 ppb in Children Severe FENO: &gt;70 ppb in Children</description>
