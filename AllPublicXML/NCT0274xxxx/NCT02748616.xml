  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In vitro findings have established that ursodeoxycholic acid is a surrogate for deoxycholic
      acid in preventing the growth of C. difficile, and interrupting recurrence. Investigators
      will administer ursodeoxycholic acid for two months, beginning with Metronidazole and/or
      Vancomycin (8 to 10 days), antibiotics currently used for the treatment of acute C.Difficile
      infection. Ursodeoxycholic acid prevents c.difficile recurrence by (a) directly suppressing
      the growth of C. Difficile and (b) permitting restoration of normal fecal bile acid
      composition (80% deoxycholic acid) to maintain growth suppression.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The non-investigational reference therapies, Metronidazole, Vancomycin and fidaxomicin , are
      FDA-approved antibiotics currently in use today because of their effectiveness in suppressing
      the growth of C. difficile and therefore quickly eliminating the colitis and diarrhea.
      However, they do not promote the restoration of the normal bacterial flora. Therefore, when
      medication is stopped, the C. difficile colitis returns. In vitro findings have established
      that ursodeoxycholic acid is a surrogate for deoxycholic acid in preventing the growth of C.
      difficile, and interrupting recurrence.
