      To assess the efficacy of the herbal medicinal product Sinupret extract versus placebo in the
      treatment of chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) in adults.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the present double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, randomized, phase
      III clinical trial is to assess the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of Sinupret extract (3
      x 160 mg = 480 mg daily) taken for up to 16-weeks compared with placebo in the treatment of
      chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) in adults. In addition, in an exploratory approach to identify
      potential pharmacological modes of action underlying the expected treatment benefit, the
      anti-inflammatory activity of Sinupret extract will be assessed in a subset of CRS patients.

          1. Signed informed consent (IC) including data protection declaration

          2. Male and female outpatients aged ≥18 and ≤75 years

             Women will be considered for inclusion if they are not pregnant (as confirmed by urine

             (have had a documented bilateral oophorectomy and/or hysterectomy) or if menopause is
             ensured (at least 12 months without menstrual bleeding). Women of childbearing
             potential must use a highly effective (failure rate less than 1% per year, i.e. Pearl
             Index &lt;1) method of contraception 2 weeks prior to trial inclusion and during the
             screening/treatment period of the clinical trial (e.g. vasectomized partner, sexual
             abstinence - the lifestyle of the female has to be such that there is complete
             abstinence from intercourse from 2 weeks prior to the first dose of trial medication
             until at least 72 hours after treatment - implants, injectables, combined oral
             contraceptives, or hormonal intrauterine devices).

          3. Diagnosis of bilateral CRS without nasal polyps confirmed by:

               -  Nasal endoscopy during the screening phase to confirm inflammation, mucopurulent
                  discharge, and/or edema/mucosal obstruction primarily in middle meatus without
                  nasal polyps being present

               -  At the discretion of the investigator, results from a historic imaging
                  diagnostic, i.e. computer tomography (CT), digital volume tomography (DVT), or
                  magnetic resonance tomography (MRT) (before screening and not older than 24
                  months, not taken during acute exacerbation), which will be considered
                  additionally for confirmation of bilateral involvement of middle meatus and
                  paranasal sinuses without resolution of symptoms (mucosal changes within the
                  ostiomeatal complex and/or sinuses)

          4. Bilateral CRS characterized by:

               -  Presence of CRS symptoms for &gt;52 weeks prior to enrolment (V1) as documented in
                  the medical file of the patient

               -  Major Symptom Score (MSS) ≥10 at V1 and V2 as assessed by the investigator (MSS
                  INV), and rhinorrhea (anterior or posterior) and pain (facial pain or headache)
                  each of at least moderate intensity (score ≥2)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Sinus surgery within the last 2 years (solitary sinus puncture is allowed)

          2. Inferior turbinate reduction (by surgery or other methods) within the last 3 months

          3. Presence or history of uni- or bilateral nasal polyps

          4. Moderate to severe co-morbid asthma, including allergic asthma

          5. Cystic fibrosis

          6. Perennial (e.g. patients with clinical symptoms of allergic rhinitis against house
             dust/mite antigen) or seasonal allergic rhinitis

          7. Rhinitis medicamentosa (drug induced rhinitis)

          8. Aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease (aspirin sensitivity)

          9. Dentogenic sinusitis or otherwise unilateral sinusitis

         10. Presence of anatomical deviations of the nasal septum that significantly impair nasal
             and paranasal ventilation/airflow

         11. Known hypersensitivity to trial medication or excipients

         12. Rare hereditary problems of fructose intolerance, galactose intolerance, lactase
             deficiency, glucose-galactose malabsorption, or sucrase- isomaltase insufficiency

             complications, severe unilateral frontal headache, or toothache)

         14. Treatment with antihistamines within 4 weeks prior to V1

         15. Treatment with 2-3.5% hypertonic saline solution within 2 weeks prior to V1

         16. Treatment with systemic or nasal antibiotics or corticosteroids within 4 weeks prior
             to V1

         17. Treatment with decongestant preparations (α-sympathomimetics), analgesics (including
             systemic non-steroidal inflammatory drugs [NSAIDs], including paracetamol),
             mucolytics/secretolytics, or alternative medicine preparations for treatment of common
             cold-like symptoms or with immunomodulating properties within 7 days prior to V1

         18. Peptic ulcer

         19. Gastritis

         20. Other diseases within 5 years prior to V1 that, in the opinion of the investigator,
             disqualifies the patient for trial enrolment (e.g. liver or kidney disease, severe
             somatopathic, neurological and/or psychiatric diseases, history of malignancy, alcohol
             or drug abuse, or immunodeficiency)

         21. Parallel participation in another clinical trial, participation in a different trial
             within less than 6 weeks prior to trial entry, or previous randomization into this
             clinical trial

         22. Known to be, or suspected of being unable to comply with the clinical trial protocol
             (CTP) that in the opinion of the investigator disqualifies the patient for trial
             enrolment (e.g. no permanent address, known to be non-compliant, or presenting an
             unstable psychiatric history)

         23. Legal incapacity and/or other circumstances rendering the patient unable to understand
             the nature, scope, and possible impact of the clinical trial
