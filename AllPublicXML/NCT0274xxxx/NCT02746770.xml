      Spanish population with unilateral peripheral vestibular disorders.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Participants with peripheral vestibular disorders will be allocated to a Cawthorne and
      Cooksey exercises protocol or control group. The Cawthorne and Cooksey exercises consist in
      some head mobilization and positioning tasks which are related with a restoration of
      vestibular disorders.

    <measure>Activities-specific Balance Confidence scale (ABC)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and after 6 weeks of intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Activities-specific Balance Confidence scale (ABC), to quantify the level of confidence in performing a specific task without losing balance or becoming unsteady. This scale is applied to assess the change due to intervention between the baseline and 6 weeks of treatment. So the data will be collected at baseline and after 6 weeks of treatment.</description>

    <description>UCLA Dizziness Questionnaire (UCLA-DQ), used to measure the severity and frequency of dizziness and its impact on quality of life. This questionnaire is applied to assess the change due to intervention between the baseline and 6 weeks of treatment. So the data will be collected at baseline and after 6 weeks of treatment.</description>
