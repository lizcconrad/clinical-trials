      Background: Previous animal model studies at the University of Pittsburgh have shown a
      significant impact on inhibiting bladder over activity and increasing bladder capacity with
      neuromodulation techniques, specifically tibial nerve stimulation. This has been translated
      into adult clinical trials through the department of urology. Through the use of a
      commercially available subcutaneous nerve stimulator placed on the dorsum of the foot,
      researchers were able to demonstrate a significant increase in bladder capacity and the delay
      of voiding sensation for up to 5 hours after stimulation in eight healthy subjects. This
      prompted the clinical trial approved under IRB PRO13020474 which is currently enrolling
      patients.

      The incidence of night-time overactive bladder leading to nocturnal enuresis (bed wetting) is
      very common in the pediatric and teenage population, particularly in patients without daytime
      bladder over activity symptoms. When behavioral modification (i.e. refraining from night-time
      fluid consumption and bladder irritants, and bed wetting alarms for timed voiding) fails
      which it often does there is a paucity of effective and safe treatment options. Medications
      can be tried, but generally these are from the tricyclic antidepressant family and carry
      significant side effects limiting the use.

      Aim: Researchers aim to utilize the same technology currently being studied under IRB
      PRO14080250. Electrical stimulation will be applied to the foot via skin surface electrodes
      for a minimum of 1 hour before bed for 2 weeks to 5 normal subjects. Normal Subjects will be
      asked to complete a questionnaire about any skin irritation or experiences of toe twitching
      while wearing the newly designed TENS device, during a return visit with Dr. Stephany. The
      primary outcomes of this study are safety and functionality of the New TENS unit

      Nocturnal Enuresis is a very common and difficult to treat problem in the pediatric
      population which can have significant negative impact on a child's quality of life. Apart
      from medications which can have significant side effects limiting the use, there is a lack of
      effective and safe treatment options for children with frequent nocturnal enuresis. If foot
      stimulation prior to bed does indeed improve the frequency of nocturnal enuresis, it may
      provide a safe and non-invasive therapeutic option.

      To achieve the aims Dr. Tai will work closely with Dr. Sun and Dr. Jia to design and develop
      a small, inexpensive, and easy-to-use stimulator for foot neuromodulation, and test its
      safety and usability in 5 healthy subjects for a 2-week period. . The straps in the design
      have three functions: 1) making an electrical connection to electrode, 2) securing the insole
      and the electronic unit, and 3) facilitating observation and hand access to the top panel for
      adjusting the stimulation strength.

    <intervention_name>NewTENS Design</intervention_name>
    <description>This device functions the same as the FDA approved TENS unit, but provides a small, inexpensive unit that will be easy for a child to use. The stimulation characteristics include a continuous frequency of 5 Hz, pulsewidth 0.2 ms, and intensity 2-4 times the threshold voltage required for inducing toe twitching - or the intensity that the subject feels comfortable with. The subjects will also be instructed how to use the stimulator and where to attach the electrodes on the foot at the beginning of the study. The investigator will provide the stimulator and electrodes. The subjects will be asked to wear socks to prevent the electrodes from detachment and to stop the stimulation during walking or in any non-resting situation. Subjects will be asked to use the stimulator for a MINIMUM of 60 minutes in the evening prior to bedtime at home for two weeks. They will be encouraged to use the stimulator for more time than the minimum as long as they accurately record the total duration.</description>
