      The drug being tested in this study is called TAK-041. TAK-041 is being tested to evaluate
      its safety, tolerability, and PK of single and multiple doses in healthy participants.

      The study will enroll approximately 72 participants. The study is composed of 2 parts. Part 1
      (single-rising dose [SRD], alternating panel design) and Part 2 (multiple-rising dose [MRD],
      sequential panel design). Part 1 consists of 5 cohorts, participants in Cohorts 1 and 2 will
      be randomly assigned (by chance, like flipping a coin) to treatment sequences of 2 periods
      and for Cohorts 3 to 5 participants will be assigned to a single dose sequential-panel:

        -  TAK-041 5-160 mg

        -  Placebo (inactive) - this is a similar formulation that looks like the study drug but
           has no active ingredient.

      Part 2 consists of 4 cohorts, participants will be randomly assigned to one of the two
      treatments. Dose levels for Part 2 cohort 1 will be based on emerging safety/tolerability and
      PK data from Part 1. The dose levels for Part 2 Cohorts 2 onwards will be based on emerging
      safety/tolerability and available PK data from Part 1 and from preceding cohorts in Part 2.

        -  TAK-041

        -  Placebo This single center trial will be conducted in the United States. Participants
           will remain confined to the study site from check-in (Day -1) through Days 5 of each
           period in Part 1 and on Day -2 to 3, Day 7 to 10, Day 14 to 17 and Day 21 to 24 in Part
           2. For subjects from Part 2 Cohorts 1 to 4, a final visit that completes the study will
           occur 12 to 16 days after the last safety and PK follow-up visit.
