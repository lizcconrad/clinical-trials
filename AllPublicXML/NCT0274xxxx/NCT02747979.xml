  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A prospective, randomized, controlled open clinic trial to evaluate the effect and safety of
      combination of conventional hemodialysis(HD) and hemoperfusion(HP) on middle molecules
      removal and complications improvement in long-term maintenance hemodialysis (MHD) patients.

      There are two phases of study for each subject. Phase 1 (screening phase). During this phase,
      each potential subject will be evaluated to determine if he/she is eligible for the study.

      Phase 2 (intervention phase). Each subject will be randomly allocated to HD+HP(HA130 once per
      week) group ,HD+HP(HA330 once per week) group and HD group. The follow-up duration was 3
      months.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All patients recruited from these centers who met the inclusion criteria were randomly
      allocated to HD+HP(HA130 once per week) group ,HD+HP(HA330 once per week) group and HD group.
      The follow-up duration was 3 months.

      Hemoperfusion is performed by HA130 or HA330 resin adsorbents. Blood flow is
      200ml/min，dialysate flow is 500ml/min， hemodialysis and hemoperfusion last for 2.5h，continue
      HD after removing the adsorbent to complete 4 hours'treatment.Heparin for anticoagulation
      ：first pulse 0.5-1mg/kg ，appending 8-10mg/h. Primary endpoint is the improvement of the
      clinic symptoms, meanwhile secondary endpoint is serum β2MG、iPTH、CRP、ADMA、BMP2 decrease
      compared with the baseline, life quality, nutrition condition, and cardiovascular (CVD)
      incidence.
