  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The metabolic effects of 7-day weight-maintenance diets containing 10% total energy as acacia
      honey or a fructose:glucose mixture will be assessed in a group of healthy male volunteers.
      Primary outcome is plasma total triglyceride concentrations after ingestion of standardized
      breakfast and lunch containing 25% energy as honey or fructose:glucose mixture; secondary
      outcome is glucose tolerance and suppression of endogenous glucose production after ingestion
      of 75 g glucose. Results obtained with 10% honey and 10% fructose: glucose mixture diets will
      be compared to results obtained with a weight-maintenance, isocaloric diet in which starch is
      substituted for honey or fructose:glucose mixture

      Eight health males volunteers will be studied three times in a randomized order

        -  Honey: volunteers will be fed a weight-maintenance diet containg 5% sugars, 20% starch,
           25% acacia honey, 35% fat and 15% protein during 6 days (day 1-6); On day 7, their
           plasma metabolites and hormones concentrations will be monitored over 10 hours during
           which they will receive a breakfast and a lunch containing honey; on day 8, they will
           have a 75g oral glucose4 + 375 mg 13C-labelled glucose tolerance test, and their plasma
           glucose and insulin concentrations will be monitored over 4 hours; glucose kinetics will
           be measured by 6,6 deuterated glucose

        -  FG: volunteers will be fed a weight-maintenance diet containg 5% sugars, 20% starch, and
           25% of a fructose:glucose mixture matching the composition of acacia honey, 35% fat and
           15% protein during 6 days (day 1-6); On day 7, their plasma metabolites and hormones
           concentrations will be monitored over 10 hours during which they will receive a
           breakfast and a lunch containing fructose and glucose; on day 8, they will have a 75g
           oral glucose + 375 mg 13C-labelled glucose tolerance test, and their plasma glucose and
           insulin concentrations will be monitored over 4 hours; glucose kinetics will be measured
           by 6,6 deuterated glucose

        -  Control: volunteers will be fed a weight-maintenance diet containg 5% sugars, 45%
           starch, 35% fat and 15% protein during 6 days (day 1-6); On day 7, their plasma
           metabolites and hormones concentrations will be monitored over 10 hours during which
           they will receive a breakfast and a lunch with no added sugar; on day 8, they will have
           a 75g oral glucose + 375 mg 13C-labelled glucose tolerance test, and their plasma
           glucose and insulin concentrations will be monitored over 4 hours; glucose kinetics will
           be measured by 6,6 deuterated glucose
