  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Research has shown that increasing the dose of radiotherapy improves outcomes in patients
      with lung and head and neck cancers. This study aims to see whether this is also the case for
      patients with tumour of the oesophagus. This trial will compare the effects of the standard
      dose of radiotherapy to a higher dose whilst closely monitoring the side effects.

      A comparison will also be made regarding the effects of the standard drugs used in
      chemotherapy (cisplatin and capecitabine) with an alternative combination (carboplatin and
      paclitaxel) in patients that do not show a response to chemotherapy with standard drugs early
      on in treatment.

      All patients will receive 6 weeks of chemotherapy and 5 weeks of chemoradiotherapy.

      How the study will be conducted:

      Prior to the commencement of treatment each patient will have a special scan called a PET
      scan. Patients will receive a second PET scan two weeks after the start of standard
      chemotherapy. The changes between the two scans will then be used to allocate treatment into
      the different arms of the study. All study subjects will be randomised to receive either the
      standard radiotherapy dose or the high radiotherapy dose. The participants that do not
      respond to the first cycle of standard chemotherapy will be eligible to take part in the
      aspect of the trial looking at an alternative chemotherapy regimen. Patients will be
      randomised as follows;

      On the basis of the second PET scan, patients who are not responding to standard chemotherapy
      will be allocated by a computer to one of the four groups detailed below:

        -  Standard chemotherapy and standard dose of radiotherapy

        -  Standard chemotherapy and higher dose of radiotherapy

        -  Alternative chemotherapy and standard dose of radiotherapy

        -  Alternative chemotherapy and higher dose of radiotherapy

      Patients who are responding to standard chemotherapy (or where the response is unknown or
      those who were not eligible for PET scan portion of the study) will be allocated by a
      computer to one of two groups detailed below:

        -  Standard chemotherapy and standard dose of radiotherapy

        -  Standard chemotherapy and higher dose of radiotherapy

      The arms within each of the groups above (responders and non-responders) will be equal in
      size and patients will be allocated randomly by a computer.

      This study will also compare the way that this treatment affects the two different cell types
      found in oesophageal tumours.

      The effects of the different treatment, together with the costs of the different treatment
      and the effects on quality of life will be analysed to see which is more effective for each
      of the different groups.

         16. Not responding to early cis/cape chemotherapy (this is defined as patients having a
             &lt;35% reduction in SUVmax)

         17. For diabetics, fasting Blood glucose ≤12 mmol/L. Please refer to the PET Imaging
             guidance document for further details.

         18. To be eligible for PET randomisation, the baseline PET-CT must have been within 4
             weeks prior to start date of treatment.

        Patients that are eligible for the trial but are ineligible for PET randomisation will be
        randomised to receive 50/60Gy radiotherapy plus cisplatin and capecitabine.

        * Patients where the EUS scope is unable to pass are eligible.

        Main exclusion criteria:

          1. Patients who have had previous treatment for invasive oesophageal carcinoma or
             gastro-oesophageal junction carcinoma (not including PDT or laser therapy for high
             grade dysplasia/carcinoma in-situ).

          2. Patients with metastatic disease i.e. M1a or M1b according to UICC TNM version 7.

          3. Patients with other active malignancy or past malignancy in remission for less than 3
             years are not eligible for the trial. However, patients with the following conditions
             which have been curatively treated will NOT be excluded: basal cell carcinoma,
             carcinoma-in-situ breast and carcinoma-in-situ cervix.

          4. Patients with &gt;2cm mucosal extension of tumour into the stomach or where the superior
             extent is proximal to 15 cm ab oral.

          5. Patients with unstable angina or uncontrolled hypertension or cardiac failure or other
             clinically significant cardiac disease.

          6. Patients who need continued treatment with a contraindicated concomitant medication or
             therapy.

          7. Patients with known dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPD) deficiency.

          8. Patients with hearing impairment or sensory-motor neuropathy of WHO grade ≥2.

          9. Patients with serious infections (e.g. Herpes zoster, chickenpox).

         10. Known hypersensitivity to IMPs.

         11. Women who are pregnant or breastfeeding.

         12. Oesophageal stent (patients requiring a PEG/RIG/feeding jejunostomy for nutritional
             purposes are eligible).

         13. Any other situation, which in the opinion of the local PI, makes the patient an
             unsuitable candidate for this trial (eg with profusely bleeding tumours where the PI
             has concerns about randomisation to paclitaxel/carboplatin arm where there is risk of
             aggravation of bleeding due to higher risk of thrombocytopenia).
