      analgesia.

      The current study included three phases to investigate oxytocin effect on placebo analgesia:

        1. In a double-blind, between-subject, placebo controlled design study to investigate the
           intranasal OXT (24IU) treatment in 66 healthy male subjects using working memory task.

        2. In a single-blind(subjects were informed that the treatment was oxytocin),
           between-subject, placebo controlled design study to investigate the intranasal OXT
           (24IU) treatment in 53 healthy male subjects using working memory task.They were
           informed that oxytocin would increase memory perfomance by a female experimenter.

        3. In a single-blind(subjects were informed that the treatment was oxytocin),
           between-subject, placebo controlled design study to investigate the intranasal OXT
           (24IU) treatment in 53 healthy male subjects using working memory task. But the subjects
           were told that oxytocin would decrease the performance by the same female experimenter.

        4. In a single-blind(subjects were informed that the treatment was oxytocin),
           between-subject, placebo controlled design study to investigate the intranasal OXT
           (24IU) treatment in 52 healthy male subjects using working memory task. The subjects
           were told that oxytocin would increase the performance by a male experimenter.

      Memory performance was included as dependant factor. All subjects completed a range of
      questionnaires measuring personality and affective traits and levels of anxiety: Positive and
      Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS), State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI), Beck Depression
      Inventory (BDI), Cheek and Buss shyness Scale (CBSS), Autism Spectrum Quotient (ASQ), Empathy
      Quotient(EQ),Behavioral Inhibitionactivation System Scale(BASBIS) and Raven Standard
      Progressive Matrices Test (SPM).
