      This is a feasibility and exploratory study consisting of two parts: first, a cross-sectional
      (one-time) biomarker measurement comparing BDNF-TrkB (Brain-derived neurotrophic factor
      (BDNF) and its receptor, TrkB,) signaling and cortical plasticity in patients diagnosed with
      Parkinson's Disease (PD) vs. healthy controls matched by age. Second, a prospective,
      randomized, double blind trial of Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) MAGSTIM Rapid2
      Therapy System (TMS) (real or Sham) and aerobic exercise. This exploratory feasibility study
      will look at BDNF-TrkB signaling and cortical plasticity.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Twenty-four PD patients (n=24) will be randomly assigned to receive one of two interventions
      for a duration of two weeks. In Group 1, subjects will participate in daily sessions of
      sham-rTMS followed by supervised aerobic exercise (Sham rTMS+Aerobic); in Group 2, subjects
      will participate in a combination of rTMS and supervised aerobic exercise (Real
      rTMS+Aerobic). Serum BDNF-TrkB signaling in lymphocytes and TMS-based electrophysiological
      measures of LTP-like plasticity will be measured. A comparison of such measures in a group of
      patients with PD and in a group of age-matched controls (n=12) will be analyzed to establish
      the effect of the disease on indices of plasticity.

    <description>A paired associative paradigm at 25 ms (TMS-PAS-25) to quantify cortical LTP in M1 motor cortex will be used. As well as a repetitive biphasic magnetic stimulator (Magstim Rapid2 stimulator -Magstim Co., Whitland, U.K.) with a &quot;Figure of eight&quot; coil (outer diameters: 9 cm) and apply standard protocol for LTP-like measurements.</description>
