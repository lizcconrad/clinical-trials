      The purpose of this trial is to determine whether setting up a follow-up appointment for
      patients who received treatment and were discharged from the emergency department increases
      their compliance with the follow-up appointment. We are enrolling patients who need a
      follow-up visit, have health insurance but report do not have a primary care doctor. Patients
      are randomized to one of three treatment groups: (1) assistance setting up a follow-up
      appointment by a research assistant using ZocDoc; (2) ZocDoc information given to the subject
      to set up follow-up appointment by him/herself; or (3) usual discharge instructions by ED
      staff. Subjects are phoned approximately 2 weeks after the ED visit and asked whether they
      completed a follow-up visit, satisfaction with their ED visit, satisfaction with their
      follow-up visit, and additional ED treatment and recovery.

    <textblock>
      This is a randomized controlled trial involving adult emergency department (ED) patients who
      need a follow-up visit as defined by the ED provider (importance of follow-up rated as 5 or
      greater on a 0 to 10 scale). There is software available called ZocDoc that provides a user
      the ability to identify primary care providers who have open appointments and will take the
      person's health insurance (in network and outside of network) and list the doctors based on
      their proximity to the person in need. We are testing whether booking appointments for ED
      patients using ZocDoc vs. giving patients the information to use ZocDoc themselves vs.
      standard discharge instructions given by ED staff (i.e. you should follow-up with a primary
      care doctor) affects compliance with self-reported follow-up visits. We are enrolling
      patients while they are in the ED, completed a short baseline interview and then another
      interview with them over the telephone approximately two weeks after the index ED visit. The
      follow-up interview asks subjects whether they have completed a follow-up visit, satisfaction
      with the ED visit and the primary care visit, any other additional ED treatment and extent of
      recovery from the problem that brought them to the ED the first time.
