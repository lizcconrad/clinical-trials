  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      SEDMAN study is a prospective multicenter investigator initiated study (IIS). The main idea
      is to look by Genome Wide Association (arrays that determine more than 1 million
      polymorphisms) genetic risk factors associated with response to dabigatran. To conduct the
      study, the goal is to recruit 300 patients with ischemic stroke with cardioembolic etiology
      treated with dabigatran and 200 treated with Acenocoumarol to determine if genetic risk
      factors are associated with the occurrence of any bleeding or vascular event in a year
      follow-up.

      Data will be analyzed through GWAS analysis. The results will be analyzed by experienced
      genotypic bioinformatics: Plink, Haploview, STATA, IMPUTE2, SNPtest, GTOOL, Galaxy
      management. In addition, the investigators have support of Spanish Consortium for Genetics of
      Stroke (Genestroke). The PLINK software is the main program for the analysis of GWAS. Using
      this software we can clean the raw results of genotyping platforms and determine the presence
      of risk alleles associated with resistance to the study drugs. Haploview software will be
      used for data management and graphics for significance analysis. STATA statistical software
      is a data management and very useful for the creation of Q_Q plots graphs that assist in the
      interpretation of genotypic results. GTOOL, SNPtest and IMPUTE2 are software for data
      imputation and analysis of imputed data through the information available in the 1000 Genomes
      Project.

          -  Patients with stroke or TIA in last 14 days and a diagnosis of non-valvular atrial
             fibrillation who initiate treatment with dabigatran or classical ACOs (acenocoumarol)

          -  Patients with psychological or social factor which not allow a correct follow-up.

          -  Patients with severe/disabling strokes (i.e. more than 2/3 of vascular territory,
             NIHSS≥25).
