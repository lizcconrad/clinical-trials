    <textblock>
      Motivational interview (MI) is a style of communication collaborative, objective-directed,
      with special attention to change talk.

      The present study's main objective is to investigate the efficacy of a MI intervention in
      adolescents with weight excess, in a school setting, over their motivation to adhere to a
      health lifestyle plan of dietary habits and physical exercise.

      Secondary objectives are to investigate the effect of MI over self-concept, quality of life,
      depressive symptoms, anxiety symptoms, body mass index, abdominal circumference and blood
      pressure.

      Registry Procedures Data on anthropometric parameters is recorded in data collection sheet
      and stored in individual files, which are available for monitoring procedures and for
      auditing by the Metabolic and Food Behavior Disorders Scientific Committee.

      Data Checks Data checks will be performed to compare data entered into the registry against
      predefined rules for range or consistency with other data fields in the registry

      Source Data Verification All the data will be checked to assess accuracy, completeness, or
      representativeness of registry data by comparing the data to external data sources:
      audio-taped interviews, paper case report forms and paper case self-report forms. All the
      registries will be stored during five years after study completions according to the Medical
      Faculty of Lisbon norms.

      Variables:

      Motivational Interview Audio-taped clinical interview record Motivational Interviewing
