    <textblock>
      Sixty patients aged between 60 and 75 years old of both sex of ASA physical status I and II
      were included in this randomized study who were divided into the study group of 30 patients
      who had been transfused autologous blood and the control group of 30 patients who had been
      transfused only allogeneic blood. Parenteral iron preparation was given to all patients of
      the study group after each donation. Intraoperatively all patients of the study group
      received 2 grams of intravenous tranexamic acid. This study was conducted through the
      laboratory analysis of the hemoglobin and the hematocrit values during blood donation and for
      both groups in the pre-operative and the post-operative period and the assessment of the
      amount of transfused blood units in both groups.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Elective revision total hip replacement surgery was performed in 60 patients aged
             between 60 and 75 years old of both sex of ASA physical status I and II of 70-90 kg
             body weight and height 160-180 cm.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  This study excluded cases of revision total hip arthroplasty (RTHA) for infection or
             fractures as well as early revisions for dislocations secondary to implant
             malposition. Preoperative autologous blood donation was not done in patients with
             cardiac decompensation, severe hemodynamic problems, respiratory insufficiency, severe
             defect of central nervous system, active infection, blood disease or coagulopathies.
