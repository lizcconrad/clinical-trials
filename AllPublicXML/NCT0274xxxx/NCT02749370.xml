      evaluate the efficacy of etanercept in adult subjects with moderate to severe plaque who have
      failed therapy with apremilast (Otezla)
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, open-label, single-arm, phase 4, estimation study in subjects with
      plaque psoriasis(PsO) who have failed apremilast. The study will consist of a screening
      period of up to 45 days, a 24-week treatment period with study visits every 4-weeks, and a
      30-day follow-up period for safety. Etanercept dosing will follow the recommended label
      dosing for subjects with plaque psoriasis.

    <measure>effect of treatment with etanercept on Psoriasis Area and Severity Index(PASI)</measure>
    <time_frame>through week 24</time_frame>
    <description>PASI score (0 to 72) is a calculation of plaque qualities, including induration, erythema, and desquamation, and the area involved with psoriasis. The assessor will score plaque qualities (0 to 4) and area of involvement (0 to 6) for each of 4 body areas: head and neck, upper extremities, trunk, and lower extremities.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>effect of treatment with etanercept on Static Physician's Global Assessment (sPGA)</measure>
    <time_frame>through week 24</time_frame>
    <description>The sPGA is designed to evaluate the physician's global assessment of the subject's psoriasis based on severity of induration, scaling, and erythema</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>effect of treatment with etanercept on Body Surface Area (BSA)</measure>
    <time_frame>through week 24</time_frame>
    <description>The involved BSA numerical score (0% to 100%) will be used to measure the physician's assessment of the proportion of the subject's total BSA involved with psoriasis.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>effect of treatment with etanercept on Psoriasis Symptom Inventory (PSI)</measure>
    <time_frame>through week 24</time_frame>
    <description>The subject will be asked to rate the severity of their psoriasis signs and symptoms on an 8-item questionnaire (itch, redness, scaling, burning, stinging, cracking, flaking, pain). Each item is scored from 0 (not at all severe) to 4 (very severe).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>effect of treatment with etanercept on Patient Assessment of Treatment Satisfaction</measure>
    <time_frame>through week 24</time_frame>
    <description>The subject will be asked to check a box (from &quot;very dissatisfied&quot; to &quot;very satisfied&quot;) to indicate his or her level of satisfaction with the medication's control of psoriasis.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>effect of treatment with etanercept on Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI)</measure>
    <time_frame>through week 24</time_frame>
    <description>Health related quality of life will be evaluated using the DLQI, a skin disease-specific instrument that has been validated for use in patients with psoriasis.</description>
