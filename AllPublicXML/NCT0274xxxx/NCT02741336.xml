  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Insomnia is a highly prevalent, often debilitating, and economically burdensome condition.
      Reviews of the literature indicate that there are ethnic differences in sleep behavior, with
      African Americans objectively and subjectively reporting more disordered sleep than Caucasian
      Americans.Chronic insomnia can have a significant impact on mental and physical health
      outcomes and has been associated with impaired cognitive performance, particularly, in areas
      of speed, attention, working memory, and executive function. In order to understand the brain
      mechanisms in sleep disorder both during resting state as well as during cognitive
      processing, the investigators will assess resting state EEG (during eyes-closed and eyes-open
      conditions) as well as ERP tasks for assessing decision-making and reward processing. The
      primary objective of the study is to evaluate the effect of a tailored, telephone-delivered
      cognitive behavioral intervention, versus a self- monitoring control condition, on symptoms
      of insomnia and its neurodynamic correlates.

      Hypotheses: Among Blacks subjectively reporting symptoms of insomnia, those randomized to the
      tailored, telephone-delivered CBT-I, compared with those randomized to the self-monitoring
      control group, will have: Hyp. 1: Greater reduction in symptoms of insomnia as measured by
      the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index. Hyp. 2: Greater neurophysiologic improvement (ERP, ERO)
      in the intervention condition in response to laboratory paradigms Hyp 3: Greater improvement
      in psychosocial functioning including reduction in depression and increase in quality of
      life.

    <description>For those randomized to the CBT-I group, the therapist will initiate telephone-delivered cognitive-behavioral therapy within 2 weeks of baseline assessment. Participants will complete 4 telephone sessions over a period of 8 weeks. Sessions last approximately 45 minutes. CBT-I is a short-term, focused psychotherapy that is action-oriented, practical, rational, and helps the patient gain independence and effectiveness in dealing with real-life issues. Techniques utilized in CBT-I include psychoeducation, sleep hygiene, cognitive restructuring, stimulus control, sleep restriction, and relaxation training.</description>

    <arm_group_label>Self-Monitoring Control Group</arm_group_label>
    <arm_group_type>Active Comparator</arm_group_type>
    <description>Individuals randomized to the self-monitoring control group will be asked to complete a weeklong sleep diary every other week for 8 weeks. The sleep diary will inquire about (1) the time of getting into bed; (2) the time at which the individual attempted to fall asleep; (3) sleep onset latency; (4) number of awakenings; (5) duration of awakenings; (6) time of final awakening; (7) final rise time; (8) perceived sleep quality (rated via Likert scale); and (9) an additional space for open-ended comments from the respondent. The control condition is designed to increase self-monitoring, which has been demonstrated to be an effective means of inducing change for various health behaviors such as diet and exercise.</description>

    <intervention_name>Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia (CBT-I)</intervention_name>
    <description>Cognitive-behavioral therapy is a short-term, focused psychotherapy for a wide range of psychological and behavioral issues including depression, anxiety, anger, and non-compliance. The focus of the intervention is on how one thinks, behaves, and communicates in real time, as opposed to a focus on one's early childhood experiences. The therapist assists the patient in identifying specific distortions and biases in thinking and provides guidance on how to modify these beliefs. CBT helps the patient learn effective self-help skills that are used in homework assignments that ultimately help change the way one thinks, feels and behaves. The
ï¿¼ intervention is action-oriented, practical, rational, and helps the patient gain independence and effectiveness in dealing with real-life issues. Techniques utilized in CBT-I include psychoeducation, sleep hygiene, cognitive restructuring, stimulus control, sleep restriction, and relaxation training.</description>
