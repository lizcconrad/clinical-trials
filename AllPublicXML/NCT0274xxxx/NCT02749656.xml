    <description>The Investigator's Global Assessment score (IGA) was recorded at the first visit and after treated 2,4 and 8 weeks with 0.25% Desoximetasone cream (Topoxy®), 0.25% Desoximetasone cream (Topicorte®) or placebo. The IGA score consisted of 6 points score (0 = absent disease, 1 = very mild disease, 2 = mild disease, 3 = moderate disease, 4 = severe disease and 5 = very severe disease)</description>
