  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Previous studies have shown that PVB reduces pain and postoperative nausea and vomiting after
      breast cancer surgery when used in addition to general anesthesia or sedation. However, major
      breast cancer surgery involves areas beyond the breast tissue, such as pectoral musculature.
