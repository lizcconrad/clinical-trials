      The aim of the Phase 4 study is to test the scale structure, reliability, responsiveness to
      change and validity of the EORTC QLQ-LC29 in conjunction with the EORTC QLQ-C30 in patients
      diagnosed with lung cancer. Participants will be enrolled in three groups according to their
      primary therapy (A. Surgery, B. Radiochemotherapy, C. Targeted therapy, D. Immunotherapy).
      Various combinations of therapies are permissible, resulting in a total of eight subgroups
      (A.1 Surgery alone and/or before any adjuvant therapy, A.2 Surgery [late effects], B.1
      Chemotherapy alone, B.2 Radiotherapy alone, B.3 Sequential radiochemotherapy, B.4 Concurrent
      radiochemotherapy, C.1 Targeted therapy alone, C.2 Targeted therapy in combination with any
      other therapy, D. Immonotherapy).

      According to sample size calculations we will include a total of N = 450 patients. N = 120 of
      these patients will be asked to fill in the questionnaires at a second time point, of which a
      subgroup of n = 60 will be subjected to test-retest analyses (patients who are clinically
      stable and indicate no change on an anchor question over the two assessment points), and
      another n = 60 will be subjected to test-retest analyses (those who indicate a change to the
      worse or to the better).

      Standard psychometric analyses will be employed to evaluate the hypothesized scale structure
      of the QLQ-LC29 and its internal consistency, convergent and discriminate validity, as well
      as test-retest reliability and responsiveness to change.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The EORTC QLQ-C30 comprises 30 items that are grouped in five functional scales (physical,
      role, cognitive, emotional and social), one scale to rate global health and quality of life,
      three multi-item symptom scales (fatigue, nausea and vomiting, pain) and five single symptom
      items (dyspnoea, insomnia, appetite loss, constipation and diarrhea), one item assessing
      perceived financial impact of disease and treatment [18]. Patients rate items using a
      four-point Likert response scale with the exception of the scale on global health and quality
      of life which is accompanied by a seven-point response format. A time period is not specified
      for the physical functioning scale items. The time frame for all remaining items is the past
      week.

      The updated lung cancer module, the QLQ-LC29, is a module to be used in conjunction with the
      QLQ-C30 for the assessment of quality of life in patients with lung cancer. All items are
      accompanied by the classic EORTC a four-point Likert response scale with the labels 1 &quot;not at
      all&quot;, 2 &quot;a little&quot;, 3 &quot;quite a bit&quot;, and 4 &quot;very much&quot;. The time frame for the entire module
      is the past week (&quot;Please indicate the extent to which you have experienced these symptoms or
      problems during the past week&quot;).

      A content analysis of the items and a preliminary psychometric calculation (Cronbach's alpha)
      of Phase 3 data suggest that the QLQ-LC29 is composed of five multi-item scales and five
      single items.

      Inclusion Criteria

        -  histologically confirmed diagnosis of lung cancer

        -  no previous primary or recurrent tumour

        -  ability to understand the language of the questionnaire

        -  mental fitness to complete a questionnaire

        -  18 years of age or above

        -  written informed consent.

      Exclusion Criteria Inversely, exclusion criteria are the negation of the above specified
      characteristics, i.e., no histologically confirmed diagnosis of lung cancer, previous primary
      or recurrent tumour, not mentally fit to complete a questionnaire, not able to understand the
      language of the questionnaire, younger than 18, and refusal of informed consent.

      Sampling matrix Participants will be enrolled in three groups according to their primary
      therapy (A. Surgery, B. Radiochemotherapy, C. Targeted therapy). Various combinations of
      therapies are permissible, resulting in a total of eight subgroups (A.1 Surgery alone and/or
      before any adjuvant therapy, A.2 Surgery [late effects], B.1 Chemotherapy alone, B.2
      Radiotherapy alone, B.3 Sequential radiochemotherapy, B.4 Concurrent radiochemotherapy, C.1
      Targeted therapy alone, C.2 Targeted therapy in combination with any other therapy, D.
      Immunotherapy).

      Sample size According to sample size calculations we will include a total of N = 450
      patients. N = 120 of these patients will be asked to fill in the questionnaires at a second
      time point, of which a subgroup of n = 60 will be subjected to test-retest analyses (patients
      who are clinically stable and indicate no change on an anchor question over the two
      assessment points), and another n = 60 will be subjected to test-retest analyses (those who
      indicate a change to the worse or to the better).

      Statistical analyses Standard psychometric analyses will be employed to evaluate the
      hypothesized scale structure of the QLQ-LC29 and its internal consistency, convergent and
      discriminate validity, as well as test-retest reliability and responsiveness to change.
