      A trial conducted within the company with a new non-contact respiration rate (RR) sensor. The
      device was compared for accuracy in RR measurement with a cleared device, the SOMNOScreen
      Easy, which uses chest effort bands.

      The RR was measured over a short duration on subjects sitting upright in a chair, with the
      non-contact sensor at various distances from the subject. A total of 20 subjects were tested,
      from both genders, selected to represent a wide range of age and body mass index

      The Reassure uses Radio Frequency (RF) waves to detect the small movements of the human body
      due to respiration. The reference device, the SOMNOScreen, uses chest effort bands. The
      Reassure is non-contact and so more comfortable and convenient for quick RR measurement, in a
      similar way that an Infra-Red thermometer is compared to a traditional under-the-tongue
      mercury thermometer.

      The aim is to explore the variations in the human body that could have an effect on the radio
      reflection from the human torso, and thus affect the potential detection and accuracy of
      breathing rate. Factors that could affect non-contact RF performance are:

        -  High Body Mass Index (BMI) could potentially reduce the chest wall movement during
           breathing, or alter the nature of the breathing.

        -  Elderly, thin skin (ie pensioner with low BMI) may have less RF reflection.

        -  Female breast tissue may have an effect on detection or accuracy.

      This tested a number of distances from the non-contact sensor and also with the subject
      having a thick comforter (duvet) laid across them. This tests and proves that the RR
      measurement by the Reassure is unaffected by the thickness of clothing or blankets being
      worn.

    <description>95% of second-by-second respiration rate recorded over a 60 second interval indicated by the Reassure is within 5 breaths per minute of that indicated by the reference device. This reflects the expected inter-operator differences in manual RR measurement. (See references for source)</description>
