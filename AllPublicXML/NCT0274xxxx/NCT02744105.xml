  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Thalassemics can develop liver fibrosis because of iron overload and hepatitis C infection.
      The latter is the main risk factor for liver fibrosis in transfusion dependent thalassemics.
      Excess liver iron is clearly recognized as a co factor for the development of advanced
      fibrosis in patients with hepatitis virus C infection. Transient elastography (Fibroscan) is
      a reliable non invasive method for diagnosing as liver fibrosis in thalassemic patients
      regardless of the degree of iron overload. There is evidence that suggests Spirulina may help
      to protect against liver damage, cirrhosis and liver failure in those with chronic liver
      disease.
