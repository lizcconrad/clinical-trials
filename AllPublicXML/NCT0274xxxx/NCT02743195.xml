  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The gastrointestinal (GI) ecosystem is a complex network of bacterial cells, host cells and
      tissues that change with age. Fewer numbers and less diversity of beneficial bacteria and
      greater number and diversity of non-beneficial bacteria occurs with age and conditions
      associated with accelerated aging (i.e. obesity, high fat diet)(1,2). This imbalance of the
      microbiota contributes to increased inflammation of the gastrointestinal lining and changes
      to the integrity of the intestinal cell wall.

      Prebiotics, such as non-digestible carbohydrates, can induce the growth or activity
      microorganisms that contribute to the well-being of the host. Recent studies have shown that
      prebiotic treatment can have beneficial effects on glucose levels, lipid metabolism, and
      inflammatory markers in an obese population(3). The polyphenol blend is rich in anthocyanins,
      which is a unique subgroup of flavonoids that have been demonstrated to impact the microbiome
      and have anti-inflammatory properties(4,5,6,7). This open-label study will assess the
      benefits of a prebiotic and polyphenol blend in healthy obese adults.
