  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Overweight and obesity causes low-grade systemic inflammation, which sharply increases risk
      for iron deficiency. Studies in our laboratory have shown that this is mainly the result of
      reduced dietary iron absorption because of increased hepcidin concentrations. During
      pregnancy, women have a large increase in iron needs because of the expansion of maternal
      blood volume and fetal needs. Iron deficiency anemia in infancy can impair cognitive
      development. Whether maternal adiposity impairs absorption and transfer of iron to the fetus,
      and thereby increases risk of iron deficiency in the mother and the infant is unclear.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In obese subjects, hepcidin concentrations are increased and iron absorption is believed to
      be reduced, leading to iron deficiency over time. How all this will influence iron supply of
      the fetus in obese pregnancy has not been well investigated to date. Even if maternal and
      fetal iron uptakes are regulated separately, it is unclear to what extent maternal
      subclinical inflammation might influence this process. A small study by Dao et al. indicated
      that maternal-fetal iron transfer was impaired in obese pregnant women, possibly due to
      hepcidin up-regulation. In this study, both maternal BMI as well as hepcidin were negatively
      correlated with cord blood iron status. Maternal hepcidin and c-reactive protein were
      significantly higher and cord blood iron was significantly lower in the obese compared to the
      normal weight. Hepcidin was shown to have an effect on iron transfer across the placenta in
      the study by Young et al.: the transfer was increased in women with undetectable hepcidin at
      delivery compared to those with higher levels. As of now, clear associations between maternal
      BMI or maternal hepcidin concentration and fetal iron status were not shown.

    <description>The fractional iron absorption from two test meals will be calculated based on the shift of the iron isotopic ratios in the collected blood samples 14 days after administration of the isotopically labeled meals. Calculation of fractional iron absorption will take into account the principles of isotope dilution and the fact that iron isotopic labels are not mono-isotopic. We assumed iron incorporation into erythrocytes to be constant. Blood volume, needed for the calculation of fractional iron absorption will be estimated based on available data on blood volume estimations in both, pregnant and overweight/obese women.</description>
