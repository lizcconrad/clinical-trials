  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Individuals with fragile X syndrome (FXS) demonstrate profound executive function deficits
      that interfere with learning, socialization and emotion regulation. Extensive research
      focused on the animal models of FXS show that targeted pharmacological agents can normalize
      synaptic connectivity and reverse cognitive and behavioral deficits. This translational work
      has led to multiple national and international controlled trials in humans with FXS now
      underway. However, in contrast to the heavy focus on medication treatments, there have been
      no controlled trials to empirically-validate cognitive or behavioral interventions for FXS.
      The proposed study, the first non-pharmacological controlled trial for FXS, will evaluate the
      efficacy of Cogmed, a cognitive training program proven to enhance working memory and
      executive/frontal function in a variety of clinical populations. Demonstration of effective
      Cogmed training for FXS would represent a major advance in the field, one that may also
      generalize to other forms of intellectual disability. Furthermore, it is critical to
      determine whether the targeted pharmacological treatments can accelerate learning and
      cognitive development. Thus, the validation of Cogmed for FXS will provide a paradigm for
      testing hypotheses focused on combined efficacy of medication and cognitive training.
