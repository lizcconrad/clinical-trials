  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the safety and tolerability profile of TB-403
      (humanized monoclonal antibody against placental growth factor (PlGF)) in pediatric subjects
      with relapsed or refractory Medulloblastoma.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will be conducted in 2 parts.

      In part A, the maximum tolerated dose of TB-403 will be determined in pediatric subjects with
      relapsed or refractory Medulloblastoma (MB) and as well Neuroblastoma (NB), Ewing Sarcoma
      (ES) and Alveolar Rhabdomyosarcoma (ARMS).

      In part B of the clinical trial, the safety and tolerability of TB-403 at the maximum
      tolerated dose will be evaluated in pediatric subjects with relapsed or refractory
      Medulloblastoma.
