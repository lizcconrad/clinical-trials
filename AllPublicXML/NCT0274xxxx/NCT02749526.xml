      1. Research purpose: Endostar (recombinant human endostatin) continuous intravenous
           infusion combined with chemotherapy for stage Ⅲ resectable or potentially resectable
           esophageal cancer efficacy and safety and to maintain the efficacy and safety.

        2. The main objectives: R0 resection rate

      Secondary objectives:

        1. pCR rate

        2. 3-year disease-free survival

        3. Security and complications

        4. DFS, OS

        5. Quality of Life

      3.The number of research centers and research time: This study intends to preside and
      implemented by the Jiangsu Provincial People's Hospital, Professor Gu Yanhong. The trial is
      scheduled to start in September 2015, planned to stop in June 2016 into the group, one
      patient surgery follow-up to the last end, get the primary endpoint and safety, surgical
      complications secondary endpoint. This study will continue to follow-up the patient DFS, OS
      and other secondary end points.
