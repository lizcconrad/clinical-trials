      The primary objective of this study is to

      • Assess the pharmacodynamic profile of riociguat in subjects with symptomatic pulmonary
      hypertension and heart failure with preserved ejection fraction

      The secondary objectives of this study are to

        -  Assess safety and tolerability of riociguat in this study population

        -  Assess changes in dimensions of left and right ventricles and cardiac function
           parameters using cardiac magnetic resonance imaging
