      This phase II trial studies how well ibrutinib and brentuximab vedotin work in treating
      patients with Hodgkin lymphoma that has returned (relapsed) or does not respond to treatment
      (refractory). Ibrutinib may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking some of the enzymes
      needed for cell growth. Monoclonal antibodies, such as brentuximab vedotin, may interfere
      with the ability of cancer cells to grow and spread. Giving ibrutinib together with
      brentuximab vedotin may be a better treatment for Hodgkin lymphoma.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Evaluate the anti-tumor activity of the two agent combination ibrutinib and brentuximab
      vedotin, as assessed by complete response (CR) rate.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Assess the safety and tolerability of the two agent combination through evaluation of
      toxicities, including type, frequency, severity, attribution, time course and duration.

      II. Obtain estimates of overall response rate (ORR), response duration and survival (overall
      and progression-free).

      III. Describe outcomes of patients who ultimately undergo autologous or allogeneic
      hematopoietic cell transplantation following treatment with ibrutinib/brentuximab vedotin.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Collect deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA)/ribonucleic acid (RNA) from lymphoma specimens and
      serial plasma samples for future biomarker evaluation.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive ibrutinib orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-21 and brentuximab vedotin
      intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on day 1. Courses repeat every 21 days in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for up to 2
      years.
