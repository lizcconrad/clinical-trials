  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this pilot study will be to assess the impact of chiropractic Activator
      adjustments on spatial cognitive abilities through initial assessment and testing in a
      healthy population aged 18 to 35.

      This study seeks to assess the impact of chiropractic on cognition. Participants must be
      between 18 and 35 years of age. Within the past six months individuals may not participate if
      they have had any broken bones, accidents, or surgeries to their spine. Additionally,
      participants cannot have any mental disabilities, be pregnant, or have other conditions of
      the spine such as bone mineral loss.

      Patients will receive a chiropractic exam and will be randomized to a sham (simulated
      chiropractic adjustment) or chiropractic adjustment intervention group. Prior to receiving
      either the sham or chiropractic adjustment, the participants will sit in front of a computer
      screen and will be asked to follow instructions and press a button on a keypad. There will be
      three different types of computer assessments that will take approximately fifteen minutes
      total. After the computer assessments the participant will receive either the sham or
      chiropractic adjustment. The chiropractic adjustment and the sham will both utilize a
      handheld instrument called an Activator. After the adjustment or sham the participant will
      take the computer assessments again. The total time this may take is ninety minutes.
