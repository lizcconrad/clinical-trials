  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to gain knowledge about the effectiveness of enhanced
      cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT-E) for anorexia nervosa (AN).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will assess the potency of outpatient CBT-E in a sample of patients suffering from
      AN who are admitted to the Section for Eating Disorders at the Department for Psychosomatic
      Medicine, Haukeland University Hospital in Bergen, Norway.

      Secondary objectives are to (1) prospectively identify baseline predictors of treatment
      outcome and dropout, (2) determine variables related to the treatment process and patient
      engagement as predictors of the outcome and/or treatment dropout, and (3) in a
      multidisciplinary approach, focus on selected pathophysiological mechanisms including changes
      in the gut microbiota as well as immunological measures in patients with severe AN in
      different stages of the disease, and determine to what extent they are related to treatment
      outcome.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  patients aged &gt;16 years

          -  suffering from AN, as diagnosed based on the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of
             Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-V) and confirmed with a clinical examination.

          -  either at least one unsuccessful treatment attempt in a secondary health-care service
             unit or severe AN that is evaluated as not manageable in a secondary health-care
             service unit.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  deemed unsafe to manage on an outpatient basis

          -  psychiatric comorbidity that precludes a focused eating-disorder treatment, such as
             psychosis or drug abuse.

          -  not available to participate during the requested treatment period

          -  for the analysis of the gut microbiota: patients suffering from inflammatory bowel
             disease, acute or chronic diarrhea or other bowel disease, treatment with antibiotics
             during the previous 3 months before stool sampling, or laxative abuse;
