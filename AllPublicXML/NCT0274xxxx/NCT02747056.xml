  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The research aims at clarifying the impact of autism on personal identity in adulthood. Two
      studies will be made in order to compare adults with autistic spectrum disorders without
      intellectual deficiency and controls. In the first study (Study A), the investigators will
      ask subjects to tell autobiographical memories and to specify their characteristics by
      answering focused questions. In the second study (Study B), the investigators will ask
      subjects to say the self statements which define them. Then, subjects will have to tell and
      to specify the characteristics of the autobiographical memories linked to these self
      statements.

      Introduction:

      Autism associates impairments in social relationships and specific competencies linked to
      restricted interests. These interests usually focus on mathematics, drawings or foreign
      language learning and are very significant in the autobiographies of persons with autism
      without intellectual deficiency. It's seem to be a basement of their self-identity. The
      personal identity relies on both the self representations and the sense of self. This sense
      of self supports the self continuity through time which links the present feelings, the
      autobiographical memories and the future personals projects. The personal identity depends on
      the memory of life events called &quot;autobiographical memory.&quot;

      Objectives:

      The research aims at clarifying the impact of autism on personal identity in adulthood. Two
      studies will be made in order to compare adults with autistic spectrum disorders without
      intellectual deficiency and controls. In the first study (Study A), the investigators will
      ask subjects to tell autobiographical memories and to specify their characteristics by
      answering focused questions. In the second study (Study B), the investigators will ask
      subjects to say the self statements which define them. Then, subjects will have to tell and
      to specify the characteristics of the autobiographical memories linked to these self
      statements.

      Expected Results:

      The first study will inform the investigators on the sense of self and self continuity
      through time. The investigators predict that it would be difficult for subjects with autism
      spectrum disorders to give details of their life events. The focused questions should make
      easier the recollection of the memories. The investigators hypothesize that the memories
      linked to the typically autistic restricted interests would be more detailed.

      The second study will inform the investigators on the memories linked to self
      representations. The investigators predict that these memories would be, in autism, less
      detailed and less important for identity. The investigators also hypothesize that the
      memories linked to the restricted interests would be more detailed and important for the
      self.

      Autobiographical memory and socialization are deeply interconnected. So, the investigators
      think that this research will help them to elaborate news therapies focused on
      autobiographical memory improvement. Finally, the investigators want to reduce the social
      disability in autism.

    <description>study A:The number of details is the total number of perceptual/sensory, temporal, contextual, emotional and cognitive details found in the memory after spontaneous recall first. Secondly, the investigators will ask subjects to clarify the five characteristics of the details presented upper and retrieval should be make easier with specific cueing.
Study B:The specificity measures how the memory is focused on specific date, space, context, emotions, thoughts and feelings. The specificity of the memories is deeply linked to the self .</description>

    <time_frame>This outcome will be assessed on the follow up visit (V2) either one day after the inclusion visit (V1) or within 3 months after V1</time_frame>
    <description>The number or remember, know, guess responses gives information about the subjective state of conscious awareness during the recall of the memory. This subjective state goes from complete conscious recollection with reliving of thoughts, perceptions, and feelings at the date of the event to a vague impression.
The perspective in recollection could be an actor perspective or an observer perspective. In the actor perspective, the recollection is in a first-person point of view. The person remembering relives the event through her own eyes. In the observer perspective, the recollection is in a third-person point of view. The person remembering sees the scene of the memory as the spectator of herself.
The subjective temporal distance is the subjective perception of the temporal distance between the present and the event of the memory. The investigators will ask subjects if they feel this event close or distant on a seven point scale.</description>

    <time_frame>This outcome will be assessed on the follow up visit (V2) either one day after the inclusion visit (V1) or within 3 months after V1Description</time_frame>
    <description>The importance for the self of the memory is assessed by distinctiveness. The distinctiveness criteria of the memory is established by Conway. These criteria require participants to specify in what extent these memories have had a personal significance, were discriminatory, consistent and are frequently recalled. A numerical value will be obtained for this criteria.</description>

    <description>The importance for the self of the memory is assessed by emotional intensity. The emotional intensity will be measured with the PANAS scale. The investigator will ask the participants to rate the emotional intensity of their memory based on 4 positive affect (determined, enthusiastic, proud and strong) and 4 negative affect (frightened, ashamed, guilty and disappointed). No value is obtained.</description>

    <description>The importance for the self of the memory is assessed by the active or passive position . An active position will refer to a memory in which the subject plays a key role in the progression of the event. A passive position will refer to a memory where the participant undergoes an event where he did not play a determining role.</description>
