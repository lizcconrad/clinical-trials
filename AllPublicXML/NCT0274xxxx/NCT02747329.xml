      The objective of this study is a comparative evaluation of BuMA Supreme™ stent and of Xience
      V/Prime stent in terms of the extent of neointima formation at 1 or 2 months after implanting
      in relatively high bleeding risk patients with coronary artery disease using OCT.

    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, multicenter, randomized, non-inferiority study, which will enroll a
      total of 80 subjects from approximately 8 centers. All subjects will be firstly randomly
      assigned to 1st month OCT (40 pts) or 2nd month OCT group(40 pts). Then both two groups will
      be randomly assigned to undergoing implantation of BuMA Supreme™ stent (20 pts) or Xience
      V/Prime stent (20 pts). If non-inferiority was met, superiority test will be planned.

      All of the patients be followed up to 2 years. The follow-up visits will be conducted at 1 or
      2 months (including QCA/OCT investigation), 3 months, 6 months, 1 and 2 years post
      percutaneous coronary intervention(PCI),in order to observe the Primary Endpoint and
      Secondary Endpoints.
