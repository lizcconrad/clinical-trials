      This study is to recruit 50 couples for Expanded carrier screening at Prepregnancy Checkup
      Clinic at the Family Planning Association.

      Saliva swabs are collected from couples for Hereditary Disease DNA screening test by DrGene.

      Blood samples are taken by venipuncture of women for Fragile X carrier screening by Prenatal
      Diagnostic Laboratory, Tsan Yuk Hospital.

      A pre-test self-administered Questionnaire 1 will be administered to couples to assess their
      knowledge, views and preferences in receiving expanded carrier screening. This include
      collection of basic demographic information, answers to questions on basic principles of
      expanded carrier testing, reasons of having or declining the test, choice of having
      concurrent or sequential screening, factors affecting their choices, anxiety level of the
      patient is assessed by state-trait anxiety inventory. Their willingness to pay for the test
      is also assessed.

      The test results will be available to couples in 6 week's time. A post-test self-administered
      questionnaire 2 will be administered to couples on receiving the test results at the clinic.
      These include assessment of anxiety level, any decision regret, outcome of test and resulting
      action.

      The couples with a screen positive result will be referred to Queen Mary Hospital for a joint
      counselling by clinical geneticist and gynaecologist. This counselling/consultation shall be
      audiotaped or videotaped. The interviews will be transcribed verbatim. The data will be
      explored for themes and issues identified.

      Statistics Questionnaire survey data shall be entered into SPSS. Descriptive statistics will
      be used to compare responses and choices of participants.
