  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Osteoarthritis (OA) is the most common joint disease affecting millions of people around the
      world, for which there is unfortunately no cure. Among existing therapies,
      viscosupplementation, i.e., the injection of hyaluronic acid into the joint, has an
      established place in the symptomatic treatment of knee OA.

      The present Phase IIb/III aiming to assess the safety and efficacy of JTA-004 is organized in
      two phases. With results obtained in the first phase the best dose of JTA-004 is determined,
      and the efficacy of the selected dose will then be confirmed in the second phase.
