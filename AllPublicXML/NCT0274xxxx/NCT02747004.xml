             least 21 days for myelosuppressive agents or 14 days for nonmyelosuppressive agents
             prior to receiving study drug, and recovered from the acute effects of therapy (until
             the toxicity resolves to either baseline or at least Grade 1) except for residual

          -  Have adequate organ function.

          -  Have negative serum pregnancy test within 7 days prior to the first dose of study

          -  Have clinical evidence or history of central nervous system metastasis.

          -  Have received treatment with a drug that has not received regulatory approval for any
             indication within 14 or 21 days prior to randomization of study drug for a

          -  Have had major surgery within 14 days prior to randomization of study drug to allow
             for post-operative healing of the surgical wound and site(s).

          -  Have a personal history of any of the following conditions: syncope of either

             at the time of initiating study treatment) and/or detectable viral infection.

          -  Have received treatment with a prior cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK4) and CDK 6
             inhibitor.

          -  Have a preexisting chronic condition resulting in persistent diarrhea.

          -  Have a history of any other cancer (except nonmelanoma skin cancer or carcinoma
