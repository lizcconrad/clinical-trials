    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this study is to explore the underlying mechanisms that link sleep to
      Alzheimer's disease (AD), with special focus on the clearance of metabolites in the
      extracellular space of the brain during sleep. Subjects will wear an actigraph for 1 week to
      determine regular daytime activity and sleep patterns. Subjects will then undergo partial
      sleep deprivation followed by 4 hours of in-lab nocturnal polysomnography (NPSG).
      Participants will be be asked to stay awake and active all day after the partial sleep
      deprivation with a new actigraphy secured by a hospital band to assure participants remain
      awake. They will seep inside an MRI machine for 90 minutes on the following night during
      their usual bedtime (established by 1 week actigraphy study.) Morphologic imaging, flow
      imaging and diffusion kurtosis imaging (DKI) will be performed on a 3T Siemens scanner.

    <criteria>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Capable of giving informed consent

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Diagnosis of any brain disease or brain damage including significant trauma,
             hydrocephalus, seizures, mental retardation or other serious neurological disorders
             (e.g. Parkinson's disease or other movement disorders). Persons with silent cortical
             infarcts will be excluded. White matter lesions will not be exclusions.

          -  History of major psychiatric illness (e.g., schizophrenia, bipolar or life long
             history of major depression)

          -  Conditions that alter normal sleep patterns: irregular sleep-wake rhythms (based on
             one week at home monitoring with actigraphy), moderate to severe periodic limb
             movement while you sleep (PLMS) or Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA).

          -  History of claustrophobia.

          -  BMIâ‰¥30

          -  Significant history of alcoholism or drug abuse.

          -  Inability to avoid the use of alcohol or caffeine during the 48h before the MRI.

          -  Current pregnancy or intent to become pregnant during the period of study.

          -  Any electronic or ferromagnetic devices (e.g., pacemaker or surgical clips) that
             constitutes a hazard for MRI imaging.

          -  Any medications adversely affecting cognition, blood pressure, glucose metabolism, or
             sleep will result in exclusion.
