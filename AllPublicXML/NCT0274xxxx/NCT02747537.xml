  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study proposes to treat patients with the combination of sorafenib and irinotecan.
      Patients with relapsed, recurrent, refractory, or high risk malignancies whose tumors possess
      a non-synonymous mutation in Raf, PDGFR, VEGFR, Flt-3, KIT, JAK, STAT, RAS, MEK, or ERK will
      be eligible for the study. Very few phase 2 clinical trials have been performed in pediatrics
      using targeted agents in combination with conventional chemotherapy agents. Furthermore,
      since some combinations such as the combination of this study (sorafenib and irinotecan) have
      shown additive/synergistic effects in preclinical studies, therapy selecting for those
      patients who possess mutations targeted by the TKI of the study, may unveil activity that has
      not been previously observed. Thus, the investigators hope to determine whether the addition
      of additive/synergistic chemotherapy will increase efficacy of the targeted agent and/or
      increase tumor susceptibility to the targeted agent, resulting in increased anti-tumor
      activity.
