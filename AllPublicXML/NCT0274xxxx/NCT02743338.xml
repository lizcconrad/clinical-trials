  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study includes two consecutive sub-trials.

      Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) is treatment of choice for Insomnia. One of the most
      important treatment Components in CBT for insomnia (CBT-i) is Sleep Restriction (SR), but
      lately, adverse effects related to SR have been reported. A treatment method with
      similarities to SR is Sleep Compression (SC). SC is not as well studied as SR, but appears to
      have similar effects to SR but without the adverse effects. The first sub-trial thus aims at
      directly comparing SR and SC. The second sub-trial aims at evaluating any additional effects
      of CBT-i components given as an add-on treatment to a randomized selection of half
      participants in each original treatment arm.

    <description>Behavioral component of CBT-i. Sleep restrictions includes curtailing bed time to match sleep time as registered during the first week of treatment, and expanding bed time contingent upon increased sleep efficiency, until optimal balance between sleep time and sleep efficiency is reached. The first five weeks, therapist support is provided via written messages. The next five weeks, patient works independently. At the end of tenth treatment week, therapist and patient make plan for future.</description>

    <description>Behavioral component of CBT-i. Sleep compression includes gradually compressing bed time over several weeks to approach sleep time as registered during the first week of treatment, and stopping compression when optimal balance between sleep time and sleep efficiency is reached. The first five weeks, therapist support is provided via written messages. The next five weeks, patient works independently. At the end of tenth treatment week, therapist and patient make plan for future.</description>

    <description>After 5+5 weeks of either Sleep Restriction or Sleep Compression, a randomized sample from each treatment Group is offered additional components of CBT-i, such as Stimulus Control, Cognitive Restructuring, Relaxation and Visualization for 10 weeks, without therapist support. Component allocation based on individual analysis.</description>
