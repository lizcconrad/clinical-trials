  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Despite evidence of the physiologic benefits and possible lower mortality associated with low
      chloride solutions, normal saline remains the most wildly used fluid in the world. Given
      uncertainty about the impact of lower chloride versus higher chloride solutions on mortality,
      it is unlikely that clinical practice will change without new and direct RCT evidence.
      Editorials published in leading critical care journals have called for RCT's to address this
      important clinical question. The proposed feasibility RCT will investigate the feasibility of
      a large-scale trial directly comparing low chloride versus normal chloride for resuscitation
      in septic shock on patient-important outcomes such as mortality and AKI.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Severe infection can lead to many complications within the human body including low blood
      pressure, which is called septic shock. The main treatments for septic shock are intravenous
      antibiotics and intravenous fluid.

      There are many different intravenous fluids available for doctors to use. Each one of these
      fluids has potential advantages as well as potential disadvantages. Doctors will often look
      at many things when deciding which fluid to give including the results of bloodwork and the
      clinical characteristics of the patients themselves. There is limited direction from research
      studies taht using one fluid type is better than another. Some preliminary research in the
      field has suggested that one specific electrolyte, call chloride, may be harmful when given
      to patients in high concentrations. Animal research has shown that the administration of high
      chloride fluids may be harmful to the lungs, kidneys, gastrointestinal and muscle cells. Some
      intravenous fluids have higher concentrations of chloride than others.

      The investigators plan to study the impact of giving patients with severe infection
      intravenous fluids with either a high chloride concentration (normal saline or high chloride
      albumin) or a low chloride concentration (Ringers Lactate or low chloride albumin). Although,
      the investigators plan for a larger trial looking at patient-important outcomes such as rate
      of death, kidney failure and length of stay in the ICU the investigators think it's important
      to start with a feasibility study. If the investigators are able to show a larger trial is
      feasible then the investigators will apply for further funding and use the lessons learned
      from this pilot to optimize the larger study. The larger study has the potential to guide the
      care of critically ill patients with infection worldwide.

    <description>Successful recruitment will be defined as achieving enrolment of 50 patients over the 12-month study period. This works out to approximately 1 patient/center/month. Once the pilot trial begins, the screening logs will be reviewed at all three study centers by the study steering committee on a monthly basis. We will record exclusions and reasons for physician refusals.</description>
