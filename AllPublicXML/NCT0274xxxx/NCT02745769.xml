          -  Study Arm 2

               -  pathologically confirmed mantle cell lymphoma (MCL), with (a) measurable nodal
                  disease on positron emission tomography computed tomography (PET-CT) per Lugano
                  classification. Prior to enrollment, pathology must be reviewed and confirmed at
                  the investigational site where the participant is entered

               -  have MCL that relapsed after or is refractory to (a) first-line combination
                  chemotherapy with or without stem cell transplant and (b) at least 1 other
                  locally available therapy

               -  provide a newly obtained tumor tissue sample. Tumor tissue biopsies may be taken
                  by surgical resection, core needle biopsy, or fine needle biopsy

          -  All Study Arms:

               -  have not received previous systemic therapy (including investigational agents)
                  targeting programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1)/ PD-1 ligand (PDL 1) or
                  PD-1/PDL-2 signaling pathways. Prior therapy with other immune checkpoint
                  inhibitors, including but not limited to, anti-CD137 antibody or anticytotoxic
                  T-lymphocyte-associated antigen-4 antibody, is not permitted

               -  have adequate organ function

               -  are, in the judgment of the investigator, appropriate candidates for experimental
                  therapy after available standard therapies have failed to provide clinical
                  benefit

               -  have discontinued all previous treatments for cancer and recovered from the acute
                  effects of therapy, other than less than or equal to Grade 2 neuropathy or
                  nonserious and nonlife-threatening toxicities such as alopecia, altered taste,
                  and nail changes

               -  have a performance status of 0 or 1 on the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group
                  scale

               -  men and women must agree to the use an effective method of contraception during
                  the study and for at least 3 months post last dose of study drug administration.
