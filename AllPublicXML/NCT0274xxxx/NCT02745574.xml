  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Laparoscopic surgery is becoming a major procedure, owing to smaller incisions, shorter
      hospitalizations, and less post-operative pain as compared with traditional laparotomies.
      However, there is marked interindividual variability of post-operative shoulder-tip pain
      following laparoscopic surgery. The incidence of shoulder pain varies from 35% to 80% and
      ranges from mild to severe. In some cases, it has been reported to last more than 72 hours
      after surgery.

      The hypothesis of post-operative shoulder-tip pain is that carbon dioxide induced phrenic
      nerve irritation causes referred pain to C4. Therefore, we should try to do is that if we
      could reduce carbon dioxide retention in the pelvic cavity.

      This clinical controlled trial is tried to find out the practical and clinical maneuver to
      reduce post-operative should-tip pain following laparoscopic surgery.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All the patients will receive laparoscopic surgery using carbon dioxide (CO2 ) gas as
      distension medium. At the end of the surgery, in the control group C, CO2 was removed by
      passive exsufflation through the port site. In the intervention group A, at the end of the
      surgery, the upper part of the abdominal cavity was evenly and bilaterally filled with the
      0.9% normal saline in the amount of 500 cc. We will leave the fluid in the abdominal cavity.
      Then, patients will be placed in the Trendelenburg position (30 degrees), and a pulmonary
      recruitment maneuver consisting of five manual pulmonary inflations was performed with a
      maximum pressure of 60 cm H2O. The anesthesiologists held the fifth positive pressure
      inflation for approximately 5 seconds. During these maneuvers, the surgeon was instructed to
      ensure that the trocar sleeve valve was fully open to allow the CO2 gas to escape.

      In the intervention group B, at the end of the surgery, the upper part of the abdominal
      cavity was evenly and bilaterally filled with the 0.9% normal saline in the amount of 500 cc.
      We will leave the fluid in the abdominal cavity.

      Patients will be asked to fill out questionnaires up to 48 hours to determine the frequency
      and severity of their shoulder and upper abdominal pain. The scores will be assessed 12, 24,
      48 hours after surgery using a visual analogue scale( VAS) from 0 ( no pain) to 10 ( worst
      possible pain).
