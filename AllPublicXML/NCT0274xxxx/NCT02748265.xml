    <textblock>
      This is a pilot study of a new use of Epoprostenol via inhalation (Epoprostenol is approved
      for intravenous use). The purpose of this study is to administered inhaled Epoprostenol and
      intravenous Phenylephrine to improve arterial oxygen tension during one-lung anesthesia
      either with volatile anesthesia (Sevoflurane) or with intravenous anesthesia (Propofol).

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients undergoing esophagectomy via video assisted thoracoscopy surgery or open
             thoracotomy.

          -  Patients greater than eighteen years old that have the capacity to provide consent.

          -  Patients who weigh 89kg or less.

          -  Patients with a preoperative platelet count &gt; 100,000mm3

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Contraindication or allergy to any of the study drugs e.g. epoprostenol,
             phenylephrine, sevoflurane or propofol.

          -  Spirometry: Force expiratory Volume (FEV1) less than 80% predicted for age. Patients
             with spirometry indicative of obstructive lung disease are less likely to develop
             hypoxemia during OLV compared to patients with normal spirometry . These patients are
             likely to have a smaller treatment effect if any.

          -  A history of a bleeding diathesis.

          -  Use of a platelet inhibitor within the last seven days e.g. Aspirin, clopidogrel
