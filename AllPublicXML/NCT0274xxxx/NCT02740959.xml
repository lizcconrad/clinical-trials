      This study is for an &quot;add-on&quot; study to the &quot;main&quot; study (Protocol No.: PH-CP012). The
      information of patients from main study will be collected by questionnaire survey and
      actigraphy measurement to evaluate the relationship between fatigue, depression and sleep
      disorder and the efficacy of PG2 after treatment.The association between symptom cluster and
      circadian rhythm will be also further explored.

      The study is &quot;PG2 Treatment for Improving Fatigue among Advanced Cancer Patients under
      Standard Palliative Care&quot; (Protocol Number: PH-CP012) of the additional plan, through
      questionnaires and using actigraphy measuring circadian rhythm collect patient data master
      plans, assessed for &quot;PG2&quot; treatment of cancer patients before and after treatment fatigue,
      depression, sleep disorders and other related symptoms of resistance and the effectiveness of
      treatment, and to further explore the symptom clusters in cancer patients associated with the
      circadian rhythm
