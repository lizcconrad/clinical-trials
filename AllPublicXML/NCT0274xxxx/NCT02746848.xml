      For severe ocular surface diseases, such as chemical and thermal injuries, Stevens-Johnson
      syndrome (SJS), Band Keratopathy, Corneal Dystrophies, Refractive (PRK-LASEK), corneal
      surgery and others, it is important that short time treatment with minimal side effect should
      be considered. This study is a prospective clinical trial to use Amniotic Membrane Extract
      Eye Drop (AMEED) as a natural substance for acceleration of corneal healing

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The cornea is the specific anterior part of eye that is essential for normal vision. The
      corneal surface is comprised of a unique type of non-keratinized epithelial cell. Corneal
      epithelium contains transient amplifying cells and post mitotic cells. The limbal stem cells
      (LSC) are located between limbal cornea and conjunctiva which are main source of corneal
      epithelium healing in eye injuries. For some corneal disease such as chemical and thermal
      injuries, Corneal Dystrophies and corneal surgery, treatment in short time is important.

      AM can modulate corneal epithelium healing by promoting re-epithelialization and migration of
      limbal stem cell while suppressing stromal inflammation, angiogenesis and scarring. This
      biological substrate maintain epithelial progenitor cells within the limbal stem cell niche
      and facilitate ocular surface epithelial renewal. It is well accepted that amniotic membrane
      Transplantation (AMT) as a temporary patch normally dissolves within 2 weeks. Consequent
      reapplication of membrane is difficult for the patient.

      Other studies have been reported that processed AM as a liquid has comparable effect to AMT
      in treatment of corneal epithelial healing.

      This study is a prospective clinical trial to use Amniotic Membrane Extract Eye Drop (AMEED)
      as a natural substance for acceleration of corneal healing.
