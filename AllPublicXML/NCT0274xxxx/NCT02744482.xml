      This is an experimental study, prospective, comparative. This clinical trial is randomized
      and double-blind, Residronate versus placebo.

      The study aims to demonstrate the effectiveness of risedronate in pain management, after 18
      month of traitment, in patients undergoing aseptic joint prosthesis loosening. 2 groups were
      compared with a 1: 1 ratio. The first group receives active drug (risedronate 75mg) and the
      second a placebo.

      Patients are treated during 18 months: 1 tablet residronate/placebo per os two consecutive
      days each month.

      Evaluations are planned evry 6 months.
