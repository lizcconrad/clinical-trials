  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to estimate the effect of a probiotic dairy drink on occurrence and
      duration of AAD and gastrointestinal symptoms during Helicobacter pylori (Hp) eradication
      therapy and during 4 weeks thereafter and calculating the sample size for a confirmatory
      study.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Helicobacter p. positive subjects aged ≥18 years with an indication for Helicobacter pylori
      (Hp) eradication recommended by a gastroenterologist should be included in the study.
      Subjects should be willing to consume 2 servings of the study product per day for 6 weeks,
      and to undergo an Hp eradication therapy for 14 days starting with the consumption period.
