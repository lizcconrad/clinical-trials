      Purpose: of determining the role of Interactive Binocular Treatment (I-BiTTM) as a
      complementary method of patching in amblyopia therapy.

      Materials and Methods: In this randomized clinical trial study, 50 unilateral amblyopic
      children (25 male/25 female) less than 10 years with either best corrected visual acuity
      (BCVA) ≤0.3 LogMAR (Logarithm minimum angle of resolution) in amblyopic eye or difference of
      VA≥2 lines between two eyes will be included. Patients will be classified in the case and
      control groups (25 in each), randomly. Patching will be recommended in both, cases will also
      received I-BiTTM. The child will be asked to play I-BiTTM games through glasses with
      conjugate colored filters. Patching was continued for one month more in both groups. VA and
      stereoacuity were measured at baseline, one month at the end of I-BiTTM treatment and one
      month after I-BiTTM treatment.

      In this clinical trial study, our case group will receive I-BiTTM in the format of three
      playing games which have been designed suitable to the age of our cases. The mechanism of
      I-BiTTM has been designed in three playing games with inducing more foveal stimulation for
      the amblyopic eye through presentation of movable targets with more detailed. In addition,
      unmovable targets will presented to the non-amblyopic eyes. Playing games were continued 30
      minutes in each session for 5 days in each week within one month.
