    <textblock>
      The study will ascertain the ability of preschool lung function tests to distinguish healthy
      children from those with wheeze, and to differentiate phenotypes of wheezy children (high and
      low risk for asthma as defined by API) in order to predict response to therapy, and to
      explore the correlation between preschool lung function test results and symptoms, in order
      to develop objective methods for monitoring asthma.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In Canada, the most common chronic disease of childhood is asthma. Childhood asthma places a
      significant burden on the health care system (refn). No objective preschool asthma diagnostic
      tools exist, and the current gold-standard, the Asthma Predictive Index, does not provide
      information about lung function and symptom management. In this study, it is hypothesized
      that the lung clearance index (LCI), a value derived from the multiple breath washout test,
      will be the most sensitive, responsive discriminative test for preschool asthma. If it proves
      useful in the monitoring and diagnosis of preschool asthma, LCI has the potential to improve
      the clinical management and thus potentially significantly reduce hospitalization rates for
      preschool children suffering with asthma. In this unique data set, the investigators will
      also compare the relative utility of the forced oscillation technique (FOT) and preschool
      spirometry with the LCI in order to detect abnormalities amongst those children at high risk
      for preschool asthma. In addition, the impact of sleep apnea as a risk factor for and
      modifier of asthma will be investigated in this study. Furthermore, changes to the
      composition of the nasal microbiome during and after a wheezing episodes and the role of
      viral infections in wheezing exacerbations will be explored. Finally, the utility of new
      methods of diagnosing food allergy, such as the basophil activation test, will be examined in
      this Canadian cohort.

    <description>Two study visits will be completed with wheezing subjects. The baseline visit will be completed within a 5 day window from the child's discharge from the emergency department. The follow-up visit will be completed 3 months after the baseline visit. At both visits, participants will provide a nasal swab and urine sample, complete three breathing tests: multiple-breath washout, forced oscillation technique, and Spirometry. In addition, at the follow-up visit, children will have an allergy skin test done, a nasal brush to collect epithelial cells and provide a blood sample. Whole blood will be used for basophil activation test (BAT). Children age 4+ will also complete post-bronchodilator testing using Salbutamol to capture information about bronchodilator response.</description>
