  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a naturalistic study of 100 migraineurs and 75 post concussive headache patients who
      will be asked to record their headaches, medications, sleep and other behaviors in a
      smartphone app called Curelator. The software was developed to identify possible headache
      triggers. We seek to determine whether there might be protective headache factors. Patients
      will be given audio files with relaxation therapies. We seek to understand whether this self
      relaxation therapy and/or traditional evidence based behavioral treatment recommended during
      a patient visit is protective against migraine attacks.

      Patients will be given a link to audio files on dropbox which they can download onto their
      smartphone. They consist of breathing techniques, imaging, progressive relaxation, and more.
      Patients will be asked to perform 20 minutes of relaxation therapy at least 3 times a week.
      Patients will record their headache frequency and intensity, in addition to other symptoms,
      and the frequency of practicing the behavioral therapy using Curelator Headache. ™ Curelator
      Inc. (Cambridge USA) has developed a proprietary, non-pharmaceutical, digital platform,
      called Curelator Headache,™ to collect daily data, identify trigger-attack associations and
      propose 'tests' of trigger modification.

      The Curelator approach requires high quality data from the individual, entered on a daily
      basis. Compliance is expected to be enhanced because the study if being offered by the
      individual's healthcare provider.

      This a pilot study of an initial 90 days use of a digital platform to identify potential
      migraine protective factors (Curelator Headache™) in subjects with physician-diagnosed
      episodic or chronic migraine or post-concussive headache. Subjects are recruited to Curelator
      Headache use by a physician and enter data each day. The baseline period (90 days) is
      followed by a test period (90 days) during which, under Curelator guidance, subjects make one
      or more modifications to their behaviors based on the data from the 90 day period.

      The study will include up to 100 patients with chronic or episodic migraine and 75 patients
      with postconcussive headache. At clinics, investigators will offer participation to
      consecutive migraine patients with 6-20 headache days a month and to consecutive concussion
      patients complaining of headache more than 1 month post concussive event.

    <description>This will be analyzed by means of univariate Cox Proportional Hazards (PH) models. At the end of the study period (Day 90) significant trigger factors (HR/RR&gt;1 and p-value ≤ 0.05) will be identified for each individual: the number and percentage of subjects with at least one significant relationship between a trigger and occurrence of migraine attacks and the number of trigger-migraine attack significant relationships per individual will be estimated by means of descriptive statistics.</description>
