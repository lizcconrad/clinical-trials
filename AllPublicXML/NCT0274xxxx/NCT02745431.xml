      In a double-blind, between-subject, placebo controlled design study, the researchers aimed to
      investigate the intranasal OXT (40IU) treatment on rating response after being liked or
      disliked in healthy male subjects. All subjects completed a range of questionnaires measuring
      personality and affective traits and levels of anxiety: Positive and Negative Affect Schedule
      (PANAS) , State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) , Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), Cheek and
      Buss shyness Scale (CBSS),Autism Spectrum Quotient (ASQ), Empathy Quotient(EQ) before
      self-administration.Study participants were led to believe that other participants had formed
      an opinion on their likability based on their appearance in a photograph and they passively
      viewed the responses (like or dislike) from 'other participants'. After that, they rated
      'other participants' about likeability (how much do you like the person), accuracy (have you
      seen the person), feeling (how good do you feel), and tendency (how much would do like have
      him/her as a friend). Likeability, tendency, feeling and accuracy were included into analysis
      as dependent variables.
