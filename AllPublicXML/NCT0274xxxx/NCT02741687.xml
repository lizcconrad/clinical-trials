  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare sitagliptin with a placebo for the prevention of high
      glucose after general surgery.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Approximately 30-40% of hospitalized patients will develop stress hyperglycemia (high glucose
      in response to surgery or illness). High glucose is linked to an increased risk of hospital
      complications including wound infection, kidney failure and death. Patients with high glucose
      are treated with insulin given through an arm vein or by frequent insulin injections under
      the skin.

      Sitagliptin is an oral medication approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to treat
      patients with diabetes. The aim of this study is to determine whether treatment with
      sitagliptin once daily can prevent the development of stress hyperglycemia during the
      postoperative period in non-diabetic patients undergoing general surgery.

    <description>Participants will receive sitagliptin beginning the day prior to surgery and continuing daily during hospitalization (up to 10 days post-surgery).
Point of care (POC) testing will be done four times daily, before meals and at bedtime, or every 6 hours for patients who are not eating (NPO). Patients developing hyperglycemia during or after surgery will be treated with insulin per standard of care.
Patients with fasting and/or premeal blood glucose levels &gt;180 mg/dl will receive supplemental insulin provided on a sliding scale. Patients with two consecutive fasting and/or premeal blood glucose levels &gt;180 mg/dl, or with average daily blood glucose levels &gt;180 mg/dl will be started on rescue therapy with subcutaneous insulin once daily plus correction doses by a sliding scale.</description>

    <description>Supplemental insulin lispro will be administered before meals, in addition to scheduled insulin dose, following the supplemental insulin scale protocol.
