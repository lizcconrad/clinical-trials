    <textblock>
      This study evaluates a nutritional supplement in the treatment of pancreatic cancer in
      adults. Half of the participants will receive the nutritional supplement, while the other
      half will receive a placebo.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with a newly diagnosed pancreatic tumor thought to be pancreatic cancer
             scheduled for resection of the tumor.

          -  Patients with a newly diagnosed pancreatic tumor thought to be pancreatic cancer,
             subsequently found to have biliary or ampullary cancer upon full pathological review,
             scheduled for resection of the tumor.

          -  Patients with a CT image, which includes scans of the 3rd lumbar region, taken within
             45 days before tumor resection surgery.

          -  Ability to maintain oral intake.

          -  Ability to give written, informed consent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients found to have a diagnosis other than pancreatic, biliary, or ampullary cancer
             upon full pathological review.

          -  Patients with a benign tumor.

          -  Patients taking drugs that modify muscle metabolism.

          -  Patients with uncontrolled jaundice.

          -  A compliance rate of &lt;80%, excluding compliance during recovery from tumor resection
             surgery while in the hospital.

          -  Patients currently taking the nutritional supplement being investigated in this study.

          -  Patients in the placebo group who have plasma levels of the nutritional supplement
             components within the range of the nutritional supplement group at study time points
             when plasma levels of the nutritional supplement components are significantly higher
             in the nutritional supplement group versus the placebo group.

          -  Inadequate specimens.

          -  Known allergy to gelatin or glycerin.
