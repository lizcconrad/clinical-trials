  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, single-blinded, controlled phase 1 study to demonstrate feasibility and
      explore the neurophysiologic and clinical effects of repetitive transcranial magnetic
      stimulation (TMS) interventions in epilepsy patients and healthy controls. The inclusion of a
      control group will be used to see whether epilepsy patients, who suffer from a higher degree
      of comorbid memory difficulty presumably from entorhinal-hippocampal dysfunction, can benefit
      from a TMS intervention can benefit as much as a healthy matched population. Investigators
      will also be looking at functional connectivity between the hippocampus and cortical regions

             subjects.

          -  Must be able to provide informed consent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Any history of a neurological disorder

          -  Chronic or progressive medical condition

          -  Any history of severe traumatic brain injury or skull defect

          -  Metal or devices in the head, including neurostimulators of metal foreign bodies

          -  Any other implanted metal device, including pacemaker, spinal cord stimulator, VNS.

          -  Any other ferromagnetic substance in the body (including tattoos, dental prosthetics,
             etc).

          -  Taking a medication which may lower the seizure threshold within the 4 weeks prior to
             the start of the study, including use of neuroleptic (esp. clozapine), antibiotic
             (penicillin, cephalosporins), and bronchodilating medications.
