      Primary Objective of this study: To assess experimental heat pain responses (pain intensity,
      pain unpleasantness, pain catastrophizing, emotional reactivity) in migraineurs vs. healthy
      controls.

      The current tools of migraine pain measurement are inadequate to distinguish the overall
      burden of suffering, as there is an over reliance on a single numerical pain score to
      represent the entire pain experience. Measuring and targeting the affective component, in
      addition to the sensory component of pain, may capture this discrepancy in disease burden.
      The affective component of migraine pain may be just as important as the sensory component to
      target and measure since it significantly impacts outcomes, disability, and has therapeutic
      treatment implications.

      Quantitative sensory testing (QST) is a robust lab paradigm (not a clinical experience) that
      delivers one painful noxious thermal stimuli and asks for simultaneous pain intensity and
      pain unpleasantness scores. By using this in the research, investigators will be able to
      differentiate the sensory (pain quality—what the pain feels like) from the affective (how
      awful/unpleasant the pain feels) components of experimental pain in normal controls vs.
      migrainuers.

      No previous studies have evaluated differences in experimental pain intensity vs. pain
      unpleasantness in migraineurs vs. controls. As migraine pain uniquely involves many altered
      sensory phenomenon (e.g., photophobia, phonophobia), it cannot be assumed that responses to
      experimental pain in migraine will be the same as other clinical pain syndromes. Further,
      different clinical pain syndromes have distinct responses to pain intensity vs. pain
      unpleasantness.

      Investigators will conduct a cross-sectional study in migraineurs (interictally, i.e.,
      between migraine attacks) and healthy controls to compare responses to experimental heat pain
      intensity and unpleasantness and correlate these results to differences in emotional
      reactivity and pain catastrophizing.
