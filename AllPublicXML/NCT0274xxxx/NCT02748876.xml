  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cardiac resynchronisation therapy (CRT) is a specialised type of pacemaker used in patients
      with severe heart failure to improve symptoms and survival. Approximately one third of
      patients treated with CRT do not notice significant improvement in their symptoms and this
      may be due to inadequate co-ordination between the upper and lower chambers of the heart
      (atrioventricular dyssynchrony).

      The investigators propose a new method to achieve atrioventricular synchrony in CRT based on
      measurements of electrical conduction from within the heart. Patients referred for CRT
      implantation at Castle Hill Hospital are eligible to participate. During CRT implantation,
      additional measurements, will be recorded from within the heart. After implantation, device
      settings will be adjusted to either standard or electrophysiologically-optimised settings
      with cross-over at 4 months.

      The investigators hypothesis is that patients with optimised settings will derive additional
      benefit compared to patients with standard pacemaker-determined settings.
