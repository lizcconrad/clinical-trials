    <textblock>
      In patients with IDH1-R132X-mutant solid tumors treated with BAY1436032:

        1. Determine the safety, tolerability, maximum tolerated dose (MTD) or recommended phase II
           dose (RP2D) of BAY1436032;

        2. Evaluate the pharmacokinetic (PK) properties and pharmacodynamic (PD) effects of
           BAY1436032;

        3. Look for preliminary evidence of clinical efficacy in patients treated with BAY1436032;

        4. Evaluate effect of standard high-fat, high calorie meal on the PK of BAY1436032.

    <description>Dose escalation: Patients with any type of IDH1-R132X-mutant solid tumor may be eligible for enrollment. BAY1436032 tablets will be administered continuously in 21-day cycles. The starting dose is 300 mg/day (150 mg twice daily) and a minimum of 3 patients per cohort will be treated. If dose limiting toxicities (DLTs) occur, Bayesian dose-DLT modeling will be performed to help guide dosing decisions and to identify the maximum tolerated dose (MTD). If the MTD is not reached, a recommended phase II dose (RP2D) will be chosen based on available safety, tolerability, PK, PD and clinical efficacy data.
Dose expansion: The dose and schedule that was determined to be most appropriate in the dose escalation part of the study, which may be the MTD and / or the RP2D, will be used. Cohorts will consist of patients with the following IDH-R132X-mutant tumor types: (1) anaplastic glioma; (2) glioblastoma; (3) intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma; (4) tumor types other than those in Cohorts 1-3.</description>
