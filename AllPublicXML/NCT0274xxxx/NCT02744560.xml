  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Thalassemics can develop liver fibrosis because of iron overload and hepatitis C infection.
      The latter is the main risk factor for liver fibrosis in transfusion dependent thalassemics.
      Excess liver iron is clearly recognized as a co factor for the development of advanced
      fibrosis in patients with hepatitis virus C infection. Magnetic resonance imaging represents
      the most available noninvasive technique to assess the level of iron in the liver.there is
      evidence that suggests Spirulina may help to protect against liver damage, cirrhosis and
      liver failure in those with chronic liver disease.
