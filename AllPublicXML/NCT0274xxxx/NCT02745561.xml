      Endostatin inhibits the pro-angiogenic action of basic fibroblast growth factor and vascular
      endothelial growth factor in esophageal cancer.This study aims at assessing the efficacy and
      safety of endostatin combined with concurrent chemoradiotherapy with Oxaliplatin in
      esophageal cancer patients.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Cytologically or histologically confirmed esophageal carcinoma

          2. Age of 18 -80

          3. ECOG performance status: 0-1;

          4. No treatments prior to enrollment;

          5. At least one measurable lesion on CT, MRI or esophageal barium exam;

          6. Normal functions of heart, lung, liver, kidney and bone marrow Blood exams qualified
             for chemotherapy, which included hemoglobulin ≥9 g/dl, neutrophil ≥1.5×109/L and
             platelet (PLT) ≥100×109/L, creatinine ≤1.5 UNL

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Prior treatments of chemotherapy or irradiation;

          2. Poor bone marrow, liver and kidney functions, which would make chemotherapy
             intolerable;

          3. Contraindication for irradiation: complete obstruction of esophagus, deep esophageal
             ulcer, fistula to mediastinum, or haematemesis;

          4. Participating in other clinical trials;

          5. Pregnancy, breast feeding, or not adopting birth control;

          6. Clinically significant and uncontrolled major medical conditions including but not
             limited to: active uncontrolled infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure,
             Unstable angina pectoris or cardiac arrhythmia, psychiatric illness/ social situation
             that would limit compliance with study requirements; any medical condition, which in
             the opinion of the study investigator places the subject at an unacceptably high risk
             for toxicities

          7. The subject has had another active malignancy within the past five years except for
             cervical cancer in site, in situ carcinoma of the bladder or non-melanoma carcinoma of
             the skin;
