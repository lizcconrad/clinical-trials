  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Clinical definitions of acute kidney injury (AKI) have been based on an increase in serum
      creatinine and a decrease in urine output. However, applying this definition to neonates
      remains challenging because of the normal renal physiologic features that serum creatinine
      levels are expected to increase in the first days after birth, and impaired sodium
      reabsorption and concentrating ability.

      Because of several limitations of early detection of AKI, investigators are focused on
      identifying biomarkers that predict AKI before an increase serum creatinine level.

      Investigators will collect urine from preterm infants before and after administrating
      ibuprofen for closing patent ductus arteriosus. To identify novel biomarkers, investigators
      will analyze urine by proteomics. To verify those biomarkers, investigators will use initial
      urine on the first day of life from preterm infants who diagnosed AKI within 7 days after
      birth without any risk factors for AKI and enrolled institutional bio-repository.
