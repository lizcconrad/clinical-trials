      This study is to evaluate the prevalence of chronic endometritis (CE) in women with severe
      intrauterine adhesions and compare recurrence of adhesion in women with and without CE.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Chronic endometritis (CE) is a persistent in endometrium that is characterized by the
      presence of plasma cells. Recently, there has been increasing interest in the role of CE in
      recurrent pregnancy loss (RPL). One of the most common uterine abnormalities for RPL is
      Intrauterine adhesion (IUA).Intrauterine adhesion, also known as Asherman's syndrome, is the
      partial or complete occlusion of the uterine cavity as a result of endometrium damage. Most
      intrauterine adhesions patients manifest amenorrhea, reduced menstrual pattern, infertility,
      and intrauterine growth restriction, which seriously affect their reproductive health.It is
      well established that the formation of IUA likely involves hypoxia, reduced
      neovascularization, and altered expression of adhesion-associated cytokines, but the exact
      mechanisms are not well understood. Although excessive curettage is considered the primary
      cause, intrauterine adhesion is known to be associated with diverse non-traumatic factors,
      such as postabortal sepsis, puerperal sepsis and infections. It is therefore possible to
      hypothesize that Intrauterine adhesion may be related to chronic endometritis. To the best of
      researchers knowledge,there have been no reports investigating this relationship. The aim of
      this study was to clarify the hypothesis by evaluating the prevalence of chronic endometritis
      (CE) in women with severe intrauterine adhesions and compare recurrence of adhesion in women
      with and without chronic endometritis (CE).

    <description>Second-look hysteroscopy was carried out in the early proliferative phase, 1 to 3 months after the initial operation.After assessment of the extent and severity of any reformed adhesions, hysteroscopic adhesiolysis was also carried out at the time of the second-look procedure, if adhesions had recurred.</description>

    <description>The severity and extent of intrauterine adhesions were scored according to a classification system recommended by the American Fertility Society (AFS) (1988 version) [7]. A score of 1-4 was considered to represent mild adhesions, a score of 5-8 was considered to represent moderate adhesions and a score of 9-12 represented severe adhesions.</description>

        with moderate to severe Intrauterine adhesion according to the criteria of American
        Fertility Society (AFS) were recruited into present study.
