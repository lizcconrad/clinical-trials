  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this research is to evaluate the relationships between multiple data
      from cochlear implant (CI) adult users to and to estimate predictive models of their fitting
      parameters. In a group of patients, the Electrically-evoked Compound Action Potentials (ECAP)
      will be collected intra-operatively and the correlation with demographic data (deafness
      duration, age deafness onset, etiology, duration of cochlear implant use of CI), auditory
      performances and subjective measures used for implant fitting (hearing threshold and most
      comfortable level) will be calculated. In a second group of experienced users (more than
      9months of use of their CI), ECAP and Electrically-evoked Auditory Brainstem Response (EABR)
      will be collected after 9 months of CI experience and after 12 months or more of use.
      Correlation analyzes with demographic data, performance and fitting parameters will be
      performed as well. Statistical predictive models for both fitting at the activation or in
      experienced users should be developed according to the correlation analysis.

      The secondary objective is to evaluate the effects of simultaneous stimulation on hearing
      performances. Simultaneous stimulations will be delivered in one ear (bimodal condition) in
      patients using an Electro-Acoustic Stimulation device (EAS) or in the two ears (binaural
      condition) for bilateral CI users. ECAP, EABR and speech perception will be measured and
      compared in the different conditions.
