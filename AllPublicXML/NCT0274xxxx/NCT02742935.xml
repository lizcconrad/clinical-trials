    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, single center, non-randomized, dose escalation phase I trial to
      evaluate safety and tolerability of SHR-1210 in patients with advanced solid tumors. The
      primary objective is to assess safety and tolerability of SHR-1210 and identify recommended
      phase II doses of SHR-1210 in patients with advanced solid tumors.

      This is an open-label, single center, nonrandomized, dose-escalation Phase 1 study to
      evaluate safety and tolerability of SHR-1210 in subjects with advanced Solid Tumors who have
      failed current standard antitumor therapies.

      The safety and tolerability of SHR-1210 will be assessed by ongoing reviews of clinical
      laboratory tests, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status, physical
      examination, electrocardiogram (ECG), and adverse events. Evaluations of immune safety will
      also be conducted (immune-related AEs, or labs of autoimmune sera, inflammatory events, and
      immunogenicity). Safety evaluations (both clinical and laboratory) are performed at baseline,
      before each study treatment, and throughout the study.

      Efficacy will be assessed every 8 weeks. The study consists of 3 periods: screening (up to 14
      days before the first dose), treatment, and follow-up (up to 3 months after the last dose of
      study treatment).
