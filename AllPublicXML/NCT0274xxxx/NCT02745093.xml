      The purpose of this study is to assess the effectiveness, safety, and acceptability of
      home-administered medical abortion at gestational age of 8 to ≤9 weeks versus &gt;9 to ≤12 weeks
      among a cohort of women in Mexico City.

    <textblock>
      Medical abortion represents an important alternative to surgical methods for termination of
      early pregnancy. In Mexico City, abortion is legal on request up to 12 weeks of gestation;
      however, medical abortion is currently only offered up to 10 weeks at Marie Stopes Mexico
      clinics. The World Health Organization guidelines state that medical abortion drugs may be
      used to terminate pregnancy up to a gestational age of 24 weeks in clinical settings, with
      recommended regimens differing by gestational age. However, data are lacking on the safety
      and effectiveness of home-based medical abortion regimens for pregnancy terminations between
      &gt;9 and ≤12 weeks' gestation. Investigators propose a prospective cohort study with women
      between 8 and ≤9 weeks and &gt;9 and ≤12 weeks of pregnancy at Marie Stopes Mexico clinics to
      compare the effectiveness, safety, and acceptability of mifepristone followed by home-based
      misoprostol use in these two gestational age groups. The information from this study will
      inform policy and practice guidelines in Mexico City and potentially other locations by
      providing evidence on the safety, effectiveness, and acceptability of home-use of medical
      abortion between &gt;9 and ≤12 weeks of gestation.
