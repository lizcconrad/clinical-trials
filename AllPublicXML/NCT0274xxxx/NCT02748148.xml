      The purpose of this study is to identify challenges and successes associated with
      implementing an enhanced medication therapy management service in primary care practice.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The specific aim of this study is to implement a Medication Therapy Management (MTM) service
      in primary care that is enhanced by the incorporation of pharmacogenomics (PGx) and
      medication risk mitigation (MRM) factor technology and is standardized by a systematic
      approach to evidence- and personalized-based medicine. The primary objective is to implement
      the systematic approach to delivering an enhanced MTM service in a primary care setting.
      Secondary objectives include: determine how successful the communication between prescriber
      and pharmacist is within implementing the service, determine how PGx testing can be
      incorporated into primary care prescribers' daily work flow, determine if patients are
      receptive to PGx testing, determine how satisfied prescribers are with an enhanced MTM
      clinical service and their confidence to conduct on their own, and determine if enhanced MTM
      optimizes or changes drug therapy for patients.
