      This is a neuroimaging study designed to learn more about amyloid and tau burden in the brain
      of patients with Atypical Alzheimer's Disease and how burden may change over a one year
      period.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Over the age of 21

          -  Must have an informant who will be able to provide independent evaluation of
             functioning

          -  English is primary language

          -  All subjects must have insidious onset, report progression of their symptoms, and meet
             current clinical diagnostic criteria for Logopenic Aphasia (LPA) or Posterior Cortical
             Atrophy (PCA).

          -  All subjects with Logopenic Aphasia (LPA) must present with early and dominant
             impairments in language

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  If you have had a stroke or tumor that could explain your symptoms

          -  Subjects that present with early episodic memory impairment or meet clinical criteria
             for mild cognitive impairment will not be recruited into the study

          -  Subjects that meet specific criteria for another neurodegenerative disorder, including
             behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia, semantic dementia, primary progressive
             apraxia of speech, probable corticobasal syndrome, or progressive supranuclear palsy,
             will be excluded

          -  Subjects will be excluded if they have poor vision (20/400)

          -  Women that are pregnant or post-partum and breast-feeding will be excluded

          -  Subjects will be excluded from the study if they are unable to undergo the tau-PET
             scan due to a prolonged QT interval on ECG, or if they have any of the following
             genetic conditions which can increase the chance of cancer: Cowden disease, Lynch
             syndrome, hypogammaglobulinemia, Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome, and Down's syndrome

          -  Subjects will also be excluded if MRI is contraindicated (metal in head, cardiac pace
             maker, e.t.c.), if there is severe claustrophobia, if there are conditions that may
             confound brain imaging studies (e.g. structural abnormalities, including subdural
             hematoma or intracranial neoplasm), or if they are medically unstable or are on
             medications that might affect brain structure or metabolism,(e.g. chemotherapy)
