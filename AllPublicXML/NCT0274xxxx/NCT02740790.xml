      Evaluate immunogenicity and safety of recombinant human papillomavirus bivalent ( types 16
      and 18 ) vaccine ( Yeast )in different age group. And evaluate persistence of immune response
      in 9-17years age group. To demonstrate that 9-17years age group was non-inferior to 18-26
      years age group and 27-45 years age group in terms of immunogenicity.

      This study is a multi-centre, randomized, blinded, placebo controlled study. The study
      vaccine is recombinant human papillomavirus bivalent (types 16 and 18) vaccine (Yeast), the
      placebo is aluminium phosphate diluent.

      After informed and received the consent of participants/guardians, 1200 healthy females aged
      9-45 will be enrolled into three age groups: 9-17, 8-26, 27-45. With the proportion of 1:1,
      vaccine group and placebo group will receive injection of 0.5ml of vaccine or placebo
      diluent.

      Participants will be injected of vaccine or placebo on a three-dose schedule (0, 2, 6
      months). After each inoculation, the immediate reaction will be observed for 30 minutes, and
      the local and systemic reaction will be systematically observed for 7 days. After the first
      inoculation, adverse event will be collected until one month after the final inoculation,
      while serious adverse event will be collected until 6 months after the final inoculation. For
      every participants, blood samples will be collected before the first inoculation (month 0),
      one month after the final inoculation (month 7), 6 months after the final inoculation (month
      12) to detect the neutralizing antibody of HPV type 16 and 18, and proceed safety and
      immunogenicity analysis. For participants in 9-14 age group who received the vaccine,
      neutralizing antibody will also be detected in month 24, 36 and 48 to examine the immune
      persistency. Meanwhile, some participants will be chosen to study the deviation of gene
      expression after the vaccination and the association of that with the neutralizing antibody
      level.
