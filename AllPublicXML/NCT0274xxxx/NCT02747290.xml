  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) study to
      investigate the diagnostic performance and evaluation efficacy of 68Ga-NOTA-BBN-RGD in
      prostate cancer patients. A single dose of 111-148 Mega-Becquerel (MBq) 68Ga-NOTA-BBN-RGD
      will be injected intravenously. Visual and semiquantitative method will be used to assess the
      PET/CT images.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Both GRPR and integrin αvβ3 are overexpressed in neoplastic cells of human prostate cancer.
      To target both receptors, a heterodimeric peptide BBN-RGD was synthesized from bombesin(7-14)
      and c(RGDyK) through a glutamate linker and then labeled with 68Ga. An open-label whole-body
      PET/ CT study was designed to investigate the safety and dosimetry of 68Ga-NOTA-BBN-RGD and
      diagnostic performance of 68Ga-NOTA-BBN-RGD PET/CT in patients with primary and/or metastasis
      prostate cancer.
