    <textblock>
      Thyroid cancers can occur sporadically, but can also be found as tumors that cluster in
      families with other cancers or genetic syndromes. Researchers are studying thyroid cancer in
      children and families, with a particular interest in understanding genes and other factors
      that may put individuals at risk for developing thyroid cancer and thyroid nodules.

        -  In this study, family and medical history information is collected alongside a blood or
           saliva sample for genetic studies.

        -  Individuals with a past or present childhood thyroid cancer/nodule or a thyroid cancer
           suspected to be inherited in their family are invited to participate.

      The purpose of this research study is to learn more about risk factors for inherited thyroid
      cancer.

      The investigators would like to use the participant DNA to look for alterations in genes. The
      investigator will perform DNA sequencing and other genetic studies to identify errors in the
      genes that may contribute to the formation of thyroid nodules and cancer.
