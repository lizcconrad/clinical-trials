    <textblock>
      This phase II trial will investigate the efficacy and safety of the addition of Optune (Tumor
      Treating Fields or TTF Therapy) to bevacizumab for patients with bevacizumab-refractory
      recurrent glioblastoma.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients that have recurrent glioblastoma that has progressed on bevacizumab continue to
      receive bevacizumab with the addition of Tumor Treating Fields Therapy. Treatment is given
      until disease progression or the development of adverse events that require complete
      discontinuation.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Histologically proven diagnosis of glioblastoma or other grade IV malignant glioma
             (including variants of glioblastoma i.e., gliosarcoma, giant cell glioblastoma, etc.).

          -  Confirmation of tumor recurrence or progression on contrast MRI (with and without
             gadolinium contrast) as determined by RANO criteria within 14 days prior to
             registration for patients who did not have recent resection of their glioblastoma or
             only had a stereotactic biopsy.

          -  Patients having undergone recent resection (within 5 weeks prior to registration) of
             their glioblastoma to treat current recurrence prior to study treatment must have
             recovered from the effects of surgery (including patient's skin having fully recovered
             from the surgical wound) Note: a 4-week window is required after surgery prior to
             starting treatment. For CNS-related stereotactic biopsies, a minimum of 7 days must
             have elapsed prior to registration.

          -  Residual disease of recurrent glioblastoma is not mandated for eligibility into the
             study. To best assess the extent of residual disease post-operatively, a
             post-operative MRI scan must be performed prior to registration and is recommended to
             be within 96 hours post-surgery (although 24-48 hours would be optimum). Note:
             Patients who did have surgery with a post-operative contrast-enhanced scan falling
             outside the 5-week window prior to registration, must have a repeat MRI scan within 14
             days prior to registration.

          -  Patients with up to two recurrences are allowed.

          -  Failure on bevacizumab (either as a monotherapy or a combination) as most recent
             regimen confirmed by tumor recurrence on MRI.

               -  The patient must have failed no more than one regimen of bevacizumab.

               -  The patient must not have received bevacizumab as an upfront treatment in newly
                  diagnosed glioblastoma.

               -  There must be a minimum of 14 days (i.e., an interval equal to or greater than 14
                  days) since last treatment with bevacizumab and registration

          -  History/physical examination within 14 days prior to registration

          -  Karnofsky performance status ≥ 70 within 14 days prior to registration

          -  Age ≥ 22

          -  Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥ 1,000 cells/mm3

          -  Platelets ≥ 75,000 cells/mm3

          -  Hemoglobin ≥ 9.0 g/dl (Note: The use of transfusion or other intervention to achieve
             Hgb ≥ 9.0 g/dl is acceptable.)

          -  Creatinine ≤ 1.5 mg/dl

          -  Urine protein: creatinine (UPC) ratio &lt; 1.0 within 14 days prior to registration OR
             urine dipstick for proteinuria ≤ 2+ (patients discovered to have &gt; 2+ proteinuria on
             dipstick urinalysis at baseline must have a UPC ratio done that is &lt;1.0 to be
             eligible. If the UPC ratio is ≥ 1.0 then the patients should undergo a 24-hour urine
             collection and must demonstrate ≤ 1g of protein in 24 hours to be eligible).

             *Note: UPC ratio of spot urine is an estimation of the 24-hour urine protein
             excretion; a UPC ratio of 1 is roughly equivalent to a 24-hour urine protein of 1 gm.
             UPC ratio is calculated using one of the following formulas:

               -  [urine protein]/[urine creatinine]: if both protein and creatinine are reported
                  in mg/dL

               -  [(urine protein) x0.088]/[urine creatinine]: if urine creatinine is reported in
                  mmol/L

          -  Serum total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x upper limit of normal (ULN) within 14 days prior to
             registration

          -  ALT and AST ≤ 3.0 x ULN within 14 days prior to registration

          -  Patients on full dose anticoagulants (e.g., warfarin or LMW heparin) must meet both of
             the following criteria:

               1. No active bleeding or pathological condition that carries a high risk of bleeding
                  (e.g., tumor involving major vessels or known varices) within 14 days prior to
                  registration

               2. One of the below criteria must be met based on patient's therapy:

                    1. Warfarin: In-range INR (usually between 2 and 3) within 14 days prior to
                       registration

                    2. Low molecular weight heparin or Novel oral anti-coagulant: stable dose
                       within 14 days prior to registration

          -  Patients must have recovered from the toxic effects of prior therapy at the time of
             registration as follows:

               -  28 days from the administration of any investigational agent

               -  28 days from administration of prior cytotoxic therapy with the following
                  exceptions:

                    -  14 days from administration of vincristine or irinotecan

                    -  42 days from administration of nitrosoureas

                    -  21 days from administration of procarbazine

               -  7 days from administration of non-cytotoxic agents [e.g., interferon, tamoxifen,
                  thalidomide, cis-retinoic acid, etc. (radiosensitizer does not count)]

                    -  Female patients of child-bearing potential must have a negative serum
                       pregnancy test within 14 days prior to registration.

                       for at least 5 days before the baseline scan.

                    -  Minimum interval since completion of radiation treatment at the time of
                       registration is 90 days.
