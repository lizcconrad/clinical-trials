      Patients diagnosed traumatic rib fracture and need admission will be included. Patients will
      be divided two groups.The experimental group will be given parecoxib after visiting emergency
      department. The control group will be given Narcotic agent such as morphine for pain control.
      The outcome such as numerical rating scale (NRS) and hospital length of stay will be
      recorded.

      3.1 Inclusion/exclusion criteria Patients who are diagnosed ribs fracture and need admission.
      Exclusion criteria included heart failure, Coronary artery disease (CAD) history. Traumatic
      cardiac injury and cardiac tamponade will be excluded, too.

      3.2 Group design Patients will be divided two groups, and the experimental group will be
      given parecoxib after visiting emergency department. And they will be kept given after
      admission by intravenous method every 12 hours for 4 days. The control group will be given
      Narcotic agent such as morphine for pain control. The daily dose will be recorded. Finally
      the end outcome will be recorded.

      3.3 Data collection The data of patient's medical history and laboratory results will be
      recorded on pre-designed case report forms (CRFs) by study nurses. In all patients, age,
      gender, diagnosis, co-morbidities, length of hospital and intensive care unit (ICU) stay,
      Injury Severity Score (ISS) score, numerical rating scale (NRS) and outcomes, will be
      recorded. In addition, all microorganisms isolated and antibiotic substances applied will be
      documented.
