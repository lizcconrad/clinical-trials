  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is a lack of sufficient analgesia monitoring apart from surrogate parameters. The
      analgesia nociception index (ANI) shall be evaluated under general and regional anaesthesia.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      While sophisticated haemodynamic monitoring as well as depth of neuromuscular block and
      sedation are established in daily clinical routine monitoring of analgesia remains poorly
      represented. The surgical pleth index (SPI) algorithm takes into account both central and
      peripheral sympathetic tone via the normalised heart beat interval and the plethysmographic
      pulse wave amplitude and has been described before. A more detailed investigation on the SPI
      and its behaviour under a posture maneuver shows the limitation of the device.

      Another device developed calculates the &quot;analgesia nociception index&quot; (ANI) by heart rate
      variability and was launched into the market in 2010. However, the effect of posture - to our
      knowledge - has not yet been studied. The change of body positioning during surgery is
      regularly necessary in order to improve surgical access to anatomic structures. These
      alterations in positioning are known to be accompanied by changes in haemodynamic parameters.

      The aim of this study was to evaluate the ANI in patients undergoing elective surgery in
      lithotomy position.
