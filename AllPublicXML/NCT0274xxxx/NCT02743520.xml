      The purpose of this research study is to learn about arrhythmia detection in obstructive
      sleep apnea (OSA). For several years patients with OSA have an increased likelihood of having
      irregular heartbeats. This study will determine how often patients with OSA have irregular
      heartbeats. This study will also define which OSA patients are most likely to have irregular
      heartbeats.

      The participant is being asked to be in the study because the participant has been diagnosed
      with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA).
