    <textblock>
      This is a pilot study with the purpose of measuring vascular function, assessed by evaluating
      arterial stiffness (pulse wave velocity and augmentation index) and endothelial function
      (flow mediated dilatation), in elite/amateur symptomatic male cyclists with unilateral
      Endofibrosis (EF), compared to asymptomatic males cyclists and to a group of age matched
      healthy males (non-athletes).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Endofibrosis (EF) of the iliac arteries is a non-atheromatous flow-limiting condition
      specific to highly trained athletes. Although the pathophysiology is not well understood,
      haemodynamic injury and mechanical stress are considered to play a key role in developing EF.
      Recurrent exposure to these factors could trigger an arterial remodelling process that
      results in an intravascular lesion such as EF that more resembles an &quot;adaptive intimal
      thickening&quot;. Although the natural history of this condition is not known, it is believed to
      be progressive with increasing numbers of reports of limb threatening ischaemia due to
      dissection and/or thrombosis of the arterial lumen. Therefore, it is imperative to understand
      the pathophysiological mechanism behind this condition in order to develop accurate
      diagnostic and screening criteria/tools for an early identification and characterization of
      EF. As there are no data in the literature supporting this hypothesis, the investigators have
      designed this pilot study to evaluate this hypothesis as to whether athletes with EF have
      evidence of vascular dysfunction in their arteries. There are currently no data on whether
      athletes who develop EF have underlying arterial disease or abnormalities. It is quite
      possible that people who develop EF have an underlying systemic endothelial dysfunction and
      that this may represent a risk factor for the development of the disease. Therefore the
      investigators will study non-invasively endothelial function (measured as flow mediated
      dilatation) as well as arterial stiffness (measured as pulse wave velocity and augmentation
      index) to improve the understanding about the structural and mechanical characteristics of
      the vascular tree in this cohort of patients.
