  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Anterior Cruciate Ligament (ACL) injuries by trauma are a prevalent pathology. In the USA,
      about 200.000 injuries are estimated per year, half of which implicate a total rupture of the
      ligament. Data indicates that the number of ACL injuries is increasing in young athletes and
      presents a common problem, especially people playing agility sports.

      One of the most widely used methods for the post-surgical mobilization after ACL is the use
      of Continuous Passive Motion (CPM) devices. These machines are meant to drain residual fluid
      from the articulation and maintain the mobility of the joint and muscles in the knee. Even
      though studies show that, an early mobilization after surgery is beneficial to the
      rehabilitation of the knee joint, recent studies are questioning the efficiency of the CPM
      when compared with the goal of application. While literature suggests that efficacy of CPM
      are related with the magnitude of knee flexion and the Range of Motion (ROM) achieved some
      studies show that the range of motion measured by the CPM is considerably less than the
      actual ROM.

      As other therapy that provides an effective mobilization of the knee joint, the Specific
      Manual Physical Therapy method (Kaltenborn method) takes in account the physiological
      combination of rotation and gliding of the two joint surfaces. This technique mobilizes the
      femorotibial joint by controlling the tibial plateau anteroposterior during flexion and
      posteroanterior during extension of the knee. Therefore, in the past 30 years there are not
      studies comparing ROM measurements obtained with CPM and manual physical therapy methods.

      It is hypothesized that the benefits of the early passive mobilization after ACL
      reconstructive surgery are diminished by the limited efficacy of currently used CPM devices.
      The aim of our study was to determine the range of motion achieved with the passive
      mobilization using a CPM device compared with a manual method (Kaltenborn method) and to
      assess that ROM measurements provided by the CPM correlates the real ROM.
