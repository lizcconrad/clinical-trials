  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate changes in erectile function (EF) before
      versus after 8 bi-weekly treatments of Low-Intensity Extracorporeal Shock Wave Therapy
      (LIESWT) via IIEF-EF (the Erectile Function domain of the International Index of Erectile
      Function) scores.

    <textblock>
      The secondary objectives of this study are to evaluate changes in the following elements
      before versus after 8 bi-weekly treatments of LIESWT:

      A. EF categorical improvement.

      B. Other validated measures of EF (SEP2 (question 2 of the sexual encounter profile), SEP3
      (question 3 of the sexual encounter profile), GAQ (Global Assessment Question), EHS (Erection
      Hardness Score)), and the remaining domains of the IIEF score (orgasmic function, sexual
      desire, intercourse satisfaction, overall satisfaction), as well as the total IIEF score.

      C. Harms/Safety: To evaluate treatment tolerance and potential adverse events.

    <description>The study population is comprised of adult men less than 80 years of age who are consulting for ED lasting for over 6 months following a prostatectomy that took place 18 to 60 months ago. The patients are currently in a stable relationship that has been going on for at least 3 months, have an IIEF-EF score between 6 and 25, and have at least a natural tumescence during sexual stimulation (EHS score ≥ 1).

    <description>LIESWT = Low-Intensity Extracorporeal Shock Wave Therapy
The treatment protocol consists of eight bi-weekly treatment sessions (weeks 0 ot 4). During each session 3600 shocks at 0.09 mJ/mm are applied. Shocks are applied to the penis shaft at the right corpus cavernosum and the left corpus cavernosum, and at the crura at the right crus and the left crus. 900 shocks are administered to each area. The treatment areas are the same for each session, so that at the end of the full treatment (8 sessions) each area will have received 7200 shocks at 0.09 mJ/mm.
In general, the patient is placed on an examination table. A series of focused shockwaves produced by the electromagnetic transducer are coupled to a patient's penile shaft and crura and are made to converge along the penis/crura volume. The operator controls treatment parameters including shockwave intensity and shockwave rate.
