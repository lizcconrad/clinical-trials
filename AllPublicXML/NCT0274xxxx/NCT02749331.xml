      An open-labelled, uncontrolled, single-center Phase I/IIa clinical study to evaluate the
      safety of repeated infusions of AdVince into the hepatic artery in patients with metastatic
      neuroendocrine tumors (NETs), and if possible determination of maximum tolerated dose.
      Secondary objectives include to evaluate the anti-tumoral efficacy of AdVince infusions on
      metastatic neuroendocrine tumors, to determine the replication profile of AdVince and to
      determine the humoral (antibody) and cytokine-mediated immune response to AdVince. Minimum 12
      and maximum 35 patients will be included, the number is based on the toxicity observed.
