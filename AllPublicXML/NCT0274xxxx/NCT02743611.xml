  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate patients with relapsed or refractory Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) or
      advanced hypomethylating agent-resistant myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) who will have
      autologous immune cells, called T cells, collected via apheresis. The T cells will be
      reinfused according to a dose-finding schedule after the patient has been identified as
      having adequate lymphopenia to provide for homeostatic expansion of the adoptively
      transferred, engineered T cell therapeutic product. As a safety measure, these T cells have
      been programmed with a self-destruct switch so that they can be destroyed if they start to
      react against tissues (Graft versus host disease).

      This is a single arm, dose escalation/ de-escalation, single US center, unblinded, phase 1
      study. Its main goal is to determine the safety and tolerability of the autologous
      genetically modified T cell (BPX-701) in subjects with relapsed or refractory AML or advanced
      hypomethylating agent-resistant MDS. Rimiducid (AP1903) will be administrated treat
      uncontrolled BPX-701 toxicity, such as Cytokine Release Syndrome or severe
      off-tumor/on-target toxicities.
