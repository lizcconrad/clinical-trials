  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study will evaluate whether a technology-based lifestyle intervention program using
      primarily a smartphone platform is an acceptable and effective way for treating obesity. The
      goal of the program is to achieve weight loss and enhance the health of overweight or obese
      subjects by improving their diet and activity via smartphone applications as compared with
      conventional in-person weight management programs.

    <description>The Smart Technology Group will receive a technology-based lifestyle intervention program which uses wearable technology, smartscales and smartphone applications to track and deliver feedback on caloric expenditure, physical activity, caloric intake and body weight. Participants will receive information through smartphone applications on strategies to make changes to their diet, physical activity, and weight-related behaviors along with standard 3 monthly in-person weight management visits.</description>
