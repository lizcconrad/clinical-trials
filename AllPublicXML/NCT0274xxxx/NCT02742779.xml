  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of single and multiple
      orally ascending doses of GDC-0310 administered in healthy participants as 4 parts including
      Part 1- a single dose (SD) part using a powder-in-capsule (PIC) formulation, Part 2- a
      multiple dose (MD) part using a PIC formulation, Part 3- a SD part using a solution
      formulation, and Part 4- a MD part using a solution formulation. Effects of food on
      pharmacokinetics (PK) will also be explored.
