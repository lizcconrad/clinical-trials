      Background: Growth impairment is commonly seen in children diagnosed with inflammatory bowel
      diseases (IBD), mainly those with Crohn's disease (CD). There is general consensus in the
      literature that body composition, composed of fat mass and lean mass is altered in children
      with IBD compared with controls. Evidence regarding the effect of different therapeutic
      approaches on body composition in children with IBD is scarce and inconsistent. Furthermore,
      most studies used anthropometric measures and dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) for
      body composition assessment, while information on the usefulness of air displacement
      plethysmography (ADP) for this assessment is lacking.

      Objectives: To assess body composition in children with IBD by ADP and DEXA at diagnosis and
      at various intervals during follow up.

      Design: A prospective cohort study. Setting: Pediatric gastroenterology institute, Schneider
      Children's Hospital.

      Participants: Children 6 year to 17 years who are diagnosed with either CD or ulcerative
      colitis (UC).

      Main outcome measures: Accuracy of ADP in comparison to DEXA and percentage of fat mass and
      lean mass at diagnosis and during treatment.

      Secondary outcome measures: Correlation of body composition to skin fold, mid arm
      circumference measurements, BMI, inflammatory markers, gender, disease activity and physical
      activity.

      Children diagnosed with either Crohn's disease (CD) or Ulcerative Colitis (UC) under
      follow-up at the Pediatric gastroenterology institute, Schneider Children's Hospital, will be
      enrolled. Patients can be enrolled at diagnosis or at any time point during follow-up.
      Patients' characteristics will be retrieved from their medical files including demographic
      details, disease phenotype, anthropometric measures, laboratory evaluation, complication and
      therapeutic regimens. At enrollment all patients will perform body composition assessment by
      air displacement plethysmography (ADP) and DEXA (no greater than 7 days between the 2 methods
      of measurement). At one and two years following initial assessment ADP measurement will be
      repeated, mid arm circumference and skin fold measurements will be taken and the patient will
      fill a physical activity questionnaire. Disease activity score (either Pediatric Crohn's
      Disease Activity Index for CD or Pediatric Ulcerative Colitis Activity Index for UC) will be
      calculated. Similar evaluation will be performed prior and immediately following exclusive
      enteral nutrition or corticosteroid courses and prior to any biologic therapy initiation.
