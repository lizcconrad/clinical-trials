  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Previously published studies have indicated that there exist difference in electrical
      properties (EPs), i.e., the conductivity and relative permittivity, between malignant and
      adjacent normal tissue, which will be useful in the early detection of cancers. However the
      EP information mainly based on ex vivo measurement of cancer tissues, and few data in vivo
      were published. The purpose of this study is to in vivo measure the electrical properties of
      the malignant tissues.

      The measurements were safety guaranteed and were conducted during the cancer surgeries.
      Before the tissue was excised from the patient,the pathologist assisted the operator (already
      at the operating room) responsible for the measurement.The measurement of malignant and
      corresponding normal tissues were both performed. The tissues for dielectric properties
      measurement were classified as normal or malignant by the pathologist based on his own
      expertise and decision criteria (visual inspection, anatomy) and the per-operative
      histological examination. The measurements were directly performed on the tissue before
      excision.The sites of the measured malignant tissues were marked,doubletracked according to
      the pathological report to make sure the marked sites are malignant. The patient age and
      tissue temperature at the time of measurement were recorded.

    <description>The dielectric properties of the tissues were measured using the open-ended coaxial line method. The measurement system consisted of a network analyzer (Model 4395A, Agilent Corp., Santa Clara, CA) associated with an S-parameter test set (Model 87511A, Agilent Corp., Santa Clara, CA). A semi-rigid coaxial line with a diameter of 3.58 mm was connected to the network analyzer system by using a Bayonet Neill-Concelman connector. The other tip of the coaxial line (probe) was placed on the flat bare surface of the tissue.</description>
