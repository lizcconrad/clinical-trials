      This study is a phase 2, multicenter, double-blind, randomized, placebo controlled,
      parallel-group study to investigate the renal safety and tolerability of multiple dose
      intravenous (IV) administration of CSL112 compared with placebo in subjects with moderate
      renal impairment (RI) and acute myocardial infarction (AMI).

    <measure>Incidence of treatment-emergent renal serious adverse event (SAE)</measure>
    <time_frame>From the start of the first infusion to the end of the subject's participation in the study, up to approximately 9 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The incidence rate is based on the number of subjects with at least one occurrence of a renal SAE defined as follows. A renal SAE is defined as any SAE with a MedDRA preferred term (PT) included in the Acute Renal Failure narrow Standard MedDRA Query (SMQ) or a PT of renal tubular necrosis, renal cortical necrosis, renal necrosis, or renal papillary necrosis.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Incidence of treatment-emergent acute kidney injury (AKI)</measure>
    <time_frame>From baseline (before infusion) through the active treatment period, approximately 1 month.</time_frame>
    <description>The incidence rate is based on the number of subjects with at least one occurrence of an AKI defined as follows. Acute kidney injury is defined as an absolute increase in serum creatinine from baseline ≥ 0.3 mg/dL during the Active Treatment Period that is sustained upon repeat measurement by the central laboratory no earlier than 24 hours after the elevated value. If no repeat value is obtained, a single serum creatinine value that is increased from baseline ≥ 0.3 mg/dL (26.5 μmol/L) during the Active Treatment Period would also fulfil the definition of AKI.</description>

    <time_frame>From the start of the first infusion to the end of the safety follow-up period, approximately 9 weeks for each subject</time_frame>
    <description>Adverse drug reactions or suspected adverse drug reactions are defined as:
All TEAEs, including local tolerability events, that begin during or within 1 hour after the end of an infusion; or
Those TEAEs that the investigator or sponsor indicate may be causally related to product administration; or
All TEAEs for which the Investigator's causality assessment is missing or indeterminate; or
All TEAEs for which the incidence in an active treatment arm exceeds the exposure-adjusted incidence rate in the placebo arm by 30% or more, provided the difference in incidence rates is 1% or more.</description>

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Symptoms, biomarker elevation or electrocardiogram (ECG) changes other than those of
             the index event that are consistent with a diagnosis of AMI but are likely not due to

          -  Ongoing hemodynamic instability

          -  Planned coronary artery bypass surgery

          -  Evidence of hepatobiliary disease
