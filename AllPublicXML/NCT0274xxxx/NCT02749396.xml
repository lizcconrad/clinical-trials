  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is the most common chronic neurologic disability in young adult
      females in their childbearing ages. Little evidence is available regarding the association
      between exposure to IFN-beta (β) products and adverse pregnancy outcomes. Therefore the four
      marketing holders of IFN-β are conducting a European-wide IFN-β pregnancy registry.
      Additionally, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) has requested a study
      to enable identification of pregnancy outcomes in the MS population unexposed to IFN-β
      products for comparison with the ongoing European IFN-β Pregnancy Registry.

      Information will be obtained from the Drugs and Pregnancy Project database (DPP - FIN) and
      the Medical Birth Register (MBR - SWE, NOR). The Finnish DPP and Norwegian MBR include
      information on all stillbirths of foetuses with a birth weight of at least 500 g or with a
      gestational age of at least 22+0 Gestational Week (GW). The Swedish MBR includes data on
      stillbirths after 28 GW

      The estimated number of pregnancies in MS patients needed is 1671, encompassing data from:

      i) FIN: 1 January 1996 - 31 December 2014; ii) SWE: 1 July 2005 - 31 December 2014; iii) NOR:
      1 January 2004 - 31 December 2014.
