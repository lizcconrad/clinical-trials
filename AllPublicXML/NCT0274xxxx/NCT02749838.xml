      Purpose of the Protocol:

        -  To prospectively identify cancer patients whose tumors express specific molecular
           markers targeted by therapeutic agents, for the purpose of selecting the most clinically
           appropriate anticancer therapy, including clinical trial opportunities.

        -  To collect and analyze biospecimens from cancer patients, using primarily standard of
           care laboratory methods, for the purpose of determining the expression of specific
           genotypic and phenotypic disease markers of scientific and medical interest.

        -  To create a protocol database, including case and disease stage-matched clinical and
           therapeutic history data in addition to patient biomarker profiles, to serve as:

             -  a systematic collection of data for comparing patient data to clinical trial
                selection criteria for the purpose of informing a clinical investigative site of
                available clinical trials matching patient clinical status;

             -  a collection of clinically matched, comprehensive molecular results for scientific
                and research and development applications.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The molecular understanding of cancer is advancing rapidly, and a new generation of more
      effective, targeted cancer drugs are taking center stage in cancer care. Yet the
      investigators system for clinical testing of new agents has not kept pace with the revolution
      in cancer biology.

      Stratification by genotypic and phenotypic abnormalities further divides histological cancers
      into a myriad of clinically distinct subtypes. As cancer therapies become more selective, and
      the intent to treat populations and the predictability of patient presentation decrease,
      clinical trial enrollment becomes more difficult by traditional methods. A breakout solution
      is needed in clinical research methodology, to create a more efficient means of developing
      new cancer drugs in the US. Improved methods for the systematic, prospective screening of
      cancer patients are needed to identify the subsets of patients whose tumors express molecular
      markers targeted by precision therapeutics. This protocol will evaluate clinical samples of
      cancer tissue to identify the molecular abnormalities present in individual patients' cancer.
      In this context the investigators objective will be to enable physicians to more thoroughly
      characterize the molecular abnormalities underlying cancer and to connect eligible patients
      to precision treatments as part of optimal care.

      By making trials more accessible and utilizing technology wisely, it should be possible to
      match cancer patients to appropriate treatments, including clinical trials, within a
      clinically relevant timeframe to bring research opportunities into consideration for best
      clinical care.
