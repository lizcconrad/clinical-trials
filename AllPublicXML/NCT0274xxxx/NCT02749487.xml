  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Neutrophil lymphocyte ratio NLR is an important index that evaluate the inflammatory status .
      It is a cost effective and readily available , and simply calculated , so that why
      investigators try to use it as a predictor of short term survival in the critically ill
      patients
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      NLR will be used as predictor for short term survival and patients stay in ICU in 2 groups of
      patients . Investigators will use it in a group of Medical Critically ill patients as
      respiratory failure , neuromuscular disorders , renal impairment . the other group is the
      critically ill surgical patients , as patients with multiple trauma , post major surgery
