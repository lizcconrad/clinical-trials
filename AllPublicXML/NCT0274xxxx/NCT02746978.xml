  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Shepherd Center is bringing a more patient-centered focus to educational, peer-support, and
      technology resources offered to patients with spinal cord injury and their families and is
      evaluating these changes.

      Approximately 740 patients have provided information about healthcare utilization following
      inpatient rehabilitation. This information will help Shepherd Center staff follow utilization
      trends and plan programs targeted at the high-use areas.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Research efforts are transforming the educational, peer-support and technology resources
      offered to patients and their caregivers, and evaluating how these changes help improve
      outcomes, including building patients' sense of self-efficacy - the belief that they can
      effectively manage their own care. Goals of the three focus areas include:

      A. Patient and Family Education Revamp patient education modules for bladder management, skin
      management, and medical complications management to follow the chronic disease self
      management approach that replaces didactic lectures with participant-focused problem solving
      discussions led by peers (persons with SCI). Multiple baseline implementation approaches will
      be evaluated in interrupted time series analyses.

      B. Peer mentoring and peer-led self-management training The peer mentor randomized clinical
      trial is reported separately on clinicaltrials.gov and not repeated here.

      C. Patient and family web portal Shepherd Center, along with our collaborators at Craig
      Hospital in Denver, Colorado, are developing an engagement portal to provide a mechanism for
      patients to manage all aspects of injury following rehabilitation discharge and share
      information with other providers and caregivers.The portal will become a standard part of
      rehabilitation care and discharge planning for all Shepherd Center patients - starting first
      with patients with spinal cord injuries and later expanding to others. Stakeholders will be
      actively involved in providing feedback about portal usability and content so that the
      product continues to meet their needs.
