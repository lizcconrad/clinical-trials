  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Ability research project, funded in Italy within the Smart Cities and Smart Communities
      funding program (MInistry of University and Research, Operational Regional Programme,
      Lombardy, Axis 1, Operational Regional Programme - European Funding for Regional Development
      2007-2013), aims at developing and testing the efficacy and the impact of a Personal Smart
      Health Community able to provide innovative trajectories for people with cognitive
      impairment, putting them at the core of a continuous and intertwining treatment and support
      from both formal (e.g. physicians) and informal (e.g. near relatives) caregivers, with
      special focus on home-based care.

      Within this framework of the Ability project the investigators test the efficacy of the
      home-based motor-cognitive rehabilitation program delivered with two different approaches:
      the Ability platform versus the usual care program
