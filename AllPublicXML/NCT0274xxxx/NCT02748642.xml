  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This randomized, observer-blinded, placebo-controlled, single and multiple ascending-dose
      study will be conducted in two parts to evaluate the safety, pharmacokinetics, and
      immunogenicity of BITS7201A. Part A will be an ascending, single-dose, sequential-group study
      where participants will be randomly assigned to active drug or placebo. Part B will be an
      ascending, multiple-dose, sequential-group study where participants will be randomized to
      active drug or placebo. Total length of the study is anticipated to be approximately 12
      months.
