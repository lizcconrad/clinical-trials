    <textblock>
      This is a randomized controlled pilot study to assess the microbiological and clinical
      impacts of Fecal Microbiota Transplantation (FMT) in patients with obesity. The investigators
      will prospectively enroll 20 adult patients who are obese (Body Mass Index of 35kg/m2 or
      higher) after providing written informed consent. The study participants will be randomized
      1:1 to either the treatment arm or the placebo arm. The treatment arm will receive an
      induction FMT with capsules followed by a monthly maintenance dose of oral capsules for 12
      weeks total. The placebo group will receive a placebo capsules for induction followed by
      monthly intake of oral placebo capsules for 12 weeks.

    <description>Adverse event (AE) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation patient administered a biologic product. It is an unintended sign, symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of the investigational agent. Adverse events will be determined by a toxicity grading scale.</description>
