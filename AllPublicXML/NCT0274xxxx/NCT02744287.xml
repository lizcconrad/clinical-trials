  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this protocol, patients with non-resectable pancreatic cancer will have autologous T cells
      collected via apheresis and genetically modified using a retrovirus to express the anti-PSCA
      Chimeric Antigen Receptor (CAR). The T cells will be reinfused according to a dose-finding
      schedule after the subject has been identified as having adequate lymphopenia to provide for
      homeostatic expansion of the adoptively transferred, engineered T cell therapeutic product.

      This is a Phase I, single center, open-label, non-randomized, feasibility, safety and
      dose-finding study. The purpose of the clinical trial is to determine the safety of the
      administration of the anti-PSCA CAR T cells (BPX-601) in subjects with non-resectable
      pancreatic adenocarcinoma, followed by the evaluation of the safety of the rimiducid infusion
      after BPX-601 administration, and the persistence of the CAR-T cells over time after a single
      rimiducid infusion.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Histologically confirmed adenocarcinoma of the pancreas with non-resectable disease.
             Subjects with mixed histology may be included if the predominant component is
             adenocarcinoma.

          -  Tumor with positive PSCA expression.

          -  Failed standard therapy (chemotherapy or surgery) or investigational therapy for non-
             resectable disease, or have documented refusal of standard treatments.

          -  Tumor must be evaluable by CT scan (or MRI, if subject is allergic to CT contrast
             media).

          -  Age ≥ 18 years.

             pregnancy test documented prior to administration of BPX-601.

          -  If sexually active, the subject must agree to use contraception considered adequate
             and appropriate by the Investigator for 3 months after administration of BPX-601.
