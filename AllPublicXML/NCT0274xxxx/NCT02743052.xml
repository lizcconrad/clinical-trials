    <textblock>
      Purpose: Cancer associated intravascular coagulopathy is the primary mechanism of
      cancer-related stroke, particularly in those without conventional stroke etiologies.
      Randomized clinical trials have investigated efficacy of vitamin K-dependent oral
      anticoagulant (warfarin), low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) and non-vitamin K-dependent
      oral anticoagulant (NOAC) for the prevention of systematic venous thromboembolism. However,
      relatively little is known about the biological changes underlying intravascular coagulopathy
      and mechanisms of anticoagulation therapy in patients with cancer-related stroke. The aim of
      this study is to evaluate to determine the biological markers for intravascular coagulopathy
      causing stroke and for monitoring the effects of anticoagulation therapy, in patients with
      active cancer and stroke.

          -  Acute ischemic stroke presented within 7 days of symptom onset

          -  Cancer related stroke: active cancer (diagnosis of cancer within 6 months of stroke
             onset, any treatment for cancer within the previous 6 months, or recurrent or
             metastatic cancer) and ischemic stroke which could not be explained by conventional
             stroke mechanisms including large artery atherosclerosis, cardioembolism, lacunar
             infarction, or other etiologies (e.g., dissection)

          -  Signed informed consent or appropriate signed deferral of consent where approved

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Primary intracranial malignancy

          -  Incomplete workup for stroke etiology (either vascular or cardiologic studies)

          -  Any signs of infectious or immunological diseases which may influence plasma D-dimer
             levels

          -  Patients with stroke suspected to be caused by the tumor itself (i.e., tumor emboli)
             or cancer treatment (i.e., chemotherapy-induced stroke)
