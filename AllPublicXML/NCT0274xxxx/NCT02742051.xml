  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This open, randomized pilot feasibility trial is to evaluate the feasibility and effect of
      neoadjuvant everolimus plus letrozole versus neoadjuvant fluorouracil, epirubicin plus
      cyclophosphamide (FEC) in treating postmenopausal women with ER-positive, HER2-negative
      breast cancer. Forty postmenopausal stage M0, ER-positive, HER2-negative invasive breast
      cancer women who had a primary tumor &gt; 2cm by imaging or an axillary lymph node &gt; 2cm by
      imaging were randomly (1:1) enrolled to receive neoadjuvant everolimus plus letrozole for 18
      weeks or neoadjuvant FEC for 6 cycles before surgery. The primary objective is to determine
      the feasibility of neoadjuvant everolimus plus letrozole in postmenopausal patients with
      ER-positive, HER2-negative breast cancer, and to compare the objective response rate.
      Secondary aims are to compare the response rate by clinical palpation, pathological complete
      response (pCR) rate, breast-conserving surgery rate, toxicities, and changes in the
      percentages of peripheral blood CD8+ T cells, T helper cells (Th), regulatory T cells (Treg),
      and NK cells (pre- versus post- neoadjuvant therapy).
