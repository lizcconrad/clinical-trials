      The purpose of this study is to compare two methods for assessing patients with pelvic organ
      prolapse for occult stress urinary incontinence. Urodynamic testing is the most widely
      accepted and well-studied method for diagnosing occult stress urinary incontinence
      preoperatively, but an ambulatory pessary trial is a less expensive option that is available
      to a wider group of practitioners and evaluates patient while they are engaged in their daily
      activities.

    <description>Urodynamics is performed with the Aquarius XT Laborie system and a fluoroscopic images are obtained with a GE OCE 9800 c-arm fluoroscopy unit. Urodynamic testing will be performed in a seated position with a pessary from the ambulatory pessary trial in place. Post residual void will be measured at the start of the urodynamics.</description>

    <description>A pessary is a silicone disc that is used in to support the uterus and vagina of women with vaginal prolapse. During this study, the pessary that will be used is a ring with support. This is a disc shape with a membrane stretched across the center. It is a device used in standard practice and is safe to keep in place for up to 3 months at a time. The subjects will be fit with a pessary asked to wear the pessary for 3 days.</description>
