    <textblock>
      This prospective, multicenter, cohort study is designed to validate Anxiety Inventory
      Respiratory Disease questionnaire in patients with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease
      (COPD).

      The primary purpose of this study is to assess the validity of the Anxiety Inventory
      Respiratory (AIR) scale in detecting anxiety in relation to the DSM-V criteria in patients
      with COPD.

        -  To evaluate associations between COPD symptom scores assessed by the CAT questionnaire
           and MMRC dyspnea scale and measures of depression and anxiety

        -  To evaluate associations between physiologic measures of lung function (spirometry) and
           exercise tolerance (6 minute walk) and measures of depression and anxiety

        -  To evaluate associations between exacerbations of COPD and the prevalence of anxiety and
           depression in a cohort of COPD patients
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The goal of the Anxiety and COPD Evaluation (ACE) study is to validate the AIR scale by
      employing the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview to identify anxiety in 200
      patients recruited at participating centers from the American Lung Association (ALA) Airways
      Research Network.

    <measure>Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA)</measure>
    <time_frame>10 Minutes</time_frame>
    <description>The Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) was developed as a brief screening instrument to detect mild cognitive impairment. It is a paper-and-pencil tool that requires approximately 10 minutes to administer, and is scored out of 30 points. The MoCA assesses multiple cognitive domains including attention, concentration, executive functions, memory, language, visuospatial skills, abstraction, calculation and orientation. It is widely used around the world and is translated to 36 languages and dialects.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>COPD Assessment Test (CAT)</measure>
    <time_frame>10 Minutes</time_frame>
    <description>The CAT is an eight-item questionnaire designed to quantify the impact of COPD symptoms on the health status of patients. The CAT is quick and easy for patients to complete and, without complex calculations, provides a score of 0-40 to indicate the impact of disease.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Modified Medical Research Council dyspnea scale (MMRC)</measure>
    <time_frame>10 Minutes</time_frame>
    <description>The MMRC uses a simple grading system to assess a patient's level of dyspnea and has been used for many years for grading the effects of breathlessness on daily activities. This scale has been particularly used in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) in whom it has proved to be useful and complementary to First Forced expiratory volume (FEV1) in the classification of disease severity.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI)</measure>
    <time_frame>1-month time interval</time_frame>
    <description>The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) is a self-rated questionnaire which assesses sleep quality and disturbances over a 1-month time interval. Nineteen individual items generate seven &quot;component&quot; scores: subjective sleep quality, sleep latency, sleep duration, habitual sleep efficiency, sleep disturbances, use of sleeping medication, and daytime dysfunction. The sum of scores for these seven components yields one global score.</description>

    <measure>Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System Questionnaires: Emotional Distressâ€”Anxiety Function -(PROMIS-29)</measure>
    <time_frame>10 Minutes</time_frame>
    <description>These patient-reported outcome (PRO) measures use answers that patients provide to questions to produce numeric values which indicate patients' state of wellbeing or suffering as well as their ability or lack of ability to function. The NIH funded leading PRO and clinical investigators to develop a &quot;psychometrically validated, dynamic system to measure PROs efficiently in study participants with a wide range of chronic diseases and demographic characteristics.&quot; The PROMIS initiative is part of the NIH goal to develop systems to support NIH-funded research supported by all of its institutes and centers. PROMIS measures cover physical, mental, and social health and can be used across chronic conditions.</description>

    <measure>EuroQol EQ-5D- 5L</measure>
    <time_frame>10 Minutes</time_frame>
    <description>The EQ-5D-5L is a generic measure of health related quality of life that can be calibrated on a 0 to 1 scale and thus measures utility, allowing for the calculation of Quality Adjusted Life Years (QALYs). The standard EQ-5D measures 5 dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression graded from level 1 (i.e., no problems) to level 5 (i.e., extreme problems). Use of the 5-levels (EQ-5D-5L) rather than the standard 3 level EQ-5D (EQ-5D-3L) has led to less ceiling effect, greater discriminative ability, and potentially more power to detect differences between groups compared with EQ-5D-3L.</description>

    <measure>Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS)</measure>
    <time_frame>2 Days</time_frame>
    <description>The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), a self-assessment scale, was developed to detect states of depression, anxiety and emotional distress amongst patients who were being treated for a variety of clinical problems.</description>

    <measure>6 Minute Walk Distance</measure>
    <time_frame>6 Minutes</time_frame>
    <description>The purpose of the six minute walk is test exercise tolerance in chronic respiratory disease and heart failure. The six-minute walk test (6MWT) measures the distance an individual is able to walk over a total of six minutes on a hard, flat surface. The goal is for the individual to walk as far as possible in that time. The individual is allowed to self-pace and rest as needed as they traverse back and forth along a marked walkway.</description>

    <time_frame>2 Days</time_frame>
    <description>Spirometry is a common office test used to diagnose asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and certain other conditions that affect breathing. Spirometry measures how much air inhaled and exhaled and how fast.</description>

    <description>An initial version of the AIR was developed through a mixed-methods approach to item development, incorporating both emic and etic perspectives. This included an extensive review of extant anxiety scales (etic perspectives) and in-depth qualitative interviews with patients with COPD and self-reported anxiety (emic perspectives). AIR has ten items on a scale from 0 to 3. It provides a score of 0-30. High score indicates elevated level of clinically relevant anxiety symptoms.</description>
