  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Heart murmurs are commonly discovered in young children during clinical encounters in general
      practice. Heart murmurs might signal a structural cardiac disease that need to be treated,
      such as atrial septal defect. Thus, children with heart murmurs are routinely referred to
      comprehensive cardiac examination at a paediatric hospital department featuring
      echocardiography ('gold standard'). However, the great majority of such murmurs are innocent
      or physiological; ie., they do not represent a cardiac disorder. The prevalence of such
      innocent murmurs during routine random auscultation is estimated at 30 %.

      It would be advantageous if patients with a heart disease to a greater extent could be
      identified at the general practitioners' office:

        -  Healthy children would not be exposed to comprehensive cardiac examination

        -  The burden on the family would subside.

        -  Scarce medical resources in highly specialized departments would be better allocated, to
           the benefit of patients with real heart disease.

      The primary aim of this study is to establish the predictive value of cardiac markers in
      children with heart murmurs. Secondary aims are a) To do a pilot study of pediatric cardiac
      ultrasound examination in general practice; b) To establish age-adjusted reference range for
      cardiac markers in children, and c) To explore aspects of cardiovascular physiology in
      children.

      The investigators will include a total of 500 children aged 4 weeks to 10 years who is
      consecutively referred to the Dept. of Paediatrics, Akershus University Hospital, for
      assessment of heart murmurs. All participants will be subjected to clinical examination,
      symptom assessment, pulse oximetry, blood sampling (for troponin T, proBNP and other
      biomarkers), ECG recording, and echocardiography. A randomized subgroup of children will also
      undergo echocardiography performed by a general practitioner who has not received formal
      training in pediatric cardiology. The value of possible predictors will be assessed through
      the construction of Receiver Operating Characteristics (ROC) curves, and calculation of
      negative predictive value.
