  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if partially filling the bladder after
      laparoscopic/robotic gynecologic surgery (for benign disease) shortens the time required to
      spontaneously void for patients to determine if this subsequently shortens patient stay times
      in the Post Anesthesia Care Unit (PACU) following surgery. This intervention would be
      compared to the current standard of care, which involves removing the patient's Foley
      catheter with an empty bladder and then giving the patient up to 6 hours to void in the PACU.

      Patients undergoing laparoscopic/robotic hysterectomy or myomectomy who meet the study
      criteria will be contacted by the research assistant at a pre-operative visit. The risks and
      benefits of participation will be explained to them. If they choose to participate they will
      sign the consent form at that time.

      At the time of the surgery, the research coordinator will open a sealed envelope containing
      the patient's assignment to partial bladder filling or no bladder filling. The research
      coordinator will then notify the surgeon via secure phone call or secure messaging service
      and the patient/subject will have their bladder partially filled or completely emptied as
      relayed to the surgeon at the end of the procedure in the Operating Room, unless there are
      issues of patient safety or operative complications. In the patients who are chosen for
      partial bladder filling, the bladder will be back-filled with 150 cc of normal saline and
      then the Foley catheter will be removed at the end of the procedure. In patients who have no
      bladder filling, the bladder will be completely emptied and then the Foley catheter will be
      removed. One of the providers who perform the gynecological surgical procedures will be
      responsible for back-filling or completely emptying the bladder with the Foley catheter.

      The patients will be followed in the PACU to determine the time it takes for them to void.
      The will also be followed for any complications until they are four weeks post surgery. The
      electronic medical record will be examined to see if they have any complications reported at
      their post-operative visits or any readmissions to the hospital.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Hysterectomy or myomectomy planned for a benign gynecologic reason. (This means that
             there is no evidence of, or concern for, malignancy in the cervix, uterus, tubes or
             ovaries. Benign gynecologic reasons to have a hysterectomy include fibroids, abnormal
             uterine bleeding, endometriosis, and pelvic pain. Benign reason for myomectomy would
             be fibroids)

          2. Patient is scheduled to have surgery with one of the minimally invasive gynecologic
             surgeons at George Washington University Hospital (GWUH)

          3. Patient is planned for a robotic assisted total laparoscopic hysterectomy (RA-TLH) or
             a total laparoscopic hysterectomy (TLH) or robotic assisted or laparoscopic
             myomectomy.

          4. Patient is capable of informed consent.

          5. The patient has no baseline urinary disease.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Hysterectomy or myomectomy is indicated for malignancy

          2. Hysterectomy or myomectomy is not being performed via robotic or laparoscopic method

          3. Patient is not capable of providing informed consent

          4. Patient has urinary disease
