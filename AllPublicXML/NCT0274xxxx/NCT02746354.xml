    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to engage patients with chronic pain and other key
      stakeholders in an iterative process of pilot-testing a validated patient generated
      instrument, the Measure Yourself Medical Outcome Profile (MYMOP), to support primary care
      encounters and provide a direct comparison between a strategy of incorporating patient
      reported outcomes into the package of care for complex pain patients and usual care. The
      specific aims of this phase of the project are to: 1) adapt the MYMOP for use in the primary
      care setting well-integrated into everyday practice flow, and 2) evaluate whether the
      utilization of the MYMOP data in routine primary care encounters results in improvements in
      patient symptoms and functioning over time as well as increased satisfaction with the visit
      for patients and primary care providers. To achieve Aim 2, the investigators will compare the
      reported outcomes and health care utilization from participating patients in this study for
      whom the MYMOP-based instrument will be used in routine clinical care to a matched group of
      chronic pain patients who will not receive the MYMOP-based assessment but will otherwise have
      similarly collected data. This also allows us to evaluate of the extent to which use of the
      tool adds patient-centered information to more conventional instruments. In addition to these
      two aims, for a third aim, the investigators plan to collect qualitative data from patients,
      their family members, Kaiser Permanente Northwest (KPNW) health care providers, and KPNW
      administrators to better understand the needs of this subpopulation of patients.
