      Despite the long-term emphasis on reducing intake of and added sugar, this behavioral change
      has been hard to instill amongst most of the population. Foods with added sugars are highly
      reinforcing and, as such, reducing their consumption in order to adhere to the dietary
      guidelines (DGA) may be difficult to maintain. Sugar produces effects similar to some drugs
      of abuse such as increased extracellular dopamine release in the nucleus accumbens shell
      resulting in a reinforcing effect. Reducing any reinforcing behavior can be challenging, but
      in terms of food, it is not known whether the reinforcing value of foods high in added sugar
      increases when access to these foods is reduced. If so, this would present a mechanistic
      barrier to meeting the DGA and making dietary changes in general. That the reinforcing value
      of a behavior (e.g., eating sugar) will be increased when the rate of that behavior is
      decreased has strong theoretical underpinnings in the &quot;Disequilibrium Approach&quot;. This theory
      predicts that the circumstances of reinforcement are created or limited by changing baseline
      access. According to the Disequilibrium Approach, a response deficit will result in an
      increase in reinforcement. Applied to the proposed study, the Disequilibrium Approach would
      predict that lowering the consumption of dietary added sugar would increase the reinforcing
      value of foods high in added sugar. The Disequilibrium Approach has accurately predicted an
      increase in the relative reinforcing value (RRV) of snack foods among children. However,
      dietary changes would need to occur at the whole diet level for adults and children to meet
      the DGA for reducing added sugar intake. It is important to know if reducing added sugars at
      the whole-diet level results in increases in the reinforcing value of foods high in added
      sugars.
