      The purpose of this study is to explore patterns of Brain Network Activation (BNA) changes
      from baseline to endpoint on 1) efficacy of core symptoms of Major Depressive Disorder (MDD)
      and 2) improvement of cognitive dysfunction with acute treatment with flexible dose
      vortioxetine in adult outpatients with MDD and subjective complaints of cognitive
      dysfunction.

    <textblock>
      Vortioxetine is a novel antidepressant with hypothetical multimodal mechanism of action. It
      is thought to work through a combination of multiple pharmacological modes of action: 5-HT
      (hydroxytryptamine, or serotonin) reuptake inhibition, 5-HT3 (hydroxytryptamine, or
      serotonin) and 5-HT7 (hydroxytryptamine, or serotonin) receptor antagonism, 5-HT1A
      (hydroxytryptamine, or serotonin) receptor agonism, and 5-HT1B (hydroxytryptamine, or
      serotonin) receptor partial agonism. In vivo nonclinical studies have demonstrated that
      vortioxetine enhances levels of the neurotransmitters 5-HT (hydroxytryptamine, or serotonin),
      norepinephrine (NE), dopamine (DA), acetylcholine and histamine in specific areas of the
      brain. These affinities are all considered to be of clinical relevance and involved in the
      mechanism of action at therapeutic doses.

      Vortioxetine has been shown to improve core depressive symptoms and improve cognitive
      function in adult outpatients with MDD and subjective complaints of cognitive function. This
      pilot study is intended to evaluate the extent to which BNA technology can provide clinically
      valuable information and provide information toward designing a subsequent confirmatory study
      that will further elucidate the effect of vortioxetine on MDD and cognitive function in this
      population. This exploratory study will ascertain the acute changes in core depression
      symptoms, cognitive function, tolerability, and safety using flexible-dose vortioxetine in
      adult outpatients with MDD with subjective complaints of cognitive functioning, as measured
      by BNA changes and standard outcome measures for depression and cognition.

      The study consists of 8 weeks of open-label treatment for MDD with response to treatment
      measured by standard research depression scales and BNA electroencephalogram (EEG) readings
      taken at certain points during the trial. An important aim in this study is to explore what
      correlations may exist between changes in measured brainwave patterns and reported change in
      depressive symptoms

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  The subject has single episode or recurrent MDD (acute onset of recurrence of
             recurrent MDD with poor inter-episode recovery) (inter-episode periods cannot meet
             full MDD criteria) as the primary diagnosis according to DSM-IV-TR criteria. The
             current major depressive episode (MDE) will be confirmed using the Mini International
             Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI V6.0.0).

          -  The subject has a MADRS total score ≥26.

          -  Subject reports subjective cognitive dysfunction (such as difficulty concentrating,
             slow thinking, and difficulty in learning new things or remembering things).

          -  The reported duration of the current MDE is at least 3 months and no longer than 24
             months.

          -  The subject is a man or woman between 18 and 65 years old, inclusive.

          -  Right-handed, normal (corrected) vision, and normal hearing.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  The subject has a score of ≥70 on the Digit Symbol Substitution Test (DSST) at the
