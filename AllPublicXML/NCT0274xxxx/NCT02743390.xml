  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Resistant hypertension (RH) is characterized by high blood pressure (BP) in spite of
      concurrent use of three or more antihypertensive agents of different classes, combined at
      optimal doses. Currently it has been largely discussed the influence of inflammation in RH.
      The BP variation promotes increased expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as tumor
      necrosis factor-alpha, interleukins 1 and 6. It was showed that treatment with TNF-α
      inhibitor improves BP and endothelial function, and reduces arterial stiffness in patients
      with rheumatoid arthritis. Recently, it was demonstrated that TNF-α levels are increased in
      RH subjects compared to normotensives. This study aims to assess whether the acute inhibition
      of TNF-α changes hemodynamic parameters, such as mean BP levels in RH.

      This crossover, double-blind study will include 12 resistant hypertensive subjects -
      regularly followed at the Outpatient Resistant Hypertension Clinic/UNICAMP - which will
      randomized assigned to (1) saline infusion followed by infliximab infusion (TNF-α inhibitor,
      3 mg/kg) and (2) infliximab followed by saline, for two hours and washout of the 40-day
      period between both infusions. It is expected that the TNF-α inhibition regulates hemodynamic
      parameters, such as mean BP, cardiac Output, total peripheral resistance, which may allow a
      better rational approach for the RH treatment.
