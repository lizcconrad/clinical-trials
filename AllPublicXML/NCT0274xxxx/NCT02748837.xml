  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is the open label, multicenter Phase 1 study which consists of a dose escalation to
      determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and cohort expansion to obtain a preliminary
      evaluation of anti-tumor activity. ERY974 is intravenously injected to patients with Glypican
      3 positive advanced solid tumors until unacceptable toxicity or disease progression.

    <description>Dose escalation (DE) will proceed with the dose level increment and the dose cohort size being guided by a safety evaluations during and at the end of each cohort. DE initially utilizes an accelerated titration design (ATD) and once the first dose limiting toxicity (DLT) is observed, DE will continue using a modified continual reassessment method (mCRM) until MTD.</description>
