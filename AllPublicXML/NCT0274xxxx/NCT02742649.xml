  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if a combination of two drugs (bimatoprost and
      timolol) delivered to the surface of the eye over 10 weeks is better at lowering intraocular
      pressure (IOP) than either of the drugs delivered alone.

             last six (6) months

          -  Past history of any incisional surgery for glaucoma at any time

          -  Past history of corneal refractive surgery
