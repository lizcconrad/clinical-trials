  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Surgical defects on the scalp require closure via various techniques of suture placement. A
      traditional technique requires both dermal (deep) and epidermal (superficial) placement of
      sutures to close the defect; this is referred to as intermediate or complex linear repair.
      However, the scalp is a location with high tension, and thus the closures take an hour or
      longer to perform. A type of suture placement referred to as the &quot;pulley stitch&quot; requires
      placement of a few stitches along the defect. The pulley stitch can be used in areas of high
      tension to close a large defect. The purpose of this study is to compare the scar results and
      time taken to perform scalp closures via only pulley stitches or via intermediate/complex
      linear repairs.

      To my knowledge, no such study has been performed to compare the two techniques. Such a study
      would be useful in demonstrating comparable scar appearance and reduce the time to perform
      scalp closures.
