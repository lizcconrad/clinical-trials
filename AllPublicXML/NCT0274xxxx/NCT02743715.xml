      Neuromodulation techniques for the treatment of Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD) have
      expanded with the greater understanding of the brain circuits involved in this disorder.
      Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is a non-invasive neuromodulation technique
      that has been studied as an alternative for strategy for treatment-resistant OCD. The main
      study is a randomized, sham-controlled, double-blinded trial tDCS for OCD patients
      unresponsive to cognitive-behavioral therapy and/or selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors.
      Forty-four patients will be randomized to two groups: active or simulated intervention. The
      intervention consisted of delivering an electric current of 2mA to the cathode, positioned
      bilaterally in the cranial region corresponding to the supplementary motor cortex, and the
      anode positioned in the deltoid (neutral region), during 30-minutes, for four consecutive
      weeks. The primary outcome was the reduction in baseline YBOCS scores before and after of
      tDCS treatment. Secondary outcomes include measures of depressive and anxiety symptoms,
      genetic markers, motor cortical excitability and performance in neurocognitive tests.
