      University Children's Hospital in Korea from 2008-2009.

      The children will visit outpatient clinics for examinations regarding growth, obesity and
      other risk factors related to metabolic syndrome.

      The purpose of this study is to compare growth and risk factors of metabolic syndrome among
      children born preterm and children born healthy term at school age
