  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A prospective longitudinal surveillance for a period of 2 months. Sample - identify suitable
      Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) patients who undergo HD with functioning AVF. Participants at
      various age range and both sexes are recruited to observe their access flow, access
      recirculation and cardiac function and assess their relationship.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All patients recruited who met the inclusion criteria were investigated access flow, access
      recirculation and cardiac function(including cardiac output,cardiac index,central blood
      volume,et al).Measurement time is the beginning of HD session (first 30min to 1 hr),Middle of
      HD session (optional),and the end of the HD session (1hr to 30 min prior to end of session).
      The follow-up duration is 6 months and 12 months.Repeat the assessment at the above time
      points.
