    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is, to investigate, whether the consumption of a probiotic yoghurt
      containing 4 probiotic strains naturally colonizing the vagina (L. crispatus, L. gasseri, L.
      rhamnosus, L. jensenii) has an influence on the comfort of adult women with BV after and 3
      weeks following a standard antibiotic treatment with metronidazole.

      Female volunteers aged ≥18 years with stable menstrual cycle or postmenopausal women
      presenting with a newly diagnosed bacterial vaginosis based on Amsel criteria, complying with
      a standard oral antibiotic treatment (Metronidazol (Arilin®) 7 days 2x500mg), willing to
      consume for 4 weeks the study product two times daily, complying with the dietary
      restrictions (s. a.) and complying with the other inclusion and exclusion criteria will be
      enrolled in the study. After enrollment subjects will be randomly and evenly assigned to one
      of the two test groups verum and placebo.The study population will be recruited in a
      screening examination (G1) by gynaecologists from Kiel area. This screening examination
      (routine examination) by gynaecologist is used to provide the diagnosis BV. After enrolment
      subjects will be randomly assigned to one of the two test groups verum (n=108) and placebo
      (n=108).
