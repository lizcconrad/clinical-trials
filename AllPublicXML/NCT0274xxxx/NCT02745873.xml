  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The toxic nature of lead has been recognized ubiquitous for than 2,000 years and today it is
      a persistent and common environmental contaminant in most parts of the world. Vitamin C is a
      strong antioxidant and a metabolic co factor playing an important role in many biological
      processes and biochemical functions (hydroxylation reactions). The research objective is to
      assess the effect of oral ascorbic acid supplementation 500mg and 250 mg once a day for 4
      weeks on Blood Lead level among school going urban adolescents, using a cluster randomized
      trial study design. Ascorbic Acid (vitamin C) 250 and 500 mg will be administered in two
      study arms.

    <description>Mean Change in blood lead level is the main outcome of the study. It will be recorded as continuous variable and unit of measurement will be Î¼g/dl.
Blood lead levels will be assessed at baseline before the start of intervention and at the end of the 4 weeks of intervention period in both arms.
Mean change will be calculated by taking difference between two the points as follow up (4 weeks) Blood lead levels minus baseline Blood Lead level.</description>
