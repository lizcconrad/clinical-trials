  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Obesity is a chronic illness and multifactorial etiology, related to genetic factors,
      environmental and behavioral. Features association with several metabolic abnormalities in
      childhood, leading to increased risk of cardiovascular disease in adult life. The treatment
      involves lifestyle change, with balanced diet guidance and encouraging physical activity. The
      treatment in this age group have brought limited data, in addition to high drop-out rates. A
      unique type of food guidance is the equivalent calorie count, where calories are converted
      into points. The objective of this study was to evaluate the variance of Z score of body mass
      index (ZIMC) of obese adolescents undergoing orientation of two groups of low-calorie diet:
      traditional and based on the points system, as well as evaluate anthropometric variables,
      body composition, food intake, metabolic changes and self-monitoring.

      METHODS: randomized clinical study with duration of 24 weeks, with 66 adolescents with an
      average age of 13.7 ± 0.7 years of both genders, with scores of BMI &gt;= 2 to &lt;= 4 curve
      adjusted for gender and age of the World Health Organization. Were verified weight, height,
      blood pressure and waist circumference, intensity of physical activity and self- monitoring,
      as well as performed the nutritional guidance to each visit. Laboratory parameters, applying
      the scale of binge eating, pubertal, stage and body composition were evaluated at the
      beginning and end of the action. The patients were divided into two groups: one that received
      guidance of traditional low-calorie diet and meet the food consumption record (RCA), three
      days (Group A) and another that received low-calorie diet guidance based on the system of
      points and meet the daily RCA (Group B).

    <description>Patients received a fixed diet plan to assist in the choice of foods aimed at changing eating behavior. Dietary intake was evaluated by using 3 nonconsecutive 24-hour dietary recalls collected at each visit. Received a reduction of 500 calories in the total energy expenditure calculated by the equation predicted by Dietary Reference Intake (DRI) from the Institute of Medicine (2005). Also received qualitative information regarding healthy food behaviours, by a same dietitian, based on the DRI for Acceptable Macronutrient Ranges, appropriated for age and gender.</description>

    <arm_group_type>Experimental</arm_group_type>
    <description>Patients underwent a calorie counting diet, in which each patient has received a table list with equivalent points for food and drinks, and was instructed to record all daily food or drink intake and calculate the total score of points consumed (1 point = 3.6 calories). They were allowed to eat any food but were limited to the recommended amount of points (or calories equivalents). Received a reduction of 500 calories in the total energy expenditure calculated by the equation predicted by Dietary Reference Intake (DRI) from the Institute of Medicine (2005). Also received qualitative information regarding healthy food behaviours, by a same dietitian, based on the DRI for Acceptable Macronutrient Ranges, appropriated for age and gender.</description>
