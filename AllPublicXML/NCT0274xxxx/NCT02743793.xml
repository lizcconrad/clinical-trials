      Antirejection medicines, also known as immunosuppressive drugs, are prescribed to organ
      transplant recipients to prevent their bodies from rejecting the new organ. Some organ
      transplant recipients can stop taking anti-rejection medicines without rejecting their
      transplanted organ (this is called 'tolerance'). The purpose of this study will collect
      samples and data from 'tolerant' liver or kidney transplant recipients in order to find out:

      The purpose of this study is to collect samples and data in order to find out:

        -  How long liver or kidney transplant recipients can remain tolerant;

        -  What happens in the tolerant recipient's body over time; and

        -  If there are patterns in the body that are linked to tolerance.

    <description>Operational tolerance (to their kidney or liver transplant) defined by:
Absence of rejection, as determined by medical history;
Maintenance off immunosuppressive medication, with the exception of short courses of steroids for nonallograft related conditions; and
Normal and stable allograft function, defined respectively as liver function tests (ALT, GGT-for liver transplant recipients) or serum creatinine (for kidney transplant recipients) that have not increased more than 50% above the participant's baseline liver function test or serum creatinine value. The baseline value is the liver function tests or serum creatinine drawn at the screening (Day 0) visit.</description>
