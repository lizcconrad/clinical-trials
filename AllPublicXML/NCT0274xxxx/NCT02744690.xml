    <textblock>
      This study is a randomized, double-masked trial to examine the response to trabeculectomy
      surgery. In this study, patients will be randomized to receive MMC via subconjunctival
      injection or topical sponge application.

      This study is a randomized, double-masked (study participants and outcome assessors) trial.
      During the enrollment period, patients from Menelik Hospital who are planning to have
      trabeculectomy surgery and who meet the study enrollment criteria will be randomized to
      receive mitomycin C applied topically or by injection during the surgery.At Menelik Hospital
      mitomycin-C (MMC) is routinely applied to the eye prior to trabeculectomy by physicians via
      both sponge and injection routes. The primary outcome is the patient's response to the
      trabeculectomy procedure, as measured by cumulative complications after a 3-month follow-up
      period post-operation. Secondary outcome is the change in intraocular pressure after a 3
      month follow-up period. The investigators will perform subgroup analyses by stratifying the
      population according to skin pigmentation to determine whether pigmentation is a predictor of
      treatment success.
