      Since there is a limited amount of evidence on the feasibility and outcomes on the use of
      hand massage in patients undergoing cancer treatment, the purpose of this study is to
      evaluate the feasibility and outcomes of hand massage therapy in cancer patients undergoing
      chemotherapy, and to measure its influence on their symptoms.
