  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study was to compare the whitening effect of a toothpaste containing blue
      pigment with a conventional toothpaste and with at-home tooth bleaching; evaluate the
      subject's perception about tooth color improvement and; and evaluate the safety and
      acceptability of these products.

      The study was approved by local Ethical Committee under protocol number CAAE:
      035541412.7.0000.5188, and each volunteer signed an informed consent form prior to enrollment
      in the study.

      The sample size calculation was carried out based on a previous study. To detect the
      bleaching effect with a power of 80% and a one-tailed alpha error of 5%, a sample size of 20
      subjects in each treatment group was necessary to detect a 20% difference between groups in
      shade change. A 20% addiction in subjects' number, taking into consideration potential loss
      or refusal, gave a total sample size of 75 subjects (25 in each group). The individuals were
      invited to participate in this clinical trial through advertisement exposed at the Federal
      University of Paraíba, Brazil.

      Basing on eligibility criteria, 75 volunteers were selected to the trial and randomized to
      one of the three groups of treatment: G1- brushing teeth with a conventional toothpaste; G2-
      brushing teeth with a silica whitening dentifrice containing blue pigment; and G3 - at-home
      tooth bleaching with 10% carbamide peroxide. The treatments will be detailed in another
      section. It was used a simple randomization to allocate the subjects, and a randomization
      table was prepared in the Excel Program by a member, not directly involved with the clinical
      part of the study.

      To mask the products used in the treatment groups, each toothpaste type was enveloped with an
      adhesive tape of a different color and the seal of the bleaching gel syringe was removed. The
      same examiner responsible for subject allocation did this procedure. Thus, testing with the
      toothpastes was double-blinded, where both evaluator and subject did not know which
      toothpaste was being used.

      The outcomes evaluated were: tooth shade, subjects' perception about tooth color appearance,
      and safety and acceptability of products tested, which were measured at baseline, 2-weeks,
      3-weeks and 4-weeks of the beginning of treatments.

      For statistical analysis, data were checked for normal distribution using the Kolmogorov
      Smirnov test, and then it was applied the appropriated parametric or non-parametric tests.
      Differences were considered statistically significant when p &lt; 0.05.

    <time_frame>Baseline, Immediately after first product application, 2 weeks and 4 weeks of the beginning of interventions</time_frame>
    <description>The tooth shade evaluation was performed at each time frame using the digital spectrophotometer that provided tooth shade via two different methods: using the 16 shade tabs in the Vita shade guide (B1-C4); and the CIEL*a*b* color system. The difference between the color coordinates was calculated as: ∆E*= [(∆L*)2 + (∆a*)2 + (∆b*)2]1/2, where ΔL*, Δa*, and Δb* are the mathematical differences among CIE L*, a*, and b* at the different time frames and baseline measurements.</description>

    <measure>Subjects' perception about improvement on tooth color</measure>
    <time_frame>2 weeks of the beginning of interventions</time_frame>
    <description>After two weeks of treatment, the subjects received a visual analog scale (VAS) ranging from 1 (no improvement in tooth appearance) to 7 (exceptional improvement in tooth appearance), in order to evaluate their satisfaction level with tooth appearance</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Tooth sensitivity and gingival irritation evaluation</measure>
    <time_frame>Daily during three weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Each subject should record tooth sensitivity or gingival irritation on a daily basis for 3 weeks (2 weeks of treatment and 1 week after treatment). They should use a standardized grading scale ranked as follows: 0, no sensitivity; 1, mild sensitivity; 2, moderate sensitivity; 3, considerable sensitivity; and 4, severe sensitivity</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Acceptability of interventions</measure>
    <time_frame>2 weeks of the beginning of interventions</time_frame>
    <description>The acceptability of the three products was assessed using a questionnaire containing six questions about the opinion of subjects regarding the treatment regimen adopted. The questions were scored from positive to negative answers, as follows: 1, agree; 2, neither agree nor disagree; and 3, disagree. The questions related to sufficient instruction, ease of use, comfort level, perceived taste, and overall satisfaction.</description>
