  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical research is to learn if treatment with androgen deprivation therapy
      in combination with surgery or radiation therapy can prolong the progression-free survival of
      oligometastatic prostate cancer than androgen deprivation therapy alone. The safety of this
      treatment combination will also be studied.

    <textblock>
      Today androgen deprivation therapy has been a standard treatment for metastatic prostate
      cancer, but as to the special type of prostate cancer—oligometastatic prostate cancer, except
      for androgen deprivation therapy, whether local treatment can be the part of treatment for
      it? The purpose of this study is to evaluate whether local treatment combined with androgen
      deprivation therapy can extend progression-free survival, as well as overall survival and
      life quality of patients of oligometastatic prostate cancer compared with androgen
      deprivation therapy alone.
