    <textblock>
      Trial to demonstrate that the intended user population can use the device unsupervised in the
      home and collect data that is of sufficient quality to be successfully analysed for
      respiration rate.

  <detailed_description>

      The aim of the set of Reassure Home User Trials is to confirm that typical users can
      successfully record their sleep respiration data whilst unsupervised in their own home.

      Other objectives:

        -  To gather useful feedback on the user interface and suggestions for its improvement.

        -  To gather information on the device stability in the more variable conditions of the
           home user environment.

        -  To gather data in order to demonstrate compliance with IEC62366, and thus IEC60601-1

      The users had the device for a minimum of 10 nights, to confirm if the device could be used
      for an extended period and the likely compliance rates of users

    <description>The definitions utilised to determine the patient's success or otherwise at making a recording of their sleep respiration data are:
• That 67% of the duration of the recording has to be of sufficient quality for the respiration rate algorithms to be able to discern a respiration rate.
AND
• The duration of analysable data is to be at least 2 hours.</description>

    <description>Second phase of home user trial, testing improvements to the device user interface as a result of the experience from HUT1. Total 11 users.
Main change to device was a simpler set of displays and button-sequence on a 24 hour period.</description>

    <description>Third phase of home user trial, testing the final improvements to the device. A total of 18 users, 16 of which who were part of a couple and 2 who were single.
Main change was the introduction of a scheduled recording option, making the device totally automatic in routine use.</description>
