  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Survivors of pediatric medulloblastoma (MB) are at-risk for neurocognitive and social
      deficits, including specific skills such as facial affect recognition which is the ability to
      recognize the emotional expressions of another person. Because the underlying mechanisms of
      these deficits are poorly understood, the investigators propose to examine social-cognitive
      skills (i.e. facial affect recognition) and indices of brain integrity, including an
      established core neural network of face perception in MB survivors and healthy controls. By
      comparing these outcomes between survivors of MB and healthy controls, investigators seek to
      identify the areas of the brain that help individuals recognize emotions.

      Primary Objective:

        -  To evaluate social cognition in adolescent and young adult survivors of pediatric
           medulloblastoma.

      Secondary Objective:

        -  To examine indices of brain integrity and function and their association with facial
           affect recognition in survivors of pediatric medulloblastoma.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Comprehensive social-cognitive and behavioral data will be collected and structural and
      functional brain imaging will be completed in an attempt to determine if disruptions to brain
      integrity and function caused by prior treatment of medulloblastoma directly influence
      social-cognition and behavior in survivors. These outcomes will be compared between survivors
      and age-, gender-, and race-matched healthy community controls.

      Participants who meet eligibility criteria and consent will undergo neurocognitive
      (intelligence, attention, memory, processing speed, motor, executive function, and
      visuospatial) and social cognitive evaluations (affect recognition, prosody, social memory,
      withdrawal/isolation, loneliness, social anxiety, visuospatial, and executive function).
      Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) will be completed during affect identification
      tasks to assess activation of the core face perception network. Magnetic resonance with
      diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) will be obtained to quantify water diffusion within white
      matter tracts to assess white matter integrity and its association with functional outcomes.

        Medulloblastoma survivors enrolled in the St Jude Lifetime Cohort parent protocol will be
        recruited to complete comprehensive social-cognitive and neurocognitive evaluations as well
        as structural and functional brain imaging. Investigators will also recruit a comparison
        sample of healthy individuals matched on age, sex and race.
