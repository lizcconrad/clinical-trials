             criteria 2010) ;

          4. Documentary evidence that within the last 12 months before signing informed consent
             the patient had:

               1. At least 1 relapse, or

               2. At least 1 Gadolinium enhancing T1-weighted lesion or 1 new T2-weighted lesion in
                  dynamics.

          5. The patient should be neurologically stable during 30 days before signing informed
             consent (i.e. the patient should not have any new or aggravated neurological symptoms,
             as told by the patient); or the patient's condition should be completely stabilized
             since the last relapse, and the duration of stabilization should be at least 30 days)

             clinical signs or laboratory instrumental findings suggesting multiple sclerosis;

          3. A relapse during the screening period ;

          4. Any acute infections, relapses of chronic infections or any other chronic diseases
             that are present on the day of signing informed consent and can, as judged by the

          5. HIV, hepatitis B, hepatitis C, or syphilis ;

          6. Metabolic abnormalities (disorders) manifesting as:

               3. baseline ALT, AST or GGT levels increased more than 2.5-fold vs. upper limit of
                  normal;

               4. baseline bilirubin levels increased more than 1.5-fold vs. upper limit of normal;

          7. Baseline leukocyte counts lower than &lt;3.0 × 109/L, platelet counts lower than &lt;125 ×

                  (interferon beta-1a, interferon beta-1b),

               -  within 30 days before signing informed consent: glatiramer acetate;

               -  within 6 months before signing informed consent: monoclonal antibodies, cytotoxic
                  and/or immunosuppressive drugs, including but not limited to mitoxantrone,

             sclerosis with interferon beta-1a or limit treatment compliance;

         17. Inability to follow the Protocol procedures (in the Investigator's opinion).

         18. Contraindications to MRI or use of gadolinium-containing contrast agents:

             с) Fear of cramped spaces; d) Kidney function impairment with a risk of delayed
             gadolinium elimination (creatinine level increased to more than 2 x upper limit of
             normal); e) Documented diagnosis of sickle cell or hemolytic anemia, hemoglobinopathy.
