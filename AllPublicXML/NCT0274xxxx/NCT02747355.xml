      In adrenal tumors, the investigators will examine if there is any correlation between WIESS
      criteria, prognosis of the tumor, and the different labeling index of the following
      proliferation biomarkers: MCM3, MCM2, KI-67, P53, NEUROPILIN -1, METALLOTHIONEIN,
      SEMAPHORIN-3A.

      One of the problems in managing adrenocortical tumors is the ability to distinguish between
      benign and malignant tumors, while needle biopsy is unable to distinguish between the two
      situations. Therefore, when imaging tests demonstrate a suspected malignant adrenal tumor,
      surgical excision of the tumor is needed. Usually, the histological WIESS criteria are used
      in order to determine malignancy. However, there are cases when adrenal tumors were defined
      by WIESS criteria as benign but metastasized later. Moreover, there is no reliable test than
      can determine prognosis. KI-67 labeling index is a proliferation biomarker which is used to
      tell more about the malignant potential and prognosis of adrenal carcinoma.

      In various types of tumors, proliferation biomarkers are used in attempt to tell about
      prognosis. In this study, the investigators will examine whether some biomarkers can
      differentiate between adrenal carcinoma and adenoma and if the degree of expression of these
      markers is correlated with prognosis.

      The investigators will retrospectively collect 30 cases of adrenal carcinoma, 30 cases of
      adrenal adenoma and 10 cases of normal adrenals. All specimens are preserved with formalin.
      The investigators will re-review the WIESS criteria and all samples will be analyzed for the
      index labeling of the following proliferation biomarkers: MCM3, MCM2, KI-67, P53, NEUROPILIN
      -1, METALLOTHIONEIN, SEMAPHORIN-3A. The investigators will examine if there is any
      correlation between the labeling index of each biomarker, WIESS criteria and prognosis of the
      tumor.
