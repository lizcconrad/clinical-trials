  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Leg spasticity is common problem encountered with a large proportion of patients suffering
      with multiple sclerosis (MS) with an increasing severity as the disease progresses. It mostly
      affects the antigravity muscles that significantly complicates transfer, increases fatigue
      and makes walking more difficult. Hence, leg spasticity often interferes with patients'
      mobility and significantly influences their quality of life. A great number of
      multidisciplinary rehabilitation studies has shown a significant effect of numerous specific
      functional changes in patients with secondary (SP) and primary progressive (PP) MS but there
      are no reviews related to spasticity. The positive therapeutic effect of modulating
      Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation ( TMS) methods on spasticity is shown in only two studies,
      in patients with relapse remitting clinical form in the remission phase of the disease. The
      effect of TMS on clinical measures of lower limb spasticity, functional inability and the
      quality of life in patients with SPMS and PPMS will be examined in this study. The objective
      to this study are to to explore whether rTMS boosted exercise therapy (ET) treatment can
      bring more improvement in lower limb spasticity than ET treatment alone in these patients.
