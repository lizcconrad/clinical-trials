  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective is to test the efficacy of a patient-centered, culturally relevant narrative
      intervention, or &quot;storytelling,&quot; based on the solid conceptual foundation of the narrative
      communication theory and the constructs of the Health Belief Model (HBM) to improve
      medication adherence and outcomes in chronic diseases among African-Americans (AA), using
      gout as an example. Gout is a chronic disease associated with chronic symptoms and disability
      interrupted by intermittent acute flares, similar to Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease
      (COPD) and Congestive Heart Failure (CHF) that leads to joint destruction if not treated
      appropriately. Due to the intermittently symptomatic nature of chronic conditions, patients
      often don't perceive disease severity and susceptibility to disease complications, and,
      therefore, may not balance the barriers and benefits to medication adherence. Storytelling in
      the patients' own voices has the power to directly and more effectively confront a patient's
      barriers to medication adherence, reinforce the benefits and provide useful cues to action.
      Storytelling promotes patient engagement when the patient identifies with the storyteller and
      can lead to a patient's recognition of the need to treat the condition and improve health
      outcomes, as shown by a meaningful improvement in blood pressure in a recent clinical trial
      in AAs with hypertension. The success of this project, combined with other published data,
      will represent a major step toward demonstrating the effectiveness of storytelling to improve
      medication adherence in chronic diseases and will address two VA research priority areas,
      i.e., health care disparities and health care delivery.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators will conduct a 12-month, multicenter, randomized controlled trial among 250
      African-American Veterans with gout with ULT medication possession ratio of &lt;80% at
      Birmingham, St. Louis and Philadelphia VA clinics. The investigators will compare the
      efficacy of the storytelling intervention to usual care in improving Urate Lowering Therapy
      (ULT) adherence, assessed with MEMSCaps (electronic monitoring) at 6-months (primary
      outcome); reducing gout flares needing treatment, improving patient satisfaction, improving
      the ability to achieve target serum urate &lt;6 mg/dl and improving self-reported ULT adherence
      at 6-months (secondary outcomes). The investigators will assess these outcomes at 12-months
      as evidence for sustenance of the effect of intervention.

      Alignment with VA mission and priorities: This study serves the VA's mission of improving the
      health of Veterans and addresses two priority areas, 1) decreasing health care disparities
      and 2) improving health care delivery using a low-cost, technology-based solution to poor
      medication adherence. Study results will lead to a ready-to-implement low cost
      patient-centered intervention for AA Veterans with gout to improve medication adherence and
      patient outcomes. This study will provide the proof of efficacy of &quot;storytelling&quot; for
      improving medication adherence in chronic symptomatic diseases. The &quot;storytelling&quot;
      intervention can be easily adapted for similar chronic symptomatic conditions such as COPD
      and CHF.
