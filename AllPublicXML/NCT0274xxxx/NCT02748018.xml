  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to demonstrate the safety and effectiveness of the Hybrid Closed
      Loop system (HCL) in adult and pediatric patients with type 1 diabetes in the home setting. A
      diverse population of patients with type 1 diabetes will be studied. The study population
      will have a large range for duration of diabetes and glycemic control, as measured by
      glycosylated hemoglobin (A1C). They will be enrolled in the study regardless of their prior
      diabetes regimen, including using Multiple Daily Injections (MDI), Continuous Subcutaneous
      Insulin Infusion (CSII) or Sensor-Augmented Pump therapy (SAP)

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a 6 month, multi-center, randomized, parallel, adaptive study in type 1 diabetes with
      a 6 month continuation period. The study will have three periods:

        1. Run-in Period: The run-in period can be up to 60 days during which time a blinded CGM
           sensor will be worn for two weeks.

        2. Study Period: There will be a 6 month randomized study period with two arms: The HCL
           system and Control.

        3. Continuation Period: There will be a 6 month continuation period during which time all
           subjects will use the HCL system with Auto Mode.

      Up to 1500 subjects will be enrolled in order to have 1000 subjects complete the study. Up to
      70 investigational Centers in the US and Canada, as well as in the Medtronic EMEA region,
      that is comprised of Europe, the Middle East and Africa, will be enrolled.
