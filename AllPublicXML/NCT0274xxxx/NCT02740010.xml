    <textblock>
      The purpose of this observational, non-controlled, multicenter trial with a retrospective
      design is to evaluate the visual performance of one cohort of patients who received the
      multifocal intraocular lenses (MIOL) MINI WELL® following refractive lens exchange (RLE) or
      cataract surgery. Primary outcome were: Uncorrected Distance Visual Acuity, Best Corrected
      Visual Acuity, Best Corrected Near Visual Acuity, onset of halos and glare (during night
      vision). It was also evaluated: Distance-Corrected Contrast sensitivity without glare,
      reading speed with the best correction for distance, and Defocus Curve under photopic
      conditions. ADE/SADE/USADE and AE/SAE were secondary outcomes.

      In order to obtain a presbyopia-correcting IOL with a continuous range of vision, SIFI
      MedTech (Catania, Italy) recently developed Mini WELL®, a preloaded progressive multifocal
      aspheric IOL, which optical design increases the depth of focus to generate continuum foci.
      The in vitro optical quality of this lens has been assessed showing larger defocus tolerance
      at near distance vision (in comparison with diffractive lens) and a better optical quality at
      far vision with 4.5 mm aperture against both diffractive, and trifocal lens. Mini WELL® has
      been granted a CE-mark for use only in March 2014, but it has quickly gained pleasing
      evaluations in ophthalmology congress. On June 2015, verified that no publication on Mini
      WELL® clinical performance was yet available, four Italian Investigators have decided to
      collaborate in a retrospectively study. The collected sample is fully representative of
      Italian population, considering the total number of MINI WELL® delivered in Italy (150 lens
      on August 2015) and the range of involved sides (University Department, Ophthalmology
      Research Institute, Public Hospital and Private Clinics). The primary objective of the trial
      is to evaluate retrospectively the visual performance of the MINI WELL® in qualitative and
      quantitative terms of the progressive vision. The collected variables are: Uncorrected
      distance Visual Acuity (UCVA), Best Corrected Visual Acuity (BCVA), Best Corrected Near
      Visual Acuity (BCNVA), onset of halos, and onset of glare during night vision. In addition,
      are also evaluated: Monocular Distance-Corrected Contrast sensitivity without glare,
      Monocular and binocular reading speed with the best correction for distance and Monocular
      Defocus Curve under photopic conditions. The secondary outcomes are: ADE/SADE/USADE and
      AE/SAE. The cohort of subjects includes all patients submitted in the five involved Centers
      for the surgical procedure for cataract extraction or Refractive Lens Exchange (RLE) using
      the MINI WELL® with a pre-operative visit (from day - 30 to day -2 before surgery) and a
      post-operative follow up visit performed 30 days after implant (with a window of - 14 and +
      28 days). The period of observation is from March 1st, 2014 to March, 31st, 2016, while the
      Data Collection period is from April, 30th, 2016 to July, 31st, 2016
