      This study will evaluate the effects of screening for type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and
      brief counseling about screening test results on weight and key health behaviors among
      Veterans with risk factors for T2DM. Study participants will be randomly assigned to one of
      two study groups: (1) Blood Test Group or (2) Brochure Group. Participants in the Blood Test
      Group will complete a blood test called hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) which measures average blood
      sugar levels. Participants will receive brief counseling about the results from their primary
      care provider or someone authorized to speak on their behalf. Participants randomly selected
      for the Brochure Group will review a handout from the VA National Center for Health Promotion
      and Disease Prevention (NCP) on recommended screening tests and immunizations. All
      participants will be asked to complete a survey prior to study group assignment, immediately
      after a Primary Care appointment, 3 months after enrollment, and 12 months after enrollment.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      An essential step in designing effective strategies to improve patient engagement in behavior
      change is to better understand their current levels of engagement in these behaviors and
      determine which factors most influence their engagement. Within and outside the Veterans
      Health Administration (VHA), little is known about how patients with risk factors for T2DM
      view their risk of developing T2DM, what these patients understand about strategies to reduce
      this risk, and to what degree at-risk patients are currently engaging in behaviors to prevent
      T2DM. This project will generate important new data in these areas and will improve the
      investigators' understanding of the effects of a prediabetes diagnosis and brief counseling
      on engagement in behaviors to prevent T2DM and mediators of these behaviors.

    <description>Patients randomly assigned to the Blood Test Group will complete an HbA1c blood test around the time of their next primary care appointment. Following the HbA1c test, their VA primary care provider will be notified of the test result and will be provided with a detailed interpretation of the result. Trained study staff will then provide brief counseling by phone and written information by mail about their test result. The brief counseling and written information will be based on the American Diabetes Association and National Diabetes Prevention Program guidelines and will emphasize the risk of progression to type 2 diabetes mellitus and the rationale for preventive strategies, encourage aerobic exercise and a calorie-restricted diet to promote and maintain weight loss, and set a goal of achieving and sustaining a weight loss of at least 5% of body weight.</description>
