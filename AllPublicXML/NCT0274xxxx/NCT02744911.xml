  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Telehealth, increasingly recognized in the neurology field as a solution to access issues for
      people with Parkinson's disease, improves access to speech therapy, particularly those living
      in rural areas or with travel barriers. The SpeechVive device, developed by SpeechVive, Inc.,
      is a treatment solution that is easy to use and effective. In an NIH funded study, the
      SpeechVive device improved communication in 90% of individuals with PD by improving volume,
      articulation, and speech rate. The investigators propose to eliminate the one drawback of the
      SpeechVive device, namely that it currently must be programmed by a speech-language
      pathologist for each patient in person. The overall goal of this project is to develop a
      telehealth platform for the SpeechVive device that will enable video conferencing for
      treatment and remote programming of the SpeechVive device for each patient. Once the platform
      has been developed, the investigators will conduct a study to examine effectiveness and the
      patient and caregiver satisfaction with telepractice using the SpeechVive device.

    <description>The SpeechVive is a wearable device that plays multi-talker babble noise in one ear while the person wearing it is talking. The noise is voice-activated (only present when the person speaks). The noise does not interfere with the ability to hear communication partners. The noise coming from the device functions as a natural external cue for people with Parkinson's disease to talk more loudly and clearly. Treatment will involve asking the participants to wear the device daily during the treatment period.</description>

    <ipd_description>The data from the people with Parkinson's disease and their caregivers will include limited financial information, perceptions of speech telepractice, survey data, and some objective measurements of speech production. Once de-identified and published in peer-reviewed journals, these data will be made available upon request. Any researcher requesting access to these data will need to submit the following to Jessica Huber:
Name and institution of PI
Proof of institutional appointment
Names and roles for all individuals who will access the data for the planned analysis
Detailed plan for the use of the data
Timeline for use and publication of the analyses If Dr. Huber approves the data use, the PI must sign a license with Purdue University's Office of Technology Commercialization promising to keep the data confidential, to not share it with anyone not named in the application above, and to destroy the data once analysis is complete.</ipd_description>
