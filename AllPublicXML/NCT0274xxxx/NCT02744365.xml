      The Biobank includes data and biological specimens of women from three original studies: 1)
      First-trimester Prediction of Preeclampsia (PREDICTION Study, NCT02189148), 2) Pre-Eclampsia
      And growth Retardation, an evaluative Longitudinal study (PEARL Study, NCT02379832), 3)
      Effect of Low Dose Aspirin on Birthweight in Twins: The GAP Trial (NCT02280031) and
      4)PREDICTION2: Prediction of Preeclampsia and other Pregnancy Complications Following
      Combined Iterative Screening.

      This Biobank is comprised of: 1) medical, social, obstetrical and ultrasonographic data, 2)
      human biological samples (maternal plasma, serum and buffy coat, maternal urine, cord blood)
      and 3) the results derived from these (biochemical or ultrasonographic markers, genetics,
      risk calculations ...)
