      Objectives: To determine whether TRUS-guided prostate biopsy performed in patients continuing
      low-dose aspirin (LDA) is associated with a greater incidence, duration, and severity of
      bleeding complications.

      Eligibility: Men over 40-year-old with an elevated serum prostate-speciﬁc antigen level
      and/or abnormal digital rectal examination ﬁndings are candidates for PB.

      Design of trial Prospective Randomized Trial Study treatment: Continuing low-Dose aspirin
      before transrectal prostate biopsy Primary endpoint: The incidence, duration, and severity of
      bleeding complications Statistical analysis and sample size estimation: Fisher's exact test
      or chi-square test will be used to explore the differences between two groups for categorical
      variables, and Student t-test will be used for continuous variables. Under the assumption of
      a difference of 25% of bleeding complications in each group, with α=0.05 and power=0.80, 60
      subject are needed in each arm. Assuming the drop-out rate to be 20%, the targeted recruit
      number is 150 in total.

    <textblock>
      Transrectal ultrasound (TRUS)-guided prostate biopsy (PB) is currently the standard for
      diagnosing prostate cancer and is one of the most commonly performed urologic procedures.

      The complications that can occur after this procedure have been extensively described
      previously. Bleeding complications, namely hematuria, rectal bleeding, and hematospermia, are
      the most frequent, with a reported incidence of 20% to 70%, but they are almost exclusively
      self-limiting and of mild to moderate severity.

      There is an increasing number of patients who require PB and antiplatelet medication
      simultaneously. This is because more middle-age and elderly patients are receiving long-term
      antithrombotic therapy mainly for prevention of cardiovascular events, and these patients
      form the majority of those at risk of prostate cancer. As with other surgical interventions,
      aspirin is typically discontinued 7 to 10 days before PB. However, discontinuing aspirin
      might increase the risk of cardiovascular events, while continuing aspirin before PB might
      not necessarily increase severe bleeding complications. Several studies have found no
      increase in bleeding complications in patients continuing low-dose aspirin. However, most of
      the studies were retrospective, and only one was randomized. Moreover, there has been no
      prospective randomized trial in East Asian patients, who have a lower risk of thrombosis and
      increased risk of bleeding during antithrombotic treatment for acute coronary syndrome than
      do white patients.

      The aim of the present randomized study was to determine whether TRUS-guided PB performed in
      patients continuing low-dose aspirin (LDA) is associated with a greater incidence, duration,
      and severity of bleeding complications.
