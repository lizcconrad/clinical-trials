  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim is to investigate muscle soreness and stiffness in patients with Chronic or Frequent
      Episodic Tension Type Headache before and after treatment with amitriptyline - and to compare
      the results with healthy individuals.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The muscle stiffness is measured with ultrasonic shear wave elastography in m. masseter, m.
      sternocleidomastoid and m. Trapezius.

      The muscle soreness is measured by palpation of the muscles aided by a so called palpometer.

    <measure>Change in Total Tenderness Score</measure>
    <time_frame>March 2016 to march 2018. Up to 4 months.</time_frame>
    <description>The soreness of the muscle is reported by the patient on a scale from 0-3 (0= no pain, 1= mild pain, 2= moderate pain and 3= severe pain) when pressure is applied at eight different locations on both sides of the face and neck (m. masseter, m. frontalis, m. pterygoideus lateralis, m. temporalis, m. sternocleidomastoid, pros. mastoideus, m. trapezius and the insertions of the neck muscles at the base of the scull.) The sum of the individual scores make up the total tenderness.</description>

    <measure>Change in muscle stiffness</measure>
    <time_frame>March 2016 to march 2018. Up to 4 months.</time_frame>
    <description>The stiffness is measured in terms of the speed of the shear waves (meter/second) the higher the speed the stiffer the muscle.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Local Tenderness Score</measure>
    <time_frame>March 2016 to march 2018. Up to 4 months.</time_frame>
    <description>Aided by a palpometer a pressure of 160 U is applied to four different locations (m. masseter, m. sternocleidomastoid, the lateral part of m. trapezius and the medial part of the m. trapezius.) At each location the patient report the pain intensity on a scale from 0-10.</description>
