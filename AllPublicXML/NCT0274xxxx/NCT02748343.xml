    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare use of a tissue-engineered bone to use of a standard
      allograft bone to treat bone defect in patients. The hypothesis is that use of the
      tissue-engineered bone is effective and safe to treat the bone defect in patients.

      Patients with the bone defect without infection and sever system diseases will be recruited.

      The material selected as the scaffold for this study will be a porous β-tricalcium phosphate
      scaffold (β-TCP) scaffold and scaffold is custom-made according to the size and shape of bone
      defect after three-dimensional CT scan. Human BMSCs will be obtained and cultured before
      operation and 3.4×106 cells in 10ml serum-free medium will be seeded onto scaffold to
      construct the tissue engineered bone graft and co-cultured for two weeks.

      The implant operation will be carried out under the general anesthesia. The tissue engineered
      bone graft will be implanted into the bone defect area. The bone defect area will be covered
      with surrounding soft tissue and muscle to close the wound. Anti-inflammatory, repercussive
      and analgesic drugs will be used for 1 week.

      Patient will be hospitalized for 1 to 2 weeks after surgery. Blood routine examination,
      erythrocyte sedimentation rate, immunoglobulin, autoantibodies and clinical examination will
      be carried out for signs of pain, swelling, immune rejection and infection. Patient will be
      evaluated at 3 days，3, 6, 12, 18 and 22 months after operation by radiography;
      Three-dimensional CT scan will be also performed at regular intervals. The function of the
      body will be evaluated at regular intervals.
