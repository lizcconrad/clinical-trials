  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Previously published studies have indicated that there exist difference in electrical
      properties (EPs), i.e., the conductivity and relative permittivity, between malignant and
      adjacent normal tissue, which will be useful in the early detection of cancers. While the EP
      informations of cancer tissues are not sufficient enough. The purpose of this study is to
      measure the electrical properties of the excised malignant tissues obtained from cancer
      surgeries.

      The measurements were conducted in the operating rooms of the hospital where the tissues were
      excised. Once the tissue was excised from the patient, the pathologist assisted the one of
      the engineers (already at the hospital) responsible to conduct the measurement. The specimen
      were designed to permit at least one measurement of malignant tissue and at least one
      measurement of normal tissue. Occasionally, the measurement of normal tissue was not possible
      if, for example, the normal tissue occupied a volume of small proportion for every excised
      specimen. The specimens for dielectric properties measurement were classified as normal or
      malignant by the pathologist based on his own expertise and decision criteria (visual
      inspection, anatomy) and the per-operative histological examination. The measurements were
      directly performed on the bulk specimen. The patient age, tissue temperature at the time of
      measurement and time between excision and measurement for each sample were recorded.

    <description>The dielectric properties of the tissues were measured using the open-ended coaxial line method. The measurement system consisted of a network analyzer (Model 4395A, Agilent Corp., Santa Clara, CA) associated with an S-parameter test set (Model 87511A, Agilent Corp., Santa Clara, CA). A semi-rigid coaxial line with a diameter of 3.58 mm was connected to the network analyzer system by using a Bayonet Neill-Concelman connector. The other tip of the coaxial line (probe) was placed on the flat bare surface of the tissue that placed on a measurements experiment platform.</description>
