    <textblock>
      The purpose of the research is to identify the prevalence of preconception health (PCH) risk
      factors in the Wellington-Dufferin-Guelph (WDG) catchment area and to determine whether or
      not a client-driven electronic preconception health risk assessment tool &quot;My Health
      eSnapshot&quot;, for use during healthcare visits, will increase preconception health knowledge
      and behaviour change among women of reproductive age (15-49 years).

      The purpose of the project is:

        1. To develop a client-driven electronic preconception health client risk assessment tool
           for use in a primary care setting.

        2. To develop a customized key message handout for patients based on their risk assessment
           results.

        3. To determine a successful and sustainable process for healthcare providers (HCPs) to
           administer the risk assessment tool and discuss results with patients within their
           primary care setting.

        4. To increase participants' knowledge of preconception health and their risk factors as a
           results of the risk assessment tool and discussion with their HCP.

        5. To modify participants' health behaviours as a result of the risk assessment tool and
           discussion with their HCP.

        6. To increase WDG Public Health's understanding of the most prevalent preconception health
           risk factors among reproductive women in WDG.

    <description>The patient will complete an online survey tool in their home one week after completing the risk assessment tool. The survey asks questions about their experience competing the risk assessment tool, talking with their health care provider, and receiving their customized patient handout. The patient will also provide feedback on the strengths and limitations of the risk assessment tool and patient handout. This feedback will contribute to future modifications to study tools and processes.</description>

    <description>Patient complete an online survey tool in their home two months after completing the risk assessment tool. The survey asks questions about whether there has been any changes in motivation regarding changing health behaviours and whether any changes have actually been made to the health behaviours.</description>
