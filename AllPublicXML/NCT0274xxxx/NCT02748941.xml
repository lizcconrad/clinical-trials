  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cerebrovascular accident (CVA) constitutes a major health public problem. This represents the
      second cardiovascular death cause. CVA is ischemic in 80% of cases. Atheroma of large
      arteries, mainly carotid, is involved in about 20% of cases.

      After several high grade studies (NASCET, ECST, ACAS, ACST), carotid surgery is based on
      stenosis calculation by Doppler ultrasound, CT angiography, MRI angiography or arteriography.

      The composition of the plaque, showing its vulnerability, is associated with embolic risk and
      stroke. The therapeutic strategy based only on the narrowing of the arterial lumen is not
      satisfactory enough to prevent the occurrence of a transient ischemic attack (TIA) or an
      ipsilateral stroke due to carotid stenosis. Thus, new techniques emerge, to evaluate in vivo
      the inflammation of the plaque, its embolic consequences or the mechanical stress it
      undergoes. These techniques are: High Resolution MRI (HR MRI), evaluation of the Gray Scale
      Median (GSM) level, study of the plaque vascularization with Contrast Enhanced ultrasound
      (CEUS), High Intensity Transient Signals (HITS) by transcranial Doppler, micro RNA profile
      (mi RNA). These different modalities must be combined in order to increase the efficiency.

      Based on these encouraging results, the investigator aim at evaluating the ability of
      different methods or their combination to predict the occurrence of ischemic stroke or TIA
      due to emboli from a carotid atherosclerotic plaque. Before considering a cohort study, he
      investigator want to evaluate the performance of each of these new methods in the
      characterization of carotid plaque instability. Performance evaluation will allow us to
      choose secondarily the most relevant association.

      The investigator propose, as a first step, to make a case-control study with these methods,
      the cases are patients who had an ischemic stroke (authenticated by both the clinical exam
      and brain MRI) on the same side as the carotid stenosis and the controls are patients with
      carotid stenosis but without ischemic stroke. This study is a cross-sectional study because
      it simultaneously measures the occurrence of the event (ischemic stroke) and the
      characteristics of the atheromatous plaque.

      Over a 2 year period, 45 symptomatic patients and 105 asymptomatic patients will be included
      with a carotid stenosis with at least a 50% caliber constriction according to NASCET
      criteria. (North American Symptomatic Carotid Endarterectomy Trial).
