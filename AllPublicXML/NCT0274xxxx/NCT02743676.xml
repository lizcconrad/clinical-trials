  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a global, multi-center, observational registry of participants with suspected or
      confirmed infection with avian influenza A H5N1. Data are collected through retrospective
      abstraction, from detailed case reports that may be published and available in the public
      domain, or as incident cases received directly from the treating physician or other medical
      personnel.

        with avian influenza A H5N1.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Participants who develop influenza-like symptoms and who are considered to be
             epidemiologically linked by time, place, and exposure to a probable or confirmed avian
             influenza or human case of H5N1 infection are eligible for inclusion in the Registry.
             Cases with atypical symptom presentation (e.g., non-respiratory) are also included, in
             keeping with evolving knowledge about the clinical presentation of avian influenza.

          -  Participants with documented positive serological test who either remain asymptomatic
             or experience mild illness only

          -  Participants with laboratory confirmation of infection with influenza A (H5N1) who
             survive long enough to present for medical care
