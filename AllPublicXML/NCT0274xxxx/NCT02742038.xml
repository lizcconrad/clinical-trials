    <textblock>
      Triple-blind randomized controlled trial with two parallel arms conducted between 2012 and
      2014. Children 2-3 years old, from 28 rural public preschools, located in low socioeconomic
      areas of Chile were invited to participate. Oral health education component was given to
      children, parents and educators, twice yearly. A new toothbrush and toothpaste for each child
      was delivered to the parents at baseline and in each of the follow-up visits. The
      experimental group was treated with fluoride varnish every six months while the control group
      received placebo applications. 277 preschoolers (2 to 3 years) Main outcome: Number of Caries
      Incident Cases, increment dmft index

      was delivered to the parents at baseline and in each of the follow-up visits. The
      experimental group was treated with fluoride varnish every six months while the control group
      received placebo applications. A trained, calibrated dentists blinded to treatment arm
      performed a visual-tactile dental assessment at 6, 12, 18 and 24 months. The number of
      incidents children with caries were recollected as the number of caries during the follow-up
      visits.

      Nº of participant/ centres: 277 preschoolers (2 to 3 years) of 28 public preschools in
      non-fluoridated areas.
