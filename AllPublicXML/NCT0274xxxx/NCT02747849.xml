      The investigators believe in order to strengthen the evidence in support of transcutaneous
      foot stimulation in this population the investigators need to move forward with a randomized
      comparison study using the TENS device on the hand and foot as a control.

    <textblock>
      Nocturnal enuresis is a common problem in children which can have a dramatic psychological
      and social impact on quality of life. Neuromodulation by transcutaneous foot stimulation of
      peripheral tibial nerve branches has been shown to produce a prolonged inhibition of
      micturition reflex contractions and significantly increase bladder capacity. The
      investigators primary goal was to evaluate the effect of foot stimulation on the frequency of
      nocturnal enuresis episodes in children.

    <description>Subjects will complete the quality of life questionnaire attached to this application at the start of the study (prior to week 1) to establish a baseline, after the second week of treatment period (week 4 of study) to determine a treatment effect, and after the sixth week to determine any residual post-treatment effect</description>

    <time_frame>6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The subject/parents will be instructed to record a night-time voiding log specifying the number of incontinent episodes per night. This log is included in the IRB application. Subjects/parents will fill out the log for a two week period prior to foot stimulation to determine a baseline average of nocturnal enuresis episodes, during week 3 and 4 of the study the subjects will stimulate either their foot or hand to measure any acute effect on nocturnal enuresis episodes and finally during week 5 and 6 of the study, after stimulation subjects will keep a log to evaluate any post-stimulation residual benefit</description>

    <description>Subjects will be asked to use the stimulator for a MINIMUM of 60 minutes in the evening prior to bedtime at home for two weeks. They will be encouraged to use the stimulator for more time than the minimum as long as they accurately record the total duration. Stimulation will be performed during the first and second and third weeks of the study only. Subjects are required to wear the device for a minimum of one hour required. If the subject can tolerate it longer and have the time, they can wear it. Time may be a limiting factor as we require the stimulation to office before bedtime.</description>

    <description>In our pilot study, transcutaneous foot stimulation of the tibial nerve appears to be a safe and effective novel treatment to decrease the number of wet nights in children. A placebo-controlled study is currently in accrual to strengthen the evidence in support of transcutaneous foot stimulation in this population.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Children ages 5 to 18 years old without any specific neurological disorder or urinary
             tract infection, clinically diagnosed as having nocturnal enuresis AT LEAST 4 episodes
             per month by history, nocturnal enuresis is a DSM V diagnosable medical condition

          2. Currently having no daytime overactive bladder symptoms, i.e. urinary frequency,
             urgency, or daytime incontinence

          3. Having been assessed for and treated if applicable for behavioral etiologies of
             nocturnal enuresis - consuming excess fluids or specific bladder irritants

          4. Having been assessed for and treated if applicable for constipation

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Children with known neurological disorders which may be contributing to nocturnal
             enuresis episodes

          2. Children found through history to have significant behavioral causes of nocturnal
             enuresis including consumption of excessive fluids or known bladder irritants

          3. Children with chronic constipation who are non-compliant with previous pharmacologic
             efforts to treat.

          4. Children who are not adequately potty trained

          5. Children with significant daytime symptoms of overactive bladder including frequency,
             urgency, and daytime incontinence

          6. Children who do not tolerate initial stimulation training session in the urology
             clinic upon enrollment

          7. Children with any implantable medical devices such as a pacemaker will be excluded
             from the study

        Note: Any patient currently taking medication such as an anti-muscarinic or a tricyclic
        antidepressant for overactive bladder at time of enrollment will be eligible to participate
        and will be continued on their usual medication and dosage throughout the study.
