          4. Medically healthy with no clinically significant medical history, physical
             examination, laboratory profiles, vital signs or ECGs, as deemed by the PI or

             aminotransferase (AST) and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) &lt; the upper limit of normal and

             (No restrictions are required for a vasectomized male provided his vasectomy has been
             performed 4 months or more prior to first dose/dosing of study drug. A subject who has
             been vasectomized less than 4 months prior to study first dose/dosing must follow the
             same restrictions as a non-vasectomized male).

             disease in the opinion of the PI or designee.

          3. History of any illness that, in the opinion of the PI or designee, might confound the
             results of the study or poses an additional risk to the subject by their participation
             in the study.

          4. History or presence of alcoholism or drug abuse within the past 2 years prior to the

             recurrent diarrhea or gout.

          7. Positive urine drug or alcohol results at screening or check-in.

         11. QTc interval is &gt;460 msec (males) or has ECG findings deemed abnormal with clinical
             significance by the PI or designee at screening.

         12. Estimated creatinine clearance ≤80 mL/min at screening.

         13. Unable to refrain from or anticipates the use of any drug, including prescription and
             non-prescription medications, herbal remedies, or vitamin supplements beginning 14
             days prior to the first dose and throughout the study. Acetaminophen (up to 2 g per 24
             hour period) and medications for the treatment of adverse events may be permitted
             during the study.

         14. Has been on a diet incompatible with the on-study diet, in the opinion of the PI or
             designee, within the 28 days prior to the first dose and throughout the study.

         15. Is lactose intolerant.

         16. Is unable to complete the critical meal (i.e., breakfast prior to dosing).

         17. Donation of blood or significant blood loss within 56 days prior to the first dose.

         18. Plasma donation within 7 days prior to the first dose.

         19. Participation in another clinical study within 28 days prior to the first dose. The
             28-day window will be derived from the date of the last blood collection or dosing,
             whichever is later, in the previous study to Day 1 of Period 1 of the current study.
