  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Approximately 50% of preterm infants less than 32 weeks require respiratory assistance at the
      time of transition at birth. For that stabilization during resuscitation is successful, it is
      essential for proper ventilation. This transition is performed with non-invasive respiratory
      support and administration of positive pressure ventilation to establish adequate functional
      residual capacity. The problem is that a peak inspiratory fixed during ventilation, and
      adequate tidal volume is assumed, but usually not measured, unable to correct the peak
      pressure to optimize ventilation and reduce lung damage. In addition, frequent adverse events
      may hinder or impair the effectiveness of the ventilation, with the consequent deterioration
      in the prognosis of the newborn.

      HYPOTHESIS The ability to visualize the parameters and curves respiratory flow, tidal volume
      and air pressure by respiratory monitoring with MFR during cardiopulmonary resuscitation in
      newborns in the delivery room, decreases at least 10% surfactant need in first 72 hours of
      life.

      EVALUATION Data collection will be made prospectively. Investigators will measure the
      parameters of lung mechanics (tidal volume expiratory airflow (TVe), peak inspiratory
      pressure (PIP), pressure at the end of exhalation (PEEP), inspiratory time (iT)), in each of
      inflations administered to preterm with VPP or during the administration of continuous
      positive airway pressure (CPAP) in spontaneous breathing, in the first 10 minutes after
      birth, recording the air leakage through the mask and obstructions. Investigators also
      measure parameters of respiratory status and hemodynamic (FIO 2, oxygen saturation, end tidal
      CO2, respiratory rate, heart rate), patient monitoring during the implementation of the
      protocol, blood gases, manipulations of the airway during intervention and the onset of
      complications.

      Patients will be randomize in a Group 1, where these parameters of lung mechanics would be
      visible and other Group 2, where the parameters of TVe and respiratory flow would not be
      visible by the rescuer (the usual parameters of PIP and PEEP will be visible). Always, in
      both groups, current recommendations ventilation measures included in cardiopulmonary
      resuscitation of newborns of the Spanish Society of Neonatology, based on international
      recommendations (1-3.5) apply. In turn, the results analyzed in two subgroups between 24 and
      27 + 6 weeks gestational age and 28 to 32 + 6 weeks.
