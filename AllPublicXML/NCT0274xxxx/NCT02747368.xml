  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim is to study the use of Ocusweep system especially in driving health evaluation and
      compare the results produced by Ocusweep system to those of conventional devices. The main
      focus is in patients suffering from wet age-related macular degeneration. The study aims to
      find out how frequently these patients do not meet the European Union health criteria of safe
      driving and how Ocusweep finds these patients from a population of patients being treated in
      a busy medical retina clinic. The tests of Ocusweep system are compared against conventional
      visual field tests, contrast sensitivity tests, visual acuity tests and tests showing
      anatomical changes related to wet age-related macular degeneration (optical coherence
      tomography, fundus photography and fluorescein or indocyanine green angiography).
