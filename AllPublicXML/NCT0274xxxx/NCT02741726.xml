  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the effects of dual acupoints and single acupoint
      transcutaneous electrical acupoint stimulation (TEAS) pretreatment on incidence of
      Post-Mastectomy Pain Syndrome(PMPS) in patients undergoing operation of breast cancer.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients were randomly assigned to three groups, receiving 30min TEAS before anesthesia
      respectively. The acupoints of dual point group are bilateral Neiguan points(PC6) combined
      with Danzhong point(RN17), single point group is bilateral Neiguan points(PC6), and the false
      stimulation group only attach electrodes without electric current. The frequency of TEAS is
      set to 2/15 Hz. Intraoperative anesthetic dosage of propofol and remifentanil was recorded.
      Three and six months after surgery, follow-up about chronic pain was made by telephone or
      face-to-face using the follow-up questionnaire. The adverse events were recorded.
