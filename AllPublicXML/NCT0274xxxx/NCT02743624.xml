  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The indications for mechanical ventilation (MV) include excessive work of breathing, with or
      without evidence of respiratory muscle fatigue. The setting of the MV is still a challenge
      because it is based on criteria understudied, often subjective and observer-dependent.
      Despite several studies, to our knowledge has never been done before is the precise
      definition of the optimal range of ventilatory support. Novel and recognizable diagnostic
      techniques will be applied. No single parameter of the breathing pattern has good accuracy
      for the adjustment of ventilatory support. Non-invasive measures such as P0.1 and rate of
      muscle relaxation may have good accuracy for the adjustment of ventilatory support.
