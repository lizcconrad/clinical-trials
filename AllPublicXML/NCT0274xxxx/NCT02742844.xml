    <textblock>
      The aim of this clinical trial is to investigate the efficacy (by monitoring the wound size
      reduction) and safety (by monitoring occurring adverse events) of the investigational
      medicinal product APZ2 after one single application on chronic venous leg ulcer wounds.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an interventional, single arm, phase I/IIa clinical trial to investigate the efficacy
      and safety of ABCB5+ mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) on wound healing in patients with chronic
      venous ulcer (CVU). Autologous MSCs will be isolated ex vivo from a small skin biopsy and
      will be expanded in vitro. The IMP APZ2 incorporating the ABCB5+ will then be applied on the
      wound surface of CVU under local anesthesia.

      Patients are followed up for efficacy for 3 months which allows to distinguish actual wound
      healing from transient wound coverage.

      The wound healing process will be documented by standardized photography. The wound size
      evaluation will start on the day of the first change of wound dressing. The quality of the
      wound healing process will be assessed on the basis of formation of granulation tissue,
      epithelialization and wound exudation.

      Pain will be assessed using a numerical rating scale and quality of life will be investigated
      with standardized and validated questionnaires. To assess long-term safety of APZ2 an
      additional follow-up visit at Month 12 post IMP application is included.

         20. Current or previous (within 30 days of enrollment) treatment with another IMP, or
             participation and/or under follow-up in another clinical trial;

         21. Previous participation in this clinical trial;

         22. Evidence of any other medical conditions (such as psychiatric illness, physical
             examination, or laboratory findings) that may interfere with the planned treatment,
             affect the patient's compliance, or place the patient at high risk of complications
             related to the treatment;

         23. Employees of the sponsor, or employees or relatives of the investigator.

        Exclusion criteria for efficacy assessments

          1. A wound size enlargement of more than 25% between the wound assessment at the
             screening visit and the wound assessment at Visit 5;

          2. A wound size reduction of more than 50% between the wound assessment at the screening
             visit and wound assessment at Visit 5.
