  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Heart surgery procedures are still widely used worldwide for the treatment of patients with
      heart problems, and rates of complications in the postoperative period related to them remain
      high. In these patients, physical conditioning programs result in improved functional
      capacity, and reducing the heart rate and systolic blood pressure. The inspiratory muscle
      training is also emerging as a valuable strategy in the treatment of cardiac patients. The
      study of the interaction between cardiac rehabilitation and high intensity IMT about these
      changes is not yet understood in this population. The aim of this study is to assess the
      effects of inspiratory muscle training high intensity associated with cardiac rehabilitation
      exercise performance of patients in the postoperative period of CABG surgery.

      It is a controlled, randomized clinical trial in which patients were randomly assigned
      randomly after referral to cardiac rehabilitation: Group 1 IMT-HI, group 2 - IMT-HI control.
      The evaluator of outcomes is blinded as to groups. The study protocol lasts 36 sessions for
      both groups. The group 1 patients performs cardiac rehabilitation protocol for 40 minutes
      with cardio and stretching and also inspiratory muscle training protocol of high intensity
      with 50% load increase in maximal inspiratory pressure during the first two weeks, 60% of MIP
      in third and fourth week, 70% of MIP in the fifth and sixth week and 80% MIP in the seventh
      and eighth week. The group 2 patients only perform the cardiac rehabilitation protocol for 40
      minutes with aerobic exercise and stretching.

    <description>The inspiratory muscle training protocol (IMT) high intensity is achieved with a device with linear load pressure (POWERbreathe Plus Light Resistance®, SP, BR) that allows loads up to -90cmH2O. IMT is performed for 36 sessions (12 weeks) with weekly frequency of three times a week under supervision prior to the cardiac rehabilitation. The training protocol consists of five series with 10 repetitions each set until the 8th week with increase in the number of sets of repetitions of the 8th to 12th week, with two minutes or according to patient feedback using the modified Borg scale . Aerobic training lasts 40 minutes (5 minutes heating 30 minute workout and 5 minutes desaqueciemento. During training vital signs such as heart rate, blood pressure (BP) and peripheral oxygen saturation (SpO2) are evaluated and the feeling of effort the patient should not exceed the level of 8 according to the modified Borg scale.</description>
