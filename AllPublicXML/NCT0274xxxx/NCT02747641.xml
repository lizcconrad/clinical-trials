  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the use of the Alma CO2 Pixel FemiLift™ in the
      treatment of VulvoVaginal Atrophy (VVA) in postmenopausal female subjects. The primary
      endpoint is to assess the change in the vaginal dryness by means of a Visual Analogic Scale
      (10 cm VAS) and/or Bachmann Index in VVA. The clinical improvement will be assessed by
      patient filled Vulvovaginal Atrophy.
