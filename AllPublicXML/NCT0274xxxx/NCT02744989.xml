  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This project aims to provide the proof of concept for transcranial direct-current stimulation
      (tDCS) in the treatment of resistant/persistent Schizophrenia symptoms. The purpose is to
      investigate the effect of tDCS on symptoms in schizophrenic patients demonstrating a partial
      response to a first frequently prescribed antipsychotic medication. An early optimization of
      the therapeutic strategy must constitute an important factor for prognosis. Hypothesize is
      that tDCS should alleviate symptoms in patients depending on the clinical characteristics. In
      this study, stimulation is an add-on treatment to antipsychotic medication, and will be used
      in a broad variety of patients, i.e. in patients with varied durations of illness, various
      symptoms profiles, and various levels of treatment response. This in turn will allow the
      determination of the extent to which results can be generalized to varied patient
      populations, as well as the extent to which various therapeutic targets (e.g. different
      symptom dimensions, cognitive performance and brain connectivity) may be improved with tDCS.
      Despite interesting preliminary results, our team is unable to describe optimal non-invasive
      brain stimulation (NIBS) response markers.

      This study is a randomized, double blind, controlled, French multicenter study (11 centers).
      The investigators plan to include 138 patients with persistent symptoms in schizophrenia.
      Sixty-nine subjects will receive active tDCS and 69 subjects will receive sham tDCS
      (placebo). Hypothesize is a lasting effect of active tDCS on the schizophrenic symptoms as
      measured by the number of responders, defined as a decrease of at least 25% of symptoms as
      measured by a standardized clinical scale score (PANSS) between baseline and after the
      10-session tDCS regimen.

      Furthermore, the participants believe that an in depth understanding of the cortical effects
      of tDCS could constitute an important step towards improving the technique and developing
      treatment response markers. An analysis of the effects on cortical activity and plasticity
      markers could be an interesting approach.

    <description>The number of responders is based on the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) score in the active and the sham group after 5 days of tDCS.
According to Leucht et al (2009), response is defined as a decrease of at least 25% in the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS, Kay et al., 1987) score after the intervention.</description>

    <description>Long-term clinical efficacy of active tDCS on schizophrenic symptoms is assessed by PANSS score measured between baseline (day 0), after 10-sessions of tDCS regimen (day 5), 1 month after tDCS (day 30), 3 months after tDCS (day 90) and 6 months after tDCS (day 180).
The PANSS is a 30-item rater-administered assessment scale of the psychopathological symptoms observed in patients experiencing psychotic states, in particular schizophrenia. The items are noted from 1 to 7. It allows the calculation of the scores for three syndromic dimensions (positive, negative, and general psychopathology), both from a categorical and dimensional perspective. It is particularly recommended for determining a psychopathological profile, to look for predictive elements of an evolution, and to evaluate the respective efficacies of diverse therapeutic strategies.</description>

    <description>Stimulation will be performed using an tDCS stimulator (Neuroconn or Neuroelectric tDCS stimulator) with two 7×5 cm (35 cm2) sponge electrodes soaked in a saline solution (0.9% NaCl). The anode will be placed with the middle of the electrode over a point midway between F3 and FP1 (left prefrontal cortex: dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, assumed to correspond to a region including Brodmann's Areas (BA) 8, 9, 10, and 46, depending on the patient). The cathode will be located over a point midway between T3 and P3 (left temporo-parietal junction, assumed to correspond to a region including BA 22, 39, 40, 41, and 42, depending on the patient). The stimulation level will be set at 2 mA for 20 minutes during stimulation sessions twice a day for 5 consecutive weekdays. The twice daily sessions will be separated by at least 2 hours.</description>
