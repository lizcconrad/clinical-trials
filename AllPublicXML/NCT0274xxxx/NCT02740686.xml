  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will examine the inflammatory response to exercise encompassed as part of a
      standard pulmonary rehabilitation programme in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary
      disease (COPD). Patients will be split into two groups, frequent exacerbators or infrequent
      exacerbators, dependent upon exacerbation history to compare responses to pulmonary
      rehabilitation amongst phenotypes.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Pulmonary rehabilitation has been proven to benefit COPD patients in terms of quality of life
      and functional capabilities. The effects of pulmonary rehabilitation (exercise) on immune
      function are unclear despite clear benefits of exercise on immune function in healthy
      individuals being identified. Moderate-intensity and frequency of exercise has been shown to
      decrease the risk of upper respiratory tract infections in healthy individuals in comparison
      to sedentary individuals. Respiratory infections, also known as exacerbations, in COPD are
      the main cause of hospitalisation and mortality. Therefore, if exercise can modulate immune
      function in COPD, it can be encouraged further in COPD to reduce hospitalisation risk.
      However, it is important to compare the effects of exercise amongst different phenotypes as
      frequent exacerbators are known to have elevated inflammatory markers, and may consequently
      respond to exercise differently to infrequent exacerbators, paving a rationale for a
      different approach to this subset of patients.

    <description>Exacerbations will be defined as &quot;a respiratory event which led to a hospitalisation or the prescription of antibiotics and/or oral corticosteroids&quot;. Clinicians will ask patients to retrospectively recall how many exacerbations they have had in the past 12 months. Patients will be allocated to the frequent exacerbators group based on whether they have had 2 or more hospitalisations for exacerbations or have taken 2 or more courses on steroids/antibiotics within the past 12 months. Blood sample collection at the following pulmonary rehabilitation sessions: 1st (pre-exercise), 2nd (pre and post-exercise), 8th (pre-exercise), last session (pre and post exercise).
