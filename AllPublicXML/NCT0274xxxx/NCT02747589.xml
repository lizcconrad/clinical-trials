  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study, the investigators intend to evaluate the use of a commercially available
      neurostimulator system, NeuroPace RNS System to stimulate the visual cortex. The NeuroPace
      RNS System has a proven record of safety and reliability was approved by the FDA in November
      2013. The RNS System is indicated for use in patients with epilepsy and includes a skull
      implanted neurostimulator. No modification to the RNS System is required for this study. This
      study will use this device to better understand the effect of stimulation on the visual parts
      of the brain.

      The main purposes of this study are to confirm the desired location to implant a device in
      the visual cortex, determine the amount of energy needed to elicit vision, and assess the
      nature of the vision that is produced. This information is important to have early in the
      process of designing a visual cortical prosthesis that could eventually be used for
      commercial use.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Subject is blind (i.e. bare light perception or no light perception in both eyes).

          2. Subject has a history of useful form vision.

          3. Subject is between the age of 18-74.

          4. Subject resides within 2 hours distance (by ground transportation) of the
             investigational site.

          5. Subject is (a) male or (b) a female of childbearing potential with a negative
             pregnancy test who is using a reliable method of contraception or is at least two
             years post-menopause.

          6. Subject is able to complete regular office and telephone appointments per the protocol
             requirements.

          7. Subject is medically fit for neurosurgical intervention.

          8. Subject is considered a good candidate to be implanted with the investigational
             device.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Subject is blind due to cortical etiology (e.g. injury to the visual cortex).

          2. Subject is eligible for another commercially available vision restoration therapy
             (e.g. retinal prosthesis).

          3. Subject is at high risk for surgical complications such as active systemic infection,
             coagulation disorders (such as the use of anti-thrombotic therapies) or platelet count
             below 100,000.

          4. Subject has history of bleeding or immune compromise.

          5. Subject is taking chronic anticoagulants or antiplatelet agent or subject has an
             abnormally elevated preoperative coagulation profile (either PTT or PT/INR).

          6. Subject has had prior craniotomy or brain surgery.

          7. Subject has evidence of active intracranial disease that would preclude elective
             neurosurgical intervention, such as unruptured intracranial aneurysm or brain tumor,
             or aberrant visual cortex anatomy, such as prior stroke or arteriovenous malformation.

          8. Subject has a significant abnormality on preoperative brain MRI

          9. Subject has a prior history of seizures or epilepsy.

         10. Subject has Parkinson's disease

         11. Subject has a prior history of serious head injury with loss of consciousness.

         12. Subject has a progressive central nervous system disease.

         13. Subject has history of implant-related infection.

         14. Implantation of the investigational device would present unacceptable risk.

         15. Subject requires or is likely to require any of the following medical procedures while
             implanted with the NeuroPace RNS System: MR imaging, diathermy, electroconvulsive
             therapy (ECT), or transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). These medical procedures
             are contraindicated for patients with an implanted RNS® System. Energy from these
             procedures can be sent through the implanted brain stimulation system and cause
             permanent brain damage which may cause severe injury, coma, or death. Brain damage can
             occur from any of the listed procedures even if the RNS® Neurostimulator is turned off
             or if the Leads are not connected to the Neurostimulator, and can occur even if the
             Neurostimulator has been removed and any Leads (or any part of a Lead) or the cranial
             prosthesis remain. Refer to the Contraindications section of the RNS System User
             Manual for further details.

         16. Subject is implanted with any neurostimulation or neuromodulation device in the head
             including, but not limited to cochlear implant, deep brain stimulator, or auditory
             brain implant.

         17. Subject has a clinically significant or unstable medical condition including
             uncontrolled systemic hypertension with values above 170/100; cardiac or pulmonary
             disease; uncorrected coagulation abnormalities; diabetes; or any condition that would
             render the patient unable to safely cooperate with the study tests as judged by the
             screening physician.

         18. Subject has had an alcohol or illicit substance use disorder within the last 6 months,
             unstable remission of substance abuse, or chart evidence that co-morbid substance use
             disorder could account for lack of treatment response.

         19. Subject has uncontrolled chronic pain.

         20. Subject has significant neurocognitive impairment in memory domain (based on
             MoCA-BLIND &lt;18 or WAIS-IV &lt;80, described below).

         21. Subject had moderate or severe depression, as determined by a score of at least 17 on
             the HAMD.
