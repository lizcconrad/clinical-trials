      The placental drug Melsmon® is effective for correction of insomnia and other climacteric

      There were 40 women under the observation, with mild and moderate symptoms of climacteric
      syndrome with sleep disorders (for that the investigators evaluated modified Kupperman
      Index).

      All patients were randomized with the help of the envelope method with the allocation ratio
      of 1:1 (one-to-one). 20 women were prescribed placenta extract Melsmon and 20 received
      placebo during 4 months.
