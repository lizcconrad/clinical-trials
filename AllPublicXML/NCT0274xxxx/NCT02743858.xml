  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is being done to find out how many women develop lymphedema after an axillary
      lymph node dissection. The investigators also want to look for reasons why some women get
      lymphedema and others don't. Specifically, the investigators want to do tests on the breast
      tissue that is removed at the time of surgery to see if they can identify inflammation in the
      breast tissue, which may increase a woman's risk for lymphedema. The investigators will also
      ask the patient to answer questions to see how much their quality of life is affected by
      lymphedema, and whether this study can help women by detecting lymphedema earlier.

    <description>Bilateral arm measurements will be obtained using the Perometer (Model 350 NT Perometer, Per-System) circumferential arm measurements with elastic tape taken at 4-cm intervals from the wrist to the shoulder and the L-Dex U400 (Impedimed, Brisbane, Australia) for bioimpedance measurements. Measurements will be performed at baseline (prior to surgery), post-operatively (after surgery) and at scheduled timepoints of 6 months, 12 months, 18 months, and 24 months after surgery for a total of 2 years. For a patient who is diagnosed with lymphedema at â‰¥ 13 months after surgery, surveillance will continue for an additional 12 months after [lymphedema] diagnosis, and total surveillance time may exceed 2 years. Height and weight will be obtained for each patient at baseline and at each scheduled visit for the purpose of calculating BMI. All patients will complete the ULL-27 (upper limb lymphedema) quality-of-life questionnaire at baseline and at each scheduled visit.</description>
