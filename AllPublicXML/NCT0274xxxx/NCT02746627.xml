    <textblock>
      Problems with diabetes management in adolescents with type 1 diabetes are common - occurring
      at rates as high as 93% - and have serious health consequences, including poor blood sugar
      control and risk for later complications. Therefore, the investigators proposed to test a
      positive psychology intervention for adolescents with type 1 diabetes aimed at increasing
      motivation for diabetes management; specifically, to increase the frequency of blood glucose
      monitoring. This intervention will boost positive mood in adolescents (age 13-17) through
      tailored exercises in gratitude, self-affirmation, small gifts, and parent affirmation as a
      way to improve motivation for diabetes management. In addition, this study will explore the
      use of technology, by comparing telephone-administered vs. automated text-messaging versions
      of the intervention, to determine which mode of delivery is more appealing, convenient, and
      beneficial for adolescents in managing their diabetes.

      Participants and parents will complete questionnaires on mood and diabetes management during
      a routine clinic visits at baseline, 3 months, and 6 months. Clinical measures of diabetes
      management will be collected from participants' electronic medical records.
