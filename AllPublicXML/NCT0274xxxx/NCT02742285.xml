    <textblock>
      Measurement of the concentration of antimalarials in the blood of the general population
      helps estimating the overall drug pressure and is used in efficacy studies. The current
      sampling standard for drug measurement is plasma obtained by venous puncture. The use of a
      Dried Blood Spots (DBS) sampling strategy can make some aspects of field trials conditions
      easier, but concordance with usual venous sampling is not yet established.

      The current work will allow validating the concentrations of lumefantrine measured in the DBS
      samples collected during the field trials and validate the use of DBS for future studies. In
      addition, bearing in mind the substantial deployment of artemether-lumefantrine combinations
      supplies throughout most malaria endemic countries, this study may improve our understanding
      of lumefantrine and artemether distribution in the blood compartments and generate knowledge
      for further developing analytical methods for drug measurement.

      The overall purpose of this study is to validate the dried blood spots as a sampling method
      for the analysis of lumefantrine.

      The primary objective is to assess the concordance between lumefantrine plasma and dried
      blood spots (DBS) concentrations.

      The investigators also aim at describing lumefantrine's distribution in the different blood
      compartments: binding to plasma proteins, total in plasma, inside the red blood cells, total
      in whole blood.
