  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Herbal teas with galactogoge effects have been used extensively in recent years in order to
      increase the amount of breast milk in lactating mothers. We also investigated whether a
      sleep-induced herbal tea (Still-Tee; Mamsel®) was effective in regulating the sleep of these
      mothers. Plain water was used as placebo.

      Herbal teas with galactogoge effects have been used extensively in recent years in order to
      increase the amount of breast milk in lactating mothers. Mothers of premature babies often
      have problems in breastfeeding and this study was designed to investigate if such herbal teas
      has any effect on the increasing of breast milk in mothers of premature babies. We also
      investigated whether a sleep-induced herbal tea (Still-Tee; Mamsel®) was effective in
      regulating the sleep of these mothers. Plain water was used as placebo.
