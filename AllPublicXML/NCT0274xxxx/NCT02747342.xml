  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, dose-escalation phase 1 trial to evaluate the safety and tolerability
      of SHR3680 given orally to subjects with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer
      (mCRPC) as monotherapy.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study consists of 2 phases. In the dose escalation phase, up to 6 dose levels of SHR3680
      (40 mg/day, 80 mg/day, 160 mg/day, 240 mg/day, 360 mg/day, 480 mg/day) will be investigated
      with a sequential &quot;3+3&quot; design (3 or 6 participants in each dose level). There will be a
      single-dose pharmacokinetic (PK) run-in period (7 days). Following the first dose,
      participants will enter a 1 week treatment-free period to evaluate safety and single-dose PK.
      If not dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) are observed during the 1-week period, SHR3680
      administration will resume at the same dose level.

      In the expansion phase, up to 12 additional participants will be enrolled at the MTD or
      recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D). The purpose of the expansion part of the study is to explore
      the clinical benefits of SHR3680 and to further identify its PK features.

             site and obtained before entering the trial

          3. Histologically or cytologically confirmed adenocarcinoma of the prostate without
             neuroendocrine differentiation or small cell features.

          4. For patients who have not had an orchiectomy, there must be a plan to maintain
             effective GnRH-analogue therapy for the duration of the trial.

          5. Serum testosterone level &lt;1.7 nmol/L (50 ng/dL) at the screening visit.
