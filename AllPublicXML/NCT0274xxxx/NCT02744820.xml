    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics (PK) of
      multiple oral doses of GMC-252-L-Lysine salt (GMC-252) in healthy subjects and type 2
      diabetics.

      The secondary objective is to explore the effect of multiple oral doses of GMC-252 on
      pharmacodynamic(PD) parameters in type 2 diabetics.

         11. A negative urinary drugs of abuse screen, determined within 28 days before the first

             Investigator).

         12. Negative human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and hepatitis B surface antigen (Hep B)
             and hepatitis C virus antibody (Hep C) results.

         14. No history of clinically significant renal disease or any food intolerance.

         15. Willing to use 2 effective methods of contraception i.e. established method of

             subject) from Day 1 until 3 months afterwards.

        Additional Criteria for Part 1 (Healthy Subjects):

          1. Healthy males aged 18 to 55 inclusive.

          2. Body mass index (BMI) within the range of 18-30 kg/m2 inclusive.

          3. Non-Smokers (including e-cigarettes) who have abstained from smoking for at least 6
             months.

        Additional Criteria for Part 2 (Type 2 Diabetic Patients):

          4. Currently treated with metformin with a stable treatment regimen for 3 months or more
             prior to the Screening Visit, and not receiving other anti-diabetic medications.
             Allowed medication during the study include metformin, statin
             (3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG CoA) reductase inhibitors), paracetamol up
             to 3 g/day, low doses of aspirin and antihypertensive drugs if the doses are not
             changed in the 3 months before the start of screening. Other allowed medications will
             be approved by PI and Sponsor before a patient can be enrolled. Diflunisal (a test
             drug component) may decrease the antihypertensive activityof many of the currently
             used antihypertensive medications, such as β-blockers, alpha (α)-blockers, loop
             diuretics, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE inhibitors), angiotensin 2 receptor
             blockers, calcium channel blockers. Therefore, patients who are on current stable
             antihypertensive medications will be subjected to close monitoring of their blood
             pressure throughout the study.

          5. Stable dietary habits and regimen of treatment for concomitant diseases for 1 month or
             more prior to the Screening Visit.
