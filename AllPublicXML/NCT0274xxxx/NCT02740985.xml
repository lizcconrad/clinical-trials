  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase I, open-label, multicenter study of continuous oral dosing of AZD4635
      administered as a single agent and then in combination with a PD-L1 antibody, durvalumab. The
      study design allows an escalation of dose with intensive safety monitoring to ensure the
      safety of the patients. The primary objective of the study is to determine the maximum
      tolerated dose of AZD4635 in combination with durvalumab.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will be conducted in two segments. The first segment of the study (Phase 1a) will
      be a dose escalation design in order to determine the Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) of AZD4635
      given as monotherapy and in combination with durvalumab. The MTD will be determined by
      assessing adverse events and the incidence of abnormal laboratory measures. Once the maximum
      tolerated monotherapy dose of AZD4635 has been determined, combination dosing with durvalumab
      will start in a new cohort of patients at one dose level lower than the highest tolerated
      dose of AZD4635 monotherapy. The combination therapy cohorts in Phase 1a will also have a
      2-week monotherapy lead-in after which patients who tolerate monotherapy AZD4635 will then
      continue twice daily dosing of AZD4635 in combination with durvalumab (anti programmed-death
      ligand 1 [PD-L1]) at the fixed dose of 1.5 grams IV every 4 weeks.

      When the maximum-tolerated dose in the combination setting is determined, additional patients
      with advanced solid malignancies will be enrolled to a dose expansion portion to explore
      further the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK), and biological activity at the
      selected doses. Approximately 24 to 42 patients with advanced solid malignancies will be
      treated in Phase 1a. When the maximum-tolerated dose in the combination setting is
      determined, additional patients with advanced solid malignancies will be enrolled to a dose
      expansion portion to explore further the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK), and
      biological activity at the selected doses. Approximately 24 to 42 patients with advanced
      solid malignancies will be treated in Phase 1a. If the MTD for either AZD4635 monotherapy or
      the AZD4635/durvalumab combination is not reached dose expansion may take place at dose
      levels of AZD4635 and durvalumab other than MTD.

      The second segment of the study (Phase 1b) will consist of an additional expansion cohorts in
      tumour types where there is a rationale for potential efficacy of the study treatment. The
      additional dose expansion cohorts will use doses that do not exceed the highest tolerated
      dose determined during the dose escalation segment of the study in patients with:

        -  Post-immunotherapy non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) (AZD4635 monotherapy or AZD4635 in
           combination with durvalumab).

        -  Other post-immunotherapy solid tumours (AZD 4635 monotherapy).

        -  Immune checkpoint-naïve metastatic castrate-resistant prostate carcinoma (mCRPC)
           (AZD4635 monotherapy or AZD4635 in combination with durvalumab).

        -  Immune checkpoint-naïve colorectal carcinoma (CRC) (AZD4635 monotherapy).

        -  Other immune checkpoint-naïve solid tumours (AZD4635 monotherapy).

    <description>A Bayesian Logistic Regression Model (BLRM) based approach will be used to identify the set of AZD4635 doses where the incidence of DLTs is no larger than 33%. It is planned that 24 to 36 patients in total will be included in the dose-escalation part of Phase Ia. In each cohort, up to 3 patients will be initially assessed. Dose escalation to the next higher dose level for the next cohort group of 3 patients will occur if all 3 patients in the initial cohort complete the first 3 weeks of dosing without a DLT. Following the first DLT, the BLRM model will be run and the output made available to the safety review committee (SRC) to guide further dosing decisions. Each dose cohort will include a maximum of 6 patients.</description>

    <description>AZD4635 monotherapy will be given twice daily in a dose escalation scheme in Part 1a. Patients will receive a single dose of AZD4635 on Day 1 and will have blood samples collected to assess pharmacokinetics over 24 hours. On Day 2, twice daily dosing will commence and continue daily. Other dosing schedules (e.g., once daily, three times daily) may be investigated during the study on the basis of emerging safety, PK, and exploratory mechanism of action (MOA) data. During monotherapy dosing, a cycle will be 3 weeks. The Safety Review Committee (SRC) will determine whether dose escalation should occur based on safety assessments in the first cycle supported by a Bayesian Logistic Regression Model (BLRM) approach.
In Phase 1b additional expansion cohorts will be investigated based on the activity observed in the Phase 1a monotherapy dose escalation cohorts as well as monotherapy responses seen in other A2aR inhibitor studies.</description>
