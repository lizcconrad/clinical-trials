      Case-control study to evaluate gait parameters during different conditions between patients
      who suffer from chronic ankle instability and healthy individuals.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This case-control study will compare the different gait parameters such as stride time and
      stride length variability in different gait conditions (e.g., normal speed, normal speed with
      dual task, fast speed and fast speed with dual task) between healthy individuals and patients
      who suffer from chronic ankle instability.

      the measurements will be collected using the OPTOGait system installed on a treadmill.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  history of at least one significant ankle sprain which occurred at least 12 months
             prior to enrolment in the study and was diagnosed by a physician or a physical
             therapist using clinical examination classifications described by Malliaropoulos et al

          -  history of at least two episodes of 'giving way', and feelings of ankle joint
             instability in the previously injured ankle joint of 1 year post-initial sprain

          -  the most recent injury occurred more than 6 weeks prior to the study enrolment

          -  the ability to apply full weight bearing on the injured lower extremity with no more
             than mild discomfort

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  evidence of a concomitant injury (such as a bony injury or significant muscular/tendon
             injury)

          -  previous ankle surgery

          -  other pathological conditions or surgical procedures in lower extremity

          -  neurological/vestibular or any other balance disorder.

        The control group included healthy participants with no current or previous conditions that
        could affect proprioception.
