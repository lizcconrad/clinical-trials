  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cognitive behavioural analysis system of psychotherapy (CBASP) is one of the only
      psychological models and treatments that has been designed specifically for patients
      diagnosed with chronic depression. CBASP in combination with antidepressants has been found
      to be the most effective treatment for chronic depression. Despite an increasing amount of
      research into this intervention, researchers are less aware of the role that specific and
      common ingredients are accounted for in outcomes. Given that CBASP is a treatment model
      endorsed by the National Health Service Scotland (NHS Scotland), gaining a deeper knowledge
      and understanding about the active ingredients involved in their success ensures current
      practice is embedded in an evidence base. Conducting this research adds to the gap in the
      literature and identifies areas in which further exploration is warranted. Given the emphasis
      on therapist variables in relation to treatment outcomes, the results of this research will
      have wider implications from a service resource perspective. Training may be altered or needs
      emphasised in line with the results of the study to ensure most efficacious outcomes.

      Limited research has looked at therapist and client variables that may contribute to
      therapeutic alliance/engagement, and clinical outcomes. The current study proposes to explore
      two variables that are hypothesized to contribute to outcomes based on the theoretical
      framework CBASP is grounded on, namely therapist and client attachment style and reflective
      functioning. This will be done by providing CBASP to a small number of participants and
      gathering outcome data from therapists and clients at each therapy appointment. Participants
      will also complete the Adult Attachment Interview (AAI), a semi structured interview which
      can also be coded for reflective functioning. This is a proof of concept case series design
      that aims to provide an analysis of individual psychological change in relation to the above
      variables of interest.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      CBASP will consist of treatment of usual (i.e. one one-hour individual sessions on a weekly
      basis for up to 20 weeks) with additional outcome measures to be completed at each session.
      Therapists will receive a research pack which will outline when, and what, measures to
      administer and complete. To ensure anonymity and confidentiality of data collected,
      participants will be given identification numbers before data is submitted to a spread sheet
      for analysis.

      9 CBASP therapists have been identified as suitable for participation in this study.
      Therapists will have the option to choose whether to take part in the research. Similarly,
      clients will be given the choice to take part in the research. To ensure at least one set of
      outcomes are achieved it is an aim of the study to provide the therapist with a minimum
      caseload of 2.
