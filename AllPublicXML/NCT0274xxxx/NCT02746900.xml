  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Spontaneous preterm birth (SPTB) remains the number one cause of perinatal mortality in many
      countries, including the United States. In singleton gestations a short cervical length (CL)
      on transvaginal ultrasound (TVU) has been shown to be a good predictor of SPTB.

      Different strategies have been adopted for prevention of SPTB. Growing interest has focused
      on pessary for prevention of SPTB. Cervical pessary is relatively non-invasive, easy to use,
      does not require anesthesia, can be used in an outpatient clinic setting, and it is easily
      removed when necessary. However, a recent systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized
      clinical trials showed that in singleton pregnancies with short cervix, prophylactic use of
      the pessary did not reduce the rate of spontaneous preterm delivery or improve perinatal
      outcome. The evidence supports the use of vaginal progesterone in singleton pregnancies with
      short cervix, while cervical cerclage seems to be beneficial only in the subgroup of women
      with both prior SPTB and TVU CL ≤25mm. Interestingly, only 235 singletons without prior
      SPTB,7 and 504 singletons gestations with prior SPTB,6 have been included in randomized
      studies on cerclage for TVU CL ≤25mm. A meta-analysis of four trials showed that cervical
      cerclage did not prevent SPTB in women with short TVU CL and without prior preterm birth.7
      However, even if the statistical significance were not reached, they found a reduction in
      SPTB &lt;35 weeks by 16% in singletons with short TVU CL and without prior SPTB (20.6% vs 31.2%;
      relative risk (RR) 0.84, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.60 to 1.17) and by 24% in singletons
      without risk factors for SPTB (25.6% vs 33.3%; RR 0.76, 95% CI 0.52 to 1.15).

      Therefore, the aim of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of cervical cerclage in
      prevention of SPTB in singleton pregnancies with short TVU CL in second trimester, without
      prior SPTB.

      Investigators aim to conduct a prospective, multicenter, randomized, open-label, clinical
      trial at Department of Reproductive Science, University of Naples Federico II. All women
      included in the study will provide a written informed consent to participate in the study
      before the randomization.

      Women with TVU CL ≤25mm who will meet the inclusion criteria will be counselled by an
      obstetrician regarding the risk of SPTB as per standard of care. The patient will be given
      ample time to have all questions addressed and consider participation. If the patient agrees
      to participate in the study, the informed consent form will be signed and a copy will be
      given to the patient. Women who are eligible and consent to participate in the study will be
      randomly assigned to one of two groups: cervical cerclage (i.e. intervention group) or
      standard obstetric management (i.e. control group).

      Investigators planned subgroup analyses according to different CL cutoffs (i.e. &lt;=15 and &lt;=10
      mm); type of suture; and according to prior history of cervical surgery (i.e. LEEP or cone
      biopsy).

    <description>After the woman is placed in the dorsal lithotomy position and the bladder is emptied with a urinary catheter to reduce the chance of bladder injury, surgical preparation with Betadine will be performed. Breisky retractors and Sims retractors will be used to exposure the entire cervix. Sponge ring forceps will be used to optimized visualization of the cervix and provide the necessary countertraction at the suture entry and exit sites. McDonald technique will be performed placing 4-6 bites circumferentially around the cervix. Only one stitch will be used. The suture will be places as high as feasible</description>
