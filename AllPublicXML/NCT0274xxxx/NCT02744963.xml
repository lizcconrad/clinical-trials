  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This trial evaluates the effect of providing primary care patients with free and convenient
      access to a set of essential medicines. Half of the participants will receive free and
      convenient access to these essential medicines, while the other half will have usual access
      to medicines.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Medication adherence is one important determinant of health outcomes. Approximately one half
      of treatments for chronic disease are not taken as directed. Cost is one of several important
      causes of poor adherence and it is particularly important for vulnerable people. At least 2.4
      million adult Canadians report cost related nonadherence to medications. 31 % of
      prescriptions in Quebec are not filled and those of highest cost are least likely to be
      filled. Providing full drug coverage may improve medication adherence and clinical outcomes,
      particularly for vulnerable individuals and those with chronic diseases.

      The size of many formularies makes it difficult for clinicians to know the safest and most
      effective medications to prescribe. This may partially explain poor medication selection.
      Short lists of essential medications have improved the the quality of prescribing.
