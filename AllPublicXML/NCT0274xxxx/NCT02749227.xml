  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase II, open-label, 12-month pilot study in 10 patients with silent corticotroph
      pituitary tumors testing the hypotheses that Pasireotide LAR (long-acting release) treatment
      of patients with silent corticotroph pituitary tumors and elevated plasma Proopiomelanocortin
      (POMC) levels will reduce plasma POMC levels and this will be associated with a reduction in
      pituitary tumor size. Pasireotide LAR 40 mg will be administered monthly. Baseline and
      monthly visits on therapy will monitor plasma levels of POMC, other pituitary function,
      safety labs, glucose tolerance, physical examination, and visual fields. Pituitary magnetic
      resonance imaging (MRI) will be done at baseline, 6 months and 12 months of therapy. The
      eligible patient population will consist of adult patients with known silent corticotroph
      pituitary tumors and elevated plasma levels of POMC.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Clinically non-functioning pituitary adenomas (CNFAs), the subtype of pituitary adenomas that
      does not appear to secrete biologically active hormone nor to have a characteristic clinical
      phenotype, are the most common type of pituitary macroadenoma at diagnosis. There is
      currently no option for medical therapy of CNFA, in general, or specifically of silent
      corticotroph tumors. Silent corticotroph tumors can range from being completely asymptomatic
      to becoming large and causing significant hypothalamic/pituitary dysfunction and visual
      symptoms, and most data support that this type of tumor has a more aggressive phenotype.
      Current therapy consists primarily of surgical removal of the tumor and for recurrent or
      residual tumors, repeated surgery and/or radiotherapy. In very aggressive tumors,
      chemotherapy has been tried with some success. Therefore, a need exists for a medical
      therapeutic option for the treatment of this tumor type. This project assesses this clinical
      need.

    <description>Pasireotide LAR (SIGNIFOR® LAR) is a somatostatin analog indicated for the treatment of patients with acromegaly who have had an inadequate response to surgery and/or for whom surgery is not an option. It is a long acting release injectable suspension for intramuscular use.
The starting dose is Pasireotide LAR 40 mg/month IM, this will be increased to 60 mg/month at 6 months if a fall in POMC levels and/or tumor shrinkage are not attained.</description>

         21. Women of child-bearing potential, defined as all women physiologically capable of
             becoming pregnant, unless they are using highly effective methods of contraception
             during dosing and 3 months following last dose of pasireotide. Highly effective
             contraception methods include:

               -  Total abstinence when this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of
                  the subject. Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal,
                  post-ovulation methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of
                  contraception

               -  Female sterilization (have had surgical bilateral oophorectomy with or without
                  hysterectomy) or tubal ligation at least six weeks before taking study treatment.
                  In case of oophorectomy alone, only when the reproductive status of the woman has
                  been confirmed by follow up hormone level assessment

               -  Male sterilization (at least 6 months prior to screening). For female subjects on
                  the study the vasectomized male partner should be the sole partner for that
                  subject

               -  Combination of any two of the following (a+b or a+c, or b+c):

                    1. Use of oral, injected or implanted hormonal methods of contraception or
                       other forms of hormonal contraception that have comparable efficacy (failure
                       rate &lt;1%), for example hormone vaginal ring or transdermal hormone
                       contraception.

                    2. Placement of an intrauterine device (IUD) or intrauterine system (IUS)

                    3. Barrier methods of contraception: Condom or Occlusive cap (diaphragm or
                       cervical/vault caps) with spermicidal foam/gel/film/cream/vaginal
                       suppository

                         -  In case of use of oral contraception women should have been stable on
                            the same pill for a minimum of 3 months before taking study treatment.

                         -  Women are considered post-menopausal and not of child bearing potential
                            if they have had 12 months of natural (spontaneous) amenorrhea with an
                            appropriate clinical profile (e.g. age appropriate, history of
                            vasomotor symptoms) or have had surgical bilateral oophorectomy (with
                            or without hysterectomy) or tubal ligation at least six weeks ago. In
                            the case of oophorectomy alone, only when the reproductive status of
                            the woman has been confirmed by follow up hormone level assessment is
                            she considered not of child bearing potential.
