  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The sensitivity and specificity of the Hum Test is being investigated in it's ability to
      detect conductive hearing loss. The hum test is simply elicited by asking the subject to hum
      to him or herself for a few seconds at both a high and low pitch that is comfortable for the
      subject. The subject is then asked if the hum was heard on one side more than the other (left
      or right), or if the sound was equal on both sides. To simulate conductive hearing loss, ear
      plugs will be placed in one of the subject's ears. We will elicit the hum test as well as the
      standard Weber test and audiogram across two conditions, with an ear plug and without an ear
      plug. From this, it is hoped to assess how the Hum Test compares to the audiogram (gold
      standard) in detecting conductive hearing loss as well as how it compares to the standard
      Weber test. If the Hum Test demonstrates strong sensitivity and specificity in detecting
      conductive hearing loss, it could have application as being utilized as an alternative to the
      standard Weber test, or in a setting where a formal physical examination may not yet be
      possible but where the etiology of a patient's hearing change could be quickly assessed
      remotely and thus the urgency of intervention/ consultation could then be determined.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      It is presumed that the Hum Test works similarly to the Weber Test, where bone conduction of
      the skull is elicited to determine if a change in hearing is conductive or sensorineural in
      nature. Because the hum test is frequently employed in clinical practice yet its validation
      has yet to be demonstrated, investigation is warranted.

      To examine and compare the Hum Test, Weber Test, and audiogram in their ability to detect and
      identify hearing loss, hearing loss will be simulated with the use of ear plugs (mimicking
      conductive hearing loss). Subjects will serve as their own control as these tests will be
      conducted with and without ear plugs.

      Study data will be maintained using an online, password protected storage system. No
      identifiable information will be collected or stored (i.e. name, DOB, etc.). Limited
      demographic information will be collected for analysis purposes such as age and gender.

    <description>The subject will be brought into an exam room. The subject will then be asked to hum for a few seconds in a low pitch. They will then be asked if the nose was heard more so in one ear compared to the other. The subject will then be asked to hum for a few seconds in a high pitch. They will then be asked again if the noise was heard more so in one ear compared to the other.</description>
