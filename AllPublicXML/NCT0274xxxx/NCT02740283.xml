      The main purpose of the study is to evaluate an OGTT at 18 to 20 gestational weeks as an
      early diagnosis method of GDM in low risk pregnant women. By investigating maternal and
      neonatal outcomes that are associated with the early OGTT and regular OGTT results, the study
      will provide a evidence for the most appropriate time to perform an OGTT in pregnant women.

    <description>As a diagnostic study, the cohort will recruit 300 pregnant women who meet inclusion and exclusion criteria outlined below. OGTTs will be performed between 18 and 20 gestational weeks (early-OGTT) and 24 to 28 gestational weeks (regular-OGTT). Clinical and laboratory information of the mother and their offspring will be collected for analysis.</description>
