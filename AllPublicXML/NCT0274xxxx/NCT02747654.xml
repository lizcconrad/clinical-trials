      Isoniazid (INH) is an essential component of first-line anti-tuberculosis (TB) treatment.
      However, treatment with INH is complicated by polymorphisms in the expression of the enzyme
      system primarily responsible for its elimination, N-acetyltransferase 2 (NAT2), and its
      associated hepatotoxicity. The objective of this study was to develop an individualized INH
      dosing regimen using a pharmacogenetic-driven model and to apply this regimen in a pilot
      study.

        -  Eligible participants were patients newly diagnosed with active TB

          -  Who underwent standard four drug treatment for 6months: isoniazid (5 mg/kg, usually
             300 mg), rifampin (450 mg for &lt;50 kg or 600 mg for 50 kg body weight),
             ethambutol(15mg/kg), and pyrazinamide (20 - 30 mg/kg)

          -  Given daily for two months and followed by isoniazid and rifampin with or without
             ethambutol for four months.

          -  Those patients with abnormal hepatic function on laboratory testing (increased serum
             aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, or total bilirubin) before
             anti-TB treatment, underlying liver disease or systemic illness such as congestive
             heart failure, acute life-threatening disease, or alcoholism, or disease that was
             resistant to INH at the start of treatment were excluded.
