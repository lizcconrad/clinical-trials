  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the efficacy of MayoExpertAdvisor (MEA), a knowledge delivery tool, to
      improve adherence to best practices for patients with hyperlipidemia, atrial fibrillation and
      heart failure. Half of the clinicians will receive MEA, while the other half will not receive
      MEA.

      The investigators hypothesize care teams with access to MEA will act upon recommendations at
      a higher rate than those care teams in the standard of care arm without access to MEA.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      MEA is designed to increase adherence to consensus national guidelines and quality measures
      which are the standard of care for hyperlipidemia, atrial fibrillation, and heart failure.
      These diseases were selected based on national data which suggest there is less than optimal
      adherence to standard of care therapy and this non-adherence is associated with adverse
      cardiovascular outcomes.

      There are 29 care teams in the Employee and Community Health (ECH) practice. Care teams are
      comprised of 4-8 clinicians who provide primary care to between 3,000 and 8000 patients. 8
      care teams are resident/fellow led and will be excluded from the study. The remaining 21 care
      teams in the ECH practice will be stratified by clinic location and provider specialty
      (Internal Medicine, Family Medicine). 20 care teams will then be cluster-randomized to either
      the intervention arm or standard of care arm.

      Prior to randomization, clinicians in both arms will receive the same educational module to
      the current guidelines for management of the atrial fibrillation, heart failure and
      hyperlipidemia. Clinicians in the intervention arm will receive training by the research team
      on the use of MEA. This training will clearly inform clinicians that they are always to use
      their best clinical judgment.
