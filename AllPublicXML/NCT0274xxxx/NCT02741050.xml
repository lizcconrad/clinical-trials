  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this proposal is to test the efficacy of a primary care-delivered, print-based
      physical activity intervention for Latinas with type II diabetes. The investigators will test
      the efficacy of this intervention by randomizing 80 Latinas with type II diabetes recruited
      through UCSD Health System primary care to either the adapted web-based physical activity
      intervention or standard of care, and assessing physical activity gains at six and 12 months.
      The ultimate goal is to develop a print-based physical activity intervention for diabetic
      Latinas that could be widely disseminated through primary care.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Studies show that adoption of regular physical activity (PA) can greatly enhance diabetes
      management and prevention. Individuals who adopt a PA routine show significant improvements
      in clinical markers of diabetes, including HbA1c, glucose tolerance, insulin sensitivity,
      weight and waist circumference, and significant reductions in medication use, and also show
      reductions in cardiovascular risk factors and other related co-morbidities. Incorporation of
      cost-effective PA interventions into primary care for diabetes treatment could therefore
      enhance overall health and quality of life and significantly reduce healthcare costs. The
      primary aim of this study is to conduct a small randomized trial (N=80) to test the efficacy
      of an individually tailored culturally adapted print-based physical activity intervention
      integrated into primary care to increase weekly moderate-to-vigorous physical activity in
      Latinas with type II diabetes, compared to those receiving standard of care.

    <description>The 7-Day Physical Activity Recall (PAR) will also assess self-reported changes in physical activity from baseline to 6 months. The 7-Day PAR is an interviewer administered instrument that uses multiple strategies for increasing accuracy of participant recall regarding many types of activities such as time spent sleeping and moderate, hard, and very hard intensity activities. The 7-Day PAR is used across many studies assessing physical activity and has consistently demonstrated acceptable reliability, internal consistency, and congruent validity with other objective measures of activity levels.</description>

    <description>The Tailored Internet intervention is based on constructs of the Transtheoretical Model (TTM) and Social Cognitive Theory (SCT). During the 6-month intervention period, participants will receive monthly mailed questionnaires that assess current motivational readiness for physical activity and other TTM and SCT constructs (e.g., process of change, self-efficacy) and monthly logs to record their current activity.</description>

    <description>Those assigned to the control group will continue to receive standard of care through the Family Medicine clinic. This currently entails commonly accepted medication treatment strategies, educational materials and counseling for self-management and medication adherence, screening for depression or other conditions that would impair self-management, and national and state quality of care guidelines for lab testing and control targets (HbA1c, lipids, blood pressure). Participants in the control group will also receive monthly questionnaires on topics other than physical activity (e.g. diet) to fill out and return in order to have the same opportunities for compensation as those in the intervention condition.</description>
