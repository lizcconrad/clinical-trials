      Introduction: Finding and successfully treating all tuberculosis (TB) patients is the
      cornerstone of the Global Strategy to Stop TB. However, many patients in resource-limited
      countries remain undiagnosed. Prisons are a well-known source of undetected TB. Thus, there
      is a need to find feasible interventions to find and treat TB patients in these settings.

      Objective: The objective of this study is to evaluate whether empowering and involving inmate
      peer educators in TB control has an impact on increasing TB case detection rate and improving
      treatment success in resource-limited prison settings.

      Methodology: This is a matched cluster randomized control trial where randomization to the
      intervention and treatment groups will be carried out within pairs. Eight matched prison
      pairs will be randomly selected for this study in which eight prisons from each pair will be
      randomly assigned to the intervention and the remaining to the control group. Trained prison
      peer educators at the intervention sites will organize and provide education about TB every
      two weeks on a regular basis for one year. Peer educators will also perform routine TB
      screening, using a screening protocol to identify presumptive TB cases for a referral.
      Identified presumptive TB cases will then be linked to the prison health personnel for a
      referral to nearby hospitals. The TB diagnosis will be carried out at the referral sites
      using the routine direct smear microscopy and/or chest X-ray (Radiography). Tuberculosis case
      finding in the control sites will follow the existing referral system (self-referral to
      nearby hospitals) and the diagnosis will be undertaken using direct sputum microscopy and/or
      chest X-ray as in the intervention sites. The data will be entered using Epi Data entry
      version 3.1 software and analyzed using SPSS version 20.0. Considering prisons as a unit of
      analysis, the mean Case Detection Rate (CDR), Treatment Success Rate (TSR) and the percentage
      of patients symptomatic for &gt; =3 months will be compared within pairs using the paired t-test
      or sign test as appropriate.

      1. Background and justification

           Although the global incidence of tuberculosis (TB) has fallen by an average rate of 1.5%
           per year between the years 2000 and 2013, TB remains a major global health problem and
           is the second leading cause of death from infectious diseases [1,2]. An estimated 9
           million people had developed TB in the year 2013 of which one-quarter was from Africa,
           the continent that also has the highest rates of cases and deaths relative to its
           population [1,3]. In the same year, only 5.7 million cases were both detected and
           notified to the National TB programs (NTPs), meaning that about 3 million people were
           &quot;missed&quot; by TB control programs [1]. The TB case detection rate (calculated as
           notifications of new and relapse cases divided by the estimated incidence per year) was
           only 64% at the global level and is below the World Health Organization (WHO) target
           (70%) [1].

           Tuberculosis disproportionately affects vulnerable populations such as prisoners.
           According to a review of studies from both high and low-income countries, the prevalence
           of TB in prisons was 3 to 200-fold higher than in the general population [4,5]. A number
           of factors such as overcrowding, inadequate ventilation, delayed case detection and the
           movement of prisoners from site to the site make prisons a high-risk environment for TB
           transmission [6]. The emergence of drug-resistant TB has also made TB control efforts
           very complicated in prisons. [7]. If untreated, prisoners with drug-resistant TB will be
           an additional health hazard for fellow prisoners and staff [8]. Furthermore, TB and
           resistant forms of TB can spill out into the community and create a public health hazard
           [9]. In sub-Saharan African prisons, the high burden of human immunodeficiency virus
           (HIV) infection and poverty make the problem much worse [10]. Health care services are
           also very limited and due to the lack of diagnostic facilities many TB patients remain
           undetected [11]. In a recent study from a South African prison, for example, the
           prevalence of undiagnosed TB was reported to be high at 3.5% [12].

           Ethiopia, which ranks 8th of the 22 countries with a high burden of TB [13], has
           implemented the directly observed treatment short-course (DOTS) program since 1992 [14].
           Currently, the country has achieved the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) of halving
           TB incidence, prevalence, and mortality by 2015 [1]. However, the case detection rate
           (CDR) remains low as in many other developing countries.

           The case detection rate of all forms of TB was reported to be 62% which is still below
           the WHO target [1]. Ethiopia is listed among the top ten countries that accounted for
           74% (2.4% million) of missed TB cases [1]. Shortage of health workers, low service
           coverage, low health seeking behavior and lack of efficient TB diagnostics are some of
           the factors for the low case detection rate in the country [15].

           Tuberculosis detection is a huge challenge for Ethiopian prisons [7,16]. Because of lack
           of skilled health professionals and laboratory facilities, TB diagnosis relies on a
           referral of prisoners to health facilities outside prisons. As prisoners often do not
           recognize the symptoms of TB or use non-TB medicines to relieve symptoms, TB diagnosis
           is often severely late [17,18]. As a consequence, many prisoners with TB in the
           Ethiopian prisons remain undiagnosed [19]. Recently, we reported that at least half of
           symptomatic pulmonary TB cases were left undiagnosed and hence untreated in Northern
           Ethiopian prisons [20]. Some of these patients remained undiagnosed for more than two
           years [20]. This creates an opportunity for the transmission and dissemination of TB not
           only among prisoners but also to the general community. In addition, although accurate
           data is not available on TB treatment adherence, the conditions in Ethiopian prisons
           make the TB treatment supervision difficult and hence adherence to the full course of
           anti-TB drugs remains a challenge to TB patients [20]. This will lead to the emergence
           of drug-resistant strains, an important challenge for TB control. Thus, efforts are
           needed to improve TB case detection and treatment adherence in Ethiopian prisons.
           Epidemiological models show that employing active case finding through entry and exit
           screening, and frequent mass screening, using a combination of diagnostic tools (usually
           sputum smear microscopy and chest-X-ray), improves TB case detection in prisons [21].
           However, resource constraints and lack of skilled health professionals limit its
           applicability in prisons of poor countries. Increasing the health service coverage and
           training health workers to fill the gap in short period seems a remote possibility.
           Therefore, there is a need to find alternative ways that could increase access to
           diagnostic and treatment services, ultimately increasing TB case detection and treatment
           success rate. In the current study, the investigators plan to undertake a cluster
           randomized controlled trial to assess whether empowering and involving inmate peer
           educators in the TB control improves TB case detection, treatment success rate, and
           pre-treatment symptom duration in a resource-limited prison setting.

        2. Hypotheses

           Hypothesis 1: Case detection rate: Compared to the control sites, the TB case detection
           rate in the intervention sites will be increased by 50%.

           Hypothesis 2: Treatment success rate: Compared to the control sites, treatment success
           rate in the intervention sites will be increased by 10%.

           Hypothesis 3: Pre-treatment symptom duration: Compared to the control sites, the
           proportion of patients with pre-treatment symptom duration of &gt;=3 months will be reduced
           by 30% in the intervention sites.

        3. Methods 3.1. Study area and study population

           This study will be conducted in Northern Ethiopian prisons. Ethiopia had an officially
           registered prison population of 112,361 (136/100,000 persons) in 2010 [22], which is
           higher than the imprisonment rates observed in some sub-Saharan African countries such
           as in Kenya (121/100,000 persons), and Malawi (76/100,000 persons). The fact that
           prisons are overcrowded and inadequately ventilated means that Ethiopian prisons are
           ideal for the transmission of Mycobacterium tuberculosis [23] and urge appropriate
           interventions. This interventional study will be conducted in 16 main prisons (8 matched
           pairs) located in the Amhara and Tigray regions including Mekelle vs. Shire, Adawa vs.
           Tembien, Humera vs. Adigrat, Mychew vs. Alamata, Wukro vs Axum, Dessie vs. Woldya,
           Fenoteselam vs. Debremarkos, and Debretabor vs. Bahir Dar for a one year period from
           March 2016 to March 2017. This interventional study focuses only in prisons of the
           Northern Ethiopia considering feasibility. All the prisoners in the 16 selected prisons
           are study populations.

           3.2. Study design and inclusion criteria

           This is a matched cluster randomized controlled trial where randomization to the
           intervention and treatment groups will be carried out within pairs. Prisons will be
           matched into pairs on the basis of their location and/or the number of prisoners. Larger
           prison sites located in the main cities of Amhara and Tigray regions will be considered
           as eligible while small jails will be excluded. Accordingly, there are a total of 22
           main prisons (11 matched pairs) eligible for the study in which the five matched pairs
           are in Tigray and the remaining in the Amhara region. All the five matched prison pairs
           from Tigray will be included in the randomization considering their proximity and hence
           feasibility. However, the investigators will undertake a random selection and will
           include three matched pairs from the Amhara region considering the feasibility and
           financial constraints.

           3.3. Randomization

           Once the required number of matched prisons pairs was fixed, the randomization was done
           within pairs in which eight prisons from each pair were randomly assigned to the
           intervention and the remaining to the control group. One of the investigators from
           Maastricht University who didn't have information about the study prisons performed the
           randomization by consulting the online randomization website; random.org. The
           investigators will then undertake follow-up and monitoring for a year (from March 2016
           to April 2017) and outcomes will be measured 3.3.1. Procedure

           After the investigators have had discussions and agreements with the concerned bodies in
           the Amhara and Tigray regions, eligible prisons were selected according to our inclusion
           criteria. Then the investigators matched the selected prisons into pairs considering
           geographical location and/or the number of prisoners as described above. After the
           number of the required matched pairs was fixed, the randomization was done to the
           intervention and control group .

           3.4. Interventions

           3.4.1. Training inmate peer educators

           Before launching the intervention program, the investigators will discuss the objectives
           and procedures of the program with the prison administrators, the prison health
           personnel, and the prisoners. Inmate peer educators, about 3-6 from each prison, will be
           recruited in consultation with the prison health personnel. The investigators, in
           collaboration with the prison health personnel, will provide 3 days training for inmate
           peer educators using standard TB training materials. The training will focus on basic
           facts about TB: its cause, transmission, symptoms, diagnosis, prevention, treatment, and
           outcomes. Inmate peer educators will be trained on how to provide health education about
           TB, screen and identify presumptive TB cases, and support TB patients to adhere to the
           TB treatment. Moreover, inmate peer educators will be provided with leaflets and posters
           illustrating the cause, transmission, main symptoms of TB, and containing the
           information that TB is curable with proper treatment. Inmate peer educators will also be
           informed to teach and encourage their fellow inmates about the isolation of TB patients
           as much their setting allows.

           3.4.2. Educating prisoners and performing TB screening

           After the training, but before trained prison peer educators start their activities, the
           investigators will assess whether inmate peer educators are really capable of doing the
           expected activity. The investigators will make them teach a sample of trainees in front
           of trainers and will evaluate inmate peer educators using a checklist. Inmate peer
           educators will also be tested whether they are cable of identifying presumptive TB cases
           by providing them presumptive TB cases and non-presumptive TB cases and verifying their
           diagnosis by TB experts (trainers). Once they are tested for their capability, peer
           educators will organize inmates into groups and will provide education about TB, its
           prevention, and control every two weeks on a regular basis for one year. Peer educators
           will undertake routine TB screening using a standardized TB screening protocol to
           identify presumptive TB cases for a referral. Inmate peer educators will be provided
           with N95 masks to be used during the screening. Identified presumptive TB cases (those,
           at least, having had a cough for two weeks or more according to the recommendation of
           national TB guideline) will be referred by the prison health personnel to nearby
           hospitals.

           3.4.3. Tuberculosis treatment follow-up

           Trained inmate peer educators will follow and encourage their fellow patients to adhere
           to the prescribed TB treatment and to undertake follow-up sputum examination according
           to the national recommendation. Inmate peer educators will provide health education
           about the consequences of nonadherence to TB treatment using the prepared TB training
           module .

           3.5. Control Conditions

           At the control sites, there will not be involvement of inmate peer educators and no
           training will be provided. The TB screening and treatment activity will follow the
           existing referral system (self-referral to nearby hospitals). However, the prison
           personnel at these sites will be informed about the proposed intervention. The prison
           personnel will be informed that this is a trial and that the investigators don't know
           whether the intervention is effective or not. The investigators will also inform the
           prison personnel that other prison sites were selected by chance and the intervention
           will be implemented in the control prisons if the investigators found this trial
           effective and helpful. Moreover, the investigators will provide a standardized
           up-to-date referral protocol to the prison personnel at the control sites as in the
           intervention sites.

           3.6. Follow-up and monitoring

           Supervisors assigned to each intervention site (prison) will regularly follow the
           intervention progress, do a daily assessment of the activities and give a timely
           solution to the problems met. The principal investigator will also supervise all
           activities closely through a regular visit and phone call. Randomly selected prisoners
           from each intervention site will be asked short random questions to check whether they
           did get the intervention or not at random times during the intervention.

           An intervention check will also be done by collecting data on knowledge attitude and
           practices (KAP) of prisoners in the intervention sites using a standardized pre-tested
           KAP questionnaire through a face-to-face interview by trained prison nurses. Inmate peer
           educators will be involved in facilitating and interviewing of the baseline data, but
           the post-test will be performed by trained nurses only. Briefly, the KAP questionnaire
           will consist of questions on the etiology of TB, mode of transmission, prevention and on
           attitudes of prisoners such as whether they are afraid to get infected with TB bacilli
           or not. A sample of prisoners will be selected randomly with proportional allocation of
           the total number of prisoners in each intervention site and data on their KAP score will
           be assessed at baseline and the end of the intervention (after 12 months). Only
           prisoners that will be available in prisons during the intervention period will be
           eligible for the random selection. Finally, data will also be collected from the
           randomly selected prisoners from the control sites and the KAP scores of the two groups
           will be compared.

           Supervisors will also be assigned for each control site. They will neither encourage nor
           discourage the existing TB diagnosis and treatment program in these sites. But,
           supervisors will regularly follow the ongoing activities with equal frequency as in the
           intervention sites. The principal investigator will also supervise all activities
           closely through a regular visit and phone call.

           3.6.1. Contamination check

           Together with the supervisors, the principal investigator will undertake a random
           assessment at the control sites regularly every week throughout the intervention period
           to check whether some sort of new TB control methods or peer education has been started
           in the control sites as in the intervention sites. Then,the investigators will give
           timely solutions if possible or will consider the contamination during result
           interpretation.

           3.7. Blinding

           Neither the prison health personnel nor peer educators will be blinded to the
           allocation. However, the data analyzer and the laboratory personnel will be blinded.

           3.8. Demographic and clinical data collection

           Demographic and clinical information such as pre-treatment symptom duration will be
           collected from TB confirmed cases detected at both the intervention and control sites
           using a pre-tested structured questionnaire. Patients' sputum smear status, the
           radiological findings and treatment outcomes will be recorded from the referrals sites
           and Directly Observed Treatment Short Course (DOTS) centers in both groups. The
           investigators will also collect data on the size of the prison cells and on the number
           of pulmonary TB cases detected in the previous two years before the start of this
           intervention in both the intervention and control sites to consider for possible
           adjustments.

           3.9. Laboratory Methods and Diagnostic criteria

           For both the intervention and control conditions, TB diagnosis will be carried out at
           the referral sites using the direct smear microscopy and/or chest X-ray (the routine
           available diagnostic methods). Three sputum samples (spot-morning-spot) will be
           collected from each presumptive TB case and direct sputum microscopy will be performed
           using Ziehl-Neelsen staining technique as per the national guideline at the referral
           sites by experienced laboratory technologists. Chest X-ray will also be performed at
           referral sites. A presumptive TB case with one or more initial sputum smear examinations
           (direct smear microscopy) AFB-positive; or one sputum examination AFB-positive plus
           radiographic abnormalities consistent with active pulmonary TB as determined by a
           clinician will be considered as a smear-positive TB case according to the national
           guideline [24]. A patient having symptoms suggestive of TB with at least 3 initial smear
           examinations negative for AFB by direct microscopy, and with no response to a course of
           broad-spectrum antibiotics, and with radiological abnormalities consistent with
           pulmonary tuberculosis will be considered as a smear-negative pulmonary TB case [24].
           All confirmed TB cases will be treated according to the national guideline. The
           treatment regimen for new TB cases consisted of two months intensive phase treatment
           with ethambutol, rifampicin, isoniazid and pyrazinamide followed by a continuation phase
           treatment for 4 months with isoniazid and rifampicin. Follow-up sputum examination will
           be conducted according to the national recommendation and outcomes (treatment success,
           failure, default, and death) will be recorded by the data collectors (trained prison
           nurses). A smear-positive TB patient with at least two negative smears including the
           last month of treatment will be reported as cured. A patient who finished the treatment
           but did not have a smear result in the last month of treatment and on at least one
           previous occasion will be reported as treatment completed. If a patient remained or
           became smear-positive at the end of 5 months or later, he/she will be reported as
           treatment failure. A patient who missed treatment for eight consecutive weeks after
           receiving treatment for at least 4 weeks will be reported as a defaulter. A patient who
           was transferred to another recording and reporting unit after receiving treatment for at
           least 4 weeks and whose treatment outcome was not reported to the referring district
           will be reported as transferred out. A patient who died while on treatment will be
           reported as dead irrespective of the cause of death [25].

           3.10. Sample size calculation

           The number of pair-matched clusters required for this study was determined using a
           formula suggested by RJ Hayes and S Bennett [26] for a pair-matched cluster randomized
           trials of unequal cluster size as shown below. The sample size was calculated based on
           the following assumptions: an estimated average annual pulmonary TB case detection rate
           (CDR) of 40% in the study prisons (estimated using unpublished review of the two years
           DOTs record from some study prisons), expecting to detect a 50% increment in case
           detection rate over the intervention period (from 40% in the control groups to 60% in
           the intervention groups), a power of 80%, a coefficient of variation of 0.25, and a
           significance level of 0.05. The number of clusters was fixed considering only the
           primary outcome (case detection rate). A coefficient of variation of 0.25 was considered
           since there was no full data for the matched prison pairs to calculate the exact value.

           C = 2+ (Zα/2 + ZB) 2 [X0 x Av (1/X0j) + X1 x Av (1/X1j) + K2 (X02 + X12)]/ (X0-X1)2

           Where:

           C = number of matched clusters Zα/2 = level of significance, 95% = 1.96 Zβ = power of
           the study, 80% = 0.84 X0 = the estimated average annual smear-positive case detection
           rate in the control sites = 40% X1 = the estimated average annual smear-positive case
           detection rate in the intervention sites = 60% K= coefficient of variation = 0.25 Av
           (1/X0j) = the mean of the reciprocals of the cluster sizes (person-years) in the control
           group = 0.001 Av (1/X1j) = the mean of the reciprocals of the cluster sizes
           (person-years) in the intervention group = 0.0014 This computation provides a cluster
           size of 8.6 pairs. Considering feasibility, the investigators chose 8 pairs.

           3.11. Study variables

           3.11.1. Outcome variables

           The primary outcome measure for this study is case detection rate while treatment
           outcome (success, failure, death) and pre-treatment symptom duration are the secondary
           outcomes of interest. Moreover, the investigators will also compare the KAP scores of
           the two groups at the end of the intervention.

           Case detection rate (CDR): Calculated as notifications of new and relapse cases divided
           by the estimated incidence per year. The mean CDR will be compared within each pair at
           the end of the intervention (after 12 months).

           Treatment success rate (TSR): Cure or treatment completion rate will be calculated as
           the number of patients cured or treatment completed divided by the total number of
           patients reported expressed as a percentage. Treatment success rate is the sum of cure
           and treatment completion rate.

           Pre-treatment symptom duration: Measured as the proportion of patients with
           pre-treatment symptom duration of &gt;=3 months vs. &lt; 3 months.

           3.11.2. Predictor variables

             -  The presence/absence of the intervention

             -  Socio-demographic characteristics (age, sex)

             -  Seasonal variations (spring, winter, autumn, summer) 3.12. Operational definitions

           Jail: A facility that is used to temporarily detain those who are suspected or convicted
           of a crime.

           Inmate/prisoner: Somebody confined in a prison as a punishment for a crime or while
           waiting to stand trial.

           Peer education: The teaching or sharing of health information, values, and behavior in
           educating others who may share similar social backgrounds or life experiences.

           Prison: A facility that holds convicts who have committed crimes the legal system deems
           especially serious for more long term sentences.

           3.13. Plan for Analysis

           Collected data from questionnaire and laboratory analysis will be checked for
           completeness before entry to a database. The data will be entered using Epi Data entry
           version 3.1 software. Frequency analysis will be run to look into the range of values,
           identify missing data or possibly miscoded data. Then we will use SPSS 20.0 for Windows
           for analysis as recommended for a cluster level analysis (matched analysis). Considering
           prisons as a unit of analysis, the mean CDR, TSR and percentage of patients symptomatic
           for &gt; 3 months will be compared within pairs using the paired t-test or sign test as
           appropriate. The investigators will also perform analysis by date to see the trends of
           the outcome measures over the intervention period.

           3.14. Quality assurance methods

           The questionnaire will be pre-tested to ensure its reliability and validity. Inmate peer
           educators will be thoroughly trained in TB screening procedures and treatment
           supervision. The supervisors assigned to each prison alone, or with the principal
           investigator, will supervise the activities, do a rapid assessment of the general
           activities, and give a timely solution to the problems met. Experienced laboratory
           professionals will be involved in the microscopic examination and quality control of the
           slides examined will be ensured at regional laboratories in each region.

           3.15. Ethical Consideration

           Ethical clearance will be taken from Ethical Review Committees of Mekelle University. A
           written co-operating letter will be taken from the prison- administrators of each
           region. The participants will be included in the study after they have provided written
           informed consent. Patients who are confirmed to have tuberculosis will be referred to
           get treatment. The confidentiality of both paper-based and electronic patient data will
           also be safeguarded throughout the research activities and even after the research is
           completed.

           3.16. Dissemination of the results

           Once analyzed and written up, the findings of the study will be submitted to Mekelle
           University, Maastricht University, Federal Ministry of Health and other potential
           partners. Moreover, key findings of the study will be presented at scientific meetings
           and conferences so as to lobby for a reformulation of national TB control policy with
           the necessary attention given in such settings. The written manuscript will also be
           submitted to peer-reviewed journals for publication.

        4. Trail registration The protocol of this clinical trial will be registered at
           Clinicaltrials.gov website.

    <description>The objective of this study is to evaluate whether empowering and involving inmate peer educators in TB control has an impact on increasing TB case detection rate and improving treatment success in resource-limited prison settings. In this interventional study, inmate peer educators will be trained about TB, its prevention, and control. Once tested for their capability, peer educators will then provide education about TB, its prevention and control for their fellows every two weeks on a regular basis for one year. They will also undertake routine TB screening using a standardized TB screening protocol to identify presumptive TB cases for a referral.</description>
