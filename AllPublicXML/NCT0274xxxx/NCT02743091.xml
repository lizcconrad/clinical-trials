      This study investigates the prevalence and prognosis of idiopathic pre-capillary pulmonary
      hypertension (PH) in patients with end-stage kidney disease (ESKD).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Pulmonary hypertension (PH) is a rare cardiovascular disease with progressive and fatal
      features. PH is classified into the 5 groups, and the prevalence of group 1 pulmonary
      arterial hypertension, including idiopathic and heritable, is 5 to 15 cases per one million
      adults and a median survival was reportedly three years. PH found in patients with end-stage
      kidney disease (ESKD) is classified into group 5, because the pathogenesis and clinical
      characteristics have not been clarified. The prevalence of PH in patients with ESKD was
      reportedly around 17~56% based on echocardiographic studies. In this study, we evaluated the
      incidence of idiopathic pre-capillary PH of ESKD patients by right heart catheterization, and
      examined the prognosis by following the occurrence of heart failure death.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Symptoms of dyspnea, hypotension (systolic blood pressure &lt;90mmHg, or syncope.

          -  Systolic pressure gradients in tricuspid valve of 40 mmHg or more.

          -  In right heart catheterization, precapillary PH was defined as mean pulmonary arterial
             pressure (PAP) ≥25 mmHg, pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) ≥3 wood unit, and
             pulmonary artery wedge pressure (PAWP) ≤15 mmHg.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with systolic left ventricular dysfunction (left ventricular ejection
             fraction [LVEF] &lt;50%), mitral or aortic regurgitation of grade 2 or more, aortic or
             mitral surface &lt;1.5 cm2, severe anemia (blood hemoglobin &lt;9 g/dl), severe chronic
             obstructive pulmonary disease defined by percent predicted forced expiratory volume in
             one second &lt;60%, or lung fibrosis were not enrolled in this study.

          -  In right hear catheterization, PAP ≥25 mmHg and PAWP &gt;15 mmHg were diagnosed as post
             capillary PH.
