  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will elucidate the neurobiology of slowing and LLD, identify a novel therapeutic
      target for depression, and contribute to the development of personalized treatment regimens
      for LLD. The multimodal neuroimaging methods detailed in this application will provide
      information about the neurobiology of aging-associated slowing and LLD at molecular,
      structural, and functional levels of analysis. These data will fill a crucial gap in our
      knowledge regarding what are the physiologic and functional consequences of dopamine
      depletion occurring across the lifespan in individuals without PD. Results from this project
      also will allow us to evaluate a novel therapeutic approach to LLD, which could have large
      public health ramifications given the prevalence, frequent treatment resistance, and
      chronicity characteristic of LLD. Even apart from patients with LLD, cognitive and motor
      slowing exact a large public health burden in terms of impaired functioning and increased
      morbidity and mortality, and this burden will only grow as the population ages. It is
      critical to develop treatments capable of altering the negative health trajectories
      associated with slowing in order to help older adults maintain independent functioning and
      live longer with an increased quality of life. Finally, while PET and MRI may prove critical
      to understand the neurobiology of slowing and LLD, their invasiveness and expense limit their
      roles in informing treatment decisions in clinical practice settings. For this reason the
      investigators are also assessing the influence of genetic moderators such as interleukin-6
      (IL-6) and catechol-O-methyl-transferase (COMT) genotype on baseline dopamine functioning and
      response to L-DOPA. This may facilitate the identification of both high-risk individuals and
      those most likely to benefit from treatment interventions.
