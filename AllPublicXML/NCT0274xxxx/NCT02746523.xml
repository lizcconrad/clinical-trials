      This research study will collect data for each subject in one single visit. During the visit
      the subject will be asked to consent to the study which is estimated to take approximately 10
      minutes. A medical history will be obtained, taking approximately 15 minutes. Blood, urine,
      and cheek swabs will be collected for approximately 15 minutes. The PHQ-9, Becks Depression
      Inventory, Connors Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARSâ„¢), and Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA)
      will be administered, these assessments combined are estimated to take 50 minutes. Lastly,
      patients will be asked to complete a Sensory Organization Test (SOT) which takes
      approximately 15 minutes. There are only licensed health professionals working on this
      project that will respect your privacy and conduct this trial following all HIPPA and
      clinical research guidelines.
