  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This clinical study is designed to evaluate the PillCam SBC system performance in 50
      established or suspected inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients by visualizing and
      assessing their small and large bowel.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The PillCam SBC system to be tested in this study, is a new system composed of capsule, Data
      recorder and a new software Pillcam Desktop Software (version 9.0). The main features of the
      SBC capsule are panoramic field of view and adaptive frame rate customized for complete
      coverage of both small bowel and colonic mucosa.

      Fifty established and suspected IBD patients (at least half of them with established crohn
      disease (CD)) with active or quiescent disease activity, aged 18 years and up, with no
      symptomatic stricture or known obstruction that would prevent capsule passage will be
      enrolled in up to 6 medical sites in Israel and Europe.

      Patients will undergo bowel prep, followed by a PillCam SBC capsule examination. Patency
      capsule may precede PillCam SBC ingestion according to physician discretion.

      The PillCam Software videos will be evaluated by local site reader following a Subjective
      Assessment Form fulfillment.
