      The purpose of this study is to determine whether cervical lymph node dissection is
      necessarily performed in the presence of early-stage oral squamous cell carcinoma.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Oral squamous cell carcinoma is the most common malignant tumor of oral and maxillofacial
      region, and prone to early cervical lymph node metastases. Lymphatic spread is associated
      with increased risk of loco-regional recurrence, therefore, the identification of lymph node
      metastases preoperatively is very important for the optimal surgical therapy. Recently,
      cervical lymph node dissection(CLND) is performed in the presence of oral squamous cell
      carcinoma. However, whether cervical lymph node dissection is necessarily performed in the
      presence of early-stage oral squamous cell carcinoma is still controversial. CLND will
      represent over-treatment in some case of early-stage oral squamous cell carcinoma. Therefore,
      How to accurately predict whether a patient should be performed CLND is important. Our
      previous study show that tumor budding is closely related to lymphatic spread in the oral
      squamous cell carcinoma. The purpose of this study is to find that whether the tumor budding
      guide the individualized surgical planning of early-stage oral squamous cell carcinoma.
