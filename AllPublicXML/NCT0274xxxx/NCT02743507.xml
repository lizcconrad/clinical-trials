  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Bundled payment is a new payment reform that encourages health care providers to improve
      quality and contain costs of care. These arrangements are being rapidly expanded across the
      country, but evidence about their impact are lacking. This study will use Medicare claims
      data to evaluate the effect of participation in a large Medicare bundled payment program on
      the quality and costs of care for common medical and surgical conditions.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The overall objective is to examine the effects of the Bundled Payments for Care Improvement
      (BPCI) Model 2 on the quality and costs of care for conditions related to seven of the ten
      Medicare severity disease-related groups (MS-DRGs) most commonly selected by program
      participation. Five of these are surgical (major joint replacement of the lower extremity;
      double joint replacement of the lower extremity; revision of the hip or knee, hip and femur
      procedures except major joint; lower extremity and humerus procedure except hip, foot, and
      femur) and two are medical (simple pneumonia and respiratory infections; chronic obstructive
      pulmonary disease, bronchitis/asthma). These MS-DRGs represent two larger service lines:
      orthopedics and pulmonary. For each of these seven MS-DRGs, the team will first describe
      characteristics of provider organizations participating in bundled payment arrangements,
      including geographic characteristics and clinical volume. We will subsequently empirically
      test the effect of bundled payment arrangements on quality outcomes and costs of care for
      these conditions. Additionally, the team will examine any spillover effects that occur within
      the service lines that contain these seven MS-DRGs.

        The target population consists of a subset of provider organizations who participated in
        CMS's BPCI bundled payment program. From this group, the team will focus on provider
        organizations that participated in the largest model within the BPCI program (model 2) and
        accepted bundled payment for the ten most common MS-DRGs.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Provider organizations that participate in model 2 of the BPCI program, accept bundled
             payment for the ten most common MS-DRGs, and have at least ten or greater episodes in
             each of the MS-DRGs.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Provider organizations who participated in the BPCI program, but do not meet inclusion
             criteria will be excluded.
