      Clinical study in healthy adult subjects to compare the adult tablet of selexipag with the
      tablet developed for children.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Healthy male adults receive a single dose of selexipag (200 µg) but using a different tablet
      strength (4 film-coated pediatric tablets of 50 µg versus one film-coated tablet of 200 µg
      selexipag) during each of the two study periods. There is a washout of 7-9 days between the
      two study treatment administrations.
