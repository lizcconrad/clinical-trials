  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Bipolar-I Disorder is a common condition that is characterized by periods of mood elevation
      however periods of chronic and recurring depressive episodes are more common and can be
      severely disabling. Effective treatments exist, however a significant portion of bipolar
      depressed patients do not respond to, or have difficulty tolerating many of these
      interventions. Repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (rTMS) is a non-invasive
      neuromodulatory technique that is effective in major depression and there is evidence for its
      efficacy in bipolar depression which needs to be assessed in larger randomized controlled
      trials. This study is a randomised, double-blind, sham-controlled trial over four weeks. The
      primary objective is to assess improvement in depressive symptoms in acute bipolar-I
      depressed patients on treatment with intermittent Theta-Burst Stimulation (iTBS) in
      comparison to sham-rTMS.

    <textblock>
      rTMS is a treatment that involves stimulating a certain area of the brain with magnetic field
      pulses. Over time, the magnetic field pulses can gradually change the activity level of the
      stimulated brain region and help symptoms of bipolar depression. The device used in this
      study has been approved by Health Canada for therapeutic use since 2002. Participants will
      complete a screen visit to determine eligibility based on the inclusion/exclusion criteria.
      If the participants are not eligible, no further study procedures will be conducted. Eligible
      subjects will be randomized to receive either active iTBS-rTMS or sham rTMS treatment (scalp
      stimulation with no magnetic pulse) daily for four weeks (20 sessions) to the left
      dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC). All participants will complete a MRI (to target the
      left DLPFC region of the brain and functional activity), EEG &amp; fNIRS, lab work, and
      neurocognitive testing prior to the commencement and post rTMS treatment. Efficacy, safety
      and tolerability will be evaluated at screen visit, during daily rTMS treatments, clinic
      visits and post rTMS treatment. All participants will have a phone interview two weeks post
      rTMS treatment.

    <intervention_name>iTBS repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (rTMS)</intervention_name>
    <description>rTMS is a non-invasive procedure in which cerebral electrical activity is influenced by a rapidly changing magnetic field. The magnetic field is created by a plastic-encased coil which is placed over the patient's scalp. The magnetic field can be directed onto specific areas of the brain. rTMS can modulate cerebral activity by low or high frequencies. Over time, the magnetic field pulses can gradually change the activity level of the stimulated brain region and help symptoms of bipolar depression.</description>
