      The study will be a prospective randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial of
      mirabegron for medical expulsive therapy (MET) in patients with a CT (Computed Tomography)
      scan-proven ureteral stone between 4 to 10 mm undergoing expectant management.

      The study will be a prospective randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial of
      mirabegron for medical expulsive therapy (MET) in patients with a CT scan-proven ureteral
      stone between 4 to 10 mm undergoing expectant management. Subjects will be distributed at a
      1:1 ratio between the control and treatment groups. The treatment group will receive
      mirabegron and the control groups will receive a placebo. Both groups will receive analgesics
      and hydration will be recommended. All subjects will then be followed for 30 days to
      determine the proportion of subjects with spontaneous passage. Patients will record narcotic
      usage and pain scores during this time. If there is stone persistence in the ureter based on
      imaging (CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis versus renal ultrasound plus KUB), then the
      patient will undergo ureteroscopy with stent placement. In these patients, treatment will
      continue while the stent is in place and patients will fill out a validated questionnaire
      regarding stent pain.

    <measure>Comparison of pain levels between treatment groups using the Wong Baker FACES pain scale</measure>
    <time_frame>2 months</time_frame>
    <description>Pain measures between treatment groups will be measured daily for each patient by using the Wong Baker FACES pain scale. The Ureteric Stent Symptoms Questionnaire (USSQ) will be observed in patients who require surgical intervention, and will be observed during study visit 4. A general linear model will be used to compare USSQ (Ureteric Stent Symptoms Questionnaire) pain scores between the treated and placebo groups. The model will also be used to explore associations between pain scores and demographic or clinical characteristics adjusting for treatment group.</description>
