  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this prospective interventional study is to verify the efficacy of smoking
      cessation on clinical and microbiological outcomes of non-surgical periodontal therapy of
      chronic periodontitis patients. Smokers willing to quit received periodontal treatment and
      concurrent smoking cessation therapy. Periodontal maintenance was performed every 3 months. A
      single calibrated examiner, blinded to smoking status, assessed periodontal clinical outcomes
      and applied a structured questionnaire in order to collect demographic and behavioural
      information. Further, expired carbon monoxide concentration were measured with a monoximeter.
      A pooled subgingival plaque sample was collected from the deepest periodontal pocket from
      each participant. The presence and quantification of Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans,
      Porphyromonas gingivalis, Tannerella forsythia and Treponema denticola were determined using
      (RT-PCR).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Smokers willing to quit, with 10 teeth or more, and with periodontitis (30% or more of their
      teeth with proximal attachment loss ≥ 5 mm) were enrolled in the study. All subjects received
      periodontal treatment and concurrent smoking cessation therapy. Smoking cessation therapy was
      performed by a team comprising physicians, nurses, a psychologist and dentists, and consisted
      of four 1-h counselling lectures, psychologist-assisted cognitive behavioral therapy,
      nicotine replacement therapy and medication (bupropion or varenicline). Smoking cessation
      motivation was reinforced by dentists at the maintenance sessions, by means of motivational
      interviewing techniques. Periodontal therapy consisted in full-mouth supra and subgingival
      scaling and root planing (with curettes and ultrasonic scaler); oral hygiene instruction and
      motivation and removal of intra-oral plaque retentive factors. Further, periodontal
      maintenance was performed every 3 months.

      A single calibrated examiner, blinded to smoking status, assessed periodontal clinical
      outcomes (recession, pocket depth, clinical attachment level, plaque index and bleeding on
      probing). A structured questionnaire was applied in order to collect demographic and
      behavioral information. Expired carbon monoxide concentration was measured with a
      monoximeter, in order to validate smoking status. A pooled subgingival plaque sample was
      collected from the deepest periodontal pocket from each participant. The presence and
      quantification of Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Tannerella
      forsythia and Treponema denticola were determined using real time - PCR (RT-PCR).

    <masking_description>The outcome assessor was blind to smoking status. Before each follow-up periodontal examination (3, 6 and 12 months), the following procedures were performed by a periodontist: (1) removal of all tobacco stains from subject's teeth and/or dental polishing, with a standardized duration of up to 30 min., (2) 0.12% chlorohexidine rinse (1min.) aimed to hide any possible cigarette odour exhaled from the oral cavity. After these procedures, the examiner entered the examination room fully equipped (including a mask), in order to avoid noticing the smoking status by odour</masking_description>
