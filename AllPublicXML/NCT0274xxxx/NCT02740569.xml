  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Scleroderma is an autoimmune disease with skin manifestations and may have pulmonary
      involvement. Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) may also be seen in scleroderma. Less is known
      regarding the prevalence of OSA in scleroderma and its association with pulmonary
      involvement.

      Scleroderma is an autoimmune disease with skin manifestations and may have pulmonary
      involvement. OSA may also be seen in scleroderma. Less is known regarding the prevalence of
      obstructive sleep apnea in scleroderma and its association with pulmonary involvement.

      The investigators would like to address the prevalence of OSA in patients with Scleroderma,
      using overnight cardiorespiratory polygraphy. Other comorbidities and pulmonary findings on
      computer tomography (CT) as well as lung function tests will be evaluated.

      The investigators plan to include 60 patients.
