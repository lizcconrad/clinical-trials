  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is a need for better visualization of resection margins and detection of small tumor
      deposits during surgery for pancreatic cancer. Optical molecular imaging of pancreatic ductal
      adenocarcinoma associated biomarkers is a promising technique to accommodate this need. The
      biomarker Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF-A) is overexpressed in pancreatic cancer
      tissue versus normal tissue and has proven to be a valid target for molecular imaging. VEGF-A
      can be targeted by the monoclonal antibody bevacizumab. Monoclonal antibodies can be labeled
      by the near-infrared (NIR) fluorescent dye IRDye800CW (800CW). The investigators hypothesize
      that bevacizumab-800CW accumulates in VEGF expressing cancer, enabling pancreatic cancer
      visualization using a NIR intraoperative camera system. In this pilot intervention study the
      investigators will determine the optimal dosage of bevacizumab-800CW (4,5 10, 25 or 50mg) to
      detect pancreatic cancer tissue intraoperatively.
