  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic hepatitis B (CHB) affects more than 350 million people worldwide. The most common
      form in Europe is CHB HBeAg-negative. Antiviral treatment of CHB HBeAg-negative patients
      includes chronic administration of nucleos(t)ide analogues (NUC) or pegylated interferon
      (PegIFN) during 12 months. Typically, PegIFN allows immune control of CHB and antigen &quot;s&quot;
      (HBsAg) loss in around 4% of patients compared to less than 0,1% using NUC. Recently, it has
      been described that HBsAg quantification (HBsAg-q) is useful to identify patients with high
      probability to lose HBsAg during follow-up. In addition, a proof-of-concept study with nine
      HBeAg-negative patients receiving NUC showed that adding PegIFN (16 weeks) achieved HBsAg
      loss in one patient (11%). The aim of our study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety adding
      PegIFN (48 weeks) in treated HBeAg-negative patients with NUC.
