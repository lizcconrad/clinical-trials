    <textblock>
      Photography is considered as one of the most important means to promote evidence-based
      medical practice in pediatric ophthalmology.This study is to investigate the feasibility of
      congenital cataract morphological classifications and monitoring using slit-lamp-adapted
      anterior segmental photography in a large cohort that included uncooperative children.

    <textblock>
      Lens opacities in congenital cataracts have a wide range of presentations.Therefore, it is
      important to find a method of recording, classifying and monitoring cataract morphologies
      that is feasible and safe in a large cohort of children with congenital cataracts, including
      uncooperative children. Photography is considered as one of the most important means to
      promote evidence-based medical practice in pediatric ophthalmology.

      In this study, the investigators studied congenital cataract morphological classifications
      and monitoring using slit-lamp-adapted anterior segmental photography and evaluated its
      safety and feasibility in pediatric cataract patients registered in the Childhood Cataract
      Program of the Chinese Ministry of Health.

    <description>All eligible pediatric patients underwent pupil dilation with compound tropicamide eye drops 3 times (1 time every 10 minutes) before the examination or administration of sleep aid medicine. Then, the children underwent slit-lamp-adapted anterior segmental photography (BX900, Haag-Streit AG, Köniz, Switzerland) for each cataractous lens, including one diffuse light photo, one slit-light photo across the cataract and one retro-illumination photo. All photos of the included patients were screened and morphologically classified separately by two pediatric ophthalmologists; a third ophthalmologist was masked and required to make a decision if the first two physicians had different opinions.</description>
