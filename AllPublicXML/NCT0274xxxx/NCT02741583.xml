  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      prospective controlled interventional trial evaluating the efficacy of a 3-weeks asthma
      rehabilitation program at high altitude (3200m) and low altitude (760m) on lung function and
      asthma control.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Low altitude baseline measurements will be performed in Bishkek. Participants will then
      either be assigned to a rehabilitation program in Bishkek (760m) or in Tuja Ashu (3200m).

      The rehabilitation programs in high or low altitude will be identically performed and will
      comprise

        -  asthma education and awareness

        -  instruction on inhaled therapies

        -  smoking cessation counseling

        -  respiratory and skeletal muscle training in groups

        -  guided walks / cycle ergometer training

        -  questionnaires on asthma control, quality of life

        -  spirometry and peak flow measurements

        -  echocardiography

      Measurement on study subjects will be performed at baseline (Bishkek), during the
      rehabilitation program, after completion of the rehabilitation program and during a follow-up
      at week 15.
