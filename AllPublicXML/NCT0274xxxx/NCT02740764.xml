  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Aging is often associated with multiple chronic conditions conducting increased consumption
      of drugs. Drug therapy is necessary for the treatment of many diseases. However, misuse of
      drugs, particularly linked to the potentially inappropriate prescribing and polypharmacy,
      increases the iatrogenic risks and can lead to adverse events such as falls, cognitive
      decline, increased use to the health system: hospital admissions, emergency room visits, and
      institutionalization. These problems are common since about 20% of emergency room use in
      elderly patients due to an adverse event related to drugs. Nearly 28% of adverse events
      related to drug prescriptions could be avoided.

      Interventions to optimize drug therapy showed a reduction in the number of potentially
      inappropriate medications, but their impact on health, has rarely been evaluated. If an
      association with death has been established, the link with the loss of functional autonomy,
      which leads to reduced quality of life and significant cost of care, has not been
      investigated. The evolution towards functional disabilities, frequent with aging has many
      causes, among which some could be prevented. The optimization of drug prescriptions could
      thereby delay or prevent the loss of functional autonomy by reducing the risk of adverse
      events, such as falls or cognitive decline and improving the management of chronic diseases.
      Our hypothesis is that an optimization program of the drug prescribing may slow progression
      to functional dependence. To assess the effect of the optimization program of drug
      prescribing on the level of functional autonomy, a multicenter Randomized Controlled Trial
      will be conducted in geriatric and memory consultations.

      Expected results The implementation of the &quot;OPTIM&quot; program should enable optimization of drug
      prescribing in elderly patients and therefore slow or prevent progression to addiction. It
      should also help to develop and strengthen collaboration and communication between the team
      of geriatric consultation, the clinician pharmacist and referring physicians in town (private
      practice). In addition, pharmaceutical notice sent to referring physicians should help raise
      awareness of the prescription of drugs in these patients.

    <time_frame>At inclusion</time_frame>
    <description>The primary outcome will be calculated using the 4 successive evaluations of IADL scale.
The IADL scale assesses the level of functional autonomy of a patient through the assessment of instrumental activities of daily living: ability to use the telephone, transportation, shopping, managing medications, manage a budget, prepare meals, maintain the house and do the laundry. The rating scale provides a score from 0 to 8. A higher score indicates a higher level of dependency, while a lower score reflects a lower level of dependence. The IADL scale consists of 8 questions.</description>

The scale DAD-6 assesses the patient's activities in his daily life.

The score ranges from 0 to 18 points, the higher the score, the more the patient is autonomous.</description>
