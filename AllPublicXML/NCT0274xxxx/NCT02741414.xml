  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Recently studies showed that the eradication rate of H. pylori fail to exceed 80% and even
      falls into an unacceptable range. A major cause of treatment failure is associated with
      antibiotic resistance and poor patient compliance. However, the refractory infection of H.
      pylori is still existing, although patients have good compliance and receive standardized
      treatment. This phenomenon is likely attributed to the different ratio of sensitive and
      resistance in H. pylori, the difference of Amoxicillin resistance between in vivo and in
      vitro, the difference between phenotype and genotype or the influence of micro-environment in
      the stomach. In order to solve the refractory infection of H. pylori, investigators performed
      a muti-center study together with other 14 institutions. In this study, investigators will
      select the patients with refractory infection of H. pylori after two standardized treatment
      from patients with first eradication therapy of H. pylori infection. Then, investigators will
      perform a high-throughput sequencing for patients in groups. Finally, investigators will
      compare the differences between the patients with first successful eradication and patients
      with refractory infection of H. pylori, such as drug resistance gene mutation, phenotype and
      genotype, the mechanisms of Amoxicillin resistance and micro-environment in stomach.

    <description>The intervention focused on the results from the result of 13C-urea breath test after treatment. The first successful eradication group and the refractory infection of H. pylori group were treated according to the antibiotic susceptibility testing and CYP2C19 gene polymorphism. Eight weeks after treatment, a 13C-urea breath test was performed on patients. The first successful eradication group were patients with negative in 13C-urea breath tests in the first treatment. The refractory infection of H. pylori group were treatment failure patients with positive in 13C-urea breath tests after the second standardized treatment.</description>
