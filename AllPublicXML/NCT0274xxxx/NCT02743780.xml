  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if the clinical profile of topical-ocular MGV354
      merits further development for the indication of lowering intraocular pressure (IOP).

  <detailed_description>

      Part 1 will evaluate the safety and tolerability of single ascending doses of MGV354 compared
      to placebo in healthy male and female subjects. Part 2 will evaluate the safety and
      tolerability of MGV354 in a multiple ascending dose design (two highest tolerated doses from
      Part 1) compared to placebo when administered for 7 days to patients with ocular hypertension
      or glaucoma. Part 3 will explore the safety, tolerability and efficacy of a single dose level
      of MGV354 (maximum tolerated dose) compared to placebo when administered for 7 days in
      patients with ocular hypertension or glaucoma.

    <measure>Part 3: Change in Diurnal IOP (Averaged Over 8 AM, 10 AM, Noon, 4 PM, and 8 PM) From Baseline to Day 8</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Day 8</time_frame>
    <description>IOP (fluid pressure inside the eye) was assessed using Goldmann applanation tonometry and reported in mmHg. Diurnal IOP was defined as the average of the five time points measured (8 AM, 10 AM, noon, 4 PM, and 8 PM). Baseline diurnal IOP was the average of IOP measurements obtained at the 2 eligibility visits. Change from baseline was calculated by taking the change at each time point from baseline to Day 8 and averaging the available changes. A more negative change from baseline indicates a greater improvement, i.e., a reduction of IOP. Only one eye (study eye) contributed to the analysis.</description>

        <title>Part 3: Change in Diurnal IOP (Averaged Over 8 AM, 10 AM, Noon, 4 PM, and 8 PM) From Baseline to Day 8</title>
        <description>IOP (fluid pressure inside the eye) was assessed using Goldmann applanation tonometry and reported in mmHg. Diurnal IOP was defined as the average of the five time points measured (8 AM, 10 AM, noon, 4 PM, and 8 PM). Baseline diurnal IOP was the average of IOP measurements obtained at the 2 eligibility visits. Change from baseline was calculated by taking the change at each time point from baseline to Day 8 and averaging the available changes. A more negative change from baseline indicates a greater improvement, i.e., a reduction of IOP. Only one eye (study eye) contributed to the analysis.</description>

        <title>Part 3: Change From Baseline in IOP at 36 Hours and 48 Hours Post Day 7 Administration</title>
        <description>IOP (fluid pressure inside the eye) was assessed using Goldmann applanation tonometry and reported in mmHg. Baseline IOP was the average of IOP measurements obtained at the 2 eligibility visits. Change from baseline was calculated by taking the change at each time point from baseline to Day 8 and averaging the available changes. A more negative change from baseline indicates a greater improvement, i.e., a reduction of IOP. Only one eye (study eye) contributed to the analysis.</description>
