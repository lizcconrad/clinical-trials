    <textblock>
      This was a prospective phase II study on patients with locally advanced rectal cancer or
      local recurrence, to evaluate the pathological response and resectability of a neoadjuvant
      treatment based on the use of a combined treatment with VMAT-SIB and two drugs chemotherapy (
      XELOX).

      This was a prospective phase II study on patients with LARC or local recurrence, to evaluate
      the pathological response and resectability of a neoadjuvant treatment based on the use of a
      combined treatment with VMAT-SIB and two drugs chemotherapy ( XELOX).

      The primary aim was to asses the pathological response rate. Key secondary aim was the acute
      toxicity. Secondary aims were local control, disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival
      (OS).

      The follow-up period of each subjects started at the end of combined treatment and concluded
      after a period of maximum 60 months or until death.

    <description>Pathological response was determined according to the TNM classification system of the American Joint Committee on Cancer. The complete resection of the tumor (R) with no histological proven residual disease in the surgical specimen, was defined as pathological complete response (pCR =pT0). Near complete response (pTmic) was defined as the presence of a number of neoplastic cells inferior to 10%.</description>

    <description>A VMAT-SIB technique was used. Radiation dose prescribed to PTV2 was 45 Gy (1.8 Gy/fraction), five sessions weekly in 25 daily fractions. A simultaneous boost was delivered on PTV1 with a total dose of 57.5 Gy (2.3 Gy/fraction). Dose-volume histograms (DVHs) were calculated for the PTV1, PTV2 and Organs at risks.
The prescribed concurrent chemotherapy consisted of oxaliplatin infusion 130 mg/m2 on days 1, 17, 35 and capecitabine 1650 mg/m2 daily (825 mg/m² twice daily, 5 days/week) over all the treatment.</description>

    <description>Radiation dose prescribed to PTV2 was 45 Gy (1.8 Gy/fraction), five sessions weekly in 25 daily fractions. A simultaneous boost was delivered on PTV1 with a total dose of 57.5 Gy (2.3 Gy/fraction). Dose-volume histograms (DVHs) were calculated for the PTV1, PTV2 and OARs. Patients were treated only if the relative variations of the bone markers between the images were within 3 mm along the three spatial directions. Planning and delivery processes underwent to systematic independent-check procedures.</description>

An adequate blood count was necessary to start each chemotherapy infusion. Adjuvant chemotherapy was recommended on patients with high risk factors at pathological examination and decision was left to medical oncologists discretion.</description>
