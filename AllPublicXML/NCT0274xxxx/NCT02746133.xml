  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to characterise the patient and disease profile under the
      influence of a protein-restricted diet supplemented with keto acids/amino acids (KA/AA),
      focusing on the progression of chronic renal insufficiency, calcium and phosphorus
      metabolism, nutritional status, patient compliance to diet and Ketosteril intake as well as
      the persistent dietary education to ensure compliance in a large group of pre-dialysis
      patients.

    <description>This is an observational study aiming to characterise the Patient Profile and contemporary Treatment of pre-dialytic chronic kidney disease (CKD) in patients receiving a restricted Protein diet supplemented with Ketosteril®. There is no distinction between Primary and secondary outcome measures in the observational plan, and only Routine procedures are documented.
Patient compliance to Ketosteril will be assessed daily, for a total of 12 months.</description>
