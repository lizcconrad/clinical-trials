  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether oxytocin will decrease craving to use
      alcohol and stress reactivity following exposure to laboratory-induced stress among Active
      Duty Service Members with a dual diagnosis of alcohol use disorder and post-traumatic
      anxiety.

      The purpose of this study is to determine whether intra-nasally administered oxytocin will
      decrease craving to use alcohol and stress reactivity following exposure to
      laboratory-induced stress among Active Duty Service Members (AD SMs) with a dual diagnosis of
      alcohol use disorder and post-traumatic anxiety (i.e., PTSD or anxiety disorder NOS).

      This is a 2-arm placebo controlled study. Subjects will complete a battery of self-report
      questionnaires and behavioral interviews. Baseline assessments of subjective (craving,
      stress), physiologic (HR, BP), and neuroendocrine measures (salivary cortisol) will be
      collected. These same assessments will be repeatedly collected throughout the testing portion
      of the study. Subjects will receive acute administration of intra-nasal oxytocin or placebo
      and will then be exposed to a laboratory-induced social stressor. They will be asked to give
      a short speech and perform arithmetic in front of a panel of judges. Following the task,
      additional post-task assessments of the subjective, physiological, and neuroendocrine
      measures will be completed over the next hour.

             that AUD is primary.

          -  Subjects taking psychotropic medications will be required to be maintained on a stable
             dose for at least two weeks before study initiation (unless at physician's discretion

          -  Must consent to random assignment to oxytocin or placebo.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Positive urine drug screen (except marijuana) or BAC &gt; 0.

          -  Subjects with a history of a major medical illness (e.g., endocrine, cardiovascular,
             central nervous system disorders, peripheral neuropathy, or pulmonary disease) or
             other acute or unstable medical condition that might interfere with safe conduct of
             the study or accurate interpretation of the results.
