      The purpose of this study is to asses the effect of chronic constipation on formation of
      inguinal hernia using Constipation Severity Scale.

    <textblock>
      Causes of inguinal hernia are known to be multifactorial, although not fully understood.
      Besides family history, and connective tissue diseases, the sudden increase in abdominal
      pressure as heavy lifting, chronic constipation , coughing, straining , situations such as
      difficulty urinating facilitate the formation and emergence of hernia.

      Constipation severity scale(CSS) was developed by Varma et al in 2008. CSS is a scale to
      determine the individuals defecation frequency, the intensity and difficulty during
      defecation.CSS has three subscales including Pain, Congestion stool and Large Intestine
      laziness(0-73 points).High scores indicate that serious symptoms.

      Investigators found no studies that show how constipation impact on groin hernias.
      Investigators are planning to understand the effect of constipation on direct and indirect
      hernia formation.

    <description>This study asses the effect of chronic constipation on formation of inguinal hernia using Constipation Severity Scale(CSS). After the Ethics Committee Approval from Harran University, study was carried out with 200 patient. After filling out a detailed consent form the two groups were asked to fill out the scale(study group: 100 Patients which were operated with the diagnosis of inguinal hernia, control group: 100 volunteers clinically determined to be healthy). . During surgery, hernia types of the patient's in study group defined according to Nyhus classification and noted on the scale. Results in both groups were studied to understand the effect of constipation on development of inguinal hernia and whether there was a correlation between surgical patients and healthy volunteers. The effect of constipation was also evaluated on operated patients on the view of direct and indirect hernias. P &lt;0.05 was considered significant.,</description>
