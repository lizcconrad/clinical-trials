  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To evaluate the efficacy and safety of AXS-05 relative to bupropion in subjects with
      treatment resistant major depressive disorder (MDD).

      This is a randomized, double-blind, active-controlled, 12-week, two-period study consisting
      of an open-label, bupropion lead-in period, and a double-blind treatment period. The trial is
      being conducted in subjects with treatment resistant MDD.

      Subjects will be considered to have treatment resistant MDD if they have had a historical
      inadequate response to 1 or 2 antidepressant treatments and a prospective inadequate response
      to treatment with bupropion during the open-label, lead-in period.

    <description>The MADRS is used to assess depressive symptomatology during the previous week. Subjects are rated on 10 items to assess feelings of sadness, lassitude, pessimism, inner tension, suicidality, reduced sleep or appetite, difficulty concentrating and lack of interest. Each item is scored on a 7-point scale. A score of 0 indicates the absence of symptoms, and a score of 6 indicates symptoms of maximum severity.</description>
