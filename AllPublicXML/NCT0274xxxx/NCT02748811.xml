    <textblock>
      GERICO is a randomized, controlled prospective trial. The aim is to investigate if frail,
      elderly patients with stage II-IV colorectal cancer, will profit from full comprehensive
      geriatric assessment and intervention before and during treatment with chemotherapy.

      The hypotheses are: Optimizing the health conditions and functional status of frail elderly
      patients who suffers from stage II-IV colorectal cancer, with geriatric intervention will
      lead to a higher grade of completing the planned chemotherapy and at higher dose intensity.
      This will also result in a higher overall survival and improve quality of life.

    <description>The control group receives standard treatment with 6 months of adjuvant chemotherapy or first -line chemotherapy until operation, other scheduled change in treatment or progression. If the patient has other health problems, those issues will be assessed either by the oncologist or by the general practitioner.

They will simultaneously receive full geriatric assessement and intervention. The clinical examination includes laboratory parameters, review of medication list, psycho-cognitive assessement, screening for malnutrition and need of physiotherapy, optimizing social support. Validated quality of life questionnaires will be filled in prior to start, after 2 months and at the end of treatment.</description>
