      This long-term, nationwide observational data collection repository will obtain
      patient-reported outcomes from metabolic and bariatric surgery patients. The data will be
      used in conjunction with clinical outcomes to determine quality, safety, and comparative
      effectiveness of various metabolic and bariatric procedures.
