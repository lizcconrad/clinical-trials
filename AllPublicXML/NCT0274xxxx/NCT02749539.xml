      Post-mastectomy complications are often noted and complaints by breast cancer survivors. It
      often involves the development of chronic arm pain with accompanying limitation of shoulder
      motion. Aim of the study was to investigate the effect of the kinesio tape (KT) on the
      shoulder pain and range of motion (ROM).

      Method: 74 female patients underwent modified radical mastectomy were involved in this study.
      They were randomly divided into two groups, experimental who received KT for shoulder joint
      in addition to conventional physiotherapy program while, the control group received the
      physiotherapy program only. Outcome measures were visual analogues scale, shoulder ROM and
      shoulder Pain and Disability Index.
