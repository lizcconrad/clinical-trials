  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the safety and tolerability of IL-2 when given in combination with
      pembrolizumab to patients with advanced melanoma. Aldesleukin may stimulate white blood cells
      to melanoma cells. Monoclonal antibodies, such as pembrolizumab, may interfere with the
      ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Giving aldesleukin and pembrolizumab may kill more
      tumor cells.

      There are two parts to this study:

        -  Phase Ib: To determine the safety and side effects of increasing doses of IL-2 in
           combination with pembrolizumab

        -  Phase II: Once the maximum tolerated dose of IL-2 is determined, additional patients
           will be treated to determine if it is effective against the cancer.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine an optimal tolerated dose (OTD) of aldesleukin (interleukin [IL]-2) that is
      effective and tolerable in combination with pembrolizumab.

      II. To characterize the efficacy of the OTD of IL-2 in combination with pembrolizumab.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To characterize the safety of IL-2 in doses ranging up to the Food and Drug Administration
      (FDA)- approved dose when administered in combination with pembrolizumab.

      II. To characterize clinical endpoints, including overall survival, progression-free
      survival, and complete response rate.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To characterize immune parameters in the blood and tumor microenvironment and cellular and
      molecular features of the tumor tissue that correlate with response to combination therapy
      for study as potential predictive biomarkers.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive pembrolizumab intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on day 1 every 3 weeks and
      aldesleukin IV every 8 hours for up to 14 doses at weeks 4, 7, 16, 19, 28, and 31 in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months up to 10 years.
