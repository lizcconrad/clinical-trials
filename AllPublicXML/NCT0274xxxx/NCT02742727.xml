    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

        Male and female subjects with CD7+ malignancies in patients with no available curative
        treatment options who have limited prognosis (several months to &lt; 2 year survival) with
        currently available therapies will be enrolled:

          1. Eligible diseases: CD7 positive relapsed or refractory Leukemia and Lymphoma. ￚ Acute
             myeloid leukemia, previously identified as CD7+ ￚ Precursor T lymphoblast
             leukemia/lymphoma ￚ T-cell prolymphocytic leukemia ￚ T-cell large granular lymphocytic
             leukemia ￚ Peripheral T-cell lymphoma, NOS ￚ Angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma ￚ
             Extranodal NK/T-cell lymphoma, nasal type ￚ Enteropathy-type intestinal T-cell
             lymphoma ￚ Hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma

          2. Patients 18 years of age or older, and must have a life expectancy &gt; 12 weeks.

          3. CD7 is expressed in malignancy tissues by immuno-histochemical (IHC) or Flow
             cytometry.

          4. Assessable disease as measured by laboratory and bone marrow examinations.

          5. Eastern cooperative oncology group (ECOG) performance status of 0-2 or karnofsky
             performance status (KPS) score is higher than 60.

          6. Females of child-bearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test and all
             subjects must agree to use an effective method of contraception for up to two weeks
             after the last infusion of CAR-pNK cells.

          7. Adequate bone marrow, liver and renal function as assessed by the following laboratory
             requirements: serum creatinine ≤ 2.5mg/dL, aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and
             alanine aminotransferase (ALT) ≤ 5×upper limit of normal, serum total bilirubin ≤
             2.0mg/dL. These tests must be conducted within 7 days prior to registration.

          8. Ability to give informed consent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients with symptomatic central nervous system (CNS) involvement.

          2. Pregnant or nursing women may not participate.

          3. Known HIV, hepatitis B virus (HBV) or hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection.

          4. Serious illness or medical condition which would not permit the patient to be managed
             according to the protocol, including active uncontrolled infection, major
             cardiovascular, coagulation disorders, respiratory or immune system, myocardial
             infarction, cardiac arrhythmias, obstructive/restrictive pulmonary disease, or
             psychiatric or emotional disorders.

          5. Concurrent use of systemic steroids. Recent or current use of inhaled steroids is not
             exclusionary.

          6. Previously treatment with any gene therapy products.

          7. The existence of unstable or active ulcers or gastrointestinal bleeding.

          8. Patients with a history of organ transplantation or are waiting for organ
             transplantation.

          9. Patients need anticoagulant therapy (such as warfarin or heparin).

         10. Patients need long-term antiplatelet therapy (aspirin at a dose &gt; 300mg/d; clopidogrel
             at a dose &gt; 75mg/d).
