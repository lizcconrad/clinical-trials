      A pilot study to evaluate the feasibility of altering skin pigmentation using the Dermal
      Cooling System.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This non-significant risk study is being performed to test the hypothesis that a new
      treatment concept, controlled localized cooling of the epidermal layer, can be used to
      lighten areas of the skin.
