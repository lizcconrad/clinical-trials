  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of Sensory Supported Swimming is to provide a sustainable, low cost recreational
      swim program for children with ASD. A secondary purpose is to train general recreation
      providers and swim instructors to meet the unique needs of children. Specific aims include
      both program development and research aims as described below.

      Specific Aims:

      1. Provide more opportunities for families of children with ASD to access a recreational swim
      program at low cost. (program development) 2. Increase the capacity of swim instructors and
      general recreation providers working with children with ASD. (Research) 3. Increase physical
      activity for children with ASD in a way that is a good match for their individual sensory
      needs. (Research) 4. Increase safety among children with ASD in and around the water so they
      and their families can swim safely. (Research) 5. Transition swimmers with ASD from a
      learn-to-swim program to an inclusive swim team. (Program Development) Hypotheses

        1. The Sensory Supported Swim Program will increase physical activity of children with ASD.

        2. The Sensory Supported Swim Program will increase safety of children with ASD in and
           around the water.

        3. The Sensory Supported Swim Program will increase the capacity of general recreation
           providers and swim instructors to serve children with ASD.

      To decrease risk of drowning, increase opportunities to engage in a lifelong sport, and
      increase the capacity of general recreation providers, investigators developed a recreational
      swim program for children with ASD. The purpose of this program is to provide swimming and
      water safety instruction for children with ASD. A secondary purpose is to train general
      recreation providers and swim instructors to meet the unique needs of children. Research of
      this program includes investigating the effects of swimming on health outcomes (i.e.,
      fitness, BMI) of children with ASD. SSS lessons are provided in eight week sessions six times
      per year. Lessons are individualized according to the child's sensory preferences (as
      measured by the Sensory Profile). Instructors use evidence-based teaching methods (i.e.,
      visual supports, demonstration, peer and video modelling, sensory modifications) to teach
      swimming and water safety skills. Children may enroll for as many sessions as desired.
      Research includes retrospective review of program records.
