    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to examine the feasibility and acceptability of and patient
      adherence to a telephone-administered cognitive-behavioral therapy intervention for anxiety
      in older adults (65 years and older) with cancer and their primary informal caregiver. This
      study will also examine whether the intervention has a clinically significant impact on
      patient anxiety (primary outcome) and depression, distress, and quality of life (secondary
      outcomes).

      This study is a single arm pre-post evaluation of a six-session telephone-administered
      cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) intervention for anxiety in older adults with cancer and
      their primary informal (unpaid) caregiver. The primary purposes of this study are to evaluate
      the feasibility of the intervention and study procedures, acceptability of the intervention
      to older adults with cancer and their primary informal caregiver, and patient and caregiver
      adherence to the intervention. The secondary purpose is to examine changes in patient and
      caregiver anxiety, depression, distress, and quality of life pre to post intervention to
      determine whether the intervention has a clinically significant impact on these outcomes.
      Anxiety is the primary outcome; depression, distress, and quality of life are secondary
      outcomes. Patients will be 65 years of age or older and will be recruited from the myeloma,
      lung, lymphoma, gynecologic, and gastrointestinal cancer clinics at a single institution.
      Study measures will be administered by telephone prior to initiating the intervention
      (pre-intervention) and following intervention completion (post-intervention).

    <description>Older adults with cancer and their primary informal caregiver will receive a six-session cognitive-behavior therapy intervention administered over the telephone by a trained study interventionist. The intervention is administered weekly and each session is 45-50 minutes in length. Patients and caregivers will receive the intervention independently and from separate therapists.</description>

    <description>The intervention consists of six telephone-administered sessions. Session topics include psychoeducation on anxiety, behavioral strategies for managing anxiety, cognitive restructuring, communication skills training, acceptance techniques (patient only), problem-solving strategies (caregiver only), and planning for future anxiety. Session content is tailored for older adults and caregivers of older adults with cancer.</description>
