      This study sought to comprehend the relationship between syncope and dental related therapy.
      If the relationship between dental related therapies and syncope is proved, clinical dentists
      will be remained to monitor changes of patient's blood pressure during root canal procedure.

      This study sought to comprehend the relationship between syncope and dental related therapy.
      If the relationship between dental related therapies and syncope is proved, clinical dentists
      will be remained to monitor changes of patient's blood pressure during root canal procedure.

      Previous Trigemino-Cardiac Reflex(TCR) related studies reported that stimulation of
      trigeminal nerve induces trigeminal nerve reflection, and then causes blood pressure rapidly
      decreasing. Finally, sudden blood pressure decreasing results in syncope. Clinical data has
      been collected and analyzed in the past four months, and the primary results showed
      significantly difference. This phenomenon may be probably observed in other dental
      treatments. Hence, the objective of this study is to remind clinical dentists to monitor
      patients' physical conditions when conducting root canal relevant treatments and to avoid
      situations such as syncope, and reduce medical disputes and benefit dentists and patient as a
      result. In the recent year, syncope often occurs during denture procedures. The value of this
      study will inform clinical dentist to notice risk of dental relative treatments. In addition,
      it will improve patients' safety.

        Investigators collected data from adult patients who agreed to participate in the study and
        accepted relevant treatments including filling, extraction, scaling, implant, and crown
        bridge preparation (no more than 500 patients in each treatment item) before September
        2016. Previous studies shows that TCR is more often happen in young patients. Therefore, to
        avoid ethical issue, adult patients are more suitable in this study.
