  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common heart rhythm disease characterized by an
      irregular heart rhythm of the top part (atria) of the heart. It may cause unpleasant symptoms
      as well as increases the person's risk of stroke and heart failure. With an ageing
      population, increasing rates of AF and limited access to specialists, new methods of care,
      like nurse practitioners (NP) need to be assessed to meet patient specific needs and provide
      sustainable care.

      The objective of the project is to evaluate the effect of Nurse Practitioner-led care in
      people with AF on their quality of life.

      The Canadian Healthcare system is overwhelmed, with increasing costs and wait times.
      Contributing to these issues, is AF is the most common arrhythmia accompanied with costly
      complications including stroke and heart failure. Currently family or emergency room
      physicians ask general cardiologists or specialized cardiologists, to provide care to
      patients with AF. Unfortunately, there is limited access to their services. NP's are nurses
      who have taken extra education at University to treat patients and prescribe medications.
      This research project involves an NP who has specialized training in AF patient management.

      By utilizing an NP to provide care for patients with AF, the investigators hope to improve
      patient's quality of life and satisfaction with care. This may also reduce complications of
      AF.

    <description>Nurse Practitioner (NP) Intervention Initial Visit and Interventions: An experienced nurse practitioner with extra atrial fibrillation (AF) management training will complete the initial assessment to determine a treatment plan based on current AF Guidelines. The NP will provide patient education on AF management.
Follow-up: Follow-up will occur at 3 and 6 months from baseline to evaluate the patient's response to treatment and will be modified as required based on AF symptoms, testing results and physical assessment.
A physician will be consulted for advanced specialty AF management or if a patient requires admission to hospital.</description>

Follow-up: As per the cardiologist's usual practice. The patient's care will remain with the family physician if no follow-up is required.
Follow-up: Follow-up will be determined as per the cardiologist's usual practice. If a follow-up appointment is required it will done in the cardiologist's own independent clinic. The patient's care will be referred back to the family physician if no follow-up is required.</description>
