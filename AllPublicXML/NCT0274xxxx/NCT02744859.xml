      Investigators will run a field study evaluating the impact different labels have on the
      purchasing of sugar sweetened beverages. This field study will take place in a hospital
      cafeteria.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In a hospital cafeteria investigators will label all sugar sweetened beverages to evaluate
      their impact on purchasing.

      Investigators will collect baseline data for two weeks on beverage sales at the hospital
      cafe. Following this data collection investigators will introduce a calorie label which reads
      &quot;Each beverage contains [lower calorie bound]-[upper calorie bound] calories per container.
      2,000 calories a day is used for general nutrition advice but calorie needs vary.&quot; These
      signs will be posted for two weeks and investigators will collect sales data. Following this
      intervention investigators will remove the signs and collect sales data for two weeks. At the
      end of this no label period, investigators will introduce the second intervention, a warning
      label. This label will read &quot;WARNING: Drinking beverages with added sugar(s) contributes to
      obesity, diabetes, and tooth decay.&quot; This label will also be posted for two weeks and
      investigators will collect sales data. Investigators will then remove these signs and collect
      sales data for two weeks. Finally, investigators will introduce the third intervention: a
      warning label with graphic labels. This label will read &quot;WARNING: Drinking beverages with
      added sugar(s) contributes to obesity, diabetes and tooth decay.&quot; However this sign will also
      include a visual depiction of each health consequence. Investigators will collect sales data
      for this two week period. After this intervention investigators will collect sales data for
      an additional two weeks and then administer a brief survey to cafeteria customers to better
      understand their impressions of the labels.
