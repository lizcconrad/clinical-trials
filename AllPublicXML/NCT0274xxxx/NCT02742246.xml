    <textblock>
      Evaluate the efficacy of CBT4CBT and clinician-delivered CBT relative to standard treatment
      for reducing alcohol use through an 8-week randomized trial with 6-month follow-up. Our
      primary hypothesis is that either form of CBT will be more effective than standard treatment
      at increasing the percentage of days abstinent during treatment (8 weeks) and through the
      follow-up (6 months), assessed via Timeline FollowBack interviews.

    <description>This is the regular treatment a participant would normally receive at the clinic and generally includes individual and/or group therapy sessions and regular urine monitoring. Sessions will generally last for 1 hour one time per week for 8 weeks and include issues such as teaching about the treatment program, teaching important ideas about recovery, increasing knowledge about specific problems participants may have with addiction and/or demonstrating new ways of coping with skills designed to fit their lifestyle. Participants will also be asked to complete a brief questionnaire and to provide urine and breath specimens for alcohol and drug testing once each week.</description>

    <description>This is individual treatment provided by a trained Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) clinician who will focus on teaching skills to understand and change participants behaviors to help them avoid alcohol use. Sessions with the clinician will generally last for 1 hour one time per week for 8 weeks. Participants will also be asked to complete a brief questionnaire and to provide urine and breath specimens for alcohol and drug testing once each week.</description>

    <arm_group_label>CBT4CBT</arm_group_label>
    <arm_group_type>Experimental</arm_group_type>
    <description>In this treatment participants will work with a computerized program that teaches skills for stopping alcohol use and increasing coping skills, such as how to understand patterns of alcohol use, how to cope with cravings for alcohol, how to refuse offers of alcohol, and so on. The CBT4CBT program will cover the same skills as the individual clinician-provided CBT, only here it will be done by a computer. Participants will be taught how to use the computer program by a staff member and will be asked to spend about 8 hours using the program (approximately one hour per week) at the clinic.Participants will also be asked to complete a brief questionnaire and to provide urine and breath specimens for alcohol and drug testing once each week.</description>

             alcohol use disorder, consuming at least 14/7 drinks (men/women) per week with at
             least 4 heavy drinking days reported in the past 28 days,

          -  Are sufficiently stable for 8 weeks of outpatient treatment and can commit to a
             6-month follow-up

          -  Are willing to provide locator information for follow-up, and

          -  Are fluent in English and have a 6th grade or higher reading level.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Individuals will be excluded who:

          -  Have an untreated bipolar or schizophrenic disorder,

          -  Have a current legal case pending such that incarceration during the 8-week protocol
             is likely,

             the past two weeks, or

             medical detoxification is necessary for safety purposes (individuals demonstrating
             significant withdrawal symptoms would be eligible for re-screening following brief
             medical detoxification, which is arranged by RCS staff at triage).
