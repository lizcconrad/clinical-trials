  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sports medical experts recommend considerable amounts of regular physical activity in order
      to improve strength, motor control, endurance and flexibility. However, only a small share of
      the population is able to meets the corresponding international guidelines. One reason for
      this is supposed to consist in private scheduling problems and the high time expenditure.
      Against this background, high-intensity intermittent training methods with short durations
      have become popular.

      The present study aims to evaluate the effectivity of a high -intensity functional circuit
      training (the FIT15 program) in improving body function.

      Thirty healthy individuals will be included in the randomized, controlled two-armed parallel
      group trial. In the intervention group, the participants will perform the FIT15 program, a
      group-based high-intensity circuit training based on functional movement patterns (e.g.
      squats, push-ups, burpees, jumps, rope-skipping). The training will be carried out three
      times a week, each 15 minutes for a total of six weeks. In the control group, the
      participants will exercise three times a week (in total for six weeks) at moderate intensity
      on an ergometer according to the cardiopulmonary exercise guidelines of the American College
      of Sports Medicine. Outcomes assess prior and following the six-week training period
      encompass body fat and muscle mass (bio impedance analysis), aerobic exercise capacity
      (spirometric exercise testing including lactate analysis), postural control (force plate),
      maximum strength of the leg extensors and shoulder muscles (1 repetition maximum) and
      psychometric variables (e.g. physical activity readiness questionnaire).
