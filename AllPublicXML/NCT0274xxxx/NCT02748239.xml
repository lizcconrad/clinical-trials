  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A new diabetes education program for the initiation of non-intensive insulin therapy in type
      2 diabetic patients (MEDIAS 2 CT) was developed.

      In the evaluation, this new developed program is compared with an education programs which is
      currently used for diabetes education. It is expected that the new developed program (MEDIAS
      2 CT) can demonstrate non-inferiority with regard to the main outcome variable glycemic
      control. If non-inferiority can be demonstrated superiority of this program will be tested.

      The MEDIAS 2 CT program is based on a self-management/empowerment approach. It is conducted
      as a group program comprising 6 lessons of 90 minutes each. MEDIAS 2 CT was designed to help
      patients perform conventional insulin therapy. In addition, MEDIAS 2 CT focused on
      controlling metabolic risk factors (elevated lipids and blood pressure), coping with the risk
      of late complications, and reducing the emotional burden of diabetes and its treatment.

      The active comparator condition (ACC-CT) consisted of an established patient education
      program for type 2 diabetic patients with conventional insulin treatment. This education
      program was developed in the 1980s and 1990s and is more didactic-oriented, focusing
      primarily on the acquisition of knowledge, skills, and information about the correct
      treatment of diabetes. Both treatment arms (MEDIAS 2 CT and ACC) consisted of 6 lessons,
      which were conducted as group sessions.
