      It is suspected that zika virus infection during pregnancy is associated with microcephaly.
      The objective of this study is to investigate the occurrence of rash accompanied by three or
      more dengue-like signs and symptoms during pregnancy is related to the microcephaly using the
      case-control design.

      The investigators will carry out a case-control study among mothers who delivered their
      babies at Nossa Senhora de Lourdes maternity hospital located in Aracaju, state of Sergipe,
      Brazil from September 1, 2015 through January 5, 2016. Data sources for the phase I of the
      study will consist of medical records review and a standard questionnaire applied by
      telephone to collect information about demographic features, clinical signs and symptoms, and
      the duration and severity of the illness. Phase II will include dengue, chikungunya and
      dengue serologic test results as secondary outcome, if available. The objective of this study
      is to investigate the occurrence of rash accompanied by three or more dengue-like signs and
      symptoms during pregnancy is related to the microcephaly using the case-control design
