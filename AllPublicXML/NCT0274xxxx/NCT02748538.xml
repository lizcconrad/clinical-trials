      A randomised controlled trial to evaluate the effect of face-down posturing on retinal
      displacement and distortion following retinal detachment repair.

      During the surgical repair of a retina detachment, a gas bubble is inserted into the eye to
      keep the retina flat. Following this, it is common to ask patients to adopt a certain head
      position for a set period of time after their operation. This is known as posturing. It is
      thought that by adopting a certain head position/posturing, the bubble aids re-attachment of
      the retina. However, when the retinal detachment involves the macula (central portion of the
      retina) it has been shown that the retina can shift (or displace) post-operatively, leading
      to distortion in the patient's vision.

      The purpose of this study is to investigate whether adopting different head positions
      following surgery for macula involving retinal detachments, can reduce retinal displacement
      and visual distortion. The investigators plan to recruit 368 patients. Patients will be in
      follow up for a period of six months. The study will be operational at two different
      hospitals in the United Kingdom.
