  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study examined how wearing a fat suit might lead individuals to experience the negative
      effects of weight based stigmatization, including psychological, behavioral, and
      physiological consequences. It also aimed to test using the fat suit as a possible
      intervention tactic to reduce weight stigma.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this study was to understand how embodying a stigmatized domain might elicit the
      same consequences investigators see in victims of weight stigma. Participants were randomly
      assigned to either manipulate their weight through wearing a fat suit prosthesis or to a
      control condition where they wore the same clothing that was on the fat suit but in their own
      size. Outcome variables were cortisol reactivity, psychological well-being, and food and
      drink consumption. Additionally, this study tested whether wearing the fat suit might serve
      as an effective weight stigma reduction effort.
