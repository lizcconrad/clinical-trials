    <textblock>
      In this study, the risk of opioid medications on coronary heart disease in adults is
      investigated. Patients with the necessity of a coronary angiography and control patients with
      a non-cardiac disease of the same hospital are inquired with a standardized questionnaire
      about demographic and clinical risk factors for heart attack. An impact of opioid medications
      on coronary heart disease is hypothesised (MIOP).

      In addition, all patients with coronary angiography should be consulted twice (after 3 and 6
      months) to find out how many of these patients have developed a refractory angina pectoris
      (TRAPS).
