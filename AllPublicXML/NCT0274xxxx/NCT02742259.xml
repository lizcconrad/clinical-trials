  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Prostate Cancer Assay performance of Celsee Diagnostics circulating tumor cell (CTC)
      analysis system will be validated in patients diagnosed with metastatic prostate cancer. It
      will demonstrate substantial performance equivalency to a CTC Assay predicate device.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  • Male aged 18 years and above

               -  Be willing to sign an informed consent document indicating that the subject
                  understands the purpose of and procedures required for the study and are willing
                  to participate in the study

               -  Be willing/able to adhere to the prohibitions and restrictions specified in this
                  protocol

               -  Eastern cooperative group (ECOG) performance status ≤2

               -  Documented histologically confirmed adenocarcinoma of the prostate

               -  Metastatic prostate cancer to the bone as documented by positive bone scan
                  imaging

               -  CRPC patient being considered for systemic therapy or in between lines of
                  therapies (&gt;= 14 days from prior treatment) for metastatic disease. Patient must
                  have evidence of castrate resistant prostate cancer as evidenced by a confirmed
                  rising PSA (per Prostate Cancer Working Group 2 [PCWG2] criteria) and a castrate
                  serum testosterone level (i.e. ≤ 50 mg/dl).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  • Subjects actively receiving systemic therapy regimens, or between lines of therapies
             (&lt; 14 days from prior treatment)

               -  Have any condition that, in the opinion of the investigator, would compromise the
                  wellbeing of the subject or the study or prevent the subject from meeting or
                  performing study requirements

               -  Active infection or other medical condition that would make corticosteroids (i.e.
                  prednisone) use contraindicated

               -  Uncontrolled hypertension (systolic BP ≥ 160 mmHg or diastolic BP ≥ 95 mmHg)
                  Patients with a history of hypertension are allowed provided blood pressure is
                  controlled by antihypertensive treatment

               -  Severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class C)

               -  History of pituitary or adrenal dysfunction (note: the use of daily steroids does
                  not exclude someone from participating in this study)

               -  Have poorly controlled diabetes (HgB A1C ≥ 8%)

               -  Any psychological, familial, sociological, or geographical condition that could
                  potentially interfere with compliance with the study protocol and follow-up
                  schedule.

               -  Abnormal bone marrow function (absolute neutrophil count [ANC] &lt; 1500/mm3,
                  platelet count &lt;100,000/mm3, hemoglobin &lt;9 g/dL)

               -  Abnormal liver function (bilirubin &gt; upper limit of normal [ULN]; AST and/or ALT
                  &gt; 1.5 x ULN concomitant with alkaline phosphatase &gt; 2.5 x ULN)

               -  Abnormal kidney function (serum creatinine ≥ 2 x upper limit of normal)

               -  Clinically significant heart disease as evidenced by myocardial infarction, or
                  arterial thrombotic events in the past 6 months, severe or unstable angina,
                  unstable atrial fibrillation, or New York Heart Association (NYHA) Class III-IV
                  heart disease

               -  History of ventricular tachyarrhythmia within the past 5 years
