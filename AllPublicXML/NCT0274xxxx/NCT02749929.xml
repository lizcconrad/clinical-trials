  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Approximately 15,000 persons in Norway suffer from a wrist fractures during a year, making it
      the most prevalent fracture in this country. Treated conservatively, a cast is used for 4-6
      weeks before removal. After discontinuation of the cast, physiotherapy is implemented to aid
      in improving range of motion and regaining function of the injured wrist. The pain after
      injury can affect the patient to a greater or lesser extent, and it is common to prescribe
      sick leave for shorter amounts of time after the injury.

      Studies suggest that a physiotherapy intervention with Low Level Laser therapy (LLLT) may
      reduce pain and swelling after acute trauma, and potentially promote healing. The aim of this
      study is to evaluate the effect of LLLT on pain and function at 2, 4, 8 and 26 weeks after
      injury.

      Patients with wrist fractures are recruited from Bergen Municipal Emergency Ward, where they
      are randomly divided into two groups with concealed allocation. The fracture is immobilized
      with a cast of paris, with a small opening where Low Level Laser therapy can be administered
      in skin contact. The patients will receive treatment 3 times a week, for 3 weeks. After
      discontinuation of the cast, the patients swelling, pain, grip strength and function of the
      wrist is measured. The patients will meet for follow-up controls until 26 weeks after injury.

    <description>After inclusion in the study, a small window of approximately 1 cm2 opening will be made in the cast in order for the laser to make skin contact. The laser is a super pulsed infrared laser with a wavelength of 904 nm, belonging to laser class 3B. The light from the laser is not visible to the eye, and will not give any perceptible stimulus.
Low-Level Laser therapy (LLLT) will be given according to the recommended dosage from World Association of Laser Therapy (WALT). A LLLT dose of 3.6 Joules will be administered at two points over the fracture site.</description>

    <description>After inclusion in the study, a small window of approximately 1 cm2 opening will be made in the cast in order for the placebo laser to make skin contact. The placebo laser is identical in apperance to a super pulsed infrared laser with a wavelength of 904 nm, belonging to laser class 3B. Since the light from the laser is invisible, neither the participant nor the therapist will know whether the laser is a placebo. The treatment time and number of treated points will be identical to group 1.</description>
