    <textblock>
      In the present study, 62 healthy male participants participated in the double-blind,
      placebo-controlled experiment. Investigators aimed to test the idea that whether oxytocin
      would modulate subjective responses during receiving various social reward and social
      punishment about the future outcomes of pursuing personal goals.

    <measure>Rating of Encouragement after receiving specific social feedback</measure>
    <time_frame>one hour</time_frame>
    <description>There're 96 different social feedback totally for four goals which were divided into four runs consisting of 24 different feedback separately for each goal video.Therefore,subjects were instructed to complete the encouragement rating after receiving each specific feedback. To measure the rating,the investigators used the 9-point likert scale in which one refers to the minimum encouragement while nine refers to maximum encouragement.</description>

    <measure>Rating of Confidence after receiving a series of social feedback</measure>
    <time_frame>one hour</time_frame>
    <description>There're 96 social feedback totally for four goals which were divided into four runs consisting of 24 feedback separately for each goal video.Furthermore, these 24 feedback were categorized into three types which include 8 feedback separately.Therefore,subjects were instructed to complete the confidence rating after receiving these 8 feedback together. To measure the rating, the investigators used the 9-point likert scale in which one refers to the minimum confidence while nine refers to maximum confidence.</description>
