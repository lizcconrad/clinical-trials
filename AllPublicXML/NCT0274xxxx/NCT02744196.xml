  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The mail goal of this study is to establish superiority in efficacy of Acellbia® applied in a
      dose of 600 mg (Day 1 and Day 15) in combination with methotrexate in patients with active RA
      seropositive previously untreated with biological therapy, compared to standard therapy with
      methotrexate.

    <description>106 patients of this group will receive methotrexate in combination with a drug Acellbia to be used at a dose of 600 mg as a slow intravenous infusion carried out on day 1 and day 15.
If a follow-up examination at 24 weeks or later (up to 48 weeks) reveals that the patient still has active arthritis (evaluation index DAS28-4 (ESR)&gt; 2,6 points), the therapy with Acellbia is repeated by the same scheme - 2 infusion at a dose of 600 mg at intervals of 14 days.</description>

If a follow-up examination at 24 weeks or later (up to 48 weeks) reveals that the patient still has active arthritis (evaluation index DAS28-4 (ESR)&gt; 2,6 points), the patient receives open therapy with Acellbia is initiated: 2 infusion at a dose of 600 mg at intervals of 14 days.</description>
