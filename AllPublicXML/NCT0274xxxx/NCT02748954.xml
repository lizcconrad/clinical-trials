      The main goal of this study was to compare the effect of a one-session unsupported Internet
      intervention on participants' clinical symptoms (depressive and anxiety symptoms) and related
      variables (mood, confidence and motivation).

      Method: A total of 765 adults residing in the United States took part in a randomized
      controlled trial. Participants were randomly assigned to one of five brief plain text
      interventions lasting five to ten minutes. The interventions designed to address depressive
      symptoms were: Thoughts (increasing helpful thoughts), Activities (increasing activity
      level), Sleep Hygiene, Assertiveness (increasing assertiveness awareness), Own Methods
      (utilizing methods that were previously successful). They were followed-up one week after
      consenting.
