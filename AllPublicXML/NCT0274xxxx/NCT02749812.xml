  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators propose a multicentric controlled randomized trial whose goal is to
      evaluate the possibility of a prediction of the efficiency of APAP (automatic continuous
      positive airway pressure) and constant CPAP (constant positive airway pressure) in 800 severe
      obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) patients according to their profile of pressure
      variability.

    <textblock>
      Multicenter open randomized clinical trial involving 800 patients with severe OSAS. After
      inclusion in the study, the patients will be proposed to initiate CPAP at home (ResMed S9 or
      PHILIPS PR1) using systematically an APAP mode between wide range of pressure variations (4
      to 20 cm H2O) during the first 7day-period of time. After this first period of treatment, an
      analysis of the report will be released from the APAP in order evaluate the residual AHI, the
      duration of CPAP use and the amount of leaks in order to confirm CPAP efficiency and
      observance. Pressure parameters (efficient pressure and variability) will be collected. After
      randomization according to the further mode of ventilation to use (APAP vs constant CPAP),
      the patients will be treated at home for 3 months. In the constant CPAP group, efficient
      pressure will be determined as the P95 (ResMed) or the P90 (PHILIPS) as recommended by the
      manufacturers, while in the APAP group, the patients will be treated within the same range of
      pressure variations than during the first 7 day-period. Clinical and polygraphic evaluation
      will be done after 3 months of treatment, using the combined criteria previously described.
      In each group, results will be considered according to the efficient pressure value and its
      variability that were evaluated at the end of the first 7 day-period of treatment

    <description>The main objective of this study is to evaluate the ability to predict the mode of CPAP to use (APAP vs constant CPAP) in the treatment of OSAS patients, according to their own level of efficient pressure and its variability obtained on CPAP report after the first 7 days of use in an initial and systematic APAP mode. This prediction will be evaluated by using the association of the residual AHI value under CPAP and the Epworth score value obtained after 3 months of treatment, in each group of CPAP mode (constant vs APAP) used during the study. This combined criteria will be used according an ordinal scale with six levels of severity. It will be evaluated in each group (constant CPAP vs APAP) according to the level of P90 or P95 and the degree of pressure variability obtained during the first 7 day-period of use.</description>
