  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the research is to determine if participants who take &quot;Crave Crush&quot; will
      report lower cravings and palatability ratings of candy as compared to subjects who receive
      the placebo. Participants are self-selected university students who pass our table and
      verbally agree to participate in a research study about taste preferences. Data will be
      recorded anonymously.

      When students approach the table, research assistants will ask them to choose their favorite
      kind of candy from an assortment. They will ask the subjects to rate their craving for the
      candy before they taste it. After they try the candy, the research assistants will ask them
      to rate its palatability. Then they will rate their craving for another piece of candy. A
      research assistant will flip a coin to determine whether the subject will receive Crave Crush
      or placebo. While the Crave Crush or placebo is dissolving in the mouth, the students will
      fill out a short questionnaire with an identification number. The questionnaire will ask for
      their age, gender, ethnicity, approximate height and weight, and a few questions about their
      dietary habits.

      After the tablet dissolves, research assistants will ask the students to rate their craving
      for another piece of candy. Research assistants will ask participants if they would like
      another piece of candy and have them assess palatability again. The process of offering a
      piece of candy and asking subjects to rate palatability will occur up to five times. Finally,
      subjects will be asked if they would like to take a few pieces of candy for the road and if
      they say yes, the number of pieces they take with them will be noted. The study activities
      should last no more than 5-10 minutes per participant.
