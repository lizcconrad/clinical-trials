      Prospective observational study to assess bone predictive biomarkers for TKI response in RCC
      patients with bone metastasis and HRQoL with TKI in these patients as well as the sensitivity
      and specificity of whole body magnetic resonance versus bone scintigraphy and versus CT in
      the assessment of metastatic lesions at bone level and at other sites.

      Prospective observational study to assess:

        -  Bone predictive biomarkers for tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) response in renal cell
           carcinoma (RCC) patients with bone metastasis - Health Related Quality of Life (HRQoL)
           with TKI

        -  Comparison of the sensitivity and specificity of whole body magnetic resonance versus
           bone scintigraphy and versus Computerized tomography (CT) in the assessment of
           metastatic lesions at bone level and at other sites.
