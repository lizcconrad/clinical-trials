  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      At least 40% of the patients with prostate cancer (PC) present with positive lymph nodes
      (N1). The optimal treatment strategy for these patients remains controversial. Although
      androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) is still often initiated as only treatment, the results
      are disappointing. Recent studies support the use of more aggressive therapies including
      external beam radiotherapy (EBRT) and ADT. The retrospective studies supporting the
      additional use of EBRT in N1 PC patients are however not conclusive regarding to the extent
      of radiation field.

      Even after an EPLND, there might be a role for pelvic EBRT in irradicating microscopic
      disease. However pelvic irradiation irrevocably results in increased toxicity. Moreover, in
      node negative (N0) PC patients the addition of pelvic EBRT has not resulted in improved
      outcome in randomised trials. However in the setting of Tumor Node Metastasis pathological
      stage (p)N1, proven on pathological examination, PC patients this has never been evaluated so
      far. This trial aims to answer the question whether or not pelvic EBRT is beneficial in
      pathological N1 PC patients. It is also important to realise that not all pathological N1 PC
      patients have similar outcome. There is a significant impact of number of positive lymph
      nodes on outcome, with two positive nodes being suggested as a significant cut-off value in
      predicting survival in pathological N1 PC patients. By stratifying the patients according to
      the number of lymph nodes involved this study will add to the proper selection of those
      patients who will benefit most of pelvic EBRT and avoid toxicity in patients who have no
      benefit of pelvic EBRT.

      Additionally, small RNAs constitute potentially valuable markers for the diagnosis,
      prognosis, and therapeutic choices in PC patients. Blood samples will be collected to examine
      the potential role of miRNAs as a biomarker and to develop a prognostic signature for
      clinical relapse-free survival.

      The results of this trial will serve as a base for developping new trials in order to
      optimise the treatment of patients with pathological N1 PC.

      In an era with increasing evidence in favour of an aggressive local treatment, where an
      extended pelvic lymph node dissection (EPLND) is more frequently performed and with data
      supporting the potential role for external beam radiotherapy (EBRT) in pelvic node positive
      (N1) prostate cancer (PC), the treatment of N1 PC patients needs to be revised. Seen the lack
      of clear guidelines regarding the extent of radiation field in N1 prostate cancer patients,
      there is an urgent need for studies evaluating the place of pelvic EBRT.

      The aim of this trial is thus to evaluate if pelvic irradiation has an impact on clinical
      relapse free survival in pathological N1 PC.

      The hypothesis is that performing a pelvic EBRT after EPLND in pathological N1 PC patients
      results in a significant improved clinical relapse free survival with 15% when compared to
      prostate only EBRT.

      This will be evaluated in a multicentre Phase III stratified randomised trial randomising
      patients with PC and 1-4 positive lymph nodes on EPLND between prostate(bed) only
      radiotherapy + 2 years of ADT or pelvic radiotherapy + 2 years of androgen deprivation. A
      total of 330 patients will be enrolled in this trial. Stratification is based on the number
      of positive lymph nodes since patients with increased number of positive lymph nodes exhibit
      a poorer prognosis.
