    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, non-randomized, single center clinical trial to assess neointimal
      coverage on the stent or scaffold strut and apposition of SYNERGY™ and ABSORB in minimum of
      12 eligible human subject at 4 month and 12 month after stent or scaffold implantation using
      OCT and CAS
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All of the subject will received SYNERGY™ stent in one of the blocked coronary artery and
      ABSORB scaffold strut in the other artery. All subjects must have 2 coronary arteries
      stenosis of more than 70%.
