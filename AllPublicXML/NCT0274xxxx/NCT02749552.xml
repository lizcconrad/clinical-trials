  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Obesity is a prevalent, destructive, and costly chronic disease. In 2008, 37% of Canadian
      adults were measured as overweight, and 25% as obese. Obesity is a risk factor for a number
      of serious health problems, including type 2 diabetes, asthma, gallbladder disease,
      osteoarthritis, chronic back pain, several types of cancers (i.e., colorectal, kidney,
      breast, endometrial, ovarian and pancreatic cancers) and cardiovascular disease (i.e.,
      hypertension, stroke, congestive heart failure and coronary artery disease). In 2008, it was
      estimated that the annual economic burden of obesity in Canada was $4.6 billion. Given the
      economic strain and widespread health risks of obesity, there is a clear need to provide
      effective interventions for obesity.

      The purpose of the proposed study is to examine the role of ACT-based interventions in
      long-term weight maintenance. The proposed study will examine the role of value consistent
      behaviour, acceptance skills, and mindfulness skills in promoting long-term weight-related
      health behaviours. Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) is an empirically supported
      psychological intervention that emphasizes value consistent behaviours, acceptance skills and
      mindfulness skills.

      Participants will be recruited from the weight loss surgery waitlist and randomly assigned to
      a brief (5 sessions) ACT intervention or to waitlist control group. A mobile app will be used
      to encourage daily ACT skill practice and track health behaviours over time. The primary
      objective of the proposed project is to test whether a brief ACT intervention can result in
      sustained weight management (at 6 months and 1 year) compared to a waitlist control group. If
      this brief format of ACT intervention for obesity proves to be effective in encouraging
      health behaviours and weight loss, it may provide a low cost, sustainable option to enhance
      much needed obesity management services in Nova Scotia.
