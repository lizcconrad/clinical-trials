  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study adds an experimental treatment with another type of cells, called dendritic cells.
      It is hoped that these cells may stimulate the immune system to react against neuroblastoma
      in much the same way that vaccines cause the immune system to react to certain viruses and
      bacteria. The physicians conducting this study have observed from previous research that
      neuroblastoma cells can be recognized by the immune system, and that they can be destroyed by
      immune cells.The main goal of this study is to see if giving participants this additional
      anti-Neuroblastoma vaccine reduces the risk of relapse following the Hematopoietic Stem Cell
      Transplant.

      All patients who are enrolled in this study will receive all treatment at All Children's
      Hospital which is located at 501 6th Ave South, St. Petersburg, FL 33701. This includes
      autologous cell donation by apheresis, high dose cytotoxic therapy conditioning for
      autologous HPC transplant, post-transplant follow-up care, and all administration of
      dendritic cell vaccines and blood draws for post therapy immunological monitoring.

      All preparation of cellular products, including hematopoietic progenitor cell products for
      autologous transplantation, and dendritic cell vaccine products, will be carried out in the
      Cell Therapy Facility located within the Moffitt Cancer Center, which is located at 12902
      Magnolia Drive, Tampa, FL 33612.

    <description>The feasibility of manufacturing both a hematopoietic progenitor cell graft and multiple tumor lysate pulsed dendritic cell vaccine treatments from the same starting apheresis product, culminating in delivery of the vaccines in the immediate period following myeloablative therapy and autologous hematopoietic progenitor cell transplant period (autoHPCT). For what fraction of eligible patients can sufficient tumor cell lysate and dendritic cells, necessary for the production of the dendritic cell vaccines, be obtained? From what fraction would it be possible to make additional vaccines?</description>

    <description>Whether a discernable anti-tumor effect resulting from autoHPCT therapy combined with dendritic cell vaccine therapy can be detected, either through monitoring of the patient's immune system for evidence of tumor specific immunity, or by monitoring for measureable clinical responses.</description>

    <description>Autologous Hematopoietic Progenitor Cell (HPC) Transplant (HPCT). Blood stem cells will be collected by apheresis during the induction phase as part of standard treatment. During apheresis, the participant's blood is collected into a machine that filters out the stem cells and the filtered blood is returned to their body. The stem cells will be separated by the type of protein within the cells. Only the stem cells with a protein called CD34 will be used for the stem cell transplant.</description>
