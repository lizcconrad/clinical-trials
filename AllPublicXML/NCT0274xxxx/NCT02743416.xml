    <textblock>
      The STROKESTOP II study is a proposed study to determine if the biomarker NT-proBNP together
      with single-lead ECG can be used as a primary population screening tool for silent atrial
      fibrillation, and builds on previous results from the STROKESTOP study.

    <time_frame>Five years</time_frame>
    <description>With the same statistical methods used in STROKESTOP I, the number of fewer years with undetected AF will be calculated as well as the number of avoided strokes, the number of life-years and the number of quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) per 1000 screened patients. The result will be reported as the incremental cost per gained QALY and per avoided stroke.</description>

    <measure>Biomarkers within coagulation, inflammation and cardiomyocyte stress will be analysed with Proseek® Multiplex CVD II96x96 &amp; Proseek® Multiplex CVD III96x96 immunoassays, in order to identify the best discriminator for silent AF on population level.</measure>
    <time_frame>Five years</time_frame>
    <description>Proseek Multiplex CVD II96x96 is focused on low-abundance biomarkers and uses 1 µL of undiluted sample to measure 92 markers simultaneously.
Proseek Multiplex CVD III96x96 is focused on high-abundance biomarkers and uses 1 µL of a 1:100 dilution of each sample to measure 92 markers simultaneously.</description>

        Individuals aged 75/76 residing in Stockholm will be identified using their 10-digit
        personal identification number. All identified subjects will be randomized in a 1:1 fashion
        to be invited to screening for AF or to serve as a control group.

        Participants with a prior diagnosis of AF will be asked if they are on treatment with
        anticoagulants. If they are not, a referral to cardiologist will be made to ensure
        appropriate treatment.

        Individuals without known AF will have blood samples drawn and analysed with regard to
        NT-proBNP using point of care analysis.

        All individuals with NT-proBNP&gt; 125 ng/L and without known AF will be taught to undergo
        intermittent ECG recordings twice daily for two weeks (High-risk Group). Individuals with a
        NT-proBNP&lt;125 ng/L will do one initial 1-lead ECG, and if normal not undergo further ECG
        screening (low-risk Group).
