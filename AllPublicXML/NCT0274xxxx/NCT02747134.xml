    <textblock>
      In the present study researchers aim to investigate the effectiveness of an intervention
      combining emotion regulation and mindfulness skills in a single 10-week program. A total of
      75 individuals with major depressive disorder (MDD) diagnosis in complete or partial
      remission participated in this randomized controlled trial (RCT) comparing an intervention
      including emotion regulation and mindfulness skills (ER+M) with a psychoeducative program.
      After treatment, participants were followed for a 1-year period. Researchers results indicate
      that ER+M was not more effective than the treatment used with the control group in preventing
      depression relapse. Participants allocated to the ER+M group showed a significant decrease on
      global psychiatric symptoms, whereas those in the control group did not. Further studies are
      needed in order to better determine the combined effects of mindfulness and behavioral
      activation.
