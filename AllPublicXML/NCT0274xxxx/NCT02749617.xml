    <textblock>
      This pilot study will investigate the impact of dexamethasone (DEX) on anti-Xa levels in
      participants taking apixaban 2.5 mg twice a day by mouth (PO BID). Investigators propose a
      prospective, cohort study of 24 participants with multiple myeloma, in whom a
      lenalidomide-dexamethasone (LEN-DEX)-based myeloma treatment regimen is indicated. Eligible
      participants will initiate thromboprophylaxis with apixaban prior to starting their
      DEX-containing regimen and continue until the end of cycle 3. Anti-Xa levels, D-Dimer and
      plasma drug concentration will be measured.

      This pilot study looks to investigate this potential interaction between apixaban and
      dexamethasone to see if it warrants further investigation in a larger study.

      The sample size of 24 provides 90% power to detect a primary outcome of ≥ 50% reduction in
      peak anti-Xa levels from baseline. Secondary outcomes include changes in plasma apixaban
      levels, D-dimer, and symptomatic venous thromboembolism (VTE) and bleeding during a 3-month
      treatment period.
