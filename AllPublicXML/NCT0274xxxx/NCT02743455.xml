      This study is a multi-center, double-blind, placebo-controlled, Phase I study to evaluate the
      safety, reactogenicity, tolerability, and immunogenicity of MVA-BN-YF in Flavivirus-naïve
      healthy male and non-pregnant female adult subjects. There are six dose groups in this study.
      Subjects who have never received a licensed or investigational smallpox vaccine will be
      randomized to Groups 1-5 and vaccine administration and follow-up will be conducted in a
      double-blinded fashion. Subjects who have previously received two, 1 x 108 TCID50 doses of
      MVA-BN between 19 and 45 days apart by SC or IM routes will be enrolled in Group 6 and will
      be dosed open-label. Since this is a first in human, phase I study, a sentinel cohort will be
      utilized. The first two subjects (1st sentinel group) one at each clinical site will be
      randomized to Group 2 or 3 and vaccinated with MVA-BN-YF with or without ISA 720. Subjects
      and study personnel will be blinded as to whether ISA 720 was administered.

      This study is a multi-center, double-blind, placebo-controlled, Phase I study to evaluate the
      safety, reactogenicity, tolerability, and immunogenicity of MVA-BN-YF in Flavivirus-naïve
      healthy male and non-pregnant female adult subjects. There are six dose groups in this study.
      Subjects who have never received a licensed or investigational smallpox vaccine will be
      randomized to Groups 1-5 and vaccine administration and follow-up will be conducted in a
      double-blinded fashion. Subjects who have previously received two, 1 x 108 TCID50 doses of
      MVA-BN between 19 and 45 days apart by SC or IM routes will be enrolled in Group 6 and will
      be dosed open-label. Since this is a first in human, phase I study, a sentinel cohort will be
      utilized. The first two subjects (1st sentinel group) one at each clinical site will be
      randomized to Group 2 or 3 and vaccinated with MVA-BN-YF with or without ISA 720. Subjects
      and study personnel will be blinded as to whether ISA 720 was administered. Subjects will be
      monitored for safety for one day, and if no pre-defined halting rule is met (Section 9.5.1)
      then two additional subjects (2nd sentinel group) one at each clinical site will be assigned
      to the group the previous subject was not assigned to. These subjects will be vaccinated and
      monitored as above. A total of 4 sentinel subjects will be vaccinated. Primary objectives are
      assessment of the safety, tolerability, and reactogenicity of MVA-BN-YF vaccine administered
      with or without ISA 720; comparison of the safety, tolerability, and reactogenicity of
      MVA-BN-YF vaccine administered with or without ISA 720 with YF-VAX and MVA-BN. Secondary
      objectives are: assessment of the immunogenicity against the MVA-BN backbone and Yellow Fever
      virus (YF) antigen insert of MVA-BN-YF with and without ISA 720 as assessed by kinetics of
      the immune responses, seroconversion rates, and peak Geometric Mean Titer (GMT); assessment
      of the impact of previous MVA-BN vaccination on peak immune responses to YF antigen in
      MVA-BN-YF; comparison of the peak immunogenicity against YF antigen of 1 or 2 doses of
      MVA-BN-YF with or without ISA 720 with YF-VAX; comparison of the peak immunogenicity against
      the MVA-BN backbone of 1 or 2 doses of MVA-BN-YF with or without ISA 720 with MVA-BN;
      assessment of durability of immune response to YF antigen and MVA-BN at 6 months after 2nd
      vaccination or placebo administration.

          4. Must be in good health on the basis of physical examination, vital signs, medical
             history, safety laboratories, and the investigator's clinical judgment. Safety
             laboratory normal ranges will be those used by the reference clinical lab.
             Protocol-specific criteria for individual subjects are listed in criteria #6 -The
             clinical laboratory evaluations that will be graded as laboratory AEs and be
             considered for the Study or Individual Halting Rules are those which are included in
             the laboratory toxicity grading scales (Section 9.2.3). -Vital signs must be in normal
             ranges as per Sections 9.2.2 and 9.2.3. If a subject has elevated systolic or
             diastolic blood pressure, subject may rest for 10 minutes in a quiet room and then the
             blood pressure may be retaken once.

             to be enrolled, a subject has to have received two 1 x 10^8 TCID50 doses of MVA-BN
             19-45 days apart SC or IM as part of participation in DMID vaccine trials 11-0021 or
             09-0002. First dose must have been administered no earlier than 2010.

             institutional upper limit of normal -If laboratory screening tests are out of range,
             repeat of screening tests is permitted once, provided there is an alternative

             in the study [from 28 days before the first vaccination until at least 60 days after
             the last vaccination]). Women of non-childbearing potential, defined as postmenopausal
             (any age with amenorrhea for = / &gt;12 months without other known or suspected cause for
             amenorrhea, or surgically sterile (hysterectomy, bilateral tubal ligation, obilateral
             oophorectomy, or successful Essure® placement (permanent, non-surgical, non-hormonal
             sterilization) with documented confirmation test at least 3 months after the
             procedure), are not required to use the birth control methods.

          9. Female subjects must agree to not donate eggs (ova, oocytes) from the start of
             screening onwards until at least 60 days after the last vaccination.

         10. Male subjects who have not had a vasectomy and is sexually active with a woman of
             childbearing potential must agree to use an acceptable measure of birth control from
             28 days prior to 1st vaccination until at least 60 days after the last vaccination.
             Acceptable methods of birth control include the following: - Abstinence (defined as
             refraining from heterosexual intercourse with a female partner of childbearing
             potential during participation in the study [from 28 days before the first vaccination
