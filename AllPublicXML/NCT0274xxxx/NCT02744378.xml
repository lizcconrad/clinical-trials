    <measure>The intensity of Pain</measure>
    <time_frame>Three weeks after the application of drugs</time_frame>
    <description>The intensity of pain was assessed using visual analog scale (VAS) - The patients were asked to score their intensity of pain using a VAS where the pain scores ranged from 0 (no pain) to 10 (extreme pain)
Four VAS was recorded one for spicy food and the other one for without spicy food for right side and left sides separately. The mean VAS was calculated for each side and the severity of pain was evaluated according to the following scales:
Scale 0: no pain: VAS=0, Scale 1: mild pain: 0&lt; VAS≤3.5, Scale 2: moderate pain: 3.5 &lt;VAS≤7, Scale 3: severe pain: 7&lt; VAS≤10.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>The clinical response</measure>
    <time_frame>Three weeks after the application of drugs</time_frame>
    <description>The clinical response of the lesion was scored according to the grading system formulated by Thongprasom et al.,in 1992 for the mucosal lesions:
Score 5 = white striae with erosive area more than 1 cm, Score 4 = white striae with erosive area less than 1 cm, Score 3 = white striae with atrophic area more than 1 cm, Score 2 = white striae with atrophic area less than 1 cm, Score 1 =mild white striae, no erythematous area Score 0 = no lesion, normal mucosa. This scorings were performed for both right and left sides separately.</description>
