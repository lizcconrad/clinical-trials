  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Regarding its complex pathogenesis and clinic-epidemiological meaning, different strategies
      are needed for the treatment of obesity. Ginger is the rhizome of a plant with thermogenic
      and anti-inflammatory effects, and may be a promising alternative as add-on strategy in the
      treatment for obesity. The primary objective of the current study is to assess whether
      consumption of ginger as an add-on strategy to restrictive diet is effective to reduce fat
      body percentage, increase basal metabolic rate and improve loss weight.

      The secondary objectives are:

        -  to assess the effect of nutritional intervention in quality of diet and weight loss.

        -  to evaluate the effect of ginger on behavioral symptoms and peripheral biomarkers in
           overweight subjects.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Overweight individuals will be interviewed at baseline and after 30, 60, 90, 120, 150 and 180
      days from baseline. The following measures will be assessed: body composition (fat body% and
      free fat body%), anthropometric measures (height, weight, body mass index, waist
      circumference and abdominal circumference), blood pressure, basal metabolic rate, behavioral
      symptoms, binge eating (binge eating scale) and peripheral biomarkers. Behavioral symptoms
      will be assessed using the following self-reported questionnaires: Beck Depression Inventory
      (depression symptoms), Beck Anxiety Inventory (anxiety symptoms), Medical Outcomes Study 36 -
      Item Short - Form Health Survey (quality of life) and Perceived Stress Scale (stress).

      Enrolled participants will receive restrictive diet calculated on individual requirements
      aiming at the loss from two to four kilogram per month in addition to capsules of ginger or
      placebo, as follows:

        -  Group 1 will receive vials containing 90 capsules of 200mg of dry extract of ginger (5%
           active ingredient) to be taken three times a day for six months in addition to
           restrictive diet.

        -  Group 2 will receive vials containing 90 capsules of 200mg of placebo (cellulose) to be
           taken three times a day for six months in addition to restrictive diet.
