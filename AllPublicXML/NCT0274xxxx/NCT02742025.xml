    <textblock>
      The main objective of this study is to evaluate the impact on preoperative anxiety of an
      education and information program conducted prior to non-urgent coronary angiography
      performed in patients hospitalized at the Nîmes University Hospital.

      The secondary objectives of this study are to assess the impact of the HEARTLINK program on
      the following parameters:

      A. Duration of hospital stay; B. Per operative blood and heart rate?; C. Patient satisfaction
      (visual analog scale).
