    <textblock>
      Aldehyde dehydrogenases (ALDHs) are cellular enzymes responsible for detoxifying aldehyde
      resulting from the metabolism of endogenous and exogenous xenobiotic cellular constituents.
      Although ALDHs are considered to play an important role in tumorigenesis, the role of ALDH
      activity in cancer stem cells, and more particularly that of the acute leukemia must be
      specified.

      Several studies have shown that ALDHs are potent apoptogenic compounds on normal or cancer
      cells. Therefore, the cells that were damaged and their increased ALDH activity does not die
      by apoptosis but become highly proliferating. This result is a plausible mechanism for the
      &quot;evasion of apoptosis&quot;, a characteristic shared by many cancer cells.

      On this basis, it is proposed an innovative approach to cancer chemotherapy through
      inhibition of one of the protective mechanisms against apoptosis, ie the increase in ALDH
      activity than cancer cells put involved in overcoming the lethal effects of damaged roads.
      ALDHs of inhibitors they may have immediate application as anti -cancer in vivo? The limited
      experimental data obtained so far on human tumor xenografts in immunodeficient mice and the
      absence of data on the in vivo toxicology do not allow direct passage to clinical trials.
      Indeed, some members of the ALDH superfamily are expressed constitutively in some vital
      organs they protect against the deleterious effects of xenobiotics and adverse endogenous
      metabolites. Consequently, if ALDHs should be inhibited, of the collateral damages for the
      normal cells could occur. However, when normal cells have not undergone deleterious exposure,
      these harmful metabolites are not or in very small quantities, which do not require high
      levels of ALDH activity, and therefore without harm to the inhibition of cell of these
      enzymes.

      From a hematological point of view, it seems essential to test the therapeutic index of the
      inhibitor of ALDH DIMATE between normal hematopoietic cells and leukemic stem. Indeed, in the
      pathophysiology of acute leukemia, the leukemia stem cells are of major importance because
      they are much more resistant to chemotherapy than more differentiated cells and thus causing
      the high rate of relapse observed in acute leukemia despite the high rate of complete
      remission often obtained. In this study, it will be tested in vitro sensitivity of the
      cluster of differentiation 4 and cluster of differentiation 38 (CD4/CD38) highly purified of
      leukemic origin or normal to the DIMATE compound. The objective will be to analyze the
      effects of DIMATE on the parameters of the proliferation, the apoptose, the cytokinins of
      secretions and the changes transcriptomic in general, in order to better define the
      therapeutic index of this compound and to determine all the precursory hematopoietic normals
      and leukaemic cellular effects. The reversible cytostatic of DIMATE effect on normal cells
      but its irreversible apoptotic effect on cancer cells is an advantage to try to eliminate.
