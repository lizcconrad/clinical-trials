  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to validate a set of signatures, based on a panel of proteomic
      markers, that discriminate BDI, BDII, and MDD in people seeking treatment for a depressive
      episode.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a hypothesis-driven confirmatory study to validate the diagnostic signature (model)
      for distinguishing BDI from MDD that also aims to optimize the models to discriminate BDII
      from MDD and BDI. A binary classification model, using linear discriminant analysis and based
      on 13 a priori-defined proteomic markers will aim to distinguish BDI from MDD. An alternative
      binary classification model based on multiple logistic regression and using 10 a priori
      -defined proteomic markers will aim for the same result. To improve the predictive
      performance of the signatures, items from self-report mood rating scales and
      treatment-emergent changes in proteomic markers will be analyzed. In addition, the study will
      examine if baseline or early treatment-emergent changes in proteomic markers predict
      treatment response.

    <description>Linear discriminant analysis and multiple logistic regression will be used to create three diagnostic models for the proteomic markers (BDI vs MDD, BDI vs BDII and BDII vs MDD). The patient's model diagnosis will be compared to the patient's clinical diagnoses (based on SCID DSM -5) and the proportion of concordant classifications will be calculated.</description>

          -  Currently depressed for ≥4 weeks and ≤104 weeks, without psychotic features,

          -  MADRS score ≥ 20 (consistent with at least moderately-severe depression)
