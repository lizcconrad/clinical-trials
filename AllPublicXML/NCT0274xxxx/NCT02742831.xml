  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a pilot randomized controlled trial of a behavioral intervention focused on improving
      parenting skills and preventing child neglect in families of children with special health
      care needs. The intervention focuses on problem solving, distress tolerance, and emotional
      regulation skills.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This pilot randomized controlled trial will be conducted with 60 caregivers of children with
      special health care needs who have been reported to the child protection team at Boston
      Medical Center with concern for neglect that was ultimately not substantiated. Half of the
      subjects will be randomly assigned to receive the 6-session, one-on-one, in-person,
      behavioral intervention focused on problem solving, emotional regulation, and distress
      tolerance. The other half will be randomly assigned to the control group and will receive
      periodic check-ins and referrals to community resources as needed. Both groups will be
      followed for 12 months after randomization.

      Children who have previously experienced neglect, or other forms of maltreatment, will not
      included in the study. Children will be defined as having special health care needs if they
      have a chronic physical, emotional, or behavioral condition.

      With this pilot, the investigators aim to field-test study mechanics, including enrollment,
      randomization, and the collection of baseline and follow-up data; and obtain empiric
      estimates of study parameters to inform a subsequent fully-powered randomized controlled
      trial.

    <measure>Study Logistics - subject enrollment</measure>
    <time_frame>Monthly change from baseline to 12 months post randomization</time_frame>
    <description>As this is a pilot study, the primary objective is to field test study logistics, including subject enrollment. The investigators will review monthly counts of enrolled subjects from baseline to 12 months post-randomization, and will compare the number of subjects in each study arm to target enrollment goals. Because of emerging consensus that group-to-group comparisons in a pilot study are not only invalid but also misleading, estimating effect size is deliberately not our primary study objective.</description>

    <measure>Study Logistics - fidelity of intervention delivery</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months post randomization</time_frame>
    <description>For the intervention group, treatment fidelity will be assessed by audio taping a random 10% of sessions and scoring them with standardized instruments. The investigators will measure the proportion of sessions delivered with fidelity. Because of emerging consensus that group-to-group comparisons in a pilot study are not only invalid but also misleading, estimating effect size is deliberately not our primary study objective.</description>

    <description>The intervention group will receive a one-on-one in-person intervention of 6 sessions, each lasting approximately 60 minutes. The intervention is intended to be delivered over a period of 12 weeks, with sessions occurring every 1-2 weeks. The overview of the 6 sessions is as follows:
Behavioral chain analysis of episodes where parent felt stressed and episode where things went well. Identification of sources of interpersonal support.
Stress relief. Development of a detailed crisis plan.
Problem solving techniques.
Emotional regulation exercises.
Positive parenting, review of parenting challenges.
Reflection, repeat behavioral chain analysis. Update crisis plan.</description>
