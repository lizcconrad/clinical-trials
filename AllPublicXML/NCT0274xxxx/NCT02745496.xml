  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The clinical trial aims to address the critical challenge of differentiating aggressive from
      indolent prostate cancers by correlating prospectively collected MultiParametric (MP)
      Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) data (index test) with the histopathology of radical
      prostatectomy specimens (reference standard).

      The study design incorporates pre-biopsy MRI, routine standard of care Transrectal Ultrasound
      guided (TRUS) biopsies and MRI/Ultrasound (US) image fusion techniques to guide biopsies to
      the suspicious areas identified by MRI.

      The hypothesis is that MP-MRI will allow pre-treatment determination of prostate cancer
      aggressiveness and MRI/US image fusion is expected to accurately co-locate cancer foci within
      the prostate gland for guiding biopsies.

      Pre-treatment prediction of Gleason grade as a marker of cancer aggressiveness will better
      inform clinicians and patients to improve risk stratification and facilitate decision making
      on subsequent treatment.

      Image fusion will allow accurate targeting of the most suspicious areas on MP-MRI for biopsy,
      which could obviate the need for multiple biopsies.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There is preliminary evidence suggesting that MultiParametric Magnetic Resonance Imaging
      (MP-MRI) can be a marker for prostate cancer (PCa) aggressiveness and could be used to plan
      treatment. Gleason grade (GG) is a critical predictor of the aggressiveness of PCa, but in up
      to one in three men, the histology of radical prostatectomy specimens is different from the
      histology of Transrectal Ultrasound (TRUS)-guided biopsies. This discrepancy contributes to-
      and is a sign of- poor risk stratification of men with localised PCa.

      The research aims to answer the following questions:

        1. Can image-fusion techniques allow investigators to reliably target abnormal areas seen
           on MP-MRI?

        2. How reliable is pre-biopsy MP-MRI in correctly predicting aggressive disease?

      The investigators envisage that MP-MRI information will reduce unnecessary biopsies and
      over-detection of indolent PCa, while improving the detection of aggressive disease.

      Primary Objectives

      • To determine whether using MP-MRI can improve cancer detection and characterization of
      prostate cancer

      Secondary Objectives

      • To determine whether US/MRI FUSION guided biopsy can reduce the number of false negative
      biopsies.
