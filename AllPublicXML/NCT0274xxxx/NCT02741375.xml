      Aim: To investigate the efficacy of cerebral oximetry (CO) as an auxiliary diagnostic tool in
      confirming brain death (BD).

      Materials and Methods: This observational and interventional study was performed on patients
      with suspected BD in emergency departments and intensive care units. CO monitoring was
      performed for at least 6 h, and cerebral tissue oxygen saturation (ScO2) was recorded. Basal
      ScO2 values (basal ScO2), ScO2 values after 6 h (end ScO2), mean ScO2 values during
      monitoring (mean ScO2), and minimum (min ScO2) and maximum (max ScO2) ScO2 values observed
      during monitoring were recorded for all patients. Patients with diagnosis of BD confirmed by
      the organ transplantation and brain death committee were enrolled as the BD group and other
      patients as the non-BD group, and cerebral oxygen parameters were compared.

      Brain death (BD) means the irreversible loss of all brain and brain stem functions and
      physiopathologically the cessation of intracranial circulation. BD is a clinical diagnosis
      that can be made with various clinical tests. However, in order for BD to be definitely
      established, clinical tests performed initially need to be repeated after 24 h or to be
      confirmed by corroboratory tests. In addition, the obligation to confirm BD using
      corroboratory tests varies in current guidelines from country to country but has been
      eliminated except for certain specific circumstances. However, considering the adverse
      effects on patients awaiting donor and organ donations of the time lapse between initial and
      repeat tests in order to confirm BD, more rapid confirmation of definite BD is commonly made
      using corroboratory tests.

      This study was planned with the hypothesis that this non-invasive technique using NIRS
      technology can be an auxiliary tool in the diagnosis of BD.

      This study was performed with patients with suspected BD in emergency departments and
      intensive care units and was intended to evaluate the effectiveness of cerebral oximetry as
      an auxiliary diagnostic tool in patients with suspected BD.
