      The drug being tested in this study is naltrexone HCl and bupropion HCl Extended- Release
      fixed dose combination (NB) . This study will evaluate the potential effect of multiple oral
      doses of extended-release combination of naltrexone/bupropion on the PK of a single oral dose
      of metformin in healthy participants with normal renal function (defined as creatinine
      clearance [CrCl] greater than equal to [&gt;=] 90 milliliter per minute [mL/min]/1.73 meter
      square [m^2]).

      The study will enroll approximately 30 participants. Participants will receive:

      Metformin 850 mg as a single dose alone and in combination with multiple doses of
      Naltrexone/Bupropion Naltrexone 8 mg/Bupropion 90 mg + Naltrexone 16 mg/Bupropion 180 mg as
      multiple doses alone and in combination with a single dose of metformin

      All participants will be asked to take 1 tablet of metformin in the morning on Day 1 and Day
      14, 1 tablet of naltrexone/bupropion twice daily from Day 3 through Day 5, and 2 tablets of
      naltrexone/bupropion twice daily from Day 6 through Day 15.

      This single center trial will be conducted in the United States. The overall time to
      participate in this study is 73 days. Participants will be admitted on Day -1 (check in) and
      remain confined to the clinic until Day 16 and will be contacted by telephone 30 (±2) days
      after last dose of study drug for a follow-up assessment. Serial blood samples will be
      collected for PK assessments. Safety will be monitored throughout the study.
