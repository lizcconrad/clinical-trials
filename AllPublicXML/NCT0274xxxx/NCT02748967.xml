    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the safety and tolerability of different doses of
      ExPEC4V (JNJ-63871860) in healthy Japanese participants greater than or equal to [&gt; =] 20
      years of age.

    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1 double-blind (neither the Investigator nor the participant know the
      treatment), randomized (the study medication is assigned by chance), placebo-controlled (an
      inactive substance that is compared with a medication to test whether the medication has a
      real effect in a clinical study) parallel group, single center study in healthy Japanese
      participants aged greater than or equal to [&gt; =] 20 years. A target of approximately 48
      participants will be enrolled that are stratified according to their age in 2 groups: 24
      participants &gt; = 20 to less than [&lt;] 50 years of age and 24 participants &gt; = 50 years of age.
      Both groups will be randomized to a single vaccination with 1 of the 3 study dose levels of
      ExPEC4V or placebo (vaccine buffer). Participants will be enrolled in a dose ascending
      approach. Blood samples will be drawn on Days 1 (prevaccination), 15 and 30 for the
      assessment of immunogenicity. The study duration per participant will be approximately 38
      days (Screening period and postvaccination follow-up included). Participants' safety will be
      monitored throughout the study.
