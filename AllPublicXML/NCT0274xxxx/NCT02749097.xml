  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, placebo-controlled, single dose escalation study to investigate the
      safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of SHR0534. The study will be
      conducted with starting dose of 10 mg followed by dose escalation groups up to 200 mg. Eight
      subjects will be randomized in 3:1 ratio in each cohort to receive the study drug or placebo.

          -  Must have, in the investigator's opinion, no clinically significant diseases or
             abnormal laboratory test values as determined by medical and psychiatric history,

             birth control include sexual abstinence, vasectomy or a condom with spermicide (men)

             control methods, or placement of an intrauterine device or intrauterine system (for
             female partner).
