  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To be diagnosed with recurrent miscarriages, a couple might have a child, however experiences
      three or more miscarriages, primarily this happens during the first trimester.

      These miscarriages often needs medical evacuation or a D &amp; C. Surgery or retained tissue
      increases the risk of complications as infection and/or adhesions, known as asherman
      syndrome, which may result in subfertility.

      Recently chronic infection in the endometrium has been proposed to contribute to the
      condition, as protocols including treatment with antibiotics have led to birth at term for
      some of these women.

      Using the very minimal invasive office hysteroscopy, the investigators aim to describe the
      uterine cavity in patients diagnosed with recurrent miscarriages regarding both abnormalities
      in the endometrium and chromic infection.

      The Unit for Recurrent Pregnancy-loss at Rigshospitalet treats about 300 of couples with
      recurrent miscarriages a year. Together with the current examination program, the
      investigators plan to describe the uterine cavity according to abnormalities as septa,
      adhesions and further the condition for the endometrium regarding infection and hormone
      receptors. This description will include descriptive office hysteroscopy with biopsies for
      histologic - and immunohistochemically examinations.
