  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cricoid force is applied during airway management to prevent pulmonary aspiration of
      regurgitated gastric contents. This force is usually applied by a nurse or anaesthesia
      assistant. Currently this is performed WITHOUT monitoring and the force applied is determined
      by the individual's &quot;educated hand&quot; that is derived from his/her experience from past
      training and practice. Studies have shown that the actual force applied by nurse and
      anaesthesia assistant is inconsistent and deviates from the optimal force. Under application
      of cricoid force results in ineffective cricoid pressure and the risk of pulmonary
      aspiration. Consequences of pulmonary aspiration include lung injury and infection, hypoxia,
      long Intensive Care Unit stay and even death. Over exertion of cricoid force results in
      distortion of the larynx (leading to difficult bag mask, difficult tracheal tube insertion
      and hypoxia). Preliminary results from previous study (IRB 2014/437/D), an observation
      crossover pilot was carried out comparing the amount of cricoid force applied by 16 nurses on
      manikin with and without direct feedback. Nurses were instructed to apply a range of force of
      30-44 Newtons on a marked site on the neck region of manikin. A flexiforce load sensor was
      used. Unblinded nurses performed significantly better with feedback using the load sensor
      then blinded nurses. With Funding from a National grant, a real-time measurement of cricoid
      force is developed to give feedback and guide the operator to exert and maintain the TARGET
      cricoid pressure during rapid sequence induction (RSI).

      In this study we aim to verify the sensor system with a manikin and compare the forces
      applied by nurses with the sensor system and without.

      A total of 22 nurses or anesthetists will be recruited Inclusion criteria include healthy
      subjects Exclusion criteria include (1) pregnant subjects (2) history of back pain or injury

      Cricoid pressure applied on manikin will be measured

        1. By electronic medical grade weighing scale

        2. By sensor system electronically
