    <textblock>
      This observational epidemiologic study with nested cross-sectional and longitudinal aims will
      evaluate host immune response to mixed chronic infections (Helicobacter pylori, latent
      tuberculosis, intestinal helminthiasis) in recent US immigrants.

  <detailed_description>

      1750 clinically-well, adult (age 18-55 years), recent immigrants (&lt;2 years U.S. residence),
      referred through cooperating public health clinics in the Santa Clara Valley area, CA will be
      screened for H. pylori, helminth, and latent tuberculosis infections [&quot;Screening&quot;
      population]. Of these 1750, 426 will be selected for more intensive study (Cohort
      population), 105 of whom will receive baseline endoscopy. Of those selected for the cohort,
      300 are expected to complete a 9-month follow-up assessment, 75 of whom are expected to
      undergo a second follow-up endoscopy.
