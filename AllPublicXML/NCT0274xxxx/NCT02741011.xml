      Aim of this study is to evaluate the necessity of the radiological examinations of mentally
      handicapped or uncooperative patients.

    <textblock>
      Dental radiography has become an indispensable part of routine dental examination with the
      help of the technological development of radiological devices. However, medical procedures
      like dental treatment and medical imaging (magnetic resonance imaging-MRI, computed
      tomography-CT, orthopantomography- OPG, etc.) that require cooperation are usually hard to
      apply to mentally handicapped (MHP) or uncooperative patients (UCP). Treatments that will be
      done without radiological examination can be missing or incorrect.

    <description>Radiological images of the mentally handicapped patients obtained under sedation anesthesia with cone beam dental tomography. Radiological examination were performed on tomograpic images and indications (tooth filling, root canal treatment, extraction) were noted. Same procedure was performed for oral examination and indications were compared.</description>

    <description>Mentally handicapped patients underwent sedation anesthesia with IV Propofol and then tomographic images were obtained with NewTom 5G. Orthopantomographies (OPGs) were obtained by processing the raw images and radiological examination of the patients were performed on OPGs.</description>

    <description>During the period of two years, mentally handicapped patients were enrolled in this study. First a radiological examination was performed under sedation anesthesia and then an oral examination was performed when patient underwent general anesthesia for dental treatments. Oral and radiological examinations were compared with each other and also with treatment results to define the necessity of the radiological examination of mentally handicapped patients.</description>
