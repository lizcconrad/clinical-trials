  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In the 2010-french perinatal survey, the overall cesarean section (CS) rate during labour was
      21 % and 16% to 38% in case of dystocia.

      The definition of &quot; dystocia &quot; is traditionally based on the research led by Friedman in the
      1950's on a restricted population sample. Several studies over the last years seem to
      indicate that the different phases of labour are longer than originally described by
      Friedman.

      Our current hypothesis is that the application of a new definition of dystocia would enable a
      more appropriate management of labour.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The main purpose of this study is to show a significant decrease of the CS rate with the use
      of the new partograph developed by Neal and Lowe.

      Secondary purposes are

        -  To reduce the use of oxytocin during labour without increasing maternal or neonatal
           morbidity;

        -  To decrease immediate per-operative complications and post-operative complications
           associated with CS

    <description>Labour dystocia is diagnosed when cervical dilation is less than 1 cm per hour or after 3 hours at complete cervical dilation without engagement of the presentation. In this case, active management of labour is started with introduction of oxytocin, artificial rupture of membranes and supportive therapy.</description>

    <description>The second strategy is based on the partograph developped by Neal and Lowe. An active management of labour is started when crossing the dystocia line or when there are no cervical modifications after 4 hours beyond 5 cm of cervical dilation. In this case, active management of labour is started with introduction of oxytocin, artificial rupture of membranes and supportive therapy.</description>

    <intervention_name>New partograph based on the studies of Neal and Lowe</intervention_name>
    <description>The partograph designed by Neal and Lowe includes an &quot;action line&quot; which if crossed permits an active management of labour.
Eventually, the only difference between the two arms is the moment when the active management of labour is started.
The oxytocin is administrated according to the department protocol.</description>
