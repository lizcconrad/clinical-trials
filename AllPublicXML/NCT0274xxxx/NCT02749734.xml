      The purpose of this study was to determine the safety and therapeutic effect of sub-retinal
      transplantation of human embryo stem cell derived retinal pigment epitheliums (hESC-RPE) in
      patients with macular degeneration diseases, and explore new treatment modalities for macular
      degeneration diseases (Age-related macular degeneration and Stargardt's macular dystrophy).
