  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Exposure to music improves cognitive function in 'healthy' participants and in brain-damaged
      patients. However, it is still difficult to understand what precisely in music causes a
      positive effect : are they emotional components, familiarity or preference which improve
      cognition or is there any specific effect of music? Moreover, it is not yet possible to
      characterize the neural and functional links between the brain systems solicited by music and
      those associated with other cognitive functions enhanced by music.

      Finally, researches on brain-damaged patients have not exploited the potential effect of
      music on the level of alert and perceptual awareness, while this type of stimulation could be
      a valuable tool to improve cognition in patients with a disturbance of consciousness and
      alertness.

      The main objective is to describe the impact of music on the brain's response to
      self-referential or neutral stimuli in brain-damaged patients with persistent consciousness
      disorder after a coma and in healthy participants.

    <description>Improvement of the P300 response (increase in amplitude and / or a decrease in latency) to the first name pronunciation will be assessed in patients in coma, in a vegetative state or in a minimally conscious state, when it is preceded by a favorite or familiar sound (music, language, environmental noise) and / or a positive emotional connotation, compared to a control condition (unfamiliar sound and / or neutral emotional connotation). This improvement in brain response will be the sign of a more efficient categorization of patient's own name.</description>
