  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The urinary tract infections are common in children. It is estimated that about 3% of girls
      and 1% of boys suffer from a urinary tract infection before the age of 11 years. A prompt
      diagnosis and treatment are necessary for the prevention of morbidity and long-term sequelae.

      Currently, there are different methods of urine collection, such as suprapubic aspiration,
      the survey, the collection bag and the jet medium collection.

      They have in common to be time-consuming, invasive in some cases, providers of contaminated
      levies for others and impossible in children incontinent for the last.

      A Spanish study developed a new collection technique, for kidney and bladder stimulation,
      noninvasive, in the new-born to 30-day months. The results are promising with a success rate
      of over 85% within a period of about 45s.

      No study has looked at a broader pediatric population, including children from birth to age
      of acquisition of walking.

      We hypothesize that it is possible to obtain urine in less than 3 minutes, noninvasively, in
      infants who have not acquired the works for which a urine sample is required.
