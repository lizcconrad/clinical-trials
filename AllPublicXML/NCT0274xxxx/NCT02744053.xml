  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical research study is to learn if investigational imaging scans can
      help researchers predict which patients may respond to treatment. The results of these
      investigational scans will be compared to the results of standard digital mammograms (DMs)
      and ultrasound (US).

      The investigational imaging scans being used on this study are:

        -  Tc99m Sestamibi Molecular Breast Imaging (MBI), and

        -  Dynamic Contrast Enhanced Molecular Resonance Imaging (DCE-MRI).

      If you agree to take part in this study, you will be receiving an anthracycline regimen or
      anthracycline neoadjuvant-based therapies, depending on what the treating physician thinks is
      in your best interest.

      In addition to the tests and procedures described in the consent for study 2014-0185, you
      will have DCE-MRIs and MBI scans at 3 different time points. These will be performed at:

        -  Before you start anthracycline regimen therapy

        -  When you finish receiving anthracycline regimen therapy

        -  When you finish receiving neoadjuvant therapy before surgery

      Before each DCE-MRI , you will be given contrast injection by vein. Each DCE-MRI will take 45
      minutes to an hour total, and is performed like a normal MRI.

      Before each MBI scan, you will receive an injection of 99mTc sestamibi (a type of drug that
      gives off energy that is seen with special cameras, like a mammogram). You will have an MBI
      scan about 5 minutes after you receive Tc99m sestamibi. During the scan, your breast will be
      positioned between 2 detectors and lightly compressed. The detectors are 2 square cameras,
      which look very similar to mammogram cameras. You are seated during the entire procedure and
      the scan should take about an hour.

      During the first part of this imaging study, the MBI scans for the first 5-10 patients may be
      about 20 minutes longer than normal, and the MRI scans will take about 10 minutes longer than
      normal. These scans may take longer because the study staff will be adjusting the machines
      for this study.

      If the doctor thinks it is needed to check the status of the disease (as part of your
      standard of care), you will also have digital mammography and ultrasound at the same 3 time
      points. You will receive the results of the mammography and ultrasound.

      Information, such as images from previous scans and your medical history, will also be
      collected from your medical record.

      The results from the DCE-MRI and MBI scans will not affect or change your course of
      treatment, including the type of surgery you may have. You and your treating physician will
      receive the results of the MBI and DCE/MRI but the results will not be used for treatment
      planning.

      Length of Study:

      Your participation on this study will be over once you complete your surgery. If you are
      unable to have one of the investigational scans due to intolerable side effects, you will be
      taken off study early.

      This is an investigational study. DCE-MRIs of the breast and MBI scans on this study are
      performed using FDA-approved and commercially available methods. Tc99m sestamibi is
      FDA-approved and commercially available. The use of MRI and MBI scans for TNBC is considered
      investigational.

      Up to 100 participants will be enrolled in this study. All will take part at MD Anderson.
