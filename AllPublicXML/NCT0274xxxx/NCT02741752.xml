      Background: The purpose of the current study was to evaluate the effect of cortical bone
      perforation on angiogenesis and osteogenesis of augmented ridge by guided bone regeneration.

      Methods: Fourteen patients (mean age: 52) who were in need of dental implants at areas with
      osseous defects in the mandible were selected. In the test group (n=7), alveolar cortical
      bone at the area of regeneration was perforated using a #2 high speed round bur. No
      decortication of cortical bone was performed in the control group (n=7). Subsequently,
      defects were augmented by guided bone regeneration using resorbable membrane and bovine bone.
      After a healing period of 7 months, implant sites were created and trephine cores harvested
      for histological and histomorphometric analysis of the grafted areas.
