  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this randomized clinical trial is to compare the antibacterial effects of 1%
      sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl) and 2% chlorhexidine gluconate (CHX) during retreatment of teeth
      with apical periodontitis (AP).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Root canal-treated teeth with AP were randomly distributed in two groups according to the
      irrigant used. After removal of the previous filling material, bacteriological samples were
      taken from the canals before (S1) and after chemomechanical preparation using either NaOCl or
      CHX (S2), and after calcium hydroxide medication for 2-3 weeks (S3). 16S rRNA gene-based
      real-time qPCR was performed to detect and quantify total bacteria, Streptococcus species and
      Enterococcus faecalis.
