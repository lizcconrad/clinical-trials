  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Septic shock carries high mortality, which may be exacerbated by inappropriate initial
      therapy. Inappropriate therapy may result from unanticipated antimicrobial resistance.
      Conversely, positive blood cultures may result from contamination, leading to unnecessary
      therapy and procedures and possibly prolonged hospitalization. Clinicians may also resort to
      broad spectrum antimicrobials and be hesitant to de-escalate while awaiting susceptibility
      results.

      The investigators hypothesize that rapid identification of pathogens and antimicrobial
      resistance will ameliorate the above problems and improve time to optimal therapy, avoid
      unnecessary therapy and ultimately improve patient outcomes. While there are a number of
      in-vitro and uncontrolled clinical studies, there is a paucity of well-designed clinical
      trials objectively examining the real-world clinical and health-economic impact of such
      technology. To date only one randomised trial has been performed in the US
      (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01898208), at a setting with low endemic rates of antimicrobial
      resistance. This is a companion study to NCT01898208. The investigators aim to study the
      clinical impact and cost-effectiveness of a strategy for rapid pathogen and resistance
      detection in a setting with a moderate to high levels of antimicrobial resistance.

      Hypothesis:

        1. Rapid pathogen identification from blood cultures, including early identification of
           resistance (via specific genetic markers or phenotypic tests), will allow timelier
           initiation of appropriate antibiotic therapy and improved patient outcomes

        2. Rapid organism identification from blood cultures will allow timelier initiation of
           effective and optimal antibiotic therapy; minimizing the use of unnecessary antibiotics,
           including combination therapy

      Devices to be studied for this proposed study:

        1. BCID panel (Biofire Diagnostics Inc., bioMerieux) : The BCID panel is an FDA-approved
           nucleic acid amplification test (based on nested polymerase chain reaction) which
           detects Gram positive, Gram negative, the major Candida species and antimicrobial
           resistance markers (mecA for methicillin resistance, van A/B for vancomycin resistance,
           blaKPC for Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase (KPC)) directly from positive blood
           cultures in &lt; 1 - 1.5 hours

        2. Rosco Diagnostica extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) and carbapenemase screen kit
           (Rosco Diagnostica): These kits are CE-marked (Approved in the European Union) rapid
           chromogenic tests for ESBL/ carbapenemase detection from both blood cultures and
           cultured bacterial colonies.

    <description>An effective antibiotic is defined as an antibiotic regimen to which the bacterial/fungal isolate is susceptible (or predicted to be susceptible for Candida, per speciation).An optimal antibiotic is defined as an antibiotic regimen to which the bacterial/fungal isolate is susceptible/predicted to be susceptible, which is the most narrow spectrum and targeted, as recommended by institutional guidelines. This will be considered as the time from the positive Gram stain to first effective and the first optimal antibiotic.</description>

The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio is calculated by the following equation: (C1 - C0)/(O1 - O0). Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios using quality adjusted/sepsis adjusted life years gained as the health outcome of interest will then be determined, based on the method of Jones et al Crit Care Med. 2011 June ; 39(6): 1306-1312.</description>
