      Aim: To evaluate if additional cord blood transfusion could accelerate the hematopoietic
      reconstitution in severe aplastic anemia(SAA) patients receiving immunosuppressive therapy
      (IST).

      Study design: open-labed, prospective, multicenter, randomized control study Number of
      subjects: 60 each group

      Treatment:

      IST group: ATG (Thymoglobuline®, Genzyme) 3.5mg/kg/d×5d plus oral cyclosporine A (CSA) Cord
      blood transfusion group: In addition to the same dose and course of ATG and CSA , one unit of
      cord blood having no more than 2 HLA-A, B or DRB1 mismatches is transfused 24h after last
      dose of ATG administration.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Eligible patients should be under 60 years old with confirmed SAA, without HLA matched
      siblings and previous ATG treatment history. Patients will be excluded if they present any
      fatal disease, including respiratory failure, heart failure, liver or kidney function failure
      et al or severely allergic to biologic products.

      To evaluate if additional cord blood transfusion could accelerate the hematopoietic
      reconstitution in severe aplastic anemia(SAA) patients receiving IST therapy, 120 eligible
      patients will be randomized to two groups, the IST group and the cord blood transfusion
      group. Patients in the IST group receive standard IST which including ATG (Thymoglobuline®,
      Genzyme) 3.5mg/kg/d×5d plus oral cyclosporine A（CSA ) started from 5mg/kg/d and adjusted to
      maintain trough serum concentration of 200-300ng/ml. While patients in the cord blood
      transfusion group receive the same dose and course of ATG and CSA as the control group and
      one unit of cord blood having no more than 2 HLA-A, B and DRB1 mismatches is transfused 24h
      after last dose of ATG administration.

      The neutrophil recovery day is defined as the first day of 3 consecutive days during which
      the absolute neutrophil count (ANC) is &gt;0.5×109/L, without G-CSF adminstration. Platelet
      recovery day is deﬁned to have occurred on the ﬁrst of 7 consecutive days with a blood
      platelet count (BPC) of &gt;20×109/L, without transfusion support. Response (CR, PR or NR) is
      evaluated on 3, 4, 6,9, 12, 18 and 24months after treatment.

      The primary end point is the neutrophil recovery day and second end points are response rate
      (CR+PR), treatment related mortality, disease free survival and overall survival.
