      This trial is designed to preliminary evaluate the efficacy and safety of NIBS system for
      evaluation and treatment of neuropathic pain. The NIBS system evaluates brain neuronal
      network activity and customizes a personalized treatment utilizing low current non invasive
      brain stimulation technology for neuropathic pain with central component. this is single
      meeting trial which includes brain activity evaluation and a single treatment and sham
      treatment. The goal of the study is to evaluate the central brain component of neuropathic
      pain subjects, and the effect of conventional tDCS treatment.

    <textblock>
      Neuropathic pain is a pain which persists after nerve injury has healed and results from
      significant functional and structural changes in the nervous system similar to memory
      processes. As a result, neuropathic pain has been proposed to be &quot;a persistence of the memory
      of pain and/or the inability to extinguish the memory of pain evoked by an initial inciting
      injury&quot;. A firm conclusion in the neurobiology of learning and memory is that different types
      of memory have distinct mechanisms (e.g., declarative memory vs procedural memory). A similar
      distinction can be made in pain: various chronic pain states have distinct central mechanisms
      . Accumulating evidence suggests that chronic pain is a type of nociceptive memory mediated
      by structural and functional plasticity in by multiple pathways at cortical, subcortical,
      spinal, and peripheral levels.Elucidating the basal neuronal signature of the person
      suffering from chronic pain enables to optimizing a treatment which in all studies was
      constant for all patients regardless of their basal activity

      In this study participants will undergo diagnosis of the personalized central manifestation
      characteristics of the neuropathic pain and evaluate the efficacy of a standard, most
      commonly used tDCS treatment, based on the diagnosis.

      for this purpose a single meeting will take place during which participants will undergo
      evaluation, sham treatment and standard tDCS treatment.
