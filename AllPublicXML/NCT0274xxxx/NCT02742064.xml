      The purpose of this study is to determine if a mobile sensing platform can passively and
      objectively detect the presence of clinically significant mood disorder symptomatology and
      symptom progression over time. Meeting this goal will allow for improved risk categorization,
      prediction of relapse, and measurement of disease progression in a lifetime prevalence
      population.

        Participants will be selected from the MoodNetwork, an online network of individuals with
        mood disorders, which is hosted by MGH. A subset of participants with mood disorders
        enrolled in MoodNetwork will download Cogito's mobile sensing platform on their mobile
        phones.
