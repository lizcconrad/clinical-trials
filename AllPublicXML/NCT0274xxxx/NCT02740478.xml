  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the trial is to prove that the Reassure10.5 GHz sensor is equivalent in
      performance to the SomnoScreen Plus RC in indicating the breathing rate of adult subjects
      over a number of hours when the subjects are lying still or in bed asleep

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Each recording comprised at least 2 hours duration. The subject was lying on a bed, wearing
      the SomnoScreen and with the Reassure on a bed-side table in the recommended position: at
      arm's length, pointing at the subject's upper torso.

      The subject was asked to lie in set positions on the bed for 20 minutes at a time. The data
      was recorded continuously for the duration of the trial and so encompassed the acts of
      turning from one position to another and any minor movement made by the subject. If the
      subject fell asleep during the trial, they were only woken when it came time for the next
      position change.
