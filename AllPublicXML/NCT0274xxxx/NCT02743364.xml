      This randomized phase II trial studies how well simvastatin works in reducing pancreatitis
      (the inflammation of the pancreas) in patients with pancreatitis that occurs more than once
      (recurrent), has worsened quickly (acute), or has persisted or progressed over a long period
      of time (chronic). Simvastatin may decrease the inflammation of the pancreas by modulating
      the immune response responsible for inflammation. It is not yet known if simvastatin may be
      an effective treatment for pancreatitis.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the effect of a simvastatin intervention versus placebo on the change in
      secretin-stimulated peak bicarbonate concentration in the pancreatic fluid at 6 months
      post-treatment in patients with a history of at least two episodes of acute pancreatitis in
      the past 12 months.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the effect of a simvastatin intervention versus placebo at 6 months from
      baseline (study visit

      1) on change in the endoscopic ultrasound score (EUS). II. To evaluate the effect of a
      simvastatin intervention versus placebo at 6 months from baseline (study visit

      1) on change in fecal elastase. III. To evaluate the effect of a simvastatin intervention
      versus placebo at 6 months from baseline (study visit

      1) on change in serum and pancreatic fluid levels of CRP, IL-6, IL-10, TGFbeta1, MMP-9,
      TNF-alpha, and soluble (s)-fractalkine.

      IV. To evaluate the effect of a simvastatin intervention versus placebo at 6 months from
      baseline (study visit 1) on change in pancreatic fluid levels of EMT markers, e-cadherin and
      vimentin.

      V. To evaluate the effect of a simvastatin intervention versus placebo at 6 months from
      baseline (study visit 1) on change in pancreatitis-related readmissions. VI. To evaluate the
      effect of a simvastatin intervention versus placebo at 6 months from baseline (study visit

      1) on change in KRAS gene mutations in pancreatic fluid. VII. To evaluate the effect of a
      simvastatin intervention versus placebo at 6 months from baseline (study visit

      1) on change in quality of life score as measured by the quality of life questionnaire core
      30 (QLQ-C30) and quality of life questionnaire pancreatic modification (QLQ-PAN28) chronic
      pancreatitis (CP).

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.

      ARM I: Patients receive simvastatin orally (PO) once daily (QD) for 6 months.

      ARM II: Patients receive placebo PO QD for 6 months.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30, 60, and 90 days.
