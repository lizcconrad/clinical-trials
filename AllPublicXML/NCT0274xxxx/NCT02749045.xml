  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall purpose of this research study is to identify the disparity in ischemia
      measurement between fractional flow reserve (FFR) used in the cardiac catheterization
      laboratory and myocardial perfusion stress- single-photon emission computed tomography
      (SPECT). This study aims to determine the correlation between simultaneous FFR and SPECT
      obtained using regadenoson in the catheterization laboratory.

      Patients who are previously scheduled for diagnostic coronary angiography will be approached
      for consent to be part of the study. If the patient is found to have one or two vessel
      disease and it is planned by the interventional cardiologist that FFR will be used, then the
      previously consented patient will be deemed appropriate for the study. The standard procedure
      will be followed for FFR testing using regadenoson. The patient will then receive the
      standard dose of Tc-99m sestamibi. The interventional cardiologist will proceed with
      percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) if appropriate. Patients will proceed to the cardiac
      catheterization laboratory holding area post procedure. Patients will then be scheduled to be
      taken to the nuclear cardiology laboratory one to three hours following the coronary
      angiogram for standard SPECT acquisition. Patients will be monitored for 2-6 hours or
      overnight as clinically indicated following diagnostic coronary angiography and PCI. Low dose
      resting myocardial perfusion scanning may be performed the next day if stress myocardial
      perfusion study was abnormal.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Patients undergoing clinically-indicated FFR measurement (to determine the hemodynamic
        significance of intermediate degrees of stenosis) for single or two -vessel epicardial
        coronary disease during diagnostic coronary angiography for suspected coronary artery
        disease.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients with 3-vessel disease

          2. Prior coronary artery bypass grafting

          3. Patients with second or third- degree atrioventricular block, without a functioning
             pacemaker

          4. Patients who have ingested caffeine-containing products within the past 12 hours.
