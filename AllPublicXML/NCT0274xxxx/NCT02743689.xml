    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to identify the incidence of early postoperative delirium in
      intensive care patients after cardiac surgery and detect possible risk factors associated
      with increased risk for developing delirium after cardiac surgery.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A consecutive series of patients scheduled for elective cardiac surgery is included in the
      study. Delirium screening is performed using Intensive Care Delirium Screening Checklist.
      Preoperative cognitive state is evaluated with Mini-Mental State Examination. Information of
      possible risk factors is collected from patient's history and chart. The Snoring, Tiredness,
      Observed apnea, high blood Pressure-Body mass index (BMI), Age, Neck circumference and Gender
      questionnaire (STOP-BANG questionnaire) is used for obstructive sleep apnea screening.

    <description>Preoperative risk factors include demographic data, comorbidities and standard preoperative laboratory and instrumental testing results as well as preoperative cognitive status evaluation, performed a day before the surgery. If the patient does not develop delirium, information on intraoperative and postoperative risk factors is collected up to discharge from intensive care unit or maximum 5 postoperative days, whichever happens earlier. If delirium occurs, data on risk factors is collected up to the beginning of delirium.</description>
