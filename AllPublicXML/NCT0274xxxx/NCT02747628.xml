  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sixty female non-smoker patients, aged 18-50 years and ASA I and II undergoing elective
      laparoscopic cholecystectomy under general anesthesia were included in this randomized
      controlled double-blind study. Patients were randomly divided into 3 groups 20 each, C group
      patients received transdermal placebo patch, TDN group (15 mg/16 h) and TDM group (7 mg/8h).
      Assessment of postoperative pain, sedation, hemodynamic variables such as HR and MAP,
      postoperative monitoring of arterial SpO2 and side effects (e.g. nausea, vomiting, pruritis,
      respiratory depression and hemodynamic instability) were done 30 minutes, 1, 2, 6 and 12
      hours postoperatively. Postoperative Patient`s and Surgeons` satisfaction, Intraoperative
      bleeding and plasma cortisol (µg / dl) 2 hours postoperatively were also assessed.
