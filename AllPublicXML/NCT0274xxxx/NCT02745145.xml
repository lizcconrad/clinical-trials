  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this trial is to compare two doses of abituzumab with placebo and determine
      whether abituzumab is more effective, safer, will be better tolerated and can provoke better
      immune response than placebo in the treatment of patients with SSc-ILD who already receive
      constant doses of mycophenolate.

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects are eligible for this trial if they fulfill all of the following inclusion
             criteria:

          -  Female or male subjects aged between 18 and 75 years of age who provide informed
             written consent.

          -  Subjects fulfilling the 2013 American College of Rheumatology (ACR) /European League
             Against Rheumatism criteria for classification of systemic sclerosis (SSc).

          -  Disease duration of less than (&lt;) 7 years from first non-Raynaud's symptom.

          -  Subjects who have been taking the same mycophenolate regimen (stable dose) in a range
             of 1.5 to 3 gram (g)/day of Mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) or 1080 to 2160 milligram/day
             (mg/day) of MPS for at least 2 months prior to the Screening Visit and continued
             through Day 1 of the Treatment Period, of the lung on HRCT according to central
             reading.

          -  According to central readings: Diffusion capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide
             (DLCO) greater than or equal to (&gt;=) 30 percent (%) predicted, Forced vital capacity
             (FVC) 40% to 85% predicted, and a ratio of FVC % predicted to DLCO % predicted &gt;=1.8
             is acceptable if right heart catheterization within 3 months of screening revealed no
             pulmonary hypertension. If these criteria are met, then High-resolution computed
             tomography (HRCT) of lungs will be performed, and must show at least 5% fibrosis for
             subjects to be eligible.

          -  Female subjects of childbearing potential must use a highly effective method of
             contraception to prevent pregnancy for 4 weeks before randomization and must agree to
             continue to practice adequate contraception for the duration of their participation in
             the trial (up to the last Safety Follow-Up Visit). For the purposes of this trial,
             women of childbearing potential are defined as &quot;All female subjects after puberty
             unless they are post-menopausal for at least 2 years or are surgically sterile.&quot;
             Highly effective contraception is defined as 2 barrier methods (eg, female diaphragm
             and male condoms); or 1 barrier method with at least one of the following: spermicide,
             a hormonal method, or an intrauterine device. Note that because mycophenolate affects
             the metabolism of oral contraceptives and may reduce their effectiveness, women
             receiving mycophenolate who are using oral contraceptives for birth control should
             employ an additional contraceptive method (for example, male or female barrier
             method).
