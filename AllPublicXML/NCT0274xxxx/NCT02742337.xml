  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      â€¢ Given the cost and risk associated with biologic disease modifying anti-rheumatic drugs
      (bDMARDs), selection of the optimal medication is imperative. Current attempts to identify
      genetic factors that predict bDMARD response and effectiveness in rheumatoid arthritis
      patients have been inconclusive. Furthermore the presence of epigenetic signatures in
      rheumatoid arthritis patients has not been established. This protocol is the first step to
      identifying the practicality and feasibility of epigenetic testing to aid in diagnosis and/or
      medication selection in rheumatoid arthritis patients. Subsequent research into such
      epigenetic changes may be indicative of bDMARD response and/or safety. If such epigenetic
      signatures (EGS) exist the business need for such tests will thus be supported.

      Two groups of patients will be assessed for the presence unique epigenetic signatures. The
      test group, having a bonafide diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and a control group of
      subjects who does not fulfill the American College of Rheumatology's classification criteria
      for RA. A buccal cell sample and blood draw will be sequenced and analyzed from each subject
      in each group for the presence of epigenetic signatures.
