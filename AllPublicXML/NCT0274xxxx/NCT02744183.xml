  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In healthy individuals, the body responds to glucose (sugar) ingestion by reducing the amount
      released from the liver. At the same time, skeletal muscles increase the rate at which they
      remove the glucose from the bloodstream, via the actions of the hormone insulin. This ensures
      that blood glucose levels remain in a controlled range. However, in developed countries,
      diseases such as metabolic syndrome and type 2 diabetes are becoming prevalent, due to
      dietary modifications and a reduction in physical activity. As one of the prominent barriers
      to regular physical activity is a lack of time, finding ways to maximize the health benefits
      of exercise is a priority for researchers.

      The investigators want to understand potential differences in the effects of six weeks of
      aerobic training, with the exercise performed either after breakfast or after a prolonged
      fast. Specifically, this research aims to investigate whether there is a difference in the
      change in processes implicated in glucose regulation and secondly, in subsequent eating and
      physical activity behaviors. By investigating these changes this work will explore how
      exercise and nutrition can be optimized to benefit health and weight loss.
