  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test the hypothesis that early independent adaptive
      bimanual-to-unimanual training of arm and hand movements, assisted with specially designed
      mechanical devices: the mirrored motion bimanual arm trainer (m2 BAT), will improve motor
      control and function in patients with post-stroke hemiparesis.

      This study will randomly assign individuals admitted to the inpatient stroke rehabilitation
      unit to receive either conventional occupational therapy (OT) or conventional OT plus 1 hour
      additional bimanual-to-unimanual device-assisted therapy.

    <description>Conventional OT plus 1 hour additional bimanual-to-unimanual device-assisted therapy. The m2 BAT will enable repeated movement of the affected body part without the help of a therapist, providing the opportunity to maintain range-of motion in the affected limb to limit spasticity, contracture and the ensuing deformity, a major goal of rehabilitation therapy and produces movement in the affected limb from activating the patient's own brain, rather than from being acted on by an external powered source such as a robot.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Ability to follow study instructions

          -  Ability to likely complete all required visits

          -  Ability to comply with the therapy protocol as assessed by the investigator

          -  Must be English speaking

          -  Subjects must have had a unilateral stroke

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Severe upper extremity spasticity suggested by an Ashworth score of â‰¥3 at any joint,
             or restriction of full passive range of motion.

          -  Evidence of alcohol, drug abuse or other relevant neuropsychiatric condition such as
             psychotic illness or severe depression.

          -  Any condition or situation that, in the investigator's opinion, may put the subject at
             significant risk, confound the study results, or interfere significantly with the
             subject's participation in the study.

          -  History of surgery or other significant injury to either upper extremity causing
             mechanical limitations that preclude task performance.

          -  Previous neurological illness such as head trauma, prior stroke, epilepsy, or
             demyelinating disease.

          -  Complicating medical problems such as uncontrolled hypertension, diabetes with signs
             of polyneuropathy, severe renal, cardiac or pulmonary disease, or evidence of other
             concurrent neurologic or orthopedic conditions precluding the subject from complying
             with the study protocol.

          -  Patients who are cognitively impaired.

          -  Patients who lack capacity to consent.
