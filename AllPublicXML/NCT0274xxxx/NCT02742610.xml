    <textblock>
      This study aims to develop a Mindfulness Smartphone Intervention with Contingency Management
      (MSI-CM) for smoking cessation that can be readily available to depressed smokers receiving
      outpatient psychiatric treatment. This project is expected to result in the development of an
      effective intervention that will produce preliminary data showing increased short-term
      cessation success in depressed smokers receiving outpatient psychiatric treatment. It is
      anticipated that this smoking cessation intervention will have potential for broad reach to
      outpatient psychiatric treatment programs and have a significant overall impact in reducing
      smoking-related morbidity and mortality by enhancing smoking cessation rates in at-risk
      populations.

      The proposed study will develop a Mindfulness Smartphone Intervention with Contingency
      Management (MSI-CM) for smoking cessation that can be readily available to depressed smokers
      receiving outpatient psychiatric treatment. The intervention will involve a series of brief
      mindfulness training that will be delivered via smartphone, that prompts patients to practice
      a mindfulness exercise multiple times a day while abstinent: 1) 10-days prior to their target
      quit date and 2) during the 2-week incentivized abstinence period (using CM) plus an
      additional 2 weeks (without CM) following their target quit date. We will use CM as an
      adjunct strategy to enhance the efficacy of mindfulness training due to its utility in
      producing short-term abstinence, so as to provide opportunities to practice mindfulness
      without smoking in one's natural environment. We will accomplish this objective by pursuing
      the following specific aims (in 2 phases):

      Phase 1: To develop the MSI-CM intervention intended to improve smoking cessation success
      among depressed smokers receiving outpatient psychiatric treatment.

      1a. We will collaborate with TelASK, Inc. to develop a prototype of a smartphone intervention
      (MSI-CM).

      1b. We will conduct preliminary pilot testing of MSI-CM, in an iterative fashion, with 10
      smokers receiving outpatient psychiatric treatment for depression.

      Phase 2: To conduct a preliminary, randomized controlled trial (RCT) with depressed 60
      smokers receiving outpatient psychiatric treatment.

    <description>Self-reports of smoking status and verification via CO will be collected at 2-week, 4-week, and 3-month (cotinine level) post-target quit date assessment. The main outcome analyses are based upon 7-day point prevalence abstinence (PPA). As a secondary approach, we will use the timeline followback (TLFB) procedure for assessing the longitudinal course of smoking outcomes. Our approach permits us to follow the standard NCI and NHLBI guidelines for measurement. Biochemical Verification. Self-reported abstinence will be verified by carbon monoxide (CO) analysis of breath samples (6 ppm cutoff) for abstinence of 24 hours to one week for 3-month follow-up. Values above the cutoff will be considered indicative of smoking.</description>

    <description>The intervention (MSI-CM) will involve two individual pre-quit in-person sessions and two post-quit phone counseling sessions, a series of brief mindfulness trainings that will be delivered via smartphone, that prompts participants to practice a mindfulness exercise five times a day while abstinent during the 2-week incentivized abstinence period (using CM) plus an additional 2 weeks (without CM) following the participant's target quit date. The MSI-CM participants will be asked to provide CO video via smartphone twice daily with monetary incentives provided (CM). Participants will receive monetary incentives contingent on each confirmed CO level (less than 7 ppm) for the CM period. We will use CM as an adjunct strategy to enhance the efficacy of mindfulness training.</description>

    <description>Participants assigned to the control group will receive two individual pre-quit in-person sessions and two post-quit phone counseling sessions, similar to the MSI-CM except for mindfulness introduction/discussion. Participants in the control group will receive the same monetary incentives on average as the participants in the MSI-CM for submitting CO videos, regardless of CO levels (non-abstinent contingent), during the 2-week post-TQD period. Each participant in the group (the non-contingent CO group) will be yoked to a single participant (selected randomly with stratification) in the MSI-CM. The yoked participant receives the same amount of monetary incentives as his or her matched participant in the contingent CO (MSI-CM) group.</description>
