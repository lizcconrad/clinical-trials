  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pain is common after knee replacement surgery and can impact a variety of patient outcomes.
      Peripheral nerve blocks provide improved pain control and may improve function. However,
      their impact on other outcomes is poorly described. Therefore, this comparative effectiveness
      study will estimate the independent association between nerve blocks and health outcomes
      after knee replacement surgery.

      This retrospective, population-based cohort study will evaluate the comparative effectiveness
      of peripheral nerve blocks on patient and health system outcomes after elective total knee
      replacement surgery.

      The investigators will develop a non-parsimonious propensity score to control for potential
      indication bias and confounding in this observational study. Using the propensity score the
      investigators will match patients who receive a peripheral nerve block to a patient who did
      not to estimate the independent association of peripheral nerve blocks with our study
      outcomes.
