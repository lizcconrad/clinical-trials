  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of the Dengue vaccine in a
      population of special interest, such as HIV-positive adults.

      Primary Objective:

        -  To describe the safety of each injection of CYD dengue vaccine in HIV-positive adults.

      Secondary Objectives:

        -  To describe the humoral immune response to each dengue serotype at baseline and after
           each injection of CYD dengue vaccine in HIV-positive adults.

        -  To detect the CYD dengue vaccinal viremia post-Inj 1 in HIV-positive adults.

        -  To describe changes in CD4 count and HIV RNA viral load after each injection of CYD
           dengue vaccine in HIV-positive adults.

      Observational Objective:

        -  To describe the FV (YF, Dengue) serological status in the study population at baseline.

    <textblock>
      Eligible subjects will be randomized in a 2:1 ratio into 1 of 2 groups to receive 3
      injections of either CYD dengue vaccine or placebo at 0, 6, and 12 months. The enrollment of
      subjects will be carried out in two steps, including an early safety data review before the
      second step. The duration of each subject's participation in the study will be approximately
      18 months.
