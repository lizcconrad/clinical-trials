  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Nowadays, the proportion of patients with locally advanced gastric cancer is estimated up to
      90 percent of all gastric cancer cases in Russian Federation. Surgical procedure with D2
      Lymphadenectomy is the main option for treatment. Conventional open approach is still the
      current standard for advanced gastric cancer. Laparoscopic procedures for gastric cancer as
      minimally invasive surgery has gained popularity for the treatment of early gastric cancer in
      East Asia. Several studies indicated that laparoscopic procedures both total and subtotal
      gastrectomy with D2 lymphadenectomy is a technically feasible and safe procedure by
      experienced surgeons in high-volume specialized hospitals. However, lack of solid evidence on
      the oncologic efficacy.

      Starting clinical trials for evaluate safety of oncology laparoscopic subtotal gastrectomy
      for locally advanced gastric cancer. Aim of this trial is show safety, feasibility and
      oncologic efficacy of Laparoscopic radical surgical procedures both total and subtotal
      gastrectomy for treatment gastric cancer.

    <description>&quot;Major&quot; Surgical morbidity is defined as the complication grade on III-V Clavien-Dindo Classification which occurs with-in postoperative 21 days, extension of hospitalization and re-hospitalization. It is necessary to evaluate the complication and if it occurs during the hospitalization, it is required to record complication name, date of on-set (postoperatively), grade on Clavien-Dindo Classification and treatment for complication.</description>

    <time_frame>21days - 36 months after surgery</time_frame>
    <description>Surgical morbidity is defined as the events which occurs with-in postoperative 21 days - 36 months after surgery. It is necessary to evaluate the complication, it is required to record complication name, date of on-set. Long complications are included: hernia, bleeding, bowel obstruction etc.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Extent of lymph node dissection</measure>
    <time_frame>2 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The extent of lymph node dissection in treatment of gastric cancer is considered a prognostic marker for postoperative survival and disease-free survival. Before implementation of a new surgical technique, it is imperative that this technique is non-inferior with regard to the extent of lymph node dissection. Measures will include the number of resected lymph nodes and the number of resected lymph node stations.</description>
