  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study was a randomized clinical trial lasting for 24 months in two study sites, Hong
      Kong (water fluoridated) and Guangzhou (non-fluoridated area). A total of 534 subjects will
      be recruited from elderly social centers located in different districts in the two study
      sites (260 &amp; 274). Baseline clinical examination was conducted by a single calibrated
      examiner in the social centers using an intra-oral LED light, mouth mirrors and probes.
      Subjects were randomly allocated into two study groups and receive interventions accordingly.
      Follow-up examinations at 6-month intervals were carried out to assess the clinical outcomes,
      i.e. whether new root caries developed and whether the active root caries found at baseline
      become arrested. Results of this study could provide the much needed evidence to guide the
      dental professionals in Hong Kong and China, and possibly worldwide in deciding on the most
      appropriate intervention for the prevention and management of this common dental disease of
      the older adults.

      The primary and secondary outcome of this study was new root caries and arrested root caries.
      A root surface with new caries experience was recorded when a root surface which was sound at
      baseline was found to have a carious lesion or a filling at a follow-up examination. Arrested
      root caries was recorded when the active root caries found at baseline changed into inactive
      root caries at follow-up. The status of each root surface was recorded using the codes
      recommended by the International Caries Detection and Assessment System (ICDAS â…¡)
      Coordinating Committee in 2009.

      A mean root caries increment of around 0.8 root surface per year of control group was
      reported in a previous clinical trial conducted in Hong Kong. Thus, in this study, a 24-month
      increment of 1.6 new decayed root surfaces and a standard deviation of 2 was anticipated. In
      order to show that a 50% difference in mean caries increment between the test and control
      groups was statistically significant using a 2-sample t-test at a 5% significance level and
      at an 80% power, a sample size of 100 subjects in each group was required. Allowing for a
      drop-out rate of 20% over 24 months, a total of 480 subjects (120 in each group each site)
      were needed.

    <description>Distilled water as placebo with a bitter flavor added (to mimic the bitter metallic taste of SDF) was painted onto all exposed tooth root surfaces using a small disposable brush. This procedure will be repeated after 12 and 24 months.In addition, instructions on oral hygiene (OHI) tailored to the individual's condition was given, and a tube of toothpaste containing 1,000 ppm fluoride (the most popular type of adult toothpaste in the Hong Kong market) was provided. The OHI and provision of toothpaste will be repeated at 6-month intervals.</description>
