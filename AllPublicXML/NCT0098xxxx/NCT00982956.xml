      Objective:

      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the application of computer-assisted navigation in
      Total Knee Arthroplasty (TKA ) by comparing it with conventional TKA.

      Methods:

      Gemini MK II implants (Link, Germany) were used. VectorVision√¢ CT-free navigation system
      (BrainLab, Germany) was employed for the TKA. For each subject, computer-navigation TKA and
      the conventional TKA were separately performed on two knee joints. The operative method and
      order of the operations were decided on a randomized basis. All the patients and doctors
      conducting follow-up study and performing imaging measurement were blind to selection of the
      operation. Student t test was used for statistical analysis.

      hypothesis: computer-assisted navigation system can significantly improve the accuracy of
      tibial and femoral cuts on coronal and sagittal planes.
