  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main objective of the study is to evaluate the effectiveness, tolerability, and safety of
      tapentadol hydrochloride prolonged release (PR) in participants suffering from severe chronic
      pain due to osteoarthritis of the knee who are taking WHO Step III analgesics and show lack
      of tolerability. This is a clinical effectiveness trial designed to establish a link between
      anticipated clinical outcomes and the clinical practice by means of selected measures of
      clinical and subject-reported outcome. The trial will compare the effectiveness of previous
      analgesic treatment (WHO Step III) with that of tapentadol hydrochloride PR treatment during
      defined periods of evaluation.

      The trial will last up to 13 weeks for each subject and includes:

        -  One week of observation under previous analgesic treatment.

        -  Twelve weeks of treatment with tapentadol hydrochloride PR.

    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Western Ontario McMaster Questionnaire (WOMAC) Global Score: WOMAC is measured with a Likert ordinal scale (the participant gives one of 5 possible answers) A higher score indicate that a symptom is bothersome or disabling. The WOMAC is a self-administered questionnaire and has 24 questions: Pain, Stiffness and Physical Function. The possible scores range from 0-20 for pain, 0-8 for stiffness, 0-68 for physical function and these are then summed 0-96 for the global score. A lower score indicates a lower level of symptoms and or disability.</description>

    <description>The participant scored the EuroQol-5. This is a five dimensional health state classification. Each dimension is assessed on a 3-point ordinal scale (1=no problems, 2=some problems, 3=extreme problems). The responses to the five EQ-5D dimensions were scored using a utility-weighted algorithm to derive an EQ-5D health status index score between 0 to 1, with 1.00 indicating &quot;full health&quot; and 0 representing dead. The positive values indicate that during the study the health status improved.</description>

    <participant_flow>
      <recruitment_details>The enrollment of the first participant was on the 02 October 2009 and was prematurely terminated, due to slow recruitment, on 12 August 2010 (when the last subject completed the last follow-up examination).</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>The Trial had a duration of 13 weeks. The one week Observation Period did not involve dosing with Tapentadol. For Tapentadol analyses purposes the first 6 weeks of dosing with Tapentadol are reported as one period, Titration and Optimal Dose Period. The last 6 weeks on Tapentadol are reported as the Maintenance Period.</pre_assignment_details>

          <title>Tapentadol PR</title>
          <description>All participants started with either 50 mg, 100 mg or 150 mg tapentadol hydrochloride PR (twice daily). The dose of tapentadol hydrochloride PR was adjusted to a level that provided adequate analgesia (upwards or downwards on a weekly basis as needed). After 5 weeks the doses of tapentadol hydrochloride PR was kept stable. Participants were permitted a maximum dose of 250 mg twice a day (500 mg total daily dose). Tapentadol hydrochloride IR 50 mg (no more than twice daily; at least 4 hours apart) was considered as medication for acute pain episodes however, participants were not permitted to dose tapentadol hydrochloride IR once 500 mg tapentadol hydrochloride PR dose was reached.</description>

        <description>For this pain assessment, the participant was to indicate the level of average pain experienced over the previous 3 days on an 11-point Numerical Rating Scale(NRS) where a score of 0 indicated &quot;no pain&quot; and a score of 10 indicated &quot;pain as bad as you can imagine&quot;.</description>

            <description>All participants started with either 50 mg, 100 mg or 150 mg tapentadol hydrochloride PR (twice daily). The dose of tapentadol hydrochloride PR was adjusted to a level that provided adequate analgesia (upwards or downwards on a weekly basis as needed). After 5 weeks the doses of tapentadol hydrochloride PR was kept stable. Participants were permitted a maximum dose of 250 mg twice a day (500 mg total daily dose). Tapentadol hydrochloride IR 50 mg (no more than twice daily; at least 4 hours apart) was considered as medication for acute pain episodes however, participants were not permitted to dose tapentadol hydrochloride IR once 500 mg tapentadol hydrochloride PR dose was reached.</description>

The WOMAC is a self-administered questionnaire and has 24 questions: Pain, Stiffness and Physical Function. The possible scores range from 0-20 for pain, 0-8 for stiffness, 0-68 for physical function and these are then summed 0-96 for the global score. A lower score indicates a lower level of symptoms and or disability.</description>

Each dimension is assessed on a 3-point ordinal scale (1=no problems, 2=some problems, 3=extreme problems). The responses to the five EQ-5D dimensions were scored using a utility-weighted algorithm to derive an EQ-5D health status index score between 0 to 1, with 1.00 indicating &quot;full health&quot; and 0 representing dead. The positive values indicate that during the study the health status improved.</description>

The responses to the five EQ-5D dimensions were scored using a utility-weighted algorithm to derive an EQ-5D health status index score between 0 to 1, with 1.00 indicating &quot;full health&quot; and 0 representing dead.

        <description>EuroQoL-5D Health State Visual Analog Scale (VAS) is a participant rated questionnaire to assess health-related quality of life in terms of a single index value. The VAS component rates current health state on a scale from 0 (worst imaginable health state) to 100 (best imaginable health state); higher scores indicate a better health state. The values indicated represent the change from the baseline, a positive value indicates an improvement.</description>

The dose of tapentadol hydrochloride PR was adjusted to a level that provided adequate analgesia (upwards or downwards on a weekly basis as needed).
