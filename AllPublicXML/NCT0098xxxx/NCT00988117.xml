      This is an open-label study to investigate the effects of the rivastigmine patch on attention
      and behavior in Parkinson's disease when associated with memory and/or thinking problems.
      Rivastigmine (also sold under the name Exelon) is an FDA approved medication used for the
      treatment of mild to moderate Alzheimer's Disease (AD) and memory or thinking problems due to
      Parkinson's disease. Recently a rivastigmine patch was developed, which has shown similar
      effectiveness with fewer side effects and increased caregiver preference when compared to
      capsules. This is an open-label 12 week study where 15 subjects diagnosed with Parkinson's
      Disease who have mild to moderate memory and/or thinking complaints will be treated with the
      rivastigmine patch at UCSF. This study also analyzes the mechanism by which the rivastigmine
      patch works in people with Parkinson's disease and memory and/or thinking problems.

      Participation in this study requires four visits: a screening visit to ensure eligibility, an
      initial/baseline visit where the medication is distributed at a dosage lower than the optimal
      recommended dosage, a four week follow-up visit where the dosage of the medication is
      increased to the optimal amount, and a final twelve week follow up visit.

        -  In the screening visit the patient will undergo a neurological exam (including a review
           of their medical history and short physical exam), electrocardiogram ( a painless
           procedure that measures electrical activity of your heart), cognitive testing (such as
           memory and thinking tests), and a blood draw.

        -  At the Baseline/Initial visit the patient will receive a brief physical exam, additional
           cognitive testing, and an MRI scan. Afterwards, the study drug will be distributed.

        -  At the four week follow up visit the patient will be asked to do some abbreviated
           cognitive and neurological testing and the study drug will be re-distributed at the
           target dosage.

        -  At the final twelve week visit the patient will receive additional cognitive and
           neurological testing, and an MRI scan.

        -  Study compliance and adverse events will be reviewed every two weeks throughout the
           study, whether in person or over the phone.

    <measure>Resting State Functional Activity Change From Baseline to 12 Weeks</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Fractional amplitude of low frequency fluctuations (fALFF) was used to measure brain activity. This metric is derived from task-free functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and represents the power of regional spontaneous and intrinsic brain activity at the local, voxel-wise level while the subject is at rest. More specifically, the amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations (ALFF) is the total power in the low-frequency range, and fALFF is calculated by dividing ALFF by the total power across all measurable frequencies. Whereas ALFF values increase near blood vessels and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), likely due to pulsations in those areas, fALFF is less susceptible to artifactual signals. We measured change in these ratio scores post-treatment minus baseline and present in z-score units.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Pre-post Change in Continuous Performance Test of Attention (Median Reaction Time)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>On the Continuous Performance Test (CPT), subjects press the spacebar quickly when they see a target image (a white star; 150 trials), and withhold response when they see a non-target image (5 randomly sampled white shapes; 150 trials). The inter-stimulus interval is randomly sampled from 1.5s, 2.5s, or 4s. Performance is measured by the median reaction time (milliseconds) on accurate target trials.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline and 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) was used as measure of global cognitive function. Total scores range from 0 (worst) to 30 (best).</description>

        <title>Resting State Functional Activity Change From Baseline to 12 Weeks</title>
        <description>Fractional amplitude of low frequency fluctuations (fALFF) was used to measure brain activity. This metric is derived from task-free functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and represents the power of regional spontaneous and intrinsic brain activity at the local, voxel-wise level while the subject is at rest. More specifically, the amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations (ALFF) is the total power in the low-frequency range, and fALFF is calculated by dividing ALFF by the total power across all measurable frequencies. Whereas ALFF values increase near blood vessels and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), likely due to pulsations in those areas, fALFF is less susceptible to artifactual signals. We measured change in these ratio scores post-treatment minus baseline and present in z-score units.</description>

fALFF group comparisons were evaluated using t-tests corrected for multiple comparisons. To determine if there were treatment-associated changes in brain activity, we compared voxel-wise fALFF in the patients at baseline to post-treatment.</groups_desc>
