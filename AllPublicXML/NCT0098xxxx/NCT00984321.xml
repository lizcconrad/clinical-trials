  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to examine whether psychoeducation counseling for older cancer
      patients undergoing treatment is feasible and worthwhile. The investigators will test this in
      a group or individual phone counseling format. Many cancer patients seek counseling to help
      with the emotional burden of their illnesses. Counseling often helps them cope with cancer by
      giving them a place to express their feelings. This geriatric-specific psychoeducation is
      intended to help older cancer patients cope with the burden of cancer and aging. The purpose
      of this study is to see if this type of counseling helps reduce depressive symptoms, anxiety,
      perception of loneliness and isolation. In addition this counseling aims to improve coping
      and quality of life (QOL).

      Individuals who choose not to take part in the intervention study will be asked if they are
      willing to participate in a brief refusal sub study. The purpose of the refusal substudy is
      to compare levels of distress in patients that choose to participate and those that decline.
      This will yield valuable data that will help us distinguish between patients that decline due
      to lack of interest in research and those that decline due to high levels of distress.
      Participation in the refusal sub study consists of completion of 2 brief questionnaires.

    <description>Group Session will be 90 minutes long. Both the group sessions and individual session will be audio recorded. GSPI is a novel, manualized psychoeducational intervention that integrates Folkman's cognitive construct and Erikson's developmental concept of the 7th and 8th stages of life. GSPI consist of 5 weekly sessions. The first 2 sessions will be held on consecutive weeks to help establish rapport and explain therapeutic concepts, and next 3 sessions will be held every other week, giving patients time to utilize the therapeutic concepts and expanding length of contact with the patient.</description>

    <description>intervention facilitate &quot;reappraisal&quot; through the exploration of past life events and prior successful ways of coping. Preliminary studies examining the efficacy of this writing intervention have shown its' ability to introduce patients to a new and effective coping method that can be utilized during future stressful cancer and aging related events.67 In the sessions, Wwe will explore past life events and ways of coping through manualized writing sessions.</description>

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Have a diagnosis of prostate, breast cancer lung, lymphoma, or gynecological.

          -  Are receiving active treatment (e.g., radiation, hormone, or chemotherapy)or have been
             receiving treatment in the past 6 months for prostate, breast, lung, lymphoma, or
             gynecological cancer

          -  Are 70 years old or older

          -  Greater than 6-months post diagnosis

          -  Have a Distress Thermometer score of 4 or greater or

        a score of â‰¥ 6 on the Depression or Anxiety subscale of the HADS

          -  Have a Karnofsky Performance Rating of 60 or greater

          -  In the investigator's judgment, participants must have satisfactory cognitive function
             to provide valid informed consent and participate in Geriatric Specific
             Psychoeducational Intervention. The Blessed Orientation-Memory-Concentration test
             (BOMC) will be used as a cognitive screening tool. Patients must have a BOMC score of
             less than or equal to 11.

          -  Able to converse, write and read in English. The questionnaires were designed and
             validated in English and are not currently available in other languages. Translation
             of questionnaires into other languages would require a very lengthy process of
             reestablishing the reliability and validity and the establishment of norms for these
             measures. Therefore, participants must be able to communicate in English to complete
             the questionnaires.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Significant psychiatric disturbance sufficient, in the investigator's judgment, to
             preclude participation in the intervention (e.g., acute psychiatric symptoms which
             requires individual treatment).

          -  As per self-report or review of the patient's medical record, if the patient is taking
             anti-depressant medication, fewer than three months on the same dose of
             anti-depressant medication.

          -  Actively participating in protocol 07-094 or 11-021
