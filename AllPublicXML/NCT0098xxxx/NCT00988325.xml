  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will assess the pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics and safety of oseltamivir
      [Tamiflu] therapy in infants less than 1 year of age with influenza diagnosed in the 96 hours
      prior to the first dose. Patients age 3-12 months will receive 3 mg/kg, 1-3 months will
      receive 2.5 mg/kg, and birth to 1 month will receive 2 mg/kg twice a day for a total of 10
      doses. Patients positive for influenza virus on Day 6 will be eligible to receive continued
      study treatment for an additional 10 doses (5 days). The anticipated time on study treatment
      is 4 weeks, and the target sample size is 65-85 male and female infants.

The rate of decline of body temperature was calculated as the slope of body temperature between the baseline temperature and the 1st temperature below 37°C. Participants with decline in body temperature were considered to have no fever; however, participants who did not show any decline in body temperature were considered to have persisting fever.</description>

    <time_frame>Up to 3 days after the last dose of oseltamivir (Approximately 14 days)</time_frame>
    <description>An Adverse Event (AEs) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a participant or clinical investigation participant, temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered to be related to the medicinal product. An Serious Adverse Event (SAE) is any untoward medical occurrence that, at any dose, results in death, is life threatening, requires hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, results in disability/incapacity, or results in a congenital anomaly/birth defect. Secondary illnesses were influenza disease-related events, namely bronchitis, pneumonia, otitis media, and sinusitis that resolved without sequelae. Adverse events, serious adverse events, and secondary illness are reported for on-treatment period (from the first dose of oseltamivir upto 3 days after the last dose of oseltamivir [Approximately 14 days].</description>

Each scale consists of 3 subscales: eye opening (ranging 1 to 4), verbal response (ranging 1 to 5), and motor responses (ranging 1 to 6). The final score is the sum of these ranges and is scored between 3 and 15. 3 being the worst, and 15 the best. Change from baseline is change of final score post-baseline minus the final score at baseline.</description>

        <description>An Adverse Event (AEs) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a participant or clinical investigation participant, temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered to be related to the medicinal product. An Serious Adverse Event (SAE) is any untoward medical occurrence that, at any dose, results in death, is life threatening, requires hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, results in disability/incapacity, or results in a congenital anomaly/birth defect. Secondary illnesses were influenza disease-related events, namely bronchitis, pneumonia, otitis media, and sinusitis that resolved without sequelae. Adverse events, serious adverse events, and secondary illness are reported for on-treatment period (from the first dose of oseltamivir upto 3 days after the last dose of oseltamivir [Approximately 14 days].</description>
