  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to see if using a device called the Resonator, that puts out
      very low level electromagnetic fields, effects blood glucose and A1c levels in people with
      Type 2 Diabetes.

  <detailed_description>

      The purpose of this pilot study is to determine whether application of magnetic fields
      generated by the Resonator TM, as an adjunctive therapy to oral medications results in
      statistically significant reductions in fasting blood glucose levels, post prandial glucose
      levels and hemoglobin A1c levels. The study will also investigate any induced changes in
      serum lipids.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Current diagnosis of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus with a hemoglobin A1c level above 7.5%,
             despite management of diabetes with diet and/or medication.

          -  Subject currently performs routine finger stick blood sugar testing as part of his or
             her current diabetes disease management regimen.

          -  Subject is ambulatory

          -  Subject is on stable oral medication regimen without significant side effects for at
             least three (3) months (stable insulin regimen NOT permissible); willingness and
             ability to maintain the stable oral medication regimen throughout the course of the
             study. If on agents suspected of contributing to hyperglycemia(see list below),
             subject must have been on a stable dose of this(these) agent(s) for 6 months prior to
             study initiation.

          -  Hemoglobin A1c levels within a 0.8 % range of patient mean A1c level for the last two
             documented determinations, that must be within 2 years of the baseline testing date.

          -  Willingness to test finger stick blood sugars according to prescribed protocol.

          -  Willingness to have lab test blood draws performed according to prescribed protocol

          -  Willingness to maintain stable diet and activity regimen for the duration of the
             study.

          -  Willing and able to abstain from partaking in any non-essential (not physician
             ordered) existing or new treatments to improve serum blood sugar levels

          -  Willing and able to abstain from all medications that could affect diabetes mellitus
             and/or any of its associated symptoms for the duration of the study

          -  Adequate contraceptive measures for females subjects

          -  Any ethnic background

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Change in medical regimen within 3 months prior to initiation of study.

          -  Any signs of type 1 diabetes mellitus (including any history of ketoacidosis or new
             requirement for insulin therapy within the 6 month period prior to study initiation).

          -  Active significant infectious process within 3 weeks of study initiation causing wide
             fluctuations in finger stick blood sugar level

          -  Change in BMI of greater than 6 % within a 3 month period prior to study initiation

          -  Any planned revascularization procedure.

          -  Symptomatic congestive heart failure.

          -  Leg or foot ulceration or open wounds

          -  Gangrene.

          -  History of intermittent claudication

          -  Hemodialysis

          -  Currently being treated for malignancy

          -  Currently being treated with oral or intravenous catabolic steroids

          -  Reported consumption of more than 14 alcoholic drinks per week.

          -  Pregnant, breast feeding, or planning pregnancy prior to the end of participation

          -  Developmental disability or cognitive impairment that would make it difficult for the
             subject to partake in the clinical study, including adequate comprehension of the
             informed consent form and ability to record the necessary measurements

          -  Uncontrolled hypertension

          -  Uncontrolled atrial fibrillation or other uncontrolled arrythmias, e.g. tachycardia,
             bradycardia

          -  Uncontrolled seizure disorder

          -  Uncontrolled, unstable, or untreated medical conditions which may significantly impact
             the subject's health or ability to complete the entire study, in the opinion of the
             investigator.
