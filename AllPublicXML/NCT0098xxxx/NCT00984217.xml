  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Standard therapy for high-risk or locally advanced salivary gland malignancies is surgery
      followed by postoperative radiation therapy. Retrospective studies have shown the superiority
      of combined modality therapy compared to surgery alone for patients with advanced T or N
      stage. Despite the addition of postoperative radiation therapy, the five-year survival for
      locally advanced salivary gland malignancies is poor (less than 60%). In salivary gland
      malignancies, the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is expressed in 25-85%; in certain
      histological types, like salivary duct carcinomas, the expression is higher. EGFR is a
      promising target of anticancer therapy. In squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck, a
      phase III trial utilizing cetuximab added to radiation therapy improved both locoregional
      control and overall survival compared to radiation alone. Panitumumab is a novel, human, IgG2
      EGFR monoclonal antibody that may be better tolerated and more efficacious than cetuximab.
      Here, the investigators suggest that the addition of panitumumab to standard radiotherapy in
      locally-advanced salivary gland malignancies will improve recurrence-free survival (RFS).

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Pathologically determined salivary gland cancer of the major or minor salivary glands
             of the head and neck (any histology) status post potentially curative surgical
             resection with no macroscopic residual disease. Patients should have AJCC 6th edition
             stage III with:

               1. extracapsular extension,

               2. perineural invasion,

               3. positive surgical margins or

               4. high grade histology (i.e., high grade mucoepidermoid carcinoma, adenocarcinoma
                  except basal cell adenocarcinoma, salivary duct carcinoma, squamous cell
                  carcinoma, or adenoid cystic carcinoma) or stage IVA or IVB.

          -  No distant metastasis.

          -  No prior chemotherapy, biologic/targeted therapy (including any prior therapy which
             specifically and directly targets the EGFR pathway), or radiotherapy for head and neck
             cancer.

          -  No more than 10 weeks (minimum of 3 weeks) should elapse between surgery and treatment
             on study.

          -  ECOG performance status of 0-2

          -  Patients must have normal organ and marrow function as defined below:

               -  Absolute neutrophil count: Greater than or equal to 1500/uL

               -  Platelets: Greater than or equal to 100,000/uL

               -  Hemoglobin: Greater than or equal to 10g/dL

               -  Total bilirubin: &lt; 1.5x normal institutional limits

               -  Creatinine clearance: &gt; 45 mL/min

               -  Magnesium level: &gt; lower limit normal

          -  No prior invasive malignancy unless the disease-free survival is 3 years or more.

          -  Age greater than or equal to 18 years

          -  Pregnant or breast-feeding women are excluded (see exclusion criteria).

          -  Informed consent must be obtained from all patients prior to beginning therapy.
             Patients should have the ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written
             informed consent document.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active
             infection or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with
             study requirements.

          -  Significant history of uncontrolled cardiac disease; i.e., uncontrolled hypertension,
             unstable angina, recent myocardial infarction (within prior 6 months), uncontrolled
             congestive heart failure, and cardiomyopathy with decreased ejection fraction. All
             patients will have a baseline EKG. If abnormalities consistent with active coronary
             artery disease are detected, the patient will be referred to a cardiologist for
             appropriate evaluation and management prior to treatment on study.

          -  Patients may not be receiving any other investigational agents.

          -  No history of prior malignancy, with the exception of basal carcinoma of the skin or
             in situ cervical cancer, or malignancy that has been treated with a curative intent
             with a 3-year disease-free survival.

          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because chemotherapy and radiation therapy
             have the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects. Because there is an
             unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to
             treatment of the mother with chemotherapy, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the
             mother is treated with chemotherapy. Prior to study enrollment, women of childbearing
             potential (WOCBP) must be advised of the importance of avoiding pregnancy during trial
             participation and the potential risk factors for an unintentional pregnancy. In
             addition, men enrolled on this study should understand the risks to any sexual partner
             of childbearing potential and should practice an effective method of birth control.

               -  All WOCBP MUST have a negative urine pregnancy test at baseline, or within 7 days
                  prior to receiving investigational product. The minimum sensitivity of the
                  pregnancy test must be 25 IU/L or equivalent units of HCG. If the urine pregnancy
                  test is positive, a serum pregnancy test will then be performed to confirm the
                  result. In the event that both the urine and serum pregnancy tests are positive,
                  the subject must not receive investigational product and must not be enrolled in
                  the study.

               -  In addition, all WOCBP should be instructed to contact the Investigator
                  immediately if they suspect they might be pregnant (e.g., missed or late
                  menstrual period) at any time during study participation.

               -  The Investigator must immediately notify Amgen in the event of a confirmed
                  pregnancy in a patient participating in the study.

          -  Prior severe infusion reaction to a human monoclonal antibody.

          -  Prior radiotherapy, chemotherapy or EGFR inhibitor for head and neck cancer.
