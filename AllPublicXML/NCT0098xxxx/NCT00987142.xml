    <textblock>
      A phase II, comparative, open label, prospective, multicentre clinical trial where each
      patient will undergo two procedures; implant of a patch of cultured chimeric skin
      (experimental therapy) in a half of the skin lesion and an occlusive non-adherent dressing
      (control) in the other half for 12 months of follow-up in two Spanish centres.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Reconstruction of interdigital commisures in patients with severe skin syndactyly using
      laminar grafts that will be uniformly and systematically taken with an electrical or
      compressed air dermatome on an aseptic area and with the same extent and depth in microns in
      all patients.

      Immediately after the surgical procedure, a patch of cultured chimeric skin (experimental
      therapy) will be implanted in a half of the skin defect of the patient, and an occlusive non
      - adherent dressing (control) will be implanted in the other half.

      Patients will initially be followed up every two days until epithelisation occurs
      (approximately 21 days after surgery) and at 3,8,and 12 months of follow-up.

        Inclusion criteria:

          -  Patients of both sexes over 28 days of age.

          -  Patients with recessive dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa diagnosed by clinical and
             historical criteria with severe skin syndactyly in whom reconstructive surgery is
             indicated.

          -  Patients whose legal guardians have given written informed consent for participation
             in the study before any study procedure is performed.

          -  Patients aged ≥ 12 years who have given written informed consent for participation in
             the study before any study procedure is performed.

        Exclusion criteria:

          -  Women of childbearing age not using effective contraceptive methods (oral
             contraception)

          -  Pregnant or nursing women

          -  Patients with a history of clinically relevant hepatic, gastrointestinal,
             haematological, pulmonary, or neurological disease no directly related to
             epidermolysis bullosa.

          -  Any other medical condition which, in the investigator´s judgment, might interfere
             with optimal participation in the study or involve a significant risk for the patient.
