  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Newly diagnosed hyperglycemia (NDH) and stress hyperglycemia (SH) during acute illness is
      reported as a non-physiological condition in hospitals. The investigators aim is to determine
      the rate of NDH and SH among cases admitted to coronary ICU with acute coronary disease and
      to inquire the relationship of SH with disease severity and functional outcomes such as
      longevity of ICU stay.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with acute coronary heart disease admitted to the emergency room will be recruited
      consecutively. Admission plasma glucose (APG) and fasting plasma glucose (FPG); the first
      morning after admission, measurements will be obtained and each participant will be subjected
      to capillary glucose measurement (CGM) every six hours within the first day.

      Patients will be separated into 4 groups:

      GROUP 1: Normoglycemic cases GROUP 2: Newly diagnosed hyperglycemic cases Group 2a:
      Unrecognized diabetes, hbA1c: &gt;6.0% Group 2b: Stress hyperglycemia &lt;6.0%. GROUP 3: Known
      diabetes Age, gender, co-morbidities on admission, adverse outcomes in hospital, duration of
      stay in coronary ICU, deaths, drugs, and glucose levels will be all recorded.

      Throughout the hospital stay of Group 2 and Group 3, CGMs were performed and treated when
      necessary (target glucose&lt;180mg/dl).

      Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II (APACHE-II); a severity of disease
      classification system was used for each case.
