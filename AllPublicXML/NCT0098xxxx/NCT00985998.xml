      Nimotuzumab (hR3) is an IgG1 humanized monoclonal antibody that recognized an epitope located
      in the extra cellular domain of the human epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). Clinical
      efficacy has been shown in adult with head and neck cancer. The study assessed the safety,
      and efficacy of the combination of Nimotuzumab administered concomitantly with chemotherapy
      in patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Altered expression or constitutive activation of the epidermal growth factor receptor
      (EGFR/HER1/erbB1) commonly occurs in primary NSCLC, and is often a critical factor in
      progressive growth and resistance to normal mechanisms of cell death. Epidermal growth factor
      receptor expression in lung cancer has been correlated with tumor aggressiveness. Clinical
      trials already suggest that EGFR targeted therapy may improve the antitumor activity of
      chemotherapy for treatment of lung carcinoma. Monoclonal antibodies specific to EGFR can be
      combined safely and effectively with chemotherapy. Nimotuzumab (hR3) is a humanized
      monoclonal antibody (mAb) that binds to the EGFR. In preclinical studies the antibody has
      shown potent antitumor activity. A previous phase II study in children with high grade brain
      tumors showed activity of Nimotuzumab as a monotherapeutic agent, even in prognostic very
      unfavourable diffuse, intrinsic pontine glioma. No drug related side effects were reported.
      Nimotuzumab (hR3) in combination with radiotherapy for treatment of locally advanced squamous
      cell carcinomas of the head and neck resulted in high rates of antitumor response, and was
      accompanied by a favourable safety profile.

      This is a dose-escalation study of Nimotuzumab. Nimotuzumab in combination with chemotherapy
      will be administered to the patients with advanced NSCLC. The patients' blood test and liver
      and renal function tests will be monitored weekly, a physical exam and reassessment of the
      tumor will be performed and every 6 weeks. When the total result is the CR or PR, the results
      of the 6th, 12th, 18th and the 22th week should be compared.
