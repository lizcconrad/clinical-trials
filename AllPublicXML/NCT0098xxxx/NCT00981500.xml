  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators wish to study the effects of three forms of bariatric surgery: Roux-en-Y
      gastric bypass, Sleeve Gastrectomy, and Gastric Banding. The surgery is not part of the
      clinical trial. If your insurance does not cover the procedure, then you are responsible for
      payment of the surgical process. We are doing pre and post surgery testing to provide a
      better understanding of the effect of bariatric surgery-induced weight loss on metabolic
      function.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Bariatric surgery is the most effective weight loss therapy for obesity. Moreover, the early
      improvement in insulin sensitivity and the resolution of type 2 diabetes after bariatric
      surgery has led to the hypothesis that bariatric surgery has specific beneficial effects on
      glucose homeostasis beyond weight loss alone. However, this hypothesis has never been
      adequately evaluated in human subjects. Therefore, the primary goal of this proposal is to
      provide a better understanding of the effect of bariatric surgery-induced weight loss on
      insulin action and pancreatic beta cell function.
