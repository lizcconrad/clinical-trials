    <textblock>
      A functional outcomes comparison study of three surgical techniques using minimally invasive
      surgery mini-incision (MIS) for total knee arthroplasty (TKA), standard para-patellar TKA and
      the unicompartmental knee arthroplasty performed over a 2+ year post-op period.

      The purpose of this research study is to compare post-operative knee function of persons who
      have undergone one of three types of knee arthroplasty for the treatment of knee
      osteoarthritis. A variety of functional performance tests will be assessed and compared using
      a group of evaluations including: functional activity performance tests and questionnaires;
      leg strength; knee range of motion; and forces at the knee during a series of activities
      (walking, bending, stepping etc.) via a motion analysis system. The study will compare the
      three surgical subject groups and one group of healthy, non-surgical subjects for a total of
      100 subjects.

        TKA subjects:

        Subjects will be selected and recruited from the MGH Arthroplasty Clinic. The surgical
        decision for TKA approach will be made prior to recruitment for the study.

        Healthy persons:

        Healthy subjects will be recruited through orthopedic departmental advertisement flyers and
        by word of mouth.

          -  TKA subjects:

               1. Patients requiring primary knee arthroplasty;

               2. Knee osteoarthritis;

               3. Subject has sufficient quantity or quality of bone support;

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Insufficient quantity or quality of bone support resulting from conditions such as

          5. Subject has an immunological disorder: immunosuppressive treatment characterized by
             markedly inhibited ability to respond to antigenic stimuli. Examples of such
             conditions include Subjects who are on immunosuppressive therapy (corticosteroid
             hormones in large amounts, cytotoxic drugs, antilymphocytic serum or irradiation in
             large doses), Subjects receiving therapy to prevent homograft rejection, Subjects who
             have a documented history of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), or auto-immune
             diseases;

          6. Subject has a neurologic condition that would influence the results of biomechanical
