      The study was designed to evaluate the pattern of seasonal allergic signs and symptoms
      consistent with ongoing ocular allergic inflammation during ragweed season. It was
      hypothesized that a pattern of ongoing ocular allergic inflammation existed in certain
      subjects.

      Subjects who had a positive skin test to ragweed within 24 months of Visit 1 were instructed
      to complete a diary, which assessed their allergic signs and symptoms 3 times a day for 4
      weeks. During the in-office visits, subjects were asked to completed a quality of life
      questionnaire, as well as a retrospective and/or prospective eye allergy questionnaire.
