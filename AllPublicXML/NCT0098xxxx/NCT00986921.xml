    <textblock>
      Women who are requesting pregnancy termination at 14-16 weeks, who would normally have
      osmotic dilator insertion the day before their procedure, would be asked if they wanted to
      participate. Participants would be randomized to two groups: first, dilator insertion as
      usual, or second, mifepristone taken the day before the procedure.

    <measure>Assessment of Ease of Procedure by Operator</measure>
    <time_frame>It is administered shortly after the primary outcome, which is one day after enrollment. The study is complete at that point.</time_frame>
    <description>The operator for each procedure rated the ease of procedure on a categorical scale. The categories were collapsed into two: &quot;easy or very easy&quot; and &quot;average or difficult&quot;.</description>
