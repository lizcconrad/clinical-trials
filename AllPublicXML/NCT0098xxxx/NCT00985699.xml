      RATIONALE: Studying samples of tissue from patients with cancer in the laboratory may help
      doctors learn more about changes that occur in DNA and identify biomarkers related to cancer.

      PURPOSE: This research study is looking at genes in tissue samples from patients with B-cell
      non-Hodgkin lymphoma.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  To determine if toxicity following treatment for lymphoma varies according to genetic
           polymorphisms in oxidative stress-related genes (i.e., SOD2, CAT, GPX1, GSTM1, and
           GSTP1).

        -  To assess whether these genetic polymorphisms are associated with progression-free
           survival and/or overall survival in these patients treated for lymphoma.

      OUTLINE: Previously collected samples are used for biomarker analysis.
