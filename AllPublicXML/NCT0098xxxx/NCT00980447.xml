  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      UMN-0501 is a purified recombinant influenza HA vaccine (A H5N1/Vietnam/1203/2004).

      The purpose of the present study is to evaluate immunogenicity, safety and optimal dose among
      three different doses of UMN-0501 following two same-dose vaccinations of UMN-0501 per
      patient with a 3 week interval between vaccination in healthy young adults.

      Immunogenicity will be confirmed by both microneutralization (MN) antibody and
      hemagglutination inhibition (HAI) titer levels in the serums of subjects after receiving
      different doses of UMN-0501. There will be three dose groups with 30 subjects per group for a
      total of 90 healthy young adults aged 20-40 years enrolled in this study.
