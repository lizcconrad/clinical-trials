        Patient Screening Criteria and Enrollment Process

        This is a single institution study at Washington University School of Medicine in St.
        Louis. Study population are patients &gt;=18 years of age, with histologically confirmed AML
        or MDS according to World Health Organization (WHO) criteria undergoing alloHCST. All
        screening procedures are part the patients clinical care.

          -  Patients, or their legal authorized representative, will provide written informed
             consent for the study prior to alloHSCT, or through 100 days following alloHSCT

          -  Patients will undergo alloHSCT as per institutional guidelines. AlloHSCT may be
             performed using both related and unrelated donors, myeloablative or non-myeloablative
             preparative regimens, and with either peripheral blood or bone marrow as a source of
             graft.

          -  Patients who fulfill both the Inclusion Criteria and Exclusion Criteria in the period
             of ≥ 50 and ≤ 100 days after alloHSCT will be registered on the study and will receive
             decitabine maintenance. Bone marrow biopsy will be performed ≤ 14 days prior to
             starting decitabine to confirm remission. Any GVHD prophylaxis or therapy is allowed
             during the study.

          -  Patients who do not fulfill Inclusion Criteria are not eligible to be registered on
             the study and are considered screening failures.

          -  Study will include maximum of 32 evaluable patients.

        Inclusion Criteria

          -  History of AML or MDS using WHO classification.

          -  &gt;50 and &lt;100 days following HLA-matched related or unrelated donor alloHSCT. Donors
             may be mismatched at single antigen at HLA-A, -B or -DR locus plus possible single
             antigen mismatch at HLA-C according to institution guidelines. Two-antigen mismatch at
             a single locus is not allowed.

          -  Age &gt;=18 years.

          -  Bone marrow biopsy confirming complete remission after alloHSCT

             o Complete remission: less than 5% blasts in an aspirate bone marrow sample with a
             count of at least 200 nucleated cells, no blasts with Auer rods or persistence of
             extramedullary disease PLUS absolute neutrophil count (ANC) &gt; 1,500/μL, platelet count
             ≥ 50,000/μL and no leukemic blasts in the peripheral blood.

          -  Platelet count ≥ 50,000/µL without platelet transfusion for 7 days and ANC ≥ 1,500/µL
             without colony stimulating factor support.

          -  Acceptable organ function defined as:

               -  creatinine &lt; 1.5 times the institutional ULN or creatinine clearance (calculated

               -  bilirubin &lt; 1.5 times the institutional ULN

               -  AST, ALT and alkaline phosphatase &lt; 2.5 times the institutional ULN.

          -  Each Patient or their legal authorized representative must sign an institutional
             review board/ethics committee-approved informed consent indicating their awareness of
             the investigational nature of this study.

          -  Female Subjects:

          -  Female of childbearing potential (FCBP*) must agree to use a reliable form of
             contraception or to practice complete abstinence from heterosexual intercourse for at
             least 28 days before starting study drug, while participating in the study, and for at
             least 28 days after discontinuation from the study. The methods of reliable
             contraception include intrauterine device (IUD), hormonal (birth control pills,
             injections, or implants), tubal ligation, partner's vasectomy, latex condom, diaphragm
             and cervical cap.

          -  FCBP must agree to pregnancy testing.

             undergone a hysterectomy or bilateral oophorectomy; or 2) has not been naturally
             postmenopausal for at least 24 consecutive months (i.e., who has had menses at any

          -  Male Subjects:

          -  Must agree to use a latex condom during sexual contact with FCBP while participating
             in the study and for at least 28 days following discontinuation from the study even if
             he has undergone a successful vasectomy

          -  Must agree to abstain from donating blood, semen, or sperm during study participation
             and for at least 28 days after discontinuation from the study.

          -  Must agree that if a pregnancy or a positive pregnancy test does occur in a female
             partner of a male study subject during study participation, study drug must be
             immediately discontinued and must immediately notify the principal investigator.

        Exclusion Criteria

          -  History of previous alloHSCT prior to the current alloHSCT.

          -  Persistent AML or MDS after alloHSCT.

             carcinoma of the skin, squamous cell carcinoma of the skin, carcinoma in situ of the
             cervix, carcinoma in situ of the breast, prostate cancer stage T1a or T1b.

          -  Uncontrolled active infections requiring intravenous antibiotics.

          -  Clinically significant systemic illness (e.g. serious active infections or significant
             cardiac, pulmonary, hepatic or other organ dysfunction), which, in the judgment of the
             Principal or Associate Investigator would compromise the patient's ability to tolerate
             protocol therapy.

          -  Known or suspected hypersensitivity to decitabine.

          -  Patients may not be receiving any other investigational agents.
