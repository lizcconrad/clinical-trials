      Paracetamol is the centrally acting analgesic most commonly used in the world, indicated for
      the symptomatic treatment of fever and pain in mild to moderate. It comes in different
      formulations for oral, intravenous and rectal. The IV route allows rapid passage of
      paracetamol in the systemic arterial circulation and thus the brain, faster distribution
      evidenced a higher plasma concentration compared with oral and rectal. However the IV route
      also has disadvantages well known risks iatrogenic perfusion is an invasive lengthy,
      unpleasant and painful.

      The way per-Albus not to date used for the administration of paracetamol. It is a path
      nonetheless very interesting for the rapid absorption of drugs such as nitrates used in
      angina pectoris, as it seeks a highly vascular area (the floor of the tongue or gingival
      groove) and allows a very rapid action. Furthermore, the terminal per-oral mucosa, less
      restrictive than IV administration and faster than oral administration, requires a simple
      medical gesture without special surveillance after administration, produces no pain or risk
      of infection for the patient (in contrast to the IV). It is interesting to test a new dosage
      form per-oral mucosa of paracetamol and compare pharmacological level (pharmacokinetics and
      pharmacodynamics) with the only dosage form of reference used by the IV route.
