  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study of plasma and urine proteomic profiles in patients with ischemic brain injury is
      important to better understanding of the mechanisms by which thrombolytic agents or other
      therapy affects clinical outcomes. The purpose of this study is to study the proteomic
      profile of patients with ischemic brain injury and compare it to control subjects without
      ischemic brain injury, subjects with other chronic neurologic diseases or systemic vascular
      diseases, and pre- and post- therapy which may be associated with, or predictive of,
      therapeutic outcome.

      The investigators hypothesize that there is a unique set of proteins expressed in serum and
      urine in patients with ischemic brain injury that may provide a more complete understanding
      of ischemic brain injury pathophysiology.

      Ultimately, this study may provide information of direct relevance to the medical care of a
      large proportion of patients with ischemic brain injury and other neurologic diseases in the
      future. And proteomic proteomic profile may provide important information about the roles of
      specific biomarkers. Perhaps the prevention of ischemic injury related complications.
