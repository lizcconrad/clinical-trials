  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators' long-term goal is to identify, and then provide general practitioners with
      evidence-based recommendations for therapeutic interventions for unexplained chronic fatigue
      (UCF). The investigators' central hypothesis guiding this application is that some
      complimentary and alternative medicine (CAM) practitioners have developed management
      approaches that are more helpful to patients with UCF than usual care.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      An objective is to identify certain types of clinicians (or individual physicians) who appear
      to have identified effective treatments for patients with UCF, or to find that clinicians who
      report themselves to be effective are not. Study subjects will be UCF patients new to the
      practice of one of four groups of participating clinicians: 1) a control group of MDs in
      practice-based research networks, 2) MDs trained in CAM, 3) naturopathic doctors (non MDs
      trained in special naturopathic schools), and 4) MDs who specialize in chronic fatigue. Our
      rationale for this comparison is that its successful completion will potentially guide future
      searches for effective medical strategies for the treatment of UCF that may have been
      developed outside the mainstream medical community. It may also provide necessary information
      for follow-up studies that will help to identify specific effective treatments. This
      information includes which clinicians provide the best treatments (as evidenced by having
      patients with the best results), what are the characteristics of patients who respond to a
      particular treatment, how the data collection procedures might need to be refined and what
      sample sizes are necessary.

        The primary analyses will compare outcomes for 240 patients in four main groups (60 in each
        group) defined by the background of the treating clinicians. Study subjects will be UCF
        patients new to the practice of one of four groups of participating clinicians.
