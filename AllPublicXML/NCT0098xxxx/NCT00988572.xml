  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Dizziness has been identified as a risk factor for fall and vestibular asymmetry has been
      found among patients with fall-related wrist fractures as well as among patients with
      hip-fracture. Since wrist fracture is a risk factor for hip-fracture, much effort is focused
      on preventing falls for risk-groups. Therefore, it would be interesting to find out if it is
      possible to influence vestibular asymmetry with vestibular rehabilitation.

      The aim of this study is therefore to find out if vestibular rehabilitation can have any
      effect on vestibular function among patients with fall-related wrist fracture.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Fall-related fractures are an increasing problem for the society. Almost 30% of persons over
      65 years of age fall each year. In Sweden 627 persons out of 100 000 is treated in hospitals
      because of injury after a fall. In Malmö, the figure is 883 persons out of 100 000. However,
      not all falls lead to a fracture. Dizziness has been identified as a risk factor for fall and
      vestibular asymmetry has been found among patients with fall-related wrist fractures as well
      as among patients with hip-fracture.

      Vestibular rehabilitation programs were first developed in the forties, originally used for
      peripheral vestibular disorder, in order to facilitate recovery. Modern research has widened
      the use of vestibular rehabilitation to patients with other causes of dizziness than
      peripheral vestibular disorders. Since wrist fracture is a risk factor for hip-fracture, much
      effort is focused on preventing falls for risk-groups. Therefore, it would be interesting to
      find out if it is possible to influence vestibular asymmetry with vestibular rehabilitation.

      The aim of this study is therefore to find out if vestibular rehabilitation can have any
      effect on vestibular function among patients with fall-related wrist fracture.

    <description>The intervention program comprises of vestibular rehabilitation, at group sessions, twice a week for 9 weeks. The program is described in detail in table 1. Vestibular rehabilitation aims to facilitate rearrangement and recruitment of the control capacities of the vestibular system, by letting the patient be exposed to unstable body positions, such as standing on foam and performing head, trunk or eye-movements.</description>
