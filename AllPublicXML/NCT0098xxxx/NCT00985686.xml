      The purpose of this project is to explore the potential value and practicality of an
      innovative depression intervention for young people. More specifically, the objectives of
      this project are:

        1. to pilot the Internet-based Spirituality Program with depressed young people (age 13-24)
           in Calgary by:

             1. obtaining preliminary estimates on the impact of the program on the primary outcome
                of depression severity, and secondary outcomes of spiritual well-being and
                self-concept.

             2. obtaining preliminary estimates on response rates and remission rates to guide
                sample size estimations for a full size randomized trial.

             3. evaluating if the suggested research methodology is feasible with respect to
                recruitment rate, patient burden and clinical implementation to guide design of a
                full size randomized trial.

        2. to gather feedback from depressed young people, their families and referral sources in
           the community (schools, family physicians, mental health outpatient services) on the
           perceived value of the program and on ways to eventually make it available as a
           community resource for others dealing with depression.

      Depression in adolescents and young adults is a prevalent illness in Canada and presents a
      high burden for those affected and their families. In Canada, depressive disorders are on the
      rise and their onset is occurring earlier in life. There is a growing body of evidence
      suggesting that spiritual wellness may play a role in depression management and recovery.
      Considering the limitations of available treatments for depression and the significant burden
      of the disease there is a need for new treatment options that are safe, effective, affordable
      and acceptable to young people. Our previous research gives strong support to the idea of
      using a spiritually based intervention for depression. To our knowledge, no research has been
      conducted on using spirituality as a self-study intervention in the management of depression
      in young adults. Over the last two years our team has created a spirituality-based
      intervention program for adolescent depression. The program could present an innovative and
      low cost treatment option for young patients with major depression.

    <description>Measure of depression severity in individuals 13 to 18 years of age. CDRS-R total raw scores includes the sum of 17 items, each item's scoring range is from 1 (no difficulties) to 5 (severe clinically significant difficulties) or 1 (no difficulties) to 7 (severe clinically significant difficulties), with a total possible raw score ranging from 17 to 113. To meet eligibility requirements, participants required a total raw score of 40 to 70.</description>

    <time_frame>At 8 week intervals over a 24 week period</time_frame>
    <description>Measure of depression severity in individuals 19 to 24 years of age. HAMD total scores includes the sum of 17-items, with eight items scored on a range of 0 (absent) to 2 (marked or definite) and nine scored on a range of 0 (absent) to 4 (very severe). The level of depression was based on the following scoring ranges: 7 or under not depressed, 8-13 some depressive symptoms but no depressive disorder, 12-15 mild depression, 16-19 moderate depression, 20-24 moderately severe depression, and 25+ severe depression. To meet eligibility requirements, participants required a total score of 12-24.</description>
