        <description>The three strains assessed were A/Brisbane/59/2007 (H1N1), A/Uruguay/716/2007 (H3N2) and B/Brisbane/60/2008.
Seroconversion was defined as the percentage of vaccinees that had either a pre-vaccination (Day 0) titer &lt; 1:10 and a post-vaccination titer ≥ 1:40 or a pre-vaccination titer ≥ 1:10 and at least a four-fold increase in post-vaccination titer.</description>

        <population>The According-To-Protocol cohort for immunogenicity included all evaluable subjects for whom data concerning immunogenicity outcome measures were available. This included subjects for whom assay results were available for antibodies against at least one vaccine strain after vaccination.</population>

Seroconversion was defined as the percentage of vaccinees that had either a pre-vaccination (Day 0) titer &lt; 1:10 and a post-vaccination titer ≥ 1:40 or a pre-vaccination titer ≥ 1:10 and at least a four-fold increase in post-vaccination titer.
Subjects in each group were also stratified in the following age-strata: 3-4 years, 5-8 years and 9-17 years.</description>
        <time_frame>At Day 28 after last vaccine dose.</time_frame>
        <population>The According-To-Protocol cohort for immunogenicity included all evaluable subjects for whom data concerning immunogenicity outcome measures were available.

        <description>The three strains assessed were A/Brisbane/59/2007 (H1N1), A/Uruguay/716/2007 (H3N2) and B/Brisbane/60/2008.
Seroprotection rate (SPR) was defined as the percentage of vaccinees with a serum HI titer ≥ 1:40 that represents a putative protective level in adults.
Subjects in each group were also stratified in the following age-strata: 3-4 years, 5-8 years and 9-17 years.</description>

        <population>The According-To-Protocol cohort for immunogenicity included all evaluable subjects for whom data concerning immunogenicity outcome measures were available.

        <title>Seroconversion Factor (SCF) for HI Antibodies Titers Against the Three Strains, by Age-strata.</title>
        <description>The three strains assessed were A/Brisbane/59/2007 (H1N1), A/Uruguay/716/2007 (H3N2) and B/Brisbane/60/2008.
Seroconversion factor (SCF) was defined as the fold increase in serum HI GMTs post-vaccination compared to pre-vaccination.
Seroconversion factor (SCF) was defined as the geometric mean of the within subjects ratios of the post-vaccination reciprocal HI titer to the Day 0 reciprocal HI titer. SCFs were calculated at Day 28 following the complete vaccination regimen.
Subjects in each group were also stratified in the following age-strata: 3-4 years, 5-8 years and 9-17 years.</description>
        <time_frame>At Day 0 and at Day 28 after last vaccine dose</time_frame>
        <population>The According-To-Protocol cohort for immunogenicity included all evaluable subjects for whom data concerning immunogenicity outcome measures were available. This included subjects for whom assay results were available for antibodies against at least one vaccine strain after vaccination.</population>
