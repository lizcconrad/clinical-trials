      A multi-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 4-arm clinical study to
      evaluate efficacy and safety of nicotine lozenge (2mg and 4mg) in smoking cessation in adult
      cigarette smokers who are motivated to quit smoking. Successful quitters or participants who
      smoke occasionally will be followed up after week 24 till 12 months.

    <measure>Rate of Successful Smoking Cessation at Week 6</measure>
    <time_frame>From baseline to Week 6</time_frame>
    <description>Rate of Successful Smoking Cessation at Week 6 was measured by Carbon Monoxide (CO) breath levels.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Rate of Continuous Successful Smoking Cessation at Week 12 and Week 24</measure>
    <time_frame>From baseline to Week 12 and Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>Continuous abstinence was verified by measurement of CO breath levels.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Rate of Long-term Successful Smoking Cessation at Week 24</measure>
    <time_frame>From Week 6 to Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>Rate of long-term successful smoking cessation at Week 24 was defined as the proportion of participants who achieved the primary end-point with no more than six cumulative days of smoking from Week 6 to Week 24.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Proportion of Participants With Seven Day Point Prevalence Abstinence</measure>
    <time_frame>Weekly assessment at Week 1, 2, 4, 6, 12 and Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>Seven day point prevalence abstinence was defined as complete abstinence from smoking for the 7 days up to and including the evaluation day.</description>

    <measure>Mean Score of Relief of Craving/ Total Withdrawal Symptoms</measure>
    <time_frame>Weekly assessment at Week 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and Week 6</time_frame>
    <description>The evaluation of withdrawal and craving symptoms was carried out every day with the Minnesota Nicotine Withdrawal scale (MNWS). The MNWS total score contains 9 items (urge to smoke; depressed mood; irritability, frustration, or anger; anxiety; difficulty concentrating; restlessness; increased appetite; difficulty going to sleep; difficulty staying asleep). Each item was rated on a 5 grade scale with scores ranging from 0 (best score) to 4 (worst score) i.e. none (score=0), slight (score=1), mild (score=2), moderate (score=3), and severe (score=4). For each symptom at each week, the average score was calculated as the average of the daily scores during that week. The total score was calculated as the sum of the 9 symptoms.</description>

    <measure>Mean Daily Dose at Visit 4, 5, 6, 7 and 10</measure>
    <time_frame>Weeks 1-2, 3-4, 5-6, 7-12 and 13-24</time_frame>
    <description>Mean daily dose of lozenges was calculated as number of lozenges taken at each visit divided by days since the last visit.</description>

        <title>Mean Score of Relief of Craving/ Total Withdrawal Symptoms</title>
        <description>The evaluation of withdrawal and craving symptoms was carried out every day with the Minnesota Nicotine Withdrawal scale (MNWS). The MNWS total score contains 9 items (urge to smoke; depressed mood; irritability, frustration, or anger; anxiety; difficulty concentrating; restlessness; increased appetite; difficulty going to sleep; difficulty staying asleep). Each item was rated on a 5 grade scale with scores ranging from 0 (best score) to 4 (worst score) i.e. none (score=0), slight (score=1), mild (score=2), moderate (score=3), and severe (score=4). For each symptom at each week, the average score was calculated as the average of the daily scores during that week. The total score was calculated as the sum of the 9 symptoms.</description>
