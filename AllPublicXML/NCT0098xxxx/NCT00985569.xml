      The purpose is to assess the efficacy, clinical outcomes, and potential Quality Indicator
      benefits associated with the use of Lubiprostone in nursing home residents with a confirmed
      diagnosis of chronic idiopathic constipation.

      The study is a prospective, observational, open-label, non-placebo, controlled study to
      measure the effects of Lubiprostone on CIC in nursing home residents. All clinical sites will
      follow a common protocol using standardizes definitions in which eligible patients will be
      asked to participate in the proposed study. During the course of the study, various selected
      parameters will be measured and compared to establish the clinical efficacy of Lubiprostone
      in the treatment of CIC.

      The study sample (N=105) will be comprised of nursing home residents with a confirmed
      diagnosis of CIC. A power analysis generated a sample size of 97 residents. To protect the
      validity of the test, 8 residents were added to the final study sample to allow for losses to
      followup. Therefore, a final sample size of 105 residents was identified for the study.

      Patients meeting the inclusion criteria will be recruited for participation in the study. 3
      sites in Central Florida with multiple Nursing Homes per site will be recruited to
      participate in the proposed study.
