  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Urinary incontinence is a frequent complication after radical prostatectomy. Rehabilitative
      treatments are frequently utilized to reduce incontinence. However, their efficacy has not
      been completely investigated. In this study the investigators will compare the effect of an
      early rehabilitation programme (instruction of the patient, pelvic floor muscle training,
      electrical stimulation and biofeedback) versus instruction of the patient only.

      The investigators hypothesis is that early rehabilitation programme is more effective than
      patient's instruction alone in preventing urinary incontinence after radical prostatectomy.

    <description>Before surgery: 15 minutes pelvic floor muscle training and 15 minutes biofeedback, for 4 sessions.
After surgery: physical therapist's assisted pelvic floor muscle biofeedback (15 min/day for 10 days), followed by patient's instruction for pelvic floor muscle training and home based exercised pelvic floor muscle for 10 days. Then pelvic floor muscle biofeedback (15 min/day for 10 days) and functional electrical stimulation of pelvic floor (30 min/day for 10 days).
Patients will be instructed to carry on exercises at home for the following 11 months.</description>
