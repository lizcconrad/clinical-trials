    <textblock>
      The study will assess the real life effectiveness of zoledronic acid in the management of
      patients with osteoporosis over 4 years of treatment. Zoledronic acid will be compared to
      oral bisphosphonates (OBP) with respect to the change in Bone Mineral Density (BMD) and
      incidence of fractures.
