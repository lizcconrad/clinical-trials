  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      rTMS is a promising, though largely untested, option for treating adolescent and young adult
      depression. This study hypothesizes that rTMS will safely and significantly alleviate
      depression and decrease suicidal ideation in adolescents and young adults based on previous
      studies.

      After signing consent and undergoing a thorough screening, participants will be administered
      rTMS 5 days per week for 4 consecutive weeks (a total of 20 sessions) as an add-on to their
      current antidepressant regime. Adolescents must be accompanied by a parent or legal guardian.
      We will monitor for depression, anxiety and suicidal ideation over the 4 weeks as well as 1
      week following the last rTMS administration using rating scales. These scales will be given
      once a week, on Fridays, and will require roughly 40 minutes to complete. TMS sessions will
      last approximately 25 minutes each.

                  of three on the ATHF per antidepressant drug trial (those who have not completed
                  antidepressant trials of adequate dose and duration due to intolerance to therapy
                  may be included if they have demonstrated intolerance to three or more
                  antidepressant medications in the current or a previous episode)
