      The objective of this study was to investigate the bioequivalence of nisoldipine
      extended-release 30 mg tablets (by Mylan Pharmaceuticals Inc.) with Sular® Extended-Release
      30 mg tablet (manufactured for First Horizon) following a single, oral 30 mg (1 × 30 mg
      tablet) dose administration in healthy adult subjects under fasting conditions.

               -  Women of childbearing potential must have a negative serum beta human chorionic
                  gonadotropin (β-HCG) pregnancy test performed within 21 days prior to the start
                  of the study and on the evening prior to each dose administration. If dosing is
                  scheduled on Sunday or Monday, the HCG pregnancy test should be given within 48
                  hours prior to dosing for each study period. An additional serum (β-HCG)
                  pregnancy test will be performed upon completion of the study.

               -  Women of childbearing potential must practice abstinence or be using an
                  acceptable form of contraception throughout the duration of the study. No
                  hormonal contraceptives or hormonal replacement therapies are permitted in this
                  study. Acceptable forms of contraception include the following:

                    1. Intrauterine device in place for at least 3 months prior to the start of the
                       study and remaining in place during the study period, or

                    2. Barrier methods containing or used in conjunction with a spermicidal agent,
                       or

                    3. Surgical sterilization

               -  Women will not be considered of childbearing potential if one of the following is
                  reported and documented on the medical history:

                    1. Postmenopausal with an absence of menses for at least one (1) year, or

                    2. Bilateral oophorectomy with or without a hysterectomy and an absence of
                       bleeding for at least 6 months, or

                    3. Total hysterectomy

               -  During the course of the study, from study screen until study exit - including
                  the washout period, all men and women of childbearing potential must use a
                  spermicide containing barrier method of contraception in addition to their
                  current contraceptive method. This advice should be documented in the informed
                  consent form.

          -  Weight: At least 60 kg (132 lbs) for men and 48 kg (106 lbs) for women with all
             subjects having a Body Mass Index (BMI) less than or equal to 30 but greater than or
             equal to 19.

          -  All subjects should be judged normal and healthy during a pre-study medical evaluation
             (physical examination, laboratory evaluation, Hepatitis B and Hepatitis C tests, HIV
             test, 12-lead ECG, and urine drug screen including amphetamine, barbiturates,
             benzodiazepines, cannabinoid, cocaine, opiates, phencyclidine, and methadone)
