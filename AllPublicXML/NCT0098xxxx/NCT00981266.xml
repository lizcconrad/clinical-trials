    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to demonstrate safety and effectiveness of Mentor's
      Spectra/Becker 80 Adjustable Breast Implants in women who are undergoing primary or revision
      breast augmentation. Safety information on the rate of complications, such as infection, will
      be collected and used to help determine device safety. These implants are investigational
      devices.

      Approximately 450 patients at sites across the United States will be enrolled in this
      research study by up to 30 sites. These patients will be implanted with Spectra/Becker 80
      implant and monitored for 10 years to collect information on risks associated with the
      implant surgery as well as changes in the way these patients feel about themselves.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Silicone gel-filled breast implants were introduced in the early sixties and were in
      wide-scale distribution by the time the Medical Device Amendments to the Food Drug and
      Cosmetic Act was passed in 1976. In 1983, gel-filled breast implants were designated as Class
      III devices requiring premarket approval. In May 1990, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA)
      published a proposed request (515(b)) for Pre-market Approval Applications (PMA) and in April
      1991 published the final request. This final publication put manufacturers of gel-filled
      breast implants on notice that for continued marketing of gel-filled breast implants, a PMA
      was due to FDA in 90 days from the final publication date.

      A Pre-Market Approval (PMA) for the Mentor gel-filled breast implants was filed with the FDA
      in July 1991. At the FDA General and Plastic Surgery Advisory Committee meeting in November
      1991, the committee recommended the submission of additional information to establish the
      safety and effectiveness of gel-filled breast implants.

      In January 1992, the FDA Commissioner announced a voluntary moratorium of the sale of
      gel-filled breast implants to allow the advisory panel time to assess additional information.
      In April 1992, the moratorium was lifted but only for reconstruction and revision subjects.
      Every subject implanted had to be part of an Adjunct Study, in addition to being offered
      participation in a registry of gel-filled breast implant subjects. The Adjunct Study devices
      included the round MemoryGel, Becker Expander/Prosthesis and the Lumera implants. In order to
      be implanted with gel-filled implants for augmentation, women had to be enrolled in an
      Investigational Device Exemption (IDE) clinical trial.

      A PMA for Mentor's MemoryGel™ Silicone Gel-Filled breast implants (which did not include the
      Becker Expander/Breast Implants) was subsequently filed with FDA in December 2003, and
      approved in November 2006 (P030053). As a condition of approval of P030053, new enrollment in
      Mentor's Adjunct Study has ceased, and women no longer have access to the Becker
      Expander/Breast Implants or any Adjustable Gel-Filled implants. The Spectra/Becker 80
      Adjustable Breast Implants were not included in the Adjunct Study.

      This study is designed to study the safety and effectiveness of Mentor's Spectra/Becker 80
      Adjustable Breast Implants for primary breast augmentation or augmentation revision.

    <description>The Mentor Smooth Spectra/Becker 80 Adjustable Breast Implant has a low bleed, gel-filled outer lumen and an adjustable saline-fillable inner lumen. The inner lumen can be gradually filled with saline over a period of time via the fill tube by injecting saline through the injection dome. Once filled to the desired volume, the fill tube and injection dome are removed, and the prosthesis remains in position as a breast implant. Its purpose is to provide volume flexibility and projection adjustability.</description>
