  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial is studying how well giving acetylsalicylic acid together with
      eflornithine works in treating patients at high risk for colorectal cancer. Chemoprevention
      is the use of certain drugs to keep cancer from forming. The use of acetylsalicylic acid and
      eflornithine may prevent colorectal cancer.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. The proportion of subjects with an adenoma recurrence at the 1-year follow-up colonoscopy
      exam. This adenoma recurrence rate for difluoromethylornithine (DFMO) (eflornithine) +
      aspirin will be compared to double placebo to see if there is improvement in the adenoma
      recurrence rate in this patient population.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the relative tolerability and safety of the treatment regimens administered
      for 12 months.

      II. To determine the effect of the study drugs (aspirin [acetylsalicylic acid] + DFMO) and
      placebo with respect to proliferation (Ki67 labeling index), apoptosis (caspase-3 expression
      assay), and drug effect markers (COX-1, -2, polyamines, PGE2) from adenomas, aberrant crypt
      focus (ACF) and normal-appearing mucosa using pre- and 12-month post-intervention tissue
      biopsy samples.

      III. To estimate the percentage change in rectal ACF number, as determined by magnifying
      colonoscopy in subjects treated for 12 months with placebo or study drugs (aspirin +DFMO) by
      comparing % change in drug versus placebo arms.

      IV. To characterize ACF based on three criteria (ACF size [crypt number &lt; 50 or &gt;= 50], crypt
      morphology characteristics, and histology) of ACF and to correlate such characteristics with
      the intervention (vs placebo). Also, to evaluate the natural history of ACF over 1-year on
      placebo.

      V. To correlate the 12-month measurements of ACF size (# crypts/ACF), number, morphology, and
      histopathology with the adenoma recurrence data at 12 and 36 months; correlate the 12-month %
      (and actual) change in ACF size and number with the 12- and 36-month adenoma recurrence rate;
      and correlate the adenoma recurrence data at 1 year with the adenoma recurrence data at 3
      years.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To explore the effects of the study agents on a focused panel of tissue biomarkers in pre-
      and post-intervention biopsy samples from recurrent adenomas, rectal ACF, and adjacent
      normal-appearing mucosa among subjects enrolled in the phase II clinical trial.

      II. To determine if cleaved capase-3 expression can improve the detection of apoptotic cells
      by recognizing cellular commitment to apoptosis prior to late nuclear morphologic features
      and correlate with apoptotic regulatory proteins, histology, and treatment response.

      III. To determine the effects of aspirin on its biochemical targets COX-1, -2, and
      prostaglandin E2, and polyamine levels in subjects receiving DFMO.

      IV. To examine COX-2-dependent genes (i.e., Bcl-2 and DR5) in adenomas and ACF that have been
      shown to regulate the intrinsic mitochondrial and extrinsic death receptor-mediated apoptotic
      pathways in vitro and in vivo.

      V. To perform expression profiling of adenomas or ACF and to relate such date to ACF
      histology, size/morphology, modulation by chemopreventive agents, and subsequent adenoma
      recurrence rates.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

      ARM I: Patients receive acetylsalicylic acid orally (PO) once daily and eflornithine PO twice
      daily on days 1-28.

      ARM II: Patients receive placebo PO three times daily on days 1-28.

      Treatment repeats every 28 days for 12 months in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed at 6, 12, and 36 months.

    <measure>Adenoma Recurrence Rate for the Treatment Arm Relative to Placebo</measure>
    <time_frame>At 1 year</time_frame>
    <description>The primary endpoint is the proportion of participants with an adenoma recurrence at the 1-year follow-up colonoscopy exam. All eligible, randomized participants who have signed a consent form and received at least one follow-up endoscopy exam will be considered evaluable for the primary endpoint. This adenoma recurrence rate for DFMO + aspirin will be compared to double placebo to see if there is improvement in the adenoma recurrence rate in this patient population. A 1-sided Chi-square test was used to determine if there was a significant difference between treatment arms.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>ACF Characteristics vs Adenoma Recurrence Rate</measure>
    <time_frame>At baseline and 1 year</time_frame>
    <description>A potential surrogate endpoint biomarker is the aberrant crypt focus (ACF). ACF are the earliest lesions that can be detected in colorectal mucosa and are believed to be precursors of adenomas and cancers. At the 1-year time point, the presence of adenoma recurrence and the number of ACF sites was recorded for each patient. The percent change in ACF number was calculated as the number of ACF present at the 1-year post-intervention exam minus the baseline number of ACF, divided by the number of ACF present at baseline. A negative score represents a loss in the number of sites and a positive number indicates an increase in the number of ACF sites. Therefore, the possible range in percent change cannot be lower than -100% and has no upper bound. A Wilcoxon Rank-sum test was used to assess the relationship between ACF percent change and adenoma recurrence rate. This analysis was only conducted in those participants who had at least 5 rectal ACF at baseline.</description>

    <description>A potential surrogate endpoint biomarker is the aberrant crypt focus (ACF). ACF are the earliest lesions that can be detected in colorectal mucosa and are believed to be precursors of adenomas and cancers. The number and total size of ACF sites may serve as risk markers for adenoma/carcinoma development. The median number of ACF sites per patient were collected prior to treatment.</description>

    <measure>Comparison of the Percent Change in ACF Number Across the 2 Treatment Arms</measure>
    <time_frame>At baseline and 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The number of ACF sites per patient was collected at baseline and at 1-year time points. The percent change in ACF number was calculated as the number of ACF present at the 12-month post-intervention exam minus the baseline number of ACF, divided by the number of ACF present at baseline. A negative score represents a loss in the number of sites from baseline to year 1 post-treatment. A positive number indicates an increase in the number of ACF sites. Therefore, the possible range in percent change cannot be lower than -100% and has no upper bound. The percent change in ACF number between arms was compared using a t-test.</description>

    <measure>Safety, Tolerability, and Adverse Events of Study Treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 48 months from beginning treatment.</time_frame>
    <description>The National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria (CTC) Version 3.0 was used to grade all adverse events. The number of patients reporting a grade 3 or higher event are tabulated here. A grade 3 event is one categorized as being severe or medically significant but not immediately life-threatening. A grade 4 is considered life-threatening, and a grade 5 is death related to the event. A complete list of all adverse events is given in the Adverse Events section.</description>

    <measure>Effect of the Study Drugs and Placebo With Respect to Biomarkers</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>For continuous variables, we will use the 2-sample t-test (or nonparametric equivalent) to compare the active arm to the placebo arm. For categorical data, we will explore the relationship between the treatment arms and biomarkers with chi-square or fisher's exact tests. Correlations will be sought between caspase-3 staining, proliferative indices and their ratio, as well as other biomarkers using a chi-square test.</description>

        <title>Adenoma Recurrence Rate for the Treatment Arm Relative to Placebo</title>
        <description>The primary endpoint is the proportion of participants with an adenoma recurrence at the 1-year follow-up colonoscopy exam. All eligible, randomized participants who have signed a consent form and received at least one follow-up endoscopy exam will be considered evaluable for the primary endpoint. This adenoma recurrence rate for DFMO + aspirin will be compared to double placebo to see if there is improvement in the adenoma recurrence rate in this patient population. A 1-sided Chi-square test was used to determine if there was a significant difference between treatment arms.</description>

        <title>ACF Characteristics vs Adenoma Recurrence Rate</title>
        <description>A potential surrogate endpoint biomarker is the aberrant crypt focus (ACF). ACF are the earliest lesions that can be detected in colorectal mucosa and are believed to be precursors of adenomas and cancers. At the 1-year time point, the presence of adenoma recurrence and the number of ACF sites was recorded for each patient. The percent change in ACF number was calculated as the number of ACF present at the 1-year post-intervention exam minus the baseline number of ACF, divided by the number of ACF present at baseline. A negative score represents a loss in the number of sites and a positive number indicates an increase in the number of ACF sites. Therefore, the possible range in percent change cannot be lower than -100% and has no upper bound. A Wilcoxon Rank-sum test was used to assess the relationship between ACF percent change and adenoma recurrence rate. This analysis was only conducted in those participants who had at least 5 rectal ACF at baseline.</description>

        <title>Comparison of the Percent Change in ACF Number Across the 2 Treatment Arms</title>
        <description>The number of ACF sites per patient was collected at baseline and at 1-year time points. The percent change in ACF number was calculated as the number of ACF present at the 12-month post-intervention exam minus the baseline number of ACF, divided by the number of ACF present at baseline. A negative score represents a loss in the number of sites from baseline to year 1 post-treatment. A positive number indicates an increase in the number of ACF sites. Therefore, the possible range in percent change cannot be lower than -100% and has no upper bound. The percent change in ACF number between arms was compared using a t-test.</description>

          <title>Comparison of the Percent Change in ACF Number Across the 2 Treatment Arms</title>
          <description>The number of ACF sites per patient was collected at baseline and at 1-year time points. The percent change in ACF number was calculated as the number of ACF present at the 12-month post-intervention exam minus the baseline number of ACF, divided by the number of ACF present at baseline. A negative score represents a loss in the number of sites from baseline to year 1 post-treatment. A positive number indicates an increase in the number of ACF sites. Therefore, the possible range in percent change cannot be lower than -100% and has no upper bound. The percent change in ACF number between arms was compared using a t-test.</description>
          <population>All eligible treated patients that were assessed for ACF at baseline and after 1-year of treatment were included in this analysis.</population>
