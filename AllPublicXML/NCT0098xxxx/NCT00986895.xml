  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the safety and tolerability of GT4P administered
      orally as a single dose, and twice daily for 7 consecutive days, to subjects with hepatic
      impairment with cirrhosis (Child-Pugh scores of A, B, or C) and to a gender matched and
      similar age control group with normal hepatic function.

    <description>HPN-100 is a triglyceride that has a similar mechanism of action as NaPBA. It is a liquid with minimal taste and odor. HPN-100 is broken down to phenylbuteric acid (PBA). PBA is converted to phenylacetic acid (PAA) that is the active metabolite. Three teaspoons of HPN-100 (~17.4mL) delivers an equivalent amount of PBA to40 tablets of NaPBA.</description>
