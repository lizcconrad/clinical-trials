  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators have currently finished conducting an international multi-center trial that
      compares the efficacy and safety of pamidronate and zoledronate in the treatment of moderate
      to severe forms of Osteogenesis Imperfecta (OI). This trial has included only children above
      one year of age. The aim of the current study is to extend the observations of that currently
      finished study to infants below 1 year of age. Moreover, it is possible to administer
      zoledronate in a single short infusion instead of the three-day cycles with Pamidronate,
      therefore decreasing patient and family burdens with shorter stays in the hospital.
