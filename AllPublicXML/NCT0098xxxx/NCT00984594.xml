  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to determine how effective a plug made out of human bone
      (called &quot;CR-Plug&quot;) will be in the treatment of smaller, focal defects (like the injury the
      patient has to their knee).

      The main objective of this double arm study is to test the ability of an allograft plug to
      provide &quot;successful&quot; repair of less than (&lt;) 2.5 cm2 osteochondral defect in a
      low-load-bearing femoral condyle region, and a high-load-bearing femoral-condyle region.

    <measure>Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS</measure>
    <time_frame>24 months</time_frame>
    <description>The outcome at 24 months as measured by the Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS). Scores are transformed to a 0-100 scale, with zero representing extreme knee problems and 100 representing no knee problems as common in orthopaedic scales and generic measures. Scores between 0 and 100 represent the percentage of total possible score achieved.</description>

    <measure>Current Health Assessment (CHA)</measure>
    <time_frame>24 months</time_frame>
    <description>Evaluation on the Current Health Assessment at 24 months. Scores are transformed to a 0-100 scale, with zero representing a self-graded perception of extremely poor health and 100 representing no health problems. Scores between 0 and 100 represent the percentage of total possible score achieved.</description>

    <measure>IKDC Assessment</measure>
    <time_frame>24 months</time_frame>
    <description>The International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) scores from 24 months are shown. The IKDC is an index score from 0 to 100, with 100 being the best possible score,</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) Results</measure>
    <time_frame>24 months</time_frame>
    <description>MRI images were graded by a radiologist with regard to the incorporation of the CR graft in both the cancellous and cortical portions of the bone at the graft site. The raw scores were converted to an index scale form 0 to 100, with 0 representing failure of the graft to incorporate and 100 representing complete incorporation of the graft.</description>

    <measure>Lysholm Score at 24 Months</measure>
    <time_frame>24 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Lysholm scores from the 24-month exams are shown. The Lysholm score is an indexed score of knee functional ability, with 0 being the worst score and 100 being the best score, indicating no limitations in activity/function.</description>

      <recruitment_details>All participants were recruited from the patient population at one of the investigative sites between 12 June 2009 and 5 May 2010.
One subject was enrolled at 17 years, 7 months. A protocol waiver was approved by the Institutional Review Board and parental informed consent and assent of subject was obtained.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>Patients were assigned to the treatment arm based on a randomization table. Enrolled patients excluded: Not fulfilling inclusion or exclusion criteria, withdrawal of consent. Enrolled patients were followed to completion unless lost to follow up. Of 4 enrolled, 1 withdrew consent, 1 was lost to follow up &amp; 2 completed</pre_assignment_details>
