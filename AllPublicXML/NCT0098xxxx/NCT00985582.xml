  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aims of this study are to characterise the clinical efficacy and virological clearance
      dynamics of orally administered oseltamivir in patients with influenza caused by novel
      influenza A(H1N1). This research will also contribute to enhancing research capacity in
      affected countries.

      The objectives are to assess the:

        -  viral replication levels over time in affected patients

        -  antiviral efficacy of oral oseltamivir

        -  patterns and compartments of viral shedding, tissue distribution

        -  innate inflammatory response and relation to viral replication

        -  kinetics of antibody response

        -  antiviral sensitivity of influenza viruses at baseline and during oseltamivir treatment
           using in vitro and molecular methods

        -  pharmacokinetic characteristics of oseltamivir and oseltamivir carboxylate

        -  all cause in hospital mortality

        -  clinical and radiological features, disease course and outcome

        -  length of stay in hospital

        -  risk factors associated with development of severe disease and death

      Any patient over 1 year of age who presents to a participating institution with confirmed
      influenza A and who meets the study inclusion/exclusion criteria may be approached for
      informed consent. Choice of antiviral is up to the study physician. Children aged 1-6 years
      and asthmatics should receive oseltamivir. The weight- and age-adjusted dosage used will be
      that approved for treatment of uncomplicated seasonal influenza, and doses will be
      administered twice daily for 5 days for patients with normal renal function. All patients who
      are clinical and/or virologic failures at day 5 will be treated for an additional 5 days of
      antivirals. After coming off antiviral therapy patients can be discharged at day 10 if deemed
      ready by study physicians and they are virologically negative.

      During the course of treatment study evaluations will be performed to determine primary
      efficacy end points including viral clearance on Day 5 on all collected nasopharyngeal
      samples, assessed by RT PCR for novel H1N1 influenza AND no clinical features of clinical
      failure. Evaluations will also be performed to determine secondary viral, serological,
      clinical efficacy, safety and pharmacokinetic endpoints.

      Patients will be followed up for up to 6 months after discharge for a clinical assessment,
      pulmonary function and outcome of pregnancy.

      The protocol will be reviewed after 6 months from starting or after 100 patients with
      Influenza A are recruited.
