      The purpose of this study is to test the effectiveness of group psychotherapy designed
      specifically for male veterans and active-duty personnel with Post-traumatic Stress Disorder
      (PTSD), Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) and with disturbances in their sleep or daily
      routine.

      The purpose of this study is to test the effectiveness of a group psychotherapy designed
      specifically for male veterans and active-duty personnel with Post-traumatic Stress Disorder
      (PTSD), Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) and with disturbances in their sleep or daily
      routine. We will compare two group therapies, one of which has been examined in previous
      studies for veterans with PTSD. Both group therapies have been shown to reduce symptoms of
      anxiety and depression in some veterans. However, neither group therapy has been proven to be
      more effective than treatment as usual for PTSD.

    <description>Cognitive Behavioral Social Rhythm Group Therapy is designed to improve mood and sleep by stabilizing social rhythms, increasing exposure to ambient light, changing dysfunctional bed/bedtime associations, activating the imagery system by changing nightmare content, and challenging dysfunctional automatic thoughts that might contribute to behavioral inactivation and nonadherence to the therapy protocol. There is no discussion of past traumatic events.</description>

    <description>Present Centered Group Therapy includes education about the typical symptoms and features associated with PTSD and MDD, with a focus on how these symptoms affect interpersonal relationships. It uses the group format to decrease isolation, normalize symptoms, and provide the experience of giving and receiving support. Some relaxation training is provided early in therapy.

            <description>CBSRT is designed to improve mood and sleep by stabilizing social rhythms, increasing exposure to ambient light, changing dysfunctional bed/bedtime associations, activating the imagery system by changing nightmare content, and challenging dysfunctional automatic thoughts that might contribute to behavioral inactivation and nonadherence to the therapy protocol.
