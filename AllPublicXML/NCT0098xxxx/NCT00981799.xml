    <textblock>
      Nelarabine has shown significant activity in patients with T-cell malignancies. This study
      will determine the safety and maximum tolerated dose of the combination of nelarabine,
      cyclophosphamide and etoposide in patients with first bone marrow relapse of T-ALL, or first
      relapse of T-LL.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients to be enrolled in the dose-escalation portion of this study must have T-cell
             ALL or T-cell lymphoblastic lymphoma (LL) in first relapse or must have failed primary
             induction chemotherapy (ie, never attained a complete remission following an initial
             course of standard therapy for T-ALL or T-LL). Patients to be enrolled in the cohort
             expansion portion of this study (ie, those treated at the recommended phase 2 dose)
             must have T-cell ALL in first relapse or must have failed primary induction
             chemotherapy (ie, never attained a complete remission following an initial course of
             standard therapy for T-ALL). T-LL patients are not eligible for the cohort expansion
             phase.

          -  Patients with T-cell ALL must have greater than 25% blasts in the bone marrow with or
             without extramedullary disease.

          -  Patients with T-cell LL must have recurrent disease, documented by clinical or
             radiographic criteria, as well as histologic verification of the malignancy at
             original diagnosis. Patients with T-cell LL enrolled in the phase I dose-escalation
             study are not required to have measurable disease; however, patients enrolled in the
             phase II cohort expansion at the MTD must have measurable disease.

             DAYS HAS ELAPSED SINCE PRIOR INTRATHECAL THERAPY.

          -  At least 6 weeks must have elapsed since administration of nitrosureas.
