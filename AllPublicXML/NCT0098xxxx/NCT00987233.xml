    <description>It is to be self-administered; the dosing regimen will be 2 sprays (actuations) into each nostril, once daily. This is the dosing regimen during placebo lead-in and randomized treatment phases. Each actuation of active treatment is equivalent to 55 ug of triamcinolone acetonide, for a total daily dose of 220ug triamcinolone acetonide per day.</description>

          -  Is a male or female between 18 and 65 years of age;

          -  At least a 2-year history of seasonal allergic rhinitis;

          -  The presence of IgE-mediated hypersensitivity to local pollen confirmed by a positive
             response to either skin prick or intradermal testing within the past 12 months. A
             positive response is defined as a wheal diameter of at least 3 mm larger than the
             control for the skin prick test or at least 7 mm larger than the control for the
             intradermal test;

          -  In order to enter the placebo lead-in period, the subject must have a score of at
             least 6 on a 24-hour reflective TNSS completed during Visit 2;

          -  Is in general good health as determined by screening evaluations and the judgment of
             the Investigator;

          -  If female of childbearing potential, is not pregnant (confirmed by negative urine
             pregnancy test), non-lactating, and will use reliable birth control measures
             throughout the study. Female of child bearing potential is defined as a female who has
             experienced menarche, and who has not undergone successful surgical sterilization:
             hysterectomy, bilateral oophorectomy or ovariectomy, bilateral tubal ligation or
             salpingectomy; or is not postmenopausal for at least 1 year.;

          -  If receiving immunotherapy, must be on a stable maintenance regimen for at least 30
             days before Visit 1, and should maintain the same dose throughout the study (Low dose
             antibiotic therapy given prophylactically and started prior to Day -7 is acceptable.);

          -  Has not used systemic steroids or topical steroids (inhaled, intranasal, or
             intraocular) within 30 days before Visit 2; Is capable of tolerating intranasal
             application of the study drug; and

          -  Is willing and able to comply with the requirements of the protocol and intends to
             complete the study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

             cardiovascular, hepatic, renal, neurologic, psychiatric, or autoimmune
             disorder/condition/disease that in the opinion of the Investigator could place the
             subject at increased risk of complications, interfere with study participation, or
             confound any of the study objectives;

          -  Presence or history of ocular herpes simplex, cataracts, or glaucoma;

          -  Inability to avoid exposure to chickenpox or measles;

          -  Respiratory tract infection within two weeks prior to screening;

          -  Infection requiring oral antibiotic treatment two weeks prior to screening;

          -  Significant pulmonary disease and/or active asthma requiring daily medication;

          -  Signs or symptoms of nasal polyps, deviated septum, or any other condition, which in
             the opinion of the Investigator, may result in erroneous study data; Known intolerance
             (hypersensitivity or serious adverse reaction) to corticosteroids;

          -  History within the last 5 years or current evidence of alcohol or drug abuse;

          -  Current use of therapies or medications (e.g., tricyclic antidepressants and others.

             preparations) 3 days

             study within 30 days of entering this study;

          -  Documented evidence of acute or significant chronic sinusitis, as determined by the
             investigator;
