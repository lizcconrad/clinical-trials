    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the Hemolung Respiratory
      Assist System in patients with hypercapnic respiratory failure associated with acute
      exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and a 50% likelihood of failure
      of noninvasive positive pressure ventilation leading to intubation and mechanical
      ventilation.

    <description>Patients meeting the inclusion criteria will be placed on the Hemolung Respiratory Assist System. Patients will be weaned from non-invasive ventilation and then the Hemolung. Hemolung support will be provided for up to 7 days. Follow-up exams will be performed every 15 days until hospital discharge or 30 days from completion of Hemolung therapy, whichever is later.</description>
