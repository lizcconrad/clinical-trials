    <textblock>
      The final purpose of this study is to determine whether bronchodilation and cigarette smoking
      in Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) patients interact, resulting in an increase
      of cardiovascular disease. The aim of this part of the study is to demonstrate the basic
      mechanism: Does increased respiratory function after administration of a bronchodilator in
      patients with COPD lead to elevated pulmonary retention of the harmful compounds in inhaled
      cigarette smoke and to short-term biological effects associated with cardiovascular disease?

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      COPD currently is one of the most frequent diseases. In more than 80% of COPD patients, the
      disease is caused by smoking. About half of the COPD patients are active smokers, although
      smoking is also the most important prognostic factor. Also, smoking is an important cause as
      well as an important prognostic factor in cardiovascular disease. The corner stone of medical
      treatment in COPD is bronchodilation; more than half of the patients use a long-acting
      bronchodilator. An increase of the pathogenic effect of smoking by an increased lung function
      after bronchodilation is likely though, since more pathogenic particles would penetrate the
      lung. We hypothesize that bronchodilators increase cardiovascular disease in COPD patients
      who smoke.

      In order to demonstrate the basic mechanism of our hypothesis, COPD patients receive a
      bronchodilator at one time and a placebo at another time, preceded and followed by cigarette
      smoking during one hour as by a strict time schedule. Smoke retention, lung function and
      blood biomarkers are repeatedly measured.
