      RATIONALE: Monoclonal antibodies, such as rituximab, can block cancer cell growth in
      different ways. Some block the ability of cancer cells to grow and spread. Others find cancer
      cells and help kill them or carry cell-killing substances to them. Drugs used in
      chemotherapy, such as bendamustine hydrochloride, work in different ways to stop the growth
      of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Lenalidomide
      may stop the growth of cancer by blocking blood flow to the tumor. Giving rituximab together
      with bendamustine hydrochloride and lenalidomide may kill more cancer cells.

      PURPOSE: This phase I/II trial is studying the side effects and best dose of giving rituximab
      together with bendamustine hydrochloride and lenalidomide in treating patients with
      aggressive B-cell lymphoma.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  To determine the maximum-tolerated dose of the combination of rituximab, bendamustine
           hydrochloride, and lenalidomide in patients with aggressive B-cell lymphoma not eligible
           for anthracycline-based first-line treatment or intensive regimens including high-dose
           therapy (HDT) followed by autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) in refractory or
           relapsing disease, or as treatment for patients relapsing after HDT with ASCT. (phase
           I).

        -  To identify the recommended dose of this regimen for a phase II study (phase I).

        -  To determine the efficacy and safety of this regimen in these patients (phase II).

      Secondary

        -  To assess the quality of life (QOL) of patients treated with this regimen (phase II).

        -  To evaluate the usefulness and feasibility of the SAKK Cancer-Specific Geriatric
           Assessment (C-SGA) in patients treated with this regimen (phase II).

        -  To assess the association between WHO performance status, QOL indicators, and SAKK C-SGA
           scores (phase II).

        -  To describe changes in SAKK C-SGA scores from pre- to post-treatment and in QOL (phase
           II).

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter, phase I dose-escalation study of bendamustine hydrochloride
      and lenalidomide followed by a phase II study.

      Patients receive rituximab IV on day 1, bendamustine hydrochloride IV over 30-60 minutes on
      days 1-2, and oral lenalidomide on days 1-21. Courses repeat every 28 days for up to 6
      courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients on phase II study complete the SAKK Cancer-Specific Geriatric Assessment at baseline
      and after completion of course 1. Patients also complete quality-of-life questionnaires at
      baseline and periodically during study.

      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed for up to 2 years.
