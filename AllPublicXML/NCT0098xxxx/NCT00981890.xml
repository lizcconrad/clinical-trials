      The purpose of this study is to determine the maximum dose of sunitinib that can be tolerated
      when treatment is combined with radiotherapy. Patients who decide to take part in the study
      will start taking sunitinib alone for 7 days. On the seventh day of taking sunitinib,
      patients will be given stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS).

      The dose of radiation that patients will receive when they are given SRS is a standard dose
      used to help shrink brain metastases. The dose of radiation and the way it is delivered is
      not experimental.

      Patients will then continue to take sunitinib seven days per week after SRS, and depending on
      how far along the study is when they join, they may continue taking the drug for up to 13
      weeks after SRS. Patients will undergo weekly assessment during study treatment.

    <textblock>
      Brain metastases occur in 20% to 40% of all patients with cancer, with an incidence 10 times
      higher than that of primary malignant brain tumours. The reported median survival of patients
      with brain metastases is only 1-2 months with corticosteroids and 5-7 months with whole brain
      radiotherapy (WBRT). But with improvements in neuroimaging, brain metastases are being
      diagnosed more frequently and with a lower burden of disease, such that approximately 50-60%
      of patients have 1 to 4 brain metastases at diagnosis. In these patients, stereotactic
      radiosurgery (SRS), a single high dose of radiation delivered with high precision to the
      target lesion, is being used increasingly as an alternative to surgical resection or as an
      adjunct to WBRT. The addition of SRS to WBRT has provided improvements in local control and
      functional autonomy for patients with oligometastatic brain disease, supporting the
      hypothesis that SRS increases efficacy against tumours resistant to the significantly lower
      doses used in WBRT.

      SRS can accomplish destruction of a defined intracranial target through precise targeting of
      a high dose of radiation with a sharp dose fall off at the target boundaries and minimal
      damage to surrounding tissue. Brain metastases are well suited for SRS as they are often
      small, radiographically well-circumscribed, pseudo-spherical tumors that are
      non-infiltrative, and they are often located at the gray-white junction, where toxicity to
      critical structures is minimal. SRS toxicity is low (&lt;5%).

    <description>Sunitinib is a tablet that is taken by mouth every day. Patients will be treated with Sunitinib alone for 7 days. On the seventh day of taking the drug they will be given SRS. Sunitinib will continue for seven days per week after SRS, and depending on how far along the study is when patients join, they may continue taking the drug for up to 13 weeks after SRS.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

             consistent with brain metastases).

          -  Patients age 18 years of age or older, as the effects of Sunitinib at the recommended

          -  Treatment with sunitinib or other inhibitors of the VEGF signalling axis within 30
             days before Day ) of study treatment or within 30 days after last day of study

             requirement for IV alimentation, prior surgical procedures affecting absorption, or
             active peptic ulcer disease).

          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active
             infection or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with
             study requirements.

          -  Patients with poorly controlled hypertension (systolic blood pressure of 150 mmHg or
             higher, or diastolic blood pressure of 100 mmHg or higher) are ineligible
