      Part 1 (single dose)

      Primary parameters

        -  Area under the plasma concentration curve from zero to infinity [AUC0-inf] and observed
           maximum plasma concentration [Cmax] of Japanese and Caucasian subjects for each dose
           group

        -  If at least 20% of the Japanese or of the Caucasian subjects have an area under the
           plasma concentration curve extrapolation [AUCextrap%] &gt;20% relative to AUC0-inf for one
           of the dose groups area under the plasma concentration curve from zero to the last
           measurable concentration [AUC0- tz] becomes primary parameter for Japanese and Caucasian
           subjects for all of the dose groups. In this case AUC0-tau will become a secondary
           parameter

      Secondary parameters and derived values from statistical analysis

        -  Dose proportionality and linearity in Japanese subjects

        -  Ratios (Japanese vs. Caucasian subjects) of AUC0-∞ and Cmax for each dose group

        -  Dose normalized AUC [AUC0-inf,norm], dose normalized Cmax [Cmax,norm], AUC0- tz, time of
           occurrence of Cmax [tmax], apparent terminal half life [t½], mean residence time [MRT],
           apparent (oral) total plasma clearance [CLtot/f], apparent volume of distribution during
           the terminal disposition phase [Vz/f], AUCextrap%, apparent terminal disposition rate
           constant [λz], weight corrected AUC0-inf, weight corrected AUC0-tz, weight corrected
           Cmax, weight corrected CLtot/f, cumulative amount of excreted Neramexane into urine
           [Ae0-tz], fraction of orally administrated drug excreted into urine [fe/f], renal
           clearance [CLR] and apparent non-renal clearance [CLNR/f]

        -  Safety and tolerability

      Other parameters

        -  Pharmacogenetics

        -  Amount of N-OH Neramexane excreted in urine [Ae0-tz] if a validated method will be
           available at the time of analysis

        -  Metabolite determination (N-OH Neramexane) in plasma and urine, optional (may be
           analyzed and evaluated if a validated method will be available at the time of analysis)

        -  Endogenous creatinine clearance [CLCR], amount of excreted creatinine into urine per
           hour [AeCR,hr]

        -  Evaluation of further metabolites will be described in detail in the Statistical
           Analysis Plan
