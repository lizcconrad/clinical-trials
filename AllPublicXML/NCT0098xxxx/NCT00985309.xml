    <textblock>
      According the terminology of Bethesda 2001, the unsatisfactory cervical cytology can be
      categorized into specimen rejected, or specimen processed and examined, but unsatisfactory
      for evaluation of epithelial abnormality. Most of the unsatisfactory cervical cytology was
      due to scanty epithelial cells, which was defined by less than an estimated 8,000 to 12,000
      well-visualized squamous cells for conventional smears. Follow-up of unsatisfactory smear
      found an increased rate of cervical preinvasive and invasive lesions. Thus, an unsatisfactory
      smear deserves careful follow-up and studies. Although the Bethesda system allows criteria
      modification in cases of hysterectomy, pelvic irradiation therapy, or chemotherapy, no
      studies investigated the clinical factors related to the incidence of unsatisfactory smear.
      Thus, the investigators designed this trial to study the clinical factors relating to
      unsatisfactory cervicovaginal smear.The list of patients who received Papanicolaou smear
      between March 2006 and August 2006 in our hospital will be obtained from the Pathological
      Department first. Then the investigators will review the medical records from HIS system and
      pathologic files of these patients. On estimation, 7,437 cases will be enrolled for analysis.
      Clinical parameters for analysis include: age, gravidity, parity, abortion, menopause,
      location of Pap smear, history of pelvic malignancy, pelvic irradiation, cervical conization,
      hysterectomy; at pregnancy; three months postpartum; vaginal bleeding, vaginal abnormal
      discharge, intrauterine device, and cervical polyp found during pelvic examinations. Patients
      who missed any of above data will be excluded for analysis. The investigators will use
      univariate and multivariate analysis for data processing and statistic analysis to find out
      the relationship between clinical parameters and unsatisfactory cervicovaginal Pap smears.
