  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if external counterpulsation (ECP) is feasible to
      perform, tolerable, and safe as a treatment for patients with acute ischemic stroke (i.e., a
      blockage of one of the arteries supplying a part of the brain), and to assess what type of
      effect it might have on 1) the velocity of blood flow in the arteries supplying the brain and
      2) stroke symptoms. The hypothesis of the study is that ECP will be feasible and safe to
      perform, and will be tolerable for patients with acute ischemic stroke at pressures that
      increase the velocity of arterial blood flow to the brain.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A stroke is usually caused by a blockage of one of the arteries that carries blood to the
      brain. Sometimes with a stroke, there may be a small amount of blood flow that manages to get
      through or around the blockage, and it may be possible that the amount of damage from a
      stroke may be reduced by increasing this blood flow. External counterpulsation (ECP) is a
      procedure in which a machine uses electrical signals from the heart that are detectable on
      the surface of the body in order to time the inflation of cuffs (similar to a blood pressure
      cuff) that are wrapped around a patient's legs (calves, thighs and buttocks). Using a reading
      of the electrical activity from the patient's heart (an electrocardiogram, or ECG, monitor),
      the machine inflates the cuffs with air at just the right time during each heart beat, during
      diastole, in order to change the blood pressure in a way that has been shown to increase
      blood flow to the kidneys, skin, eyes, heart, and brain.

      In this study, patients presenting within the first 48 hours of an acute ischemic stroke
      (i.e., a blockage of one of the arteries supplying a part of the brain) will be randomly
      assigned to either of (1) a 1-hour treatment of external counterpulsation (ECP) applied at a
      pressure that is typically therapeutic, or (2) a 1-hour treatment of ECP at a minimal
      pressure in a control group. ECP-induced changes in brain artery flow velocity will be
      assessed with an ultrasound prior to and then during ECP in each group, and an optimal
      pressure that results in an augmentation of flow velocity will be determined. A neurological
      exam will be performed prior to, during, and after ECP in each group, in order to assess any
      changes in stroke symptoms related to ECP. Patients will be followed to 30 days. The main
      goal of this trial is to evaluate if ECP is safe and feasible to use as a treatment for
      stroke. In addition, the trial will enable an assessment of whether or not ECP increases
      blood flow to the brain or affects the neurological symptoms of a patient with a stroke.

    <measure>Feasibility and Tolerability of External Counterpulsation</measure>
    <time_frame>During one hour of treatment</time_frame>
    <description>The first primary outcome measure was tolerability and feasibility. Tolerance was defined as the absence of any indications to stop the procedure or reduce the pressure to a non-therapeutic level. Feasibility was defined in the full-pressure group as the sustained (at least 30 minutes) tolerance of any pressure capable of causing a 15% augmentation of MFV in 90% of subjects, and defined in the sham-pressure group as the sustained tolerance of the sham pressure in all subjects.</description>

    <measure>Safety (Including Endpoints Such an Increase NIHSS During or Immediately After ECP, and Acute Hemorrhage on Repeating Imaging, Serious Adverse Events Related to ECP, Mortality)</measure>
    <time_frame>30 days</time_frame>
    <description>Safety was evaluated by the incidence of serious adverse events (SAEs) or acute neurological deterioration in relation to the study device and/or procedures at 30 days, the incidence of acute symptomatic hemorrhage on repeat imaging at 24 hours, the incidence of all adverse events (AEs) in the first 48 hours, and mortality at 30 days. The National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) is a stroke severity scale, based on examination, that goes from 0 (no deficit) to a maximum of 42. Acute neurological deterioration - which was captured as a serious adverse event - was defined as a ≥4-point increase on the NIHSS, or a ≥2-point decline in level of consciousness item 1a on the NIHSS, or a new neurological deficit, or clinically significant worsening of motor function lasting more than 8 hours and attributable to a neurological entity. Symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage was defined as new hemorrhage on CT that was associated with acute neurological deterioration.</description>

Tolerance was defined as the absence of any indications to stop the procedure or reduce the pressure to a non-therapeutic level. Feasibility was defined in the full-pressure group as the sustained (at least 30 minutes) tolerance of any pressure capable of causing a 15% augmentation of MFV in 90% of subjects, and defined in the sham-pressure group as the sustained tolerance of the sham pressure in all subjects.</description>

        <title>Safety (Including Endpoints Such an Increase NIHSS During or Immediately After ECP, and Acute Hemorrhage on Repeating Imaging, Serious Adverse Events Related to ECP, Mortality)</title>
        <description>Safety was evaluated by the incidence of serious adverse events (SAEs) or acute neurological deterioration in relation to the study device and/or procedures at 30 days, the incidence of acute symptomatic hemorrhage on repeat imaging at 24 hours, the incidence of all adverse events (AEs) in the first 48 hours, and mortality at 30 days. The National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) is a stroke severity scale, based on examination, that goes from 0 (no deficit) to a maximum of 42. Acute neurological deterioration – which was captured as a serious adverse event - was defined as a ≥4-point increase on the NIHSS, or a ≥2-point decline in level of consciousness item 1a on the NIHSS, or a new neurological deficit, or clinically significant worsening of motor function lasting more than 8 hours and attributable to a neurological entity. Symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage was defined as new hemorrhage on CT that was associated with acute neurological deterioration.</description>
