  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Nimotuzumab is a humanized monoclonal anti-body targeting the epidermal growth factor
      receptor (EGFR). Clinical trials are ongoing globally to evaluate nimotuzumab in different
      indications. Nimotuzumab has demonstrated a unique clinical profile, where anti-tumor
      activity was observed in absence of severe skin, renal, gastrointestinal mucosa toxicities
      commonly associated with EGFR-targeting antibodies. Nimotuzumab has been granted approval for
      use in squamous cell carcinoma of head and neck (SCCHN), glioma and nasopharyngeal cancer in
      many countries. The investigators compared docetaxel plus nimotuzumab with docetaxel alone in
      chemotherapy-refractory/resistant patients with advanced EGFR-positive non-small-cell lung
      cancer to assess the efficacy and safety.

      Nimotuzumab and Docetaxel will be administered to the patient until disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity had occurred.Docetaxel was administered every 3 weeks 75mg/m2;
      Nimotuzumab treatment at 200mg per week,at least 12 weeks.The patients'hematology and
      biochemistry examination will be monitored weekly, a physical exam and assessment of the
      tumor will be performed and every 6 weeks. The patients will be followed up every 3 months to
      evaluate the survival.
