  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Nitric oxide is a multimodal candidate treatment for acute stroke having a number of
      properties which may be beneficial in acute stroke, including lowering blood pressure,
      causing cerebral vasodilation, and improving central and systemic haemodynamics. Nitric oxide
      donors are effective in experimental stroke and pilot studies in patients suggest that one,
      glyceryl trinitrate, can be delivered easily in a transdermal preparation. Around half of all
      patients admitted with acute stroke are taking antihypertensive therapy immediately prior to
      their stroke. No data exist as to whether it is beneficial or safe to stop or continue this
      treatment during the acute phase. ENOS is a prospective, international, multicentre,
      randomised, parallel-group, blinded, controlled, collaborative, factorial trial designed to
      test two questions related to the management of blood pressure immediately post-stroke:

        1. The safety and efficacy of nitric oxide, given as transdermal glyceryl trinitrate.

        2. The safety and efficacy of stopping or continuing prior antihypertensive medication.

      Previously independent adult patients who are conscious and have residual limb weakness are
      eligible for enrollment. Central randomisation will be performed via the internet. Treatment
      is initiated within 48 hours of stroke onset and is given as daily glyceryl trinitrate
      patches for 7 days. A computed tomography (CT) scan is required within 7 days of
      randomisation. Early follow-up is performed locally over the 7 days of treatment, including
      blood pressure, early stroke events, and adverse events. Telephone central follow-up by the
      trial co-ordinating centre will be performed at 3 months. The primary outcome is combined
      death or dependency (modified Rankin Score &gt;2).
