      The purpose of this study is to improve antibiotic prescribing practices of Mexican primary
      care physicians for patients seeking care for acute respiratory tract infections (ARIs). The
      investigators will employ a combination of qualitative and quantitative methods to develop
      and evaluate a patient education and physician decision-support intervention.

      Hypothesis 1: The investigators will identify barriers and facilitators of appropriate
      antibiotic use for ARIs that can be addressed through patient education and physician
      decision-support.

      Hypothesis 2: The proportion of patients who report desire for antibiotics as a &quot;very
      important&quot; reason for seeking care will decrease from 50% to 30% following exposure to the
      educational intervention; and 90% (95% confidence interval: 80% to 100%) of patients will
      report that they trust the information provided by the computer.

      Hypothesis 3: Antibiotic prescribing for adults with uncomplicated acute bronchitis will
      decrease from 80 percent to 40 percent following the introduction of a real-time clinical
      decision support tool.
