  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Although the beneficial effects of caffeine on cognition and mood have been reported in a
      number of studies, relatively few studies have looked at the effects of caffeine in
      combination with other phytonutrients despite the fact that caffeine is seldom consumed in
      isolation. L-theanine is a naturally occurring amino-acid found in tea, and has been used
      historically as a relaxing agent (Haskell et al., 2008). Few have assessed the impact of
      l-theanine on cognition, but of those that have, the most interesting results were obtained
      when l-theanine was assessed in combination with caffeine (Haskell et al., 2008). It remains
      unclear what is underlying the reported effects.

      Near Infrared Spectroscopy (NIRS) is an emerging neuroimaging technology that is capable of
      determining changes in cerebral blood flow (CBF) by measuring the optical properties of
      oxygenated and deoxygenated blood (Bunce et al., 2006). No study to date has used NIRS to
      assess cerebral blood flow following treatment with either caffeine, l-theanine or a
      combination of both. It is anticipated that the proposed study will provide some insight into
      the mechanism of the previously observed effects both alone and in combination.

      A randomised, double-blind, placebo controlled, balanced crossover design study will assess
      the effects of 75mg caffeine, 50mg l-theanine and a 75mg caffeine/50mg l-theanine combination
      in 24 young healthy adults (18-35). Cognitive and mood assessments will take place at
      baseline and at 30 minutes following treatment whilst cerebral haemodynamics are measured via
      the technique of NIRS.
