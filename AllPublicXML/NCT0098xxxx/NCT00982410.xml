      The proposed project will provide crucial data on the effectiveness of a pain management
      intervention designed for veterans with co-occurring pain and substance use disorders. The
      development of an empirically validated psychosocial intervention for managing pain and
      substance misuse could greatly enhance the current set of options for treating this large and
      understudied group of veterans.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Background: Chronic non-cancer pain and substance use disorders frequently co-occur in VA
      primary care and addictions treatment settings. The treatment for pain is complicated in
      veterans with a history of alcohol or drug misuse because of a potential for abuse and
      diversion of many prescription pain medications. Thus, treatment providers are left without
      successful and empirically-supported methods for treating the large number of patients with
      chronic pain who also have past or current substance use disorders. One potential strategy is
      to use cognitive-behavioral treatment (CBT) interventions to manage pain and decrease
      substance use abuse/misuse. Psychosocial interventions such as CBT have demonstrated efficacy
      for reducing pain and improving functioning in persons with a broad spectrum of pain-related
      problems. However, this form of treatment has not been explicitly tested in patients with
      co-occurring substance use disorders. Determining the effectiveness of a psychosocial
      intervention targeting both pain and substance use disorders would greatly increase the
      available treatment options for veterans with these conditions.

      Project Objectives: This project is designed to test the effect of a CBT intervention for
      patients with chronic pain who are already engaged in VA treatment for substance use
      disorders compared to an educational supportive condition on measures of pain intensity,
      pain-related disability and pain-tolerance. A set of secondary analyses will examine if group
      CBT compared to the educational supportive condition is associated with greater reductions in
      illicit substance use over the follow-up time period and whether during-treatment reductions
      in pain mediate the effect of treatment assignment on later substance use. Finally, a series
      of secondary analyses will explore whether the hypothesized mechanisms of action for the CBT
      intervention mediate the effect of this intervention on pain intensity and pain tolerance.

      Methods: The proposed study is a randomized controlled trial of group-based CBT compared to
      an educational supportive condition in patients currently receiving drug and alcohol
      treatment. At least 128 Veterans with alcohol or drug abuse or dependence and at least
      moderate pain currently treated in the Ann Arbor VA Substance Use Disorder treatment clinic
      will be assessed at baseline and then randomly assigned to one of these two conditions. These
      patients will be re-assessed at 3-months (i.e. immediately post treatment), 6-months and
      12-months. The primary outcomes will be pain intensity, pain-related disability and pain
      tolerance. Mixed model regression analyses will be used for all primary analyses to estimate
      between-group differences in changes in individual slopes over time. Finally, a series of
      secondary analyses will explore (a) whether the intervention influences post-treatment
      substance use, (b) if change in pain during treatment mediates the effect of the intervention
      on subsequent substance use and (c) whether the hypothesized mechanisms of action for the CBT
      intervention mediate the effect of this intervention on pain intensity and pain tolerance.

    <measure>Pain Intensity, as Measured by Average Pain Within the Last Week (NRS-1)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 3-, 6-, &amp; 12-months</time_frame>
    <description>The outcome measure below represents the average pain levels in each Arm/Group, across the entire follow-up period. Average pain in the last week (NRS-1) is a scale ranging from 0 (no pain) to 10 (worst possible pain). The results reported below are based on longitudinal repeated measures modeling, adjusted for baseline NRS-1 average pain level. The variance was modeled to account for time interval (3-mo, 6-mo, 12-mo), and for session block; at the time of randomization, participants were assigned to blocks for a series of 10 sessions, in parallel for the intervention and control. Session blocks were utilized as a blocking variable to address between-block variation.</description>

    <measure>As-treated Analysis: Pain Intensity, as Measured by Average Pain Within the Last Week (NRS-1)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 3-, 6-, 12-months</time_frame>
    <description>Per study protocol, participants were asked to attend 10 sessions, which comprised the intervention for CBT participants and educational support for EUC participants. Some participants in each group did not attend any sessions, yet participated in follow-up assessments. The As-treated analysis was undertaken to evaluate the impact of the intervention, among participants that attended at least 1 session. As in the Primary Analysis, average pain last week (NRS-1) is a scale ranging from 0 (no pain) to 10 (worst possible pain). The results reported below are based on longitudinal repeated measures modeling, adjusted for baseline NRS-1 average pain level. The variance was modeled to account for time interval (3-mo, 6-mo, 12-mo), and for session block; at the time of randomization, participants were assigned to blocks for a series of 10 sessions, in parallel for the intervention and control.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  A report of pain of at least moderate or greater over the three months prior to
             baseline assessment as indicated by an average score of four or greater on the Numeric
             Rating Scale of pain intensity (NRS-I; Farrar et al. 2001);

          -  Completion of an intake assessment in the Ann Arbor VA's SUD clinic within the three
             months prior to baseline assessment. The pain-related inclusion criterion will be used
             to ensure that participants are experiencing elevated levels of pain and,
             consequently, are appropriate for pain-related treatment.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Acute suicidality based on responses on the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) confirmed
             by in-depth assessment of patient by the research associate;

          -  Psychiatric condition that precludes participation in outpatient group treatment based
             on:

               -  a Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE; Folstein et al. 1975) score less than 21,

               -  psychiatric hospitalization within the past month, or

               -  endorsement of current psychotic symptoms on the Brief Symptom Inventory (BSI;
                  Derogatis 1993) combined with noticeable bizarre thoughts or behavior during the
                  interview;

          -  Inability to speak and understand English; and

          -  The inability to give informed, voluntary, written consent.

        Decisions about exclusion criteria 1 and 2 will be made using a combination of
        self-reported symptoms and researcher's judgment.

The CPSS has three primary subscales: self-efficacy for pain management (PSE), self-efficacy for physical function (FSE) and self-efficacy for coping with symptoms (CSE). These scales have high reliability. Scores range from 10-100, with higher scores representing a better outcome.</description>

          <title>Drug abuse or drug dependence</title>
          <description>University of Arkansas Substance Abuse Outcomes Module (SAOM; Smith et al. 1996). 25-item self-report measure designed to assess the severity of alcohol and drug problems. Persons classified as drug abusers (a) had no dependence, but (b) did meet the criteria for abuse on one or more substance. If a person met criteria for abuse on one substance and dependence on another, they were classified as drug-dependent. Persons with no abuse and no dependence did not meet criteria for abuse or dependence. Based on use of cannabis, cocaine, opioids, or stimulants in past 4 weeks.</description>

        <title>Pain Intensity, as Measured by Average Pain Within the Last Week (NRS-1)</title>
        <description>The outcome measure below represents the average pain levels in each Arm/Group, across the entire follow-up period. Average pain in the last week (NRS-1) is a scale ranging from 0 (no pain) to 10 (worst possible pain). The results reported below are based on longitudinal repeated measures modeling, adjusted for baseline NRS-1 average pain level. The variance was modeled to account for time interval (3-mo, 6-mo, 12-mo), and for session block; at the time of randomization, participants were assigned to blocks for a series of 10 sessions, in parallel for the intervention and control. Session blocks were utilized as a blocking variable to address between-block variation.</description>

        <title>As-treated Analysis: Pain Intensity, as Measured by Average Pain Within the Last Week (NRS-1)</title>
        <description>Per study protocol, participants were asked to attend 10 sessions, which comprised the intervention for CBT participants and educational support for EUC participants. Some participants in each group did not attend any sessions, yet participated in follow-up assessments. The As-treated analysis was undertaken to evaluate the impact of the intervention, among participants that attended at least 1 session. As in the Primary Analysis, average pain last week (NRS-1) is a scale ranging from 0 (no pain) to 10 (worst possible pain). The results reported below are based on longitudinal repeated measures modeling, adjusted for baseline NRS-1 average pain level. The variance was modeled to account for time interval (3-mo, 6-mo, 12-mo), and for session block; at the time of randomization, participants were assigned to blocks for a series of 10 sessions, in parallel for the intervention and control. Session blocks were utilized as a blocking variable to address between-block variation</description>
