      RATIONALE: Bortezomib may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking some of the enzymes
      needed for cell growth. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as cladribine, work in different
      ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from
      dividing. Monoclonal antibodies, such as rituximab, can block cancer growth in different
      ways. Some block the ability of cancer cells to grow and spread. Others find cancer cells and
      help kill them or carry cancer-killing substances to them. Giving bortezomib together with
      cladribine and rituximab may kill more cancer cells.

      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well giving bortezomib together with cladribine
      and rituximab works in treating patients with advanced mantle cell lymphoma or indolent
      lymphoma.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Determine the 2-year progression-free survival of patients with advanced mantle cell
           lymphoma or indolent lymphoma treated with bortezomib, cladribine, and rituximab.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the 2-year overall survival of patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine the complete response and overall response rate in patients treated with this
           regimen.

        -  Describe the long- and short-term toxicity of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Determine the prognostic importance of Aurora kinase A in patients treated with this
           regimen.

        -  Determine the cytokine profiles for each lymphoma subtype and how they change with this
           regimen.

        -  Evaluate the prognostic importance of major carcinogenic pathways using tissue
           microarray.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive bortezomib IV on days 1 and 4, cladribine IV over 2 hours on days
      1-5, and rituximab IV on day 1. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 6 courses in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Blood samples are collected at baseline and after course 1 for cytokine profile studies.
      Previously collected tissue samples are obtained for analysis of Aurora kinase A and B,
      Ki-67, cyclin D, Bcl-2, phosphor-HisH3, c-Met, and VEGF expression by using tissue microarray
      (IHC staining), reverse transcriptase-PCR, and/or western blotting.

      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed up every 3 months for 2 years.
