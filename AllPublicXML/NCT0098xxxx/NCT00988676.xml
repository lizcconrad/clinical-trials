  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      High quality bowel cleaning preparation was most important prerequisites of a accurate
      colonoscopy, because even a small amount of residual fecal matter can obscure small polyps
      and increase unnecessary procedure time. Until now, several studies evaluated the impact of
      bowel preparation on the quality of colonoscopy using comparison of the polyp detection rate
      in patients with adequate bowel preparation status to that in patients with inadequate bowel
      preparation status during colonoscopy. However, there was no direct measurement the effect
      bowel preparation status on the polyp missing rate, the quality of colonoscopy, using tandem
      colonoscopic evaluation in prospective setting.

      1. Study flow

        1. All patients perform Colonoscopy

             -  record the polyp size, shape, location and number

             -  record the factors affecting polyp missing rate

                  -  Patients' age / gender

                  -  Indication of colonoscopy

                  -  colonoscopist career

                  -  colonoscopy withdrawal time

                  -  bowel preparation status according to scale of U.S. Multi-Society Task Force
                     on colorectal cancer, Aronchick's scale and Ottawa bowel preparation quality
                     scale

        2. the patients needed or wanted to 2nd stage colonoscopic polypectomy (2nd stage
           polypectomy was performed within 6 month)

             -  record additionally detected polyp - size, shape, location and number
