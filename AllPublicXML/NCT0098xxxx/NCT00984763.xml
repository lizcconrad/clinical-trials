  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Malaria is a parasite, infection with which kills over 2 million people each year. It is a
      major problem for those who live in endemic areas and for travellers. There is a great need
      for a safe effective malaria vaccine. The purpose of this study is to examine a new vaccine
      designed to provide immunity during the blood stage of the malaria parasite's lifecycle.

      The vaccine consists of AMA1-C1 which is a mixture of two recombinant synthetic AMA1 proteins
      from two Plasmodium falciparum strains, Alhydrogel® which is an aluminium-based adjuvant and
      CPG 7909 - an oligodeoxynucleotide, which enhances immune response.

      This study will enable the investigators to assess:

        1. The ability of of a growth inhibition assay to predict the effectiveness of a malaria
           vaccine.

        2. The safety of the vaccine in healthy volunteers

        3. The response of the human immune system to the vaccine
