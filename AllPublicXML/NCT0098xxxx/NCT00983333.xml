  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research focuses on communication practices between patients and health care
      professionals, like nurses, doctors, or physician assistants. The goal is to help improve
      communication about heart health issues.

      This pilot (or Beta) study is designed to test our ability to recruit an appropriate sample
      of participants, and determine our ability to deliver and evaluate the effects of a web-based
      intervention. The investigators hypothesize that exposure to the intervention will result in
      measurable changes in self-reported knowledge, attitudes and behavior regarding communication
      between patients and health care professionals.

      Participants in this research study are being recruited from the people who currently receive
      care at the Richmond Family Health Center of the Oregon Health &amp; Science University. People
      who participate in this study will be between 55 and 70 years old, speak English as their
      preferred language, and have one of several possible diagnoses related to heart health. These
      could include, for example, hypertension, diabetes, asthma, or obesity.

      Additionally, the investigators are recruiting a small number of health care professionals
      from the Richmond Family Health Center. Their participation will be similar to but separate
      from the participation of patients.

      All participants will take two web-based surveys. Some participants will use a web-based tool
      that hopes to help improve communication between health care professionals and patients.

      The surveys contain questions that explore the knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors of
      participants related to heart health and communication between health care professionals and
      patients.

      Data analysis will focus upon identifying any changes that occurred in knowledge, attitudes,
      or behaviors with respect to health communication after using the web-based tool, as well as
      learning about what influences the quality and nature of communication between health care
      professionals and the patients they serve.
