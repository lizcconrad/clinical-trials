    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the safest dose of the study drug Vitamin E
      Delta-tocotrienol, how often it should be taken, and how well people with pancreatic tumors
      tolerate Vitamin E Delta-tocotrienol.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Delta-tocotrienol is a natural Vitamin E compound that has been consumed by humans as a
      dietary supplement. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has not approved it for sale as a
      drug. Vitamin E Delta-tocotrienol is being investigated for the prevention and treatment of
      pancreatic tumors. The usefulness of the Vitamin E Delta-tocotrienol in treating human tumors
      is unknown.

      This study consists of the following: (1) a Pre-Treatment Period in which participants are
      consented and qualified for the study; (2) a Study Treatment Period in which participant will
      receive Vitamin E δ-Tocotrienol administered orally twice daily for 14 (±2) consecutive days
      and once on the day of surgery, with associated pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic sampling;
      (3) a Post Treatment Period in which laboratory and physical examinations are performed.
      Adverse events will be recorded throughout the study.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  The patient has a resectable tumor or cyst arising from the pancreatic exocrine gland
             (pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm of the
             pancreas, or mucinous cystic neoplasm of the pancreas) and is undergoing surgical
             resection of the neoplasm.

          -  The patient is not a candidate for neoadjuvant chemoradiation therapy (i.e., patients
             with borderline resectable pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma who are known to benefit
             from neoadjuvant treatment regimens).

          -  The patient has an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of ≤2.

          -  The patient has adequate organ function as follows: Serum creatinine ≤1.5 mg/dL or
             calculated creatinine clearance &gt;60 mL/min; Bilirubin ≤ the institutional upper limit
             of normal (ULN); Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST)
             ≤2.5 times the upper limit of normal if no liver involvement or ≤5 times the upper
             limit of normal with liver involvement; absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥ 1000mm³;
             Platelet count ≥100,000/mm³.

          -  The patient has the capability of understanding the informed consent document and has
             signed the informed consent document.

          -  Sexually active patients (male and female) must use medically acceptable methods of
             contraception during the course of the study.

             therapy, or investigational therapy (other than the investigational therapy under
             study).

          -  The patient has received radiation therapy, chemotherapy, other anti-neoplastic
             therapy, or investigational therapy within 30 days prior to first dose of study drug.

             study drug.

          -  The patient has uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to,
             ongoing or active infection, hypertension, symptomatic congestive heart failure,
             unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations
             that would limit compliance with study requirements.

          -  The patient is unable or unwilling to stop taking vitamins, herbal remedies, or
             nonprescription medications.

          -  The patient is pregnant or breastfeeding.

          -  The patient is unable or unwilling to abide by the study protocol or cooperate fully
