  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal is to test the safety and efficacy of an EPA-enriched oil made by DuPont. DuPont
      wishes to corroborate the safety of its novel oil rich in EPA in humans prior to placing such
      a dietary supplement on the market. The goal of this study is to test this oil at doses of
      600 mg and 1800 mg of EPA/day as compared to olive oil placebo and a comparator oil providing
      600 mg of DHA/day over a 6 wk period. In a parallel arm study design, 120 healthy adults will
      be randomized to one of four groups (30 in each group) and studied in both the fasting and
      post-prandial state.

      The safety profile of omega-3 fatty acids is considered to be excellent, and has been
      recognized as safe (GRAS) by the US Food and Drug Administration when EPA and DHA
      (docosahexanoic acid) are given together at a dose of 3 grams/day or less. Safety will be
      monitored by assessing for adverse reactions, measuring vital signs and a variety of
      laboratory tests including a complete metabolic profile and complete blood count. Efficacy
      will be assessed by measuring changes in fatty acid profile and or fatty acid ratios.
