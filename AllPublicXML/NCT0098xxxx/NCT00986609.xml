      RATIONALE:

      Vaccines made from peptides may help the body build an effective immune response to kill
      tumor cells. Giving booster vaccinations may make a stronger immune response and prevent or
      delay the recurrence of cancer.

      PURPOSE:

      To evaluate the efficacy of poly-ICLC + MUCI peptide vaccine in boosting the immunologic
      response to MUCI in patients with triple-negative BC

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the efficacy of MUC1 peptide-poly-ICLC adjuvant vaccine in boosting systemic
      immunity to MUC1 in women who have completed therapy for AJCC(American Joint Committee on
      Cancer)stage I-III 'triple-negative' [i.e., ER(-) PR(-) HER2/neu(-)] breast cancer.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the safety and toxicity of the MUC1 peptide and poly-ICLC vaccine in this
      cohort of patients.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive MUC-1 peptide vaccine subcutaneously (SC) and poly-ICLC vaccine SC in weeks
      0, 2, and 10 in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Some patients
      may receive a booster vaccine in week 52. Patients will be followed for study-related Serious
      Adverse Events (SAEs) for a period of 30 days after their last vaccination. If a patient
      experiences a SAE while participating in this study, they will be followed until the
      resolution of the SAE.

    <description>Defined as a &gt;= 2-fold enhancement from baseline anti-MUC1 antibody immunity, or for subjects with no antibody to MUC1 at baseline, any detectable antibody immunity against MUC1. To test the hypothesis of a sufficient immunologic response, we will apply a Simon's optimum 2-stage design. The proportion of patients with an immunologic response will be calculated with a 95% confidence interval using method developed for multistage clinical trials.</description>
