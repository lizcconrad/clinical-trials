  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a blinded randomized controlled trial in patients undergoing laparoscopic colon
      surgery. The aim of this study is to assess whether perioperative intravenous lidocaine has
      an impact on the early post operative physical activity recovery of patients scheduled for
      laparoscopic colon surgery.

      Twenty patients will receive thoracic epidural analgesia, twenty patients will receive
      intravenous lidocaine plus patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) and twenty patients will
      receive only PCA.

      Hypothesis: patients receiving perioperative intravenous lidocaine, post operative recovery
      will be faster and decrease pain intensity, opioid consumption and side effects, length of
      hospital stay; probably as a result of a significant opioid sparing and attenuated
      inflammatory response.

      This is a blinded randomised study of patients undergoing major laparoscopic abdominal and
      pelvic surgery. The first group of patients will receive thoracic epidural analgesia, the
      second group will receive perioperative intravenous lidocaine, the third group will PCA alone
      and the last group will receive spinal analgesia. Functional restoration assessed by
      self-administered quality of Life questionnaires (SF-36, CHAMPS, ICFS) and 2 and 6 min
      walking test will be assessed in the two groups at 3 and 8 weeks after the surgery.
