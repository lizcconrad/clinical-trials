      This study compared the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of an oral insulin
      formulation with that of a standard subcutaneous injection of regular human insulin.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study was a single centre, randomized, 3-period crossover study performed in patients
      with type 2 diabetes. Patients received single doses of an oral insulin formulation and
      subcutaneous regular human insulin on separate visits.

      The primary objective of this study was to compare the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic
      properties of an oral insulin formulation with that of 15 U subcutaneous injected regular
      human insulin.

      Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic parameters including bioavailability and bioefficacy were
      measured during 6-hour glucose clamp experiments.

      Study duration: 2 months

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Male subjects between the ages of 35 and 70 years, inclusive, with Type 2 diabetes
             mellitus as defined by the ADA criteria for more than one year

          -  Subjects must have Body Mass Index (BMI) &lt; 36 kg/m²

          -  Stable glycemic control (HbA1C &lt;11%)

          -  Subjects must be off all oral hypoglycemic agents 24 hours prior to each study dosing
             day and off any investigational drug for at least 4 weeks

          -  Subjects must refrain from strenuous physical activity beginning 72 hours prior to
             admission and through the duration of the study

          -  Subjects must be willing and able to be confined to the Clinical Research Unit as
             required by the protocol

          -  Subjects must be willing and able to provide written informed consent

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  History or presence of clinically significant cardiovascular, respiratory, hepatic,
             renal, gastrointestinal, neurological or infectious disorders capable of altering the
             absorption, metabolism or elimination of drugs, or of constituting a risk factor when
             taking the study medication

          -  Subjects with gastroparesis, orthostatic hypotension and hypoglycemia unawareness
             (autonomic neuropathy).

          -  Subjects with &quot;brittle&quot; diabetes or predisposition to severe hypoglycemia, e.g., 2 or
             more serious hypoglycemic episodes (requiring another's assistance) within the past
             year, or any hospitalization or emergency room visit due to poor diabetic control
             within the past 6 months.

          -  Evidence of significant active hematological disease and/or cumulative blood donation
             of 1 unit (500 mL) or more including blood drawn during clinical trials in the last 3
             months

          -  Positive hepatitis B (hepatitis B surface antigen) and/or hepatitis C (hepatitis C
             antibody) serology

          -  Positive HIV serology

             or subjects unwilling to stop alcohol for the duration of the study (* 1 unit = 8 g
             ethanol, ¼ liter of beer or 1 glass wine or 1 measure of spirits)

          -  Intake of any drug which in the evaluation of the investigator may interfere with the
             interpretation of trial results or are known to cause clinically relevant interference
             with insulin action, glucose utilisation or recovery from hypoglycaemia.

          -  Treatment with s.c. insulin injections.

          -  Investigators, site personnel directly affiliated with this study, and their immediate
             families. Immediate family is defined as a spouse, parent, child or sibling, whether
             biological or legally adopted

          -  Have any other condition (including drug abuse, alcohol abuse, or psychiatric
             disorder) that, in the opinion of the investigator, precludes the patient from
             following and completing the protocol.
