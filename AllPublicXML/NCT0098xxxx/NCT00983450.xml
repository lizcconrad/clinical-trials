  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study will include 20 subjects who will be randomly divided to two groups: a ten person
      group being the study group and a ten person group acting as a control group (each group will
      include a similar number of females and males as the other group). In addition, the
      physiotherapy treatments at the rehabilitation center, the study group will gain an
      intervention consisting of 12 therapy sessions, administered for 12 consecutive days (apart
      of weekends). The intervention will include 6 minutes of watching a movie clip alternately
      showing a healthy man and a healthy woman at their sixties, walking while being filmed from
      various angles. Immediately after watching, the subject will perform 6 minutes of walking,
      under the experimenters supervision, but without his or hers intervention. Immediately
      following the walking, the whole procedure will be repeated (watching a clip and walking).

      The control group will undergo 12 treatments of the same nature, but will watch the movie
      clip shown backwards, so that the people filmed will seem to walk backwards (it was
      established that watching a reversed action does not activate the MNS system activated by a
      regular execution of the activity [Celnik et al., 2008]), followed by 6 minutes of walking
      under the experimenters supervision, then watching the movie again and walking again.

      The person performing the examinations will be blinded as to the division of the subjects to
      the study group and the control group. After performing the previously noted examinations
      needed to participate in the research, the subjects found fit will be examined before the
      beginning of the intervention, at its end and then three months after its conclusion. The
      examinations will include smart step and walking parameters.
