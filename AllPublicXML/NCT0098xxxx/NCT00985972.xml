      The aim of this study focuses on obtaining accurate information on the effectiveness of
      interventions involving physical activity and/or nutrition education developed in the school
      environment. This study is intended to assist in future assembly and development of effective
      school practices related to preventing and reducing levels of overweight in children and
      adolescents.

      Updated data from the systematic review:

      5,899 studies were retrieved in 14 databases (Assia, Central Cochrane, CINAHL, EMBASE, ERIC,
      ISI, LILACS, Physical Education Index, PsycINFO, PubMed, Social Care Online, Social Services
      Abstracts, Sociological Abstracts, SPORTDiscus)

      1,228 were excluded as duplicates by Eppi Reviewer

      4,678 studies referred for evaluation by title and abstracts (4,671 by systematic searches, 7
      by cross-references list)

      211 full text papers reviewed by EPHPP and GRADE tools

    <textblock>
      The inordinate increase in the prevalence of overweight and obesity at the international
      level today is one of the targets of concern the department of public health, and gradually
      has been the focus of many studies and interventions which emphasize the need for more
      evidence to clear and effective its prevention and reduction. Obesity can affect the short or
      long term health of individuals, through problems such as left ventricular hypertrophy in
      young-adult and atherosclerosis, which is due to the formation of plaques of fat in the
      arterial wall and may lead to coronary artery disease , cerebrovascular disease and
      peripheral vascular disease.

      The promotion of regular practice of physical activity through physical education school can
      be an effective way to prevent obesity among children, especially girls. There is an inverse
      relationship between physical activity and incidence of hypertension. The earlier the
      entrance to the practice of physical activities, there will be more effective in combating
      the increase in body mass index (BMI).

      Nutrition Education is to extend the knowledge on nutrition and the ability to understand the
      practices and eating behavior, improving the relationship of the individual in the
      environment which is introduced, allowing the taking of decisions under the situation
      presented.
