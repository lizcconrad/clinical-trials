  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Alcohol abuse is a widespread concern internationally with a significant threat to world
      health. Research suggests a relationship between heavy drinking and certain clinical
      presentations such as injuries, physical and psychiatric illnesses and frequent sickness
      absence from employment. This research aims to establish whether brief interventions
      delivered to harmful and hazardous alcohol drinkers admitted to hospital impacts of their
      alcohol consumption levels on discharge from hospital.

      Purpose To evaluate the effectiveness of brief interventions for hazardous and harmful
      alcohol abusers admitted to medical and surgical wards at the Southern General Hospital

      Evidence for brief interventions in general hospital Further research is required to prove
      the benefits of brief interventions within general hospital, based on evidence from the
      Cochrane systematic review 'Brief interventions for heavy alcohol users admitted to general
      hospital wards' (McQueen et al 2009).

      Links with national and international agendas The European Health Target12 supports a
      reduction in harm from alcohol drugs and tobacco. By the year 2015 the adverse health effects
      from the consumption of addictive substances such as alcohol should be reduced by all member
      states (European Health for all targets 1998) The Scottish government has set HEAT (Health
      improvement, efficacy and governance access and treatment) target for the NHS to deliver
      149,449 alcohol brief intervention cumulatively over the period of 2008/9-2010/11 (Scottish
      Alcohol and Drugs Workforce 2008).

      Research Design This study will employ a randomised control trial design. The primary outcome
      measure will be grams of alcohol consumed per week, measures will be taken at baseline, six
      months and one year post intervention. Secondary outcomes will consist of brief
      intervention's impact on hospital re-admission rates, attendance at A&amp;E and mortality rates.
