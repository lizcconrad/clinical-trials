      -  Context: Mothers living with HIV (MLH) and their children face predictable challenges:
           maintaining physical and mental health, parenting while ill, and addressing HIV-related
           stressors.

        -  Objective: To evaluate the efficacy of a family-based intervention over time; to
           contrast the life adjustments of HIV-affected families and their non-HIV-affected
           neighbors in the current treatment era.

        -  Design: Randomized controlled trial of MLH and a longitudinal comparison of MLH to a
           neighborhood cohort using random effect regression.

        -  Participants and Intervention: MLH (n = 339) and their school-age children (n = 259)
           were randomly assigned to receive 1) an intervention of 16 sessions in a
           cognitive-behavioral, small-group format; or 2) control. MLH and their children were
           compared to non-HIV-affected families recruited at shopping markets. Participant
           retention was high: 84% at 6 months, 83% at 12 months, and 78% at 18 months.

        -  Main Outcome Measures: Family functioning and conflict, mental and physical health,
           sexual behavior, and substance use.
