      The purpose of this study is to determine whether clean air administered to the breathing
      zone with Temperature controlled Laminar Airflow (TLA) during night is effective in the
      treatment of perennial allergic asthma.

      Background: Exposure to inhaled allergens is a pathogenetic factor in allergic asthma.
      However, most studies that previously looked at air cleaning devices have shown little or no
      effect on patients with perennial allergic asthma. Aims and objectives: This study aims to
      investigate a novel treatment, TLA, using temperature controlled laminar airflow with a very
      low particle concentration directed to the breathing zone of teenagers and adults with
      allergic asthma during night sleep. The hypothesis is that the decreased allergen exposure
      during the night will have an effect on bronchial inflammation and quality of life. Method:
      Patients are randomized to start with active or placebo treatment for 10 weeks. All patients
      receive both active and placebo treatment with unfiltered air, with a 2-week wash-out period
      in between treatments. Maintenance treatment with inhaled corticosteroids is unaltered during
      the trial period. Health related quality of life (miniAQLQ)is the primary effectiveness
      measure. Exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO) and spirometry are also investigated.

    <description>The intervention is designed to reduce the allergen load in the patients breathing zone by vertically displacing the allergens, originating from the bed and the ambient room environment, with a temperature controlled laminar airflow (TLA) during night sleep. The airflow is filtered through a high efficiency particulate air filter(HEPA), slightly cooled and ''showered'' over the subject. Due to the higher density, the cooled air descends slowly, and displaces the allergens from the breathing zone.</description>
