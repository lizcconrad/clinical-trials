    <textblock>
      Obesity and physical inactivity have reached epidemic proportions, resulting in increased
      rates of a variety of chronic diseases, increased risk of death, and substantial health care
      costs. Individuals with serious mental illness are even more likely to be overweight or
      obese, which contributes to the high rate of co-morbid medical disease and early mortality
      found among this population. Specific individual and group-based psychoeducational
      interventions have repeatedly and consistently been shown to help adults with serious mental
      illness improve their weight. However, these require substantial time from mental health
      clinicians, and frequent visits by patients to mental health clinics. This creates challenges
      for patients who may need to travel to a medical center that provides these services, and who
      often have limited transportation options. It is likely that these barriers can be addressed
      with a computerized, web-based intervention focused on diet and exercise education, and
      tailored for veterans with serious mental illness. Web-based systems can deliver content that
      is intensive, engaging, and tailored to the needs and preferences of specific patients.
      Web-based systems can be delivered using computers at community-based outpatient Clinics or
      other settings in the community. The objective of this project is to develop and evaluate the
      effectiveness of a web-based intervention to help patients with serious mental illness lose
      weight.

      Background: Obesity has reached epidemic proportions, and often has serious adverse health
      consequences. The VA has deployed a &quot;MOVE! Weight Management Program&quot; nationally in the
      general patient population. Since individuals with serious mental illness (SMI) often have
      cognitive deficits, specialized psychoeducational interventions are needed in this
      population. Specialized psychoeducational interventions for weight have been developed and
      studied in populations with SMI. This evidence-based practice has been adapted for use in VA,
      resulting in a &quot;MOVE! SMI&quot; intervention. However, it has proven to be quite difficult to
      disseminate this intervention. Patients with SMI often have limited transportation options,
      and may not want to participate in groups. Also, in-person MOVE! SMI requires substantial
      time from mental health clinicians. This clinician time has been difficult to deploy or is
      not available at many clinic locations. It is likely that these barriers can be addressed
      with a computerized, web-based version of MOVE! . Specialized web-based approaches have been
      studied and found to be successful in people with SMI, and can deliver content that is
      intensive and engaging with minimal requirements for staff time.

      Objectives: The VA Network 5 and 22 Mental Illness Research, Education, and Clinical Centers
      (MIRECCs) developed a web-based system that provides computerized counseling regarding diet
      to individuals with SMI. The proposed project expanded this system. This project's objectives
      are to: 1) develop a comprehensive web-based system that delivers MOVE! using design features
      that meet the needs of individuals with mental illness; 2) evaluate the effectiveness, in
      patients with serious mental illness, of web-based MOVE! compared with in-person MOVE! and a
      control group; and, 3) characterize, from the patient's perspective, the strengths,
      weaknesses, and barriers to the use of in-person and web-based MOVE!.

      Methods: This is a prospective, randomized, controlled trial in patients with SMI who are
      obese and receiving treatment with medications that often have weight gain as a major
      side-effect. Participants are assigned to in-person MOVE! SMI, web-based MOVE! SMI with
      support from peer coaches, or a comparison group. Research assessments occur at 0, 3, 6, 9
      and 12 months. Changes in outcomes are compared over time between the three groups.
      Comparative effectiveness is evaluated at 6 months. A secondary objective is to evaluate the
      extent to which gains are maintained at 9 and 12 months.

      Status: The project team developed the needed materials, methods, and informatics systems.
      Patients were enrolled, and study enrollment and interventions are complete. Follow up
      interviews are complete and the interventions have been evaluated.

      <recruitment_details>Between February 2012 and April 2014, we obtained a list of individuals at the study site who met inclusion criteria for psychiatric diagnosis, age, and psychotropic medication. Study flyers were also posted in mental health clinics. 1429 individuals were screened for eligibility, and 19% were eligible, interested, enrolled, and randomized.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>7 patients were withdrawn by the PI when they were determined to be ineligible, after signing a consent. Ineligibility reasons included: not being prescribed inclusion criteria medication, not receiving approval from primary care physician, non-veteran status, and unable to consent to participation. 2 patients disenrolled prior to group assignment.</pre_assignment_details>

        <description>Self-Efficacy and Eating Habits Survey (Sallis et al., 1988): Reducing Calories Factor.
The Reducing Calories factor includes survey items 6-10, which are each scored on a scale from 1-5. The factor score is an average of the scores on those items. Higher scores indicate more confidence in making the change in reducing calories. Range in the factor scores can be from 1 (min) to 5 (max).</description>

          <description>Impact of Weight on Quality of Life (IWQOL; Kolotkin et al 2008): Sexual Life subscale.
The Sexual Life subscale includes survey items 19-22, which are each scored on a scale from 1-5. The subscale score is an average of the scores on those items. Lower scores indicate greater impairment. Range in the subscale scores can be from 1 (min) to 5 (max).</description>
          <population>All randomized participants who received the intervention as randomized and completed this measure at 6 months were included in the analysis. Receiving the intervention as randomized was minimally defined as participating in one or more modules/sessions (WebMOVE or MOVE SMI) or receipt of the educational handout (Usual Care).</population>
