    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to compare the field of effects of the botulinum toxins
      (Dysport® and Botox®) using two equivalence-ratios and to gather supportive information, such
      as more detailed data on the effectiveness in reduction of wrinkles and duration of action on
      the upper part of the face of both products, trough scales and photographs evaluations.

      This was a monocentric, prospective, randomized and double-blind study. Twenty nine female
      patients, presenting with moderate to severe forehead wrinkles, with sweating ability who had
      never undergone previous BoNT-A injections were enrolled. Subjects have received botulinum
      toxin type-A injections in two forehead sites, Botox 2U and Dysport 5U, both reconstituted in
      the same volume of 0.02 mL per point. Baseline, twenty-eight and 112 days later, clinical and
      photographic assessments, Minor´s test, and electromyographic (EMG) evaluations were
      performed.

    <description>The measurement of the ECMAP(Evoked Compound Muscle Action Potentials) used surface electrodes on the forehead and electrical stimulation of the facial nerve, according to standard neurophysiological procedures.

      <recruitment_details>A total of 29 subjects was recruited at Brazilian Center For Studies in Dermatology, in Porto Alegre, Brazil. The anticipated drop out rate is 10%. Participants were their own control, because on one side of frontal region they have received 5U of botulinum toxin - Dysport and on other side 4U of botulinum toxin - Botox;</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>13 volunteers were excluded; Screen failure: Iodine allergy = 2; Minor´s Test failure = 6 Mild wrinkles = 3 Inclusion criteria failure = 2
Minor’s test allows the visualization of the area covered by the effects of botulinum toxin on sweat glands also known as action halos.</pre_assignment_details>
