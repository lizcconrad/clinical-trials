    <description>This is a dose escalation study. Patients will start with temsirolimus iv once weekly. After 2 weeks, PLD therapy is added. From then on, PLD is repeated every 4 weeks. One cycle is 28 days. The DLT period is also defined within the first 28 days of combination therapy (thus the first 6 weeks of study participation). The first dose level (DL) is DL 1. Depending on toxicity, intermediate dose levels can be added. If no MTD is found in the sixth cohort, this dose level will be considered as the recommended dose (RD), being the optimal dose for both drugs in this combination. At the MTD dose level, the dose level will be expanded to a total of 12 patients.</description>
