      The aim of this study was to analyze the effectiveness of the Epworth's sleepiness scale as a
      recourse aid in the diagnosis of the syndrome of obstructive sleep apnea. 475 patients
      attended this study, that sought the CESF to probable diagnosis of some sleep disorder. The
      data were collected from records, wich are of questionnaires, including the ESE, prepared by
      the CESF professionals and responded, previously, by the own patients. The study compared the
      result obtained in the scale of Epworth with the data of polysomnography. The analysis of
      data was performed using the SPSS, based on descriptive and inferential statistics, being
      used the average considering the standard deviation, and, to the crossing of variables, was
      used the chi-square test of Pearson, considering as significant statistically values of
      p&lt;0.05. The results showed that gender, age and BMI are predisposing factors to SOSA.
