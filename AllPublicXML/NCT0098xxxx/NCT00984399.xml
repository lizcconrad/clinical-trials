  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to see if Vagifem® 10mcg is safe for women who have had breast
      cancer. Vagifem is an estrogen product. It is a tiny tablet that is inserted into the vagina.
      It relieves vaginal dryness. Women who have had breast cancer are usually told not to take
      estrogen. This is because estrogen use can lead to a breast cancer recurrence or a new
      primary breast cancer. It is unclear if the estrogen in Vagifem is only absorbed in the
      vagina. It may be absorbed into the blood stream for a short time and may cause a brief rise
      in your estrogen level. However, there is no clear evidence that this would cause any bad
      effects in patients with breast cancer. How much, if any, of these topical estrogens are
      absorbed through the vagina is not known. We also do not know what the impact is of low dose
      estrogen absorption on breast cancer outcomes. Also, the absorption should decrease as the
      mucus membranes are restored after estrogen exposure.

    <description>This is a prospective longitudinal pilot study, and the targeted patient population is postmenopausal women with breast cancer being treated with adjuvant aromatase inhibitors who are initiated on vaginal 17β-estradiol to relieve symptoms of atrophic vaginitis.</description>

    <intervention_name>Vagifem® (vaginal 17β-estradiol) questionnaire &amp; menopause symptom checklist</intervention_name>
    <description>The goal is to have 30 patients on letrozole and 30 on anastrozole who are initiated on vaginal estrogen for symptoms of urogenital atrophy. All subjects will receive 10mcg vaginal 17-β estradiol tablets. Each subject will serve as her own control. We will monitor serum estradiol and follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) levels closely from 0-24 weeks. We will measure serum estradiol and FSH levels at baseline, and subsequently at weeks 2, 7, 12, 18 and 24 after commencing therapy with 10mcg vaginal 17-β estradiol.</description>
    <arm_group_label>vaginal 17β-estradiol, questionnaire , symptom checklist</arm_group_label>
    <other_name>The bloodwork will take less than one hour to perform and will be drawn +/- 72hrs from the date the</other_name>

    <other_name>Patients will be encouraged to come for their research bloodwork 12-24 hours after the insertion of the vaginal 25μg 17- β estradiol tablets.</other_name>
