  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is an open-label, multi-institutional, randomized phase II study, which is
      designed to investigate the efficacy of Extended-field irradiation (EFI) on reducing
      recurrences at the para-aortic lymph node (PAN), and also on improving disease-free survival
      of locally advanced uterine cervical cancer. Radiotherapy is given as a conformal technique
      based on the individually taken CT scan and cisplatin is given concomitantly with
      radiotherapy in both EFI arm and pelvis only treatment arm. According to our past study
      result, patients with more hypoxic tumors are more likely to develop distant metastasis
      including the recurrences at PAN (1-3). This study started with examination of CA9 (hypoxia
      marker) expression in the primary cervical tumor before randomization because it was expected
      that there would be a differential benefit of EFI in patients with CA9-positive vs
      CA9-negative tumors. However, the study design was modified because there was too much delay
      in the patient with CA9-negative tumors. The patients are now registered and then immediately
      randomized to experimental (EFI) and control arm (pelvis only treated) with examination of
      CA9 expression at later time.

      Patients with primary, untreated, histologically confirmed carcinoma of the uterine cervix
      are included in this study. Absence of metastatic para-aortic lymphadenopathy is the
      prerequisite of the enrollment, and this is confirmed by imaging studies such as MRI covering
      the abdomen and pelvis, and PET/CT scan. The sample size is based on the previous studies
      (1-3). Considering that the disease-free survival of the experimental arm (patients who are
      treated with prophylactic para-aortic LN irradiation) and those who are not treated is 82% vs
      72% (preliminary analysis), with the alpha error of 5% and statistical power of 90%
      (one-sided), a total of 140 patients in each treatment arm is needed. With 10% of follow-up
      loss taken into account, the total number of patients will be 312. Above figures were
      calculated on the basis of 80% statistical power and 5% type I error rate. PAN is treated
      prophylactically in the experimental arm with 45Gy/25F/5week fractionation schedule. Pelvis
      is treated according to the individual institute's practice guideline. Boost treatment for
      any enlarged pelvic lymph node or residual cervical/ parametrial disease with conformal
      radiation technique are allowed. Intracavitary radiation is given via low-dose-rate or
      high-dose-rate brachytherapy technique. Weekly cisplatin is given to all patients, however,
      when the patient's physical condition does not allow cisplatin administration, it can be
      omitted. This should be taken into account in the final analysis. The stage and the presence
      of pelvic lymphadenopathy are two stratification factors.
