      Evaluate how NUCYNTA (tapentadol) immediate release (IR) compares with oxycodone IR in the
      treatment of acute low back pain.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, outpatient, multicenter, double-blind study (blinded to patient and to
      study doctor) comparing NUCYNTA to oxycodone IR in the treatment of patients with acute (new
      onset) low back pain who also have associated leg pain that radiates (travels down) below the
      knee. Patients will be screened for study eligibility at Visit 1. The study will be explained
      and informed consent will be obtained. Potential patients must satisfy all eligibility
      criteria to be enrolled in the study. Eligible candidates will proceed to the Double-Blind
      Treatment Phase. At the time of study entry, all prohibited medications will be discontinued
      and will be disallowed throughout the study. All patients will call into an interactive voice
      response system (IVRS) to complete a pain assessments twice daily throughout the study.
      Patients who discontinue early for any reason will be instructed to contact the study site to
      complete final assessments, prior to taking supplemental pain medication if applicable, and
      to schedule a final study visit. All patients will return to the study site on Day 5 (Visit
      2) where they will be evaluated by study personnel and, as appropriate, continue with study
      treatment for an additional 5 days. Patients will return to the study site for the final
      visit on Day 10/End of Study (Visit 3) when they will have all final study assessments. The
      treatment duration will be up to 10 days. The sponsor will collect adverse events starting
      with the signing of the informed consent form. Adverse events will be reported by the subject
      for the duration of the study. Any clinically significant abnormalities persisting at the end
      of the study will be followed by the investigator until resolution or until a clinically
      stable endpoint is reached. Blood samples for serum chemistry and hematology and a urine
      sample for urinalysis will be collected. The investigator will review the laboratory report,
      document this review, and record any clinically relevant changes occurring during the study.
      The following tests will be performed by the central laboratory: Urine Pregnancy Testing for
      women of childbearing potential only, Urine Drug Screen, Vital Signs (pulse rate and blood
      pressure), Physical Examination, Neurological Examination, and Vomiting Assessment. The study
      will be conducted at approximately 80 sites in the United States (US). Patients will be
      randomized to one of the two following treatment groups: NUCYNTA 50, 75 or 100 mg every 4 to
      6 hours up to 10 days as needed for pain. Oxycodone IR 5, 10 or 15 mg every 4 to 6 hours as
      needed for pain. Patients will begin treatment on Day 1 with one &quot;lower dose&quot; capsule of
      study drug (NUCYNTA 50 mg or oxycodone IR 5 mg). Subsequent dose adjustments will be made by
      study patients, as needed, to achieve a dose that provides a meaningful improvement in their
      pain intensity

    <description>Pain intensity is an 11-point numerical rating scale (NRS). 0=no pain, 10=Pain as bad as you can imagine.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  At Visit 1 (study entry) patients must have a medical history and physical and
             neurological examinations that support a clinical diagnosis of acute low back pain
             that is felt down to the lower leg below the knee with the onset no longer than 30
             days before Visit 1

          -  At Visit 1 patients must report qualifying pain intensity scores

          -  Patients must be appropriate candidates for treatment with oral opioid pain medication
             in the investigator's clinical judgment

          -  Patients must be able to appropriately verbalize pain characteristics and to complete
             all protocol required measurements/assessments without assistance

          -  Patients must be medically stable on the basis of physical examination, medical
             history, vital signs, and clinical laboratory tests performed at screening

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  History of back (cervical, thoracic or lumbosacral) pain =50% of the time in the 1
             year prior to the first visit

          -  History of any low back pain episode, with the exception of the current acute low back
             pain episode, within 3 months prior to the first visit that was greater than mild in
             pain intensity, or was associated with disability (e.g., loss of time from work,
             family, or activities of daily living), or necessitated the use of an opioid
             (narcotic) analgesic including tramadol

          -  Medical history or physical examination results that suggest the acute low back pain
             or any of the neurological symptoms or signs are caused by a serious medical condition
             (e.g., fever, chills, unexplained weight loss, bowel or urinary bladder dysfunction or
             incontinence, bilateral leg weakness, progressive weakness, paralysis)

          -  There is a high probability for surgical intervention for the back pain during the
             projected time on the study or that there will be an increase in the severity of the
             leg pain or deficits

          -  Had either a surgical procedure involving the spine or intervertebral discs in the
             lower back region within 1 year prior to Visit 1 or had &gt;1 surgical procedure(s)
             involving the spine or intervertebral discs in the lower back region

          -  has any painful condition that could interfere with the study assessments or with the

        <description>Pain intensity is an 11-point numerical rating scale (NRS). 0=no pain, 10=Pain as bad as you can imagine. The pain intensity difference (PID) was to be calculated as baseline pain minus current pain at each assessment time point.

The common standard deviation for the SPID120 data was estimated to be 230. Seventy nine subjects in each arm would have 90% power to demonstrate the non-inferiority of NUCYNTA to oxycodone IR with a 1-sided significance level of 0.025. This would have required enrollment of total 158 mITT subjects for each stratum. The original sample size (292 mITT subjects) was derived for SPID72.</non_inferiority_desc>

        <description>Short-Form McGill Pain Questionnaire – 2 (SF-MPQ-2) is a 22-question instrument. Each item lists different qualities of pain or related symptoms and is scored using an 11-point NRS ranging from (pain or symptom is not present) to 10 (worst possible pain). Subscale scores are calculated as the mean of the items in that subscale ranged from 0 to 10. Continuous pain subscale descriptors include: throbbing pain, cramping pain, gnawing pain, aching pain, heavy pain, and tender.</description>

          <title>SF-MPQ-2 – Change From Baseline Values: Subscale and Total Scores - Neuropathic Pain Day 10/Last Visit</title>
          <description>Short-Form McGill Pain Questionnaire – 2 (SF-MPQ-2) is a 22-question instrument. Each item lists different qualities of pain or related symptoms and is scored using an 11-point NRS ranging from (pain or symptom is not present) to 10 (worst possible pain). Subscale scores are calculated as the mean of the items in that subscale ranged from 0 to 10. Predominantly neuropathic pain subscale descriptors include: hot-burning pain, cold-freezing pain, pain caused by light touch, itching, tingling or “pins and needles” and numbness.</description>
