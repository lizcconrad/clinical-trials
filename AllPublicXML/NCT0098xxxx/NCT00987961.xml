    <textblock>
      This study tests whether starting Suboxone (buprenorphine) during a medical hospitalization,
      and then providing an appointment (a &quot;link&quot;) for after discharge to maintenance buprenorphine
      in an outpatient setting will reduce HIV risk behavior in individuals who inject opioids.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this randomized controlled trial, medically hospitalized opioid dependent patients will be
      assigned to a &quot;treatment as usual&quot; group, where they will receive a detox regiment of
      Suboxone during their hospital stay, or a &quot;linkage&quot; group, where they receive a maintenance
      course of Suboxone during their hospital stay, and appointment post-discharge with an
      outpatient Suboxone clinic/provider and a Suboxone prescription to use between discharge and
      this appointment. Study interviews are completed at baseline, and 1, 3- and 6-months
      post-baseline. Primary outcomes are opioid use and HIV risk behavior.
