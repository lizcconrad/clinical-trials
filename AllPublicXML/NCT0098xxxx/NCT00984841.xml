      The purpose of this study is to determine if tailored letters sent to diabetic patients will
      improve care of diabetes.

    <textblock>
      Diabetes care in the US is less than optimal. Some authors have found that targeted patient
      letters are also an effective tool to improve outcomes when they are part of a comprehensive
      disease management plan. Local patient satisfaction surveys had revealed that many patients
      had sub‐optimal understanding of diabetes measures and of the importance of controlling these
      measures to reduce diabetic complications. We wondered if tailored patient letters and
      enclosed lab orders when due might increase patient awareness of diabetes measures and
      increase patient engagement.We hypothesized that the addition of targeted patient letters
      with enclosed lab orders to an ongoing performance improvement program would further improve
      diabetes care.

      We conducted a randomized controlled study of tailored patient letters and diabetes lab
      orders at our two resident‐based clinics.
