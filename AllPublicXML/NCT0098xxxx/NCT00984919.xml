      RATIONALE: Studying samples of blood and urine from patients with cancer in the laboratory
      may help doctors identify biomarkers related to cancer.

      PURPOSE: This research study is looking at a biomarker, 11-dh-TXB2, in blood and urine
      samples from patients with prostate cancer and healthy volunteers.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  To identify a potential novel marker of prostate cancer in the blood and urine,
           11-dh-TXB2, to be used as a screening tool for prostate cancer as well as in detection
           of early relapse in patients previously treated for early-stage prostate cancer.

      OUTLINE: Blood and urine samples are collected and analyzed for plasma and urinary 11-dh-TXB2
      levels by HPLC and tandem-mass spectrometry.

        DISEASE CHARACTERISTICS:

          -  Meets one of the following criteria:

               -  Histopathologically confirmed prostate cancer meeting 1 of the following

                    -  Received prior local therapy (prostatectomy, definitive radiotherapy,
                       brachytherapy, or cryotherapy) with no evidence of disease activity (defined
                       as serum PSA &lt; 0.4 ng/mL post therapy) and by imaging studies

                    -  Experienced biochemical failure (defined as rise in serum PSA â‰¥ 0.4 ng/mL
