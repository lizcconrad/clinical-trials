    <textblock>
      At least 60% of patients with constipation and dyssynergic defecation (anismus) and between
      30-50% of patients with fecal incontinence exhibit impaired rectal sensation. The problem may
      be improved by biofeedback therapy. Traditionally, biofeedback therapy was performed by using
      a syringe-assisted technique. Although some respond to this method, many, particularly those
      with severe rectal hyposensitivity have proved to be refractory. Also, repeated inflation and
      deflation of a large volume of air, using a hand-held syringe is cumbersome and time
      consuming. Recently, in pilot observations, the investigators have seen that a
      barostat-assisted technique of biofeedback therapy was simpler and easier to perform and
      could possibly be more effective. The investigators' aims are:

        1. To perform a randomized controlled study that compares the syringe-assisted sensory
           conditioning (biofeedback therapy) technique with the barostat assisted sensory
           conditioning for improving the rectal sensation in patients with rectal hyposensitivity
           and bowel dysfunction.

        2. To investigate the impact of sensory conditioning on psychosocial issues and quality of
           life.

        3. To compare the cost-effectiveness of each therapeutic modality The specific hypotheses
           that will be tested are;

      When compared to those who receive syringe-assisted training, patients receiving barostat
      training will demonstrate:

        1. Lower sensory thresholds for rectal perception (first sensation, desire to defecate and
           urgency)

        2. Greater satisfaction with bowel function (VAS Score), stool frequency,consistency &amp;
           straining.

        3. Better learning ability and greater ease of administering this training.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients categorized as having dyssynergic defecation or slow transit constipation or
             normal transit constipation will be eligible.

          -  All patients must demonstrate rectal hyposensitivity during a manometry with values
             that are outside 2 S.D. of normal range and demonstrate any two of the following: a)
             Threshold for 1st sensation &gt; 40 cc. b) Threshold for desire to defecate &gt; 130 cc. c)
             Threshold for urgency to defecate &gt;180 cc.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients taking drugs that are constipating, (e.g.; calcium channel antagonists will
             either be excluded or drug discontinued).
