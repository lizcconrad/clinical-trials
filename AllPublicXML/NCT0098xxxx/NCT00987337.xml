    <textblock>
      The primary objective for this study is to determine if the addition of filibuvir to a
      standard regimen of peginterferon/ribavirin (pegIFN/RBV) significantly increases the
      proportion of subjects who achieve a sustained viral response (SVR) compared to
      peginterferon/ribavirin (pegIFN/RBV) therapy alone.

    <measure>Percentage of Participants With Sustained Viral Response (SVR) at Week 72</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 72</time_frame>
    <description>For participants who received filibuvir, had undetectable HCV RNA from Week 4 through 24 and discontinued therapy at Week 24, SVR was defined as undetectable plasma HCV RNA levels (&lt;15 IU/mL) at both Week 24 (End of Treatment [EOT]) and Week 72, regardless of the HCV RNA levels between Week 24 and 72. For participants who received filibuvir, had detectable HCV RNA at Week 4 or later and discontinued therapy at Week 48 or who received placebo, SVR was defined as undetectable plasma HCV RNA levels (&lt;15 IU/mL) at both Week 48 (EOT) and Week 72, regardless of the HCV RNA levels between Week 48 and 72.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline up to Week 72</time_frame>
    <description>An AE was any untoward medical occurrence attributed to study drug in a participant who received study drug. A serious AE (SAE) was an AE resulting in any of the following outcomes or deemed significant for any other reason: death; initial or prolonged inpatient hospitalization; life-threatening experience (immediate risk of dying); persistent or significant disability/incapacity; congenital anomaly. Adverse events were graded as mild (did not interfere with participant's usual function), moderate (interfered to some extent with participant's usual function) or severe (interfered significantly with participant's usual function). The most severe grade was used in case of multiple occurrences of the same event.</description>

        <description>An AE was any untoward medical occurrence attributed to study drug in a participant who received study drug. An SAE was an AE resulting in any of the following outcomes or deemed significant for any other reason: death; initial or prolonged inpatient hospitalization; life-threatening experience (immediate risk of dying); persistent or significant disability/incapacity; congenital anomaly. Treatment-emergent are events between first dose of study drug and up to Week 72 that were absent before treatment or that worsened relative to pretreatment state. All causality AEs included SAEs as well as non-serious AEs, without regard to relationship to the study drug, which occurred during the trial. Treatment-related were events considered related to study drug by the investigator. Number of participants with treatment related TEAEs and all causality TEAEs were summarized.</description>
