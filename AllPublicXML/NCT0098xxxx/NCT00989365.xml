  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators hypothesize that aerobic training can reduce anxiety, depression and airway
      inflammation and those benefits may be related to changes in autonomic system.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      One-hundred patients with moderate or severe persistent asthma, age ranging from 20 to 50
      years-old recruited after a medical consultation. Asthma diagnosis based on GINA1 and
      patients were under medical treatment for at least 6-months and considered clinically stable
      (no crises and changes in medication for at least 30 days). Patients diagnosed with
      cardiovascular, pulmonary or musculoskeletal diseases impairing exercise training were
      excluded.

      Experimental Design: Patients were studied between 2 medical consultation to avoid changes in
      medication during the study and patients were randomized (by drawing lots) into either
      Control or Training groups. CG was submitted to a 4-hour educational program and a breathing
      exercise program and TG was submitted to the same CG procedures plus an aerobic training
      program individually based on VO2max. Before and after the intervention, patients performed
      pulmonary function test and cardiopulmonary exercise testing and as well as fulfilled
      questionnaires to quantify asthma specific HRQL and anxiety and depression levels. Asthma
      daily symptoms were evaluated monthly.
