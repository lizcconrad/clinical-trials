  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Approximately 30,000 new patients are introduced into dialysis and about 20,000 of them die
      every year in Japan. At present, about 300,000 patients are on dialysis and more than 10,000
      patients are registered to the Japan Organ Transplant Network (JOTN) with the hope for a
      renal transplantation. If the renal function is restored by transplantation, the quality of
      life (QOL) improves and more than 90% are reportedly come back to their normal life
      activities and get relieved from the burden of dialysis. Furthermore, it can reduce the
      dialysis related medical cost by as much as 50%. However, only about 1,000 renal
      transplantation cases are annually carried out in Japan. Among them, 80-85% are living renal
      transplantations offered by family members or relatives, and the rest are from deceased
      donors.

      Due to the fact that the number of deceased donors are scarce and renal transplantations
      between non-relatives (third parties) are currently not allowed in Japan, the approximate
      waiting time to receive a renal transplantation is 16 years. For that reason, many patients
      travel abroad to receive a renal transplantation.

      There are reports that total nephrectomies are performed as a treatment for small size (4 cm
      or less) renal tumors in many cases and that many of these nephrectomized kidneys can be
      successfully transplanted after surgical restoration with satisfactory results. However, due
      to the lack of necessary evidence it is currently not allowed in Japan.

      Therefore, the investigators planned the present clinical study to evaluate the curative
      efficacy (renal function, QOL) and safety (side effects, complications or occurence of renal
      cancer) of living renal transplantations between third parties (non-relatives) with restored
      donor kidneys after the surgical removal of a small size (4 cm or less) renal tumor, in order
      to acquire necessary clinical data for potential enrichment of the renal donor pool in Japan
      as well as to develop useful medical care for our patients who are on dialysis for many years
      due to the renal failure.
