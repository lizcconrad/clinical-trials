  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main objective of the study is to evaluate the effectiveness, tolerability, and safety of
      tapentadol hydrochloride prolonged release in subjects suffering from severe chronic low back
      pain (LBP) who are taking either WHO Step I or Step II analgesics or no regular analgesics.
      This is a clinical effectiveness trial designed to establish a link between anticipated
      clinical outcomes and the clinical practice by means of selected measures of clinical and
      subject-reported outcome.

      The trial will compare the effectiveness of previous analgesic treatment (either WHO Step I
      or Step II analgesics or no regular analgesics) with that of tapentadol hydrochloride
      prolonged release (PR) treatment during defined periods of evaluation.

    <time_frame>Baseline; End of Week 6 (6 Weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>For this pain assessment, the participant was to indicate the level of average pain experienced over the previous 3 days on an 11-point Numerical Rating Scale(NRS) where a score of 0 indicated &quot;no pain&quot; and a score of 10 indicated &quot;pain as bad as you can imagine&quot;. The value indicates the change from the baseline participant assessment on the 0 to 10 scale. A negative value indicates a reduction in pain intensity.</description>

      <pre_assignment_details>During the observation period (3 to 7 days in length) subjects recorded their analgesic medication intake and pain intensity. Prior to intake of tapentadol.</pre_assignment_details>

          <title>Tapentadol</title>
          <description>All participants started with 50 mg tapentadol hydrochloride PR (twice daily). The dose of tapentadol hydrochloride PR was adjusted to a level that provided adequate analgesia (upwards or downwards on a weekly basis as needed). After 5 weeks the doses of tapentadol hydrochloride was kept stable. Participants were permitted a maximum dose of 250 mg twice a day (500 mg total daily dose). Tapentadol hydrochloride IR 50 mg (no more than twice daily; at least 4 hours apart) was considered as medication for acute pain episodes, however participants were not permitted to dose tapentadol hydrochloride IR once 500 mg tapentadol hydrochloride PR dose was reached.</description>

            <description>All participants started with 50 mg tapentadol hydrochloride PR (twice daily). The dose of tapentadol hydrochloride PR was adjusted to a level that provided adequate analgesia (upwards or downwards on a weekly basis as needed). After 5 weeks the doses of tapentadol hydrochloride was kept stable. Participants were permitted a maximum dose of 250 mg twice a day (500 mg total daily dose). Tapentadol hydrochloride IR 50 mg (no more than twice daily; at least 4 hours apart) was considered as medication for acute pain episodes, however participants were not permitted to dose tapentadol hydrochloride IR once 500 mg tapentadol hydrochloride PR dose was reached.</description>

        <description>The Scores Form 36 (SF-36) includes several brief board questions on 8 aspects, (physical functioning, role physical, bodily pain, general health, vitality, social functioning, role-emotional and mental health) that a participant was asked to score over the last week. A higher score indicates an improvement in health. All domains are scored on a scale from 0 (negative health) to 100 (positive health), with 100 representing the best possible health state. A positive mean value indicates an improvement from baseline.</description>

        <title>painDETECT Assessment at Baseline</title>
        <description>The painDETECT questionnaire was used to determine the possibility of the presence of a neuropathic pain component. It is a participant completed questionnaire. A total score is calculated. Participants with a score between 0 and 12 are scored as being &quot;negative&quot; (no neuropathic pain component). Value between 19 and 38 as being &quot;positive&quot; (presence of neuropathic component)&quot;. Values from 13 to 18 are scored as being &quot;unclear&quot;.</description>

        <title>EuroQol-5 (EQ-5D) Health Status Index Outcome Over Time at End of Maintenance Period</title>
        <description>The participant scored the EuroQol-5. This is a five dimensional health state classification. Each dimension is assessed on a 3-point ordinal scale (1=no problems, 2=some problems, 3=extreme problems). The responses to the five EQ-5D dimensions were scored using a utility-weighted algorithm to derive an EQ-5D health status index score between 0 to 1, with 1.00 indicating &quot;full health&quot; and 0 representing dead. The positive values indicate that during the study the health status improved.</description>

        <description>EuroQoL-5D Health State Visual Analog Scale (VAS) is a participant rated questionnaire to assess health-related quality of life in terms of a single index value. The VAS component rates current health state on a scale from 0 (worst imaginable health state) to 100 (best imaginable health state); higher scores indicate a better health state. The values indicated represent the change from the baseline, a positive value indicates an improvement.</description>

        <description>Anxiety Scale - 7 items scored for each individual question from 0 = best and 3 = worst.
HADS is a self-assessment scale for the symptom severity of anxiety disorders and depression. It comprises of 14 items. Seven statements describe anxiety. Each answer is scored on a four-point scale (0-3). All seven answers are summed to a total score with a maximum score of 21 points.
A negative value indicates that there has been an improvement.</description>

The dose of tapentadol hydrochloride PR was adjusted to a level that provided adequate analgesia (upwards or downwards on a weekly basis as needed). After 5 weeks the doses of tapentadol hydrochloride was kept stable. Participants were permitted a maximum dose of 250 mg twice a day (500 mg total daily dose). Tapentadol hydrochloride IR 50 mg (no more than twice daily; at least 4 hours apart) was considered as medication for acute pain episodes, however participants were not permitted to dose tapentadol hydrochloride IR once 500 mg tapentadol hydrochloride PR dose was reached.</description>

        <description>Depression Scale - 7 items scored for each individual question from 0 = best and 3 = worst.
HADS is a self-assessment scale for the symptom severity of anxiety disorders and depression. It comprises of 14 items. Seven statements describe depression. Each answer is scored on a four-point scale (0-3). All seven answers are summed to a total score with a maximum score of 21 points.
A negative value indicates that there has been an improvement.</description>

        <description>For this pain assessment, the participant was to indicate the level of average pain experienced over the previous 3 days on an 11-point Numerical Rating Scale(NRS) where a score of 0 indicated &quot;no pain&quot; and a score of 10 indicated &quot;pain as bad as you can imagine&quot;.</description>

            <description>NRS-3 pain intensity values at end of Week 6 in painDetect specific subgroup of participants, with prior opioid treatment, that entered the titration and optimal dose period.
All participants started with 50 mg tapentadol hydrochloride PR (twice daily). The dose of tapentadol hydrochloride PR was adjusted to a level that provided adequate analgesia (upwards or downwards on a weekly basis as needed). After 5 weeks the doses of tapentadol hydrochloride was kept stable. Participants were permitted a maximum dose of 250 mg twice a day (500 mg total daily dose). Tapentadol hydrochloride IR 50 mg (no more than twice daily; at least 4 hours apart) was considered as medication for acute pain episodes, however participants were not permitted to dose tapentadol hydrochloride IR once 500 mg tapentadol hydrochloride PR dose was reached.</description>
