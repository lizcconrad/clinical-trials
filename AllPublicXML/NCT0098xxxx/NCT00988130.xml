      RATIONALE: High-intensity focused ultrasound focal ablation uses high-energy sound waves to
      kill tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying the side effects of high-intensity focused
      ultrasound focal ablation and to see how well it works in treating patients with progressive
      prostate cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  To evaluate the side effects of high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) ablation in men
           with non-metastatic progressive prostate cancer.

        -  To evaluate the quality of life of patients treated with this regimen.

      Secondary

        -  To determine the success of index lesion ablation with HIFU at 6 months after treatment
           by demonstrating the absence of cancer in the treated or ablated area by transrectal
           ultrasound biopsy.

        -  To evaluate the prostate-specific antigen kinetics after index lesion ablation in
           patients treated with this regimen.

        -  To evaluate the proportion of men who require androgen blockade at 12 months of
           follow-up.

      OUTLINE: Patients undergo focal ablation with high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU)
      ablation on day 1. Treatment may repeat at 6 months in patients with progressive disease.

      Blood samples and prostate biopsies are collected periodically for further analysis.

      Patients complete questionnaires (IPSS, IPSS-QoL, ICS, IIEF-5, and FACT-P) at baseline and
      periodically during study.

        DISEASE CHARACTERISTICS:

          -  Histologically confirmed prostate cancer by transrectal or transperineal template
             prostate biopsies

               -  Stage ≤ T3bN0M0

               -  Gleason grade ≤ 8

               -  Serum PSA ≤ 20 ng/mL

               -  Bone scan- or cross-sectional imaging-negative for metastatic or nodal (outside
                  prostate) disease

               -  No metastatic disease and/or nodal spread by CT scan or MRI

          -  Index lesion or other secondary lesions with a volume ≥ 0.5 cc by MRI

          -  No prostatic calcification and cysts (on transrectal ultrasound) that would interfere
             with effective delivery of therapy

        PATIENT CHARACTERISTICS:

          -  Able to tolerate a transrectal ultrasound

          -  Not allergic to latex

          -  Fit for major surgery as assessed by a consultant anaesthetist

          -  Able to have MRI scanning (i.e., none of the following conditions: severe
             claustrophobia, permanent cardiac pacemaker, metallic implant, etc.)

        PRIOR CONCURRENT THERAPY:

          -  No prior radiotherapy

          -  No androgen suppression and/or hormone treatment within the past 12 months

          -  No prior significant rectal surgery preventing insertion of transrectal high-intensity
             focused ultrasound (HIFU) probe (decided on the type of surgery in individual cases)

          -  No prior transurethral resection of the prostate (or equivalent procedures) within the
             past 2 years

          -  No prior HIFU, cryosurgery, thermal, or microwave therapy to the prostate
