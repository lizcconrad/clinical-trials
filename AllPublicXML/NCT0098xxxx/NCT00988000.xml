  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Consultations with patients by hospital consultants are organised today in a manner which is
      barely dissimilar from that offered 30 or 40 years ago. Whilst some attempts to improve this
      process, such as Choose and Book, shorter waiting times and patients' receiving a copy of the
      correspondence sent to their general practitioner (GP) have improved the situation, there has
      been little radical change and little thought given to the patient experience.

      The investigators wish to investigate whether patients' experience of attending respiratory
      outpatient clinics can be improved by a pre-clinic telephone call with a specialist thereby
      reducing the number of attendances at the hospital for appointments and investigations and
      improving overall patient satisfaction.

      This study will investigate whether taking a new patient's history over the telephone permits
      better selection and arrangement of investigations prior to or synchronous with the first
      face to face consultation, with the potential to reduce the number of visits the patient has
      to make to the hospital.

      Patients will be offered an initial telephone consultation by post and may opt-in or out of
      the study. Those having a telephone consultation would have this booked for a specific time
      and date and the patient would be sent an appropriate information leaflet regarding this.
      After the telephone consultation patients receive a summary of the consultation and details
      of any investigations and appointments booked by the research nurse. Patients who did not
      respond to the initial invitation letter within seven days or who declined to participate
      would be sent a routine appointment. All patients would asked to complete the MISS-21
      questionnaire.
