  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This trial was conducted to study the potential for hypersensitivity symptoms at the time of
      initial exposure to sugammadex and upon repeat exposure, since it was unknown whether the
      frequency or severity of hypersensitivity symptoms may worsen at repeat exposure over a
      prolonged period.

      In total 450 participants (all healthy subjects) were to be randomized to receive one of
      three study treatments: three repeated doses of either sugammadex 4 mg/kg, sugammadex 16
      mg/kg, or placebo. Participants were to receive one dose of study treatment on Day 8, Day 36,
      and Day 78 of the study in order to determine the safety of each treatment dose.

  <detailed_description>

      All subjects were to be admitted to the study center the day before each scheduled dose and
      were to leave the unit the morning of the day after each dose. In cases of suspected
      hypersensitivity symptoms, healthy subjects were to remain confined to the study center until
      all signs and symptoms regressed, the subject was stable, and the investigator considered it
      safe for the subject to leave the study center. Four sites participated in this trial.

    <measure>The Percentage of Participants With Adjudicated Hypersensitivity Signs/Symptoms, for Each Sugammadex Dose Group and Placebo.</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 8, Day 36, and Day 78 of the study</time_frame>
    <description>Hypersensitivity signs/symptoms were systematically collected for each subject by the investigator. Suspected cases of hypersensitivity signs/symptoms were sent to the independent Adjudication Committee (comprised of anesthesiologists &amp; allergists/immunologists) for blinded review and determination of adjudicated hypersensitivity &amp;/or anaphylaxis based on expert evaluation of all clinical data from the healthy subject.
The percentages of subjects who had adjudicated hypersensitivity at any dose (dose 1/Day 8, dose 2/Day 36, or dose 3/Day 78) were compared between the 3 treatment groups.</description>

    <measure>The Percentage of Participants With Adjudicated Anaphylaxis According to the Definition by Sampson et al., for Each Sugammadex Dose Group and Placebo.</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 8, Day 36, and Day 78 of the study</time_frame>
    <description>The Adjudication Committee evaluated each case to determine whether the subject's hypersensitivity sign/symptoms fulfilled the definition of anaphylaxis according to the criteria defined by the Symposium on the Definition and Management of Anaphylaxis as described by Sampson et al. (J Allergy Clin Immunol 2006; 117:391-7).
The percentages of subjects who had adjudicated anaphylaxis according to the Sampson Criteria at any dose (dose 1 [~Day 8], dose 2 [~Day 36], or dose 3 [Day ~78]) were compared between the 3 treatment groups.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The Percentage of Participants With Each of the 3 Levels of Diagnostic Certainty of Adjudicated Anaphylaxis According to the Definition by Rüggeberg et al., for Each Sugammadex Dose Group and Placebo.</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 8, Day 36, and Day 78 of the study</time_frame>
    <description>The Adjudication Committee evaluated each case to determine anaphylaxis according to the criteria put forth by the guidelines of the Brighton Collaboration Anaphylaxis Working Group as described by Rüggeberg et al. (Vaccine 2007; 25:5675-5684).
Level 1 represents the highest level of certainty of anaphylaxis and level 3 the lowest level of certainty.
The percentages of subjects who had adjudicated anaphylaxis according to the Rüggeberg Criteria at any dose (dose 1 [~Day 8], dose 2 [~Day 36], or dose 3 [Day ~78]) were compared between the 3 treatment groups.</description>

The percentages of subjects who had adjudicated hypersensitivity (dose 1/Day 8, dose 2/Day 36, or dose 3/Day 78) are presented for each of the 3 treatment arms for each dose.</description>
