  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a genetic disease (transmitted through the parents' genes) called Fanconi Anemia.
      Because of that genetic disease, the bone marrow has changed and now has failed, or has given
      rise to a preleukemia called myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) or leukemia (acute myelogenous
      leukemia or AML).

      Without treatment these complications of Fanconia anemia (FA) are fatal. The only treatment
      that can cure these complications is an allogeneic transplant of stem cells, meaning, giving
      the patient bone marrow cells from a healthy donor that can produce normal blood cells that
      will replace the bone marrow that is sick.

      What has been given for the treatment of FA in the past is to use a combination of low doses
      of radiation to the whole body (total body irradiation) and low doses of the chemotherapy
      drugs (cyclophosphamide and fludarabine) before the transplant. However, the use of radiation
      can, later on, increase the chances of getting a second cancer of the skin, head or the neck.
      These chances of a second cancer are higher than normal in patients with FA.

      The purpose of this study is to find out if the doctors can do the same thing with the same
      chemotherapy drugs used in the past. However physicians will use another chemotherapy drug
      called busulfan instead of the radiation. The goal of this study is to get rid of the short
      term and long term risks of the radiation. The first new part of this treatment will be to
      replace drugs for radiation with chemotherapy drugs.

    <description>This phase II trial is designed to investigate the safety and efficacy of a chemotherapy-based cytoreductive regimen plus a CD34+ selected T-cell depleted peripheral blood stem cell (PBSC) stem cell transplant for the treatment of patients with Fanconi anemia and severe hematologic disease.</description>

    <description>There are three parts in this transplant study. 1) There will be a pre-transplant - preparation - period to see if patient qualifies for the transplant study. This will be done as an outpatient and lasts 2-4 weeks. Once this is completed, there will be 2) the transplant period itself, during which the patient will be admitted and will be an inpatient. This period usually last for 4-6 weeks. Following that, there will be a 3) post transplant period, during which the patient will be watched carefully and monitored in clinic as an out patient. The post transplant period lasts from three months to one year.</description>
