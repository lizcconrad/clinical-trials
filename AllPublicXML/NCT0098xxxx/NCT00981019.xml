  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The probably most commonly used measure for expressing the pay-offs of early detection and
      treatment are survival rates. Yet, over time and groups this metric comes with several biases
      and thus, is not reliable for judging such benefits. Epidemiologists recommend using
      reduction of disease-specific mortality rates instead, which is unbiased. The purpose of the
      study is to investigate how primary care physicians understand and use different survival
      measures for determining the benefit of cancer screening tests.

    <description>The aim of the study was to learn how different medical cancer screening statistics would influence doctors' recommendation behavior and their effectiveness judgments of screening tests. For that reason the online survey study presented physicians with four different medical statistics (e.g., 5-year survival) within four successive scenarios and asked after each scenario whether they would recommend the screening to a (hypothetical) patient given the data. Options to answer are: Definitely yes, Probably yes, Probably no, Definitely no, Can't decide.</description>

    <description>Physicians are faced with four different medical statistics about the effect of screening (e.g., 5-year survival) within four successive scenarios and after each scenario asked whether they assume the screening to be beneficial given the statistical information. Options to answer are: yes, no, can't decide. If yes, then participants are further asked to describe this benefit by the following categories: Very large, large, moderate, small, very small.</description>

          <description>The study—conducted as an online survey study—investigated the influence that different medical statistics such as 5-year survival rates would have on physicians' recommendation behavior for screening and on their judgment of screening's effectiveness. The survey introduced hypothetical scenarios in which a hypothetical patient was requesting a physician's advice on whether to have a screening test. To make that decision the participants (=physicians) were presented with different statistics and then asked if they would recommend the screening to the hypothetical patient and how effective they think the screening would be in reducing cancer mortality. The online survey did not ask any sensitive data.</description>

            <description>The survey introduced four different cancer statistics in scenarios about 2 different screening tests. To mask the fact that all statistics stemmed from prostate cancer screening, screening in the scenarios were labeled “X” and “Z”. The survey then introduced test Z, whose effectiveness was described in terms of a reduction of cancer mortality. After responding to the series of outcome questions about test Z, physicians received additional information on the cancer incidence, again followed by the outcome questions. In the next scenario, the survey introduced test X, whose effectiveness was described in terms of an increase in 5-year survival and, in the next step, with additional information on early detection rates. After each step, doctors had to respond to the same outcome questions as they had for test Z. Please not, information on test X and test Z were randomly presented to control for order effects.</description>

To analyze repeated measures outcomes (e.g., effect of the four different statistic scenarios on doctors' recommendation of screening, their judgment of screening's effectiveness, etc.), we used the McNemar chi-square test and the Wilcoxon signed-rank test.
To test for order effects (scenarios were randomly presented)Pearson’s chi-square test and the Mann–Whitney U test were used.</groups_desc>

        <title>Number of Physicians (= Participants) Assuming a Benefit of Screening</title>
        <description>Physicians are faced with four different medical statistics about the effect of screening (e.g., 5-year survival) within four successive scenarios and after each scenario asked whether they assume the screening to be beneficial given the statistical information. Options to answer are: yes, no, can't decide. If yes, then participants are further asked to describe this benefit by the following categories: Very large, large, moderate, small, very small.</description>

          <title>Mortality*Incidence*5-year Survival*Early Detection Rate</title>
          <description>The study—conducted as an online survey study—investigated the influence that different medical statistics such as 5-year survival rates would have on physicians' recommendation behavior for screening and on their judgment of screening's effectiveness. The survey introduced hypothetical scenarios in which a hypothetical patient was requesting a physician's advice on whether to have a screening test. To make that decision the participants (=physicians) were presented with different statistics and then asked if they would recommend the screening to the hypothetical patient and how effective they think the screening would be in reducing cancer mortality. The online survey did not ask any sensitive data.</description>
