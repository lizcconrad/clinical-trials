  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators are testing subtenon carboplatin in combination with vincristine and
      topotecan given by vein in the hopes of finding a drug combination that may be effective
      against retinoblastoma that has come back (recurrent) or is resistant to other treatment
      (refractory).

      The goals of this study are:

        -  To decide if the drug combination is a useful treatment for recurrent or refractory
           retinoblastoma

        -  To test the safety of the drug combination and to see what kind of effects (good and
           bad) can be expected from the drug combination

        -  To measure visual changes before and after the study therapy

        -  To use a special MRI scan to measure brain function involved in vision processing, both
           before and after the study therapy

      In this study, the investigators are also testing a new experimental way of giving
      carboplatin &quot;subtenon carboplatin&quot;. The carboplatin will be given directly in the eye through
      a needle placed under the covering of the eye. This is to try to get more carboplatin to the
      retinoblastoma inside the eye.
