      Background and Aim:

      Basal cell carcinoma (BCC) is the most common skin cancer .Photodynamic therapy _as a novel ,
      non-invasive therapeutic approach _may be considered a valuable strategy. This study was
      designed with the aim of the evaluation of efficacy of PDT in treatment of BCC and recurrence
      rate after 6 months .

      Materials and Methods:

      This was a clinical trial which was done on 28 BCCs. Patients were treated with ALA-PDT
      monthly for 1-6 sessions and evaluated for clinical response,cosmetic results,recurrence rate
      and probable side effects.
