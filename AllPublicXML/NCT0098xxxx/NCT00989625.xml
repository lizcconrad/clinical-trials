  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a pharmacokinetic (PK) study designed to investigate a combination product containing
      sumatriptan succinate and naproxen sodium administered at 3 single doses (10mg
      sumatriptan/60mg naproxen sodium, 30mg sumatriptan/180mg naproxen sodium, 85mg
      sumatriptan/500mg naproxen sodium) in adolescent migraine patients. The same doses will be
      also administered to a group of healthy volunteer (HV) adult subjects and the PK parameters
      will be compared between these two groups and between doses.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This will be an open label, single dose, randomised, parallel group study. Approximately 27
      adolescent patients with migraine and 27 healthy volunteer (HV) adult subjects will be
      enrolled so that a total of 24 evaluable subjects complete in each group. The treatment
      procedures for these two groups are almost identical but some flexibility has been allowed
      for the timing of some of the PK samples in adolescents. All subjects will be required to
      attend a screening visit within 28 days prior to the first dose of study medication. Each
      subject will participate in one dosing session with one of the 3 doses of sumatriptan/
      naproxen sodium. Sequential PK samples will be collected through 48 hours after dosing and
      the PK parameters will be compared between these two groups and between doses.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Adolescent Migraine Subjects

          -  Subject has history of migraine with or without aura.

          -  Subject has history suggestive of typical migraine attacks with duration of about 2 or
             more hours.

          -  Subject has at least 2, but not more than 8, migraine attacks per month in each of the
             2 months prior to the screening visit.

          -  Subject has at least a 6-month history of moderate to severe migraine attacks,
             sufficient to establish a definitive diagnosis of migraine.

          -  Subject is able to distinguish migraine from other headaches (e.g., tension-type
             headaches).

        All subjects

          -  Subject must fall between following age ranges:

               -  Adolescent subjects between 12 and 17 years old inclusive at the screening visit
                  and 18 years at dosing.

               -  Adult healthy subjects between 18 to 55 years old inclusive at the screening
                  visit.

          -  Subject BMI and weight must fall between the following:

               -  Adolescent subject body weight less than 33.4 kg and a healthy weight using
                  age-based BMI range 5th-85th percentile (see Appendix 4).

               -  Adult healthy subject BMI within the range 18-32 kg/m2 inclusive

          -  Healthy as determined by a responsible physician, based on a medical evaluation
             including medical history, physical examination, laboratory tests and ECG. A subject
             with a clinical abnormality or laboratory parameters outside the reference range for
             the population being studied may be included only if the Investigator and the GSK
             Medical Monitor agree that the finding is unlikely to introduce additional risk
             factors and will not interfere with the study procedures.

          -  A female subject is eligible to participate if she is of:

               -  Non-childbearing potential defined as pre-menopausal females with a documented
                  tubal ligation or hysterectomy; or postmenopausal defined as 12 months of
                  spontaneous amenorrhea [in questionable cases a blood sample with simultaneous
                  follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) &gt; 40 MlU/ml and estradiol &lt; 40 pg/ml (&lt;140
                  pmol/L) is confirmatory]. For younger adolescent migraine subjects,
                  non-childbearing potential also defined as premenarchal is a young female who has
                  not yet entered puberty as evidenced by lack of breast development of palpable
                  glandular breast tissue. Females on hormone replacement therapy and whose
                  menopausal status is in doubt will be required to use one of the contraception
                  methods in Section 8.1 if they wish to continue their HRT during the study.
                  Otherwise, they must discontinue HRT to allow confirmation of post-menopausal
                  status prior to study enrollment. For most forms of HRT, at least 2-4 weeks will
                  elapse between the cessation of therapy and the blood draw; this interval depends
                  on the type and dosage of HRT. Following confirmation of their post-menopausal
                  status, they can resume use of HRT during the study without use of a
                  contraceptive method.]

               -  Child-bearing potential and agrees to use one of the contraception methods listed
                  in Section 8.1 for an appropriate period of time (as determined by the product
                  label or investigator) prior to the start of dosing to sufficiently minimize the
                  risk of pregnancy at that point. Female subjects who are sexually active must
                  agree to use contraception until 5 day after dosing.

          -  Subjects must be able to read and write English or Spanish and give written informed
             consent as follows:

               -  Adult: subject is willing and able to provide written informed consent

               -  Adolescent: subject is capable of giving written assent with an informed consent
                  from their parents or legal guardian, which includes compliance with the
                  requirements and restrictions listed in the consent form.

          -  Eligible subjects should meet the QT criteria as follows:

               -  Adolescent: QTcB or QTcF &lt;450 msec; and without Bundle Branch Block

               -  Adult: QTcB or QTcF&lt;450 msec; or QTc &lt;480 msec in subjects with Bundle Branch
                  Block.

             history of drug or other allergy that, in the opinion of the investigator or GSK
