      Primary Objective:

        -  To demonstrate that re-challenge with an oxaliplatin based regimen (modified FOLFOX-6)
           will provide a clinical disease control rate (DCR) of at least 20% at the end of the
           chemotherapy.

      Secondary Objective:

        -  To evaluate other measures of tumour's responses and safety.

    <description>Patients will receive modified FOLFOX-6 regimen:
oxaliplatin 85mg/m2, day 1 (given as a 2-hour infusion)
LV 400mg/m2, day 1 (given as a 2-hour infusion simultaneous to oxaliplatin)
5-FU given as a bolus IV 400mg/m2 dose on day 1 followed by 2400mg/m2 continuous infusion over 46 hours (day 1 and 2)
A cycle is defined as 2 weeks. Patients will receive cycles of modified FOLFOX-6 regimen every 2 weeks up to a maximum of 8 cycles. Use of bevacizumab is at the discretion of the treating physician.</description>
