  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This project is primarily a behavioral study. We employed a three-arm, patient-randomized
      practical effectiveness trial to evaluate the impact of two different interactive, multimedia
      self-management programs, relative to &quot;enhanced&quot; usual care. The two interventions will be
      (a) the revised program from our present study, based on our social-ecological theory and the
      5 As self-management model, plus enhanced support (ASM+ES) that includes practical, but
      extensive, ongoing support and b) largely Automated Self-Management (ASM). These programs
      will be compared to a realistic &quot;enhanced usual care&quot; (UC) condition that will provide health
      risk appraisal feedback, control for computer interactions, and provide standardized advice
      on behavior change, but not the hypothesized key intervention processes of goal-setting,
      barriers identification, problem-solving, or social-environmental support. Patients will be
      randomized to conditions within clinic and will participate for 1 year.

      The proposed project will test the effectiveness of a practical, automated-based intervention
      for primary care patients to facilitate dietary and physical activity practices, and
      medication-taking. Analyses will focus on primary outcomes of (a) dietary, physical activity,
      medication-taking outcomes, and (b) the UKPDS risk equation as well as secondary
      quality-of-life, patient-activation, and patient care outcomes (Specific Aim #2). Using the
      RE-AIM measures, we will analyze the reach, effectiveness, adoption, implementation, and
      maintenance of the intervention programs (Specific Aim #3), and also factors related to
      program implementation, linkage to primary care, and program success with emphasis on cost,
      cost-effectiveness, and mediators and moderators of outcomes such as social-environment
      support (Aim #4).

      Primary hypotheses:

        1. That the Automated Intervention received by Automated self-management (ASM) condition
           and ASM plus enhanced support conditions (ASM+ES) will be superior to usual care on the
           primary outcomes.

        2. That the ASM+ES condition will be superior to the ASM alone condition on primary
           outcomes at the 12-month follow-up.

          -  have been diagnosed with type 2 diabetes for at least 1 year

          -  are overweight (BMI â‰¥ 25), and

          -  have at least one additional UKPDS equation risk factor (i.e., high lipids,
             hypertension, HbA1c, or smoking)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Exclusion criteria:

          -  Suffering dementia or active psychosis,

          -  Being on end-stage dialysis,

          -  or predicted to live fewer than 2 years

          -  Being institutionalized.

          -  Pregnant women - women with gestational diabetes will not be enrolled, because there
             needs are quite different, but we won't specifically exclude women who are pregnant
             AND otherwise eligible, since we do acknowledge that it's possible that someone may be
             unaware that they are pregnant at the time of enrollment, or may become pregnant
             during the study, and that this will not affect their continued participation.
