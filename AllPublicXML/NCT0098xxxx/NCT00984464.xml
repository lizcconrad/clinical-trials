  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this Phase 2 study is to investigate whether intravenous administration of
      REOLYSIN therapeutic virus in combination with paclitaxel and carboplatin is effective and
      safe in the treatment of metastatic melanoma.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cutaneous melanoma is one of the most rapidly increasing cancers in the US and around the
      world with an increase in incidence of about 3-7% per year for fair-skinned Caucasian
      populations. An estimated 62,480 cases of invasive melanoma will be diagnosed in the US in
      2008 with an estimated 8,420 deaths. An additional 46,170 cases of melanoma in situ are
      predicted.

      Melanoma that has spread to distant sites (stage IV) is rarely curable.

      This Phase 2 study is designed to characterize the efficacy and safety of REOLYSIN given
      intravenously in combination with paclitaxel and carboplatin every 3 weeks in patients with
      metastatic melanoma.

      Response is a primary endpoint of this trial.

      Patients may continue to receive chemotherapy in combination with REOLYSIN for up to 8 cycles
      and may continue indefinitely on REOLYSIN monotherapy under this protocol, provided they have
      not experienced either progressive disease or unacceptable drug-related toxicity that does
      not respond to either supportive care or dose reduction.

          -  any surgery involving the melanoma (except biopsies) must have occurred at least 28
             days prior to study enrolment.

          -  be at least 18 years of age.

          -  have received NO chemotherapy, radiotherapy, immunotherapy or hormonal therapy within
             28 days prior to receiving study drug

          -  have ECOG Performance Score of ≤ 2.

          -  have a life expectancy of at least 3 months.

          -  absolute neutrophil ≥ 1.5 x 10^9; Platelets ≥ 100 x10^9; Hemoglobin ≥ 9.0 g/dL; Serum
             creatinine ≤ 1.5 x upper limit of normal (ULN); Bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x ULN; AST/ALT ≤ 2.5 x

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  receive concurrent therapy with any other investigational anticancer agent while on
             study.

          -  be good candidate for surgery with curative intent for metastatic disease.

          -  have a history of or current evidence of brain metastasis(es).

             the judgment of the Principal Investigator, would make the patient inappropriate for
             this study.
