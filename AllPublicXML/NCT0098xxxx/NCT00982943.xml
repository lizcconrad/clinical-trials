  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      During the past decade, the dramatic change in patterns of both psychiatric diagnoses and
      prescription of psychotropic agents has been noted since the introduction of newer
      antidepressant drugs. In the meantime, suicide has been recognized as a major public health
      problem all over the world. Research efforts have hence been spent in exploring the
      interrelationships between suicide rates and prescription of antidepressant drugs (as a proxy
      for the treatment of depression). However, most available studies came from developed
      countries despite that the majority of countries with rising suicide rates during the past
      decade were developing countries. Both suicide rates and prescription of antidepressant
      agents have been rising in Taiwan during the past decade; with a reliable mortality registrar
      and nationwide health insurance covering 99% of its population, Taiwan is distinctive in
      realizing a large-scale analysis on these interrelationships between suicide and prescription
      of antidepressant drugs. However, there has been no study in Taiwan exploring these potential
      associations up to now.

      This study aims at examining the interrelationships between suicide rates and prescription of
      antidepressant agents based on the health insurance data from persons who had diagnoses of
      ICD: 290-319 or were prescribed with antidepressant agents during the period from 1998 to
      2006. The investigators plan to first perform correlation analyses between the trends of
      suicide rates and prescription of antidepressants during the study period after taking into
      accounts potential confounding factors; analyses by age, gender groups and by administrative
      regions will also be performed. Besides, the investigators plan to analyze the change in the
      prescription pattern of psychotropic agents in Taiwan during the study period, with the
      particular focus on that of newer antidepressant drugs. The prescription of psychotropic
      agents in both psychiatric and non-psychiatric diagnoses will be explored.
