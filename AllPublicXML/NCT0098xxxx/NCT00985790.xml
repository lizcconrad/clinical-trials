        <description>A seroconverted subject was defined as a vaccinated subject who had either a pre-vaccination titer &lt;1:10 and a post-vaccination titer ≥1:40 or a pre-vaccination titer ≥1:10 and at least a four-fold increase in post-vaccination titer. The 4 assessed influenza strains were the FLU A/Brisbane/59/07 (H1N1), Flu A/Uruguay/716/07 (H3N2), Flu B/Brisbane/60/08 Victoria (VICT) and Flu B/Brisbane/3/07 Yamagata (YAMA).
