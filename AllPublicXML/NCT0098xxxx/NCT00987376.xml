  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Prostate cancer imaging using traditional anatomic modalities including CT, MR, and
      ultrasound is limited. Improvement in current imaging modalities or development of new ones
      should be a priority in prostate cancer research. Optimal treatment varies considerably for
      patients with different staging characterizations and new imaging methods that more
      accurately stage patients could lead to more appropriate treatment. The objective of this
      study is to obtain preliminary, comparative data on new, promising imaging methods for
      prostate cancer. PET/CT imaging using 11C-choline,11C-acetate, and Y86 or
      18F-Adenosylcobalamin and MRI spectroscopy (MRS) of prostate cancer will be compared. Direct
      comparison of these imaging methods has never been done and Mayo Clinic and Johns Hopkins are
      uniquely able to conduct such a trial as an inter-SPORE collaboration.
