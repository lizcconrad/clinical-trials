      The purpose of this study in heathy people is to investigate the safety, toleration and time
      course of PF-03654764 in the blood, following multiple doses given once or twice daily by
      mouth for 10 days.

    <description>5mg orally once daily for 10 days. After satisfactory review of the available safety, toleration and PK data, progression to the next dose will occur if the last dose was well tolerated. If the previous dose was not well tolerated, after review of the safety data, and discussion between the Pfizer Study Team and the Investigator, the same dose may be given again, a lower dose within the tolerated dose range may be given, or the study may be stopped. The dose increments will be based on emerging safety and toleration data, as well as plasma exposure estimates and forward predictions of PK. Nominal administered doses will not exceed 24 mg per day.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Healthy subjects. (Healthy is defined as no clinically relevant abnormalities
             identified by a detailed medical history, full physical examination, including blood
             pressure and pulse rate measurement, 12-lead ECG and clinical laboratory tests).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Evidence or history of clinically significant hematological, renal, endocrine,
             pulmonary, gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, hepatic, psychiatric, neurologic, or
             allergic disease (including drug allergies, but excluding untreated, asymptomatic,
             seasonal allergies at time of dosing).

          -  A positive urine drug screen.

          -  Treatment with an investigational drug within 30 days (or as determined by the local
             requirement, whichever is longer) or 5 half-lives preceding the first dose of study
             medication.
