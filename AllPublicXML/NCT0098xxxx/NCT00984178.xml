    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to compare the effectiveness of four different strategies for
      preventing the ventricular postinfarction remodelling: 1) Conventional treatment for
      reperfunded extensive acute myocardial infarction, 2) Autologous bone marrow stem-cells
      intracoronary transplantation 3) mobilization of bone marrow stem-cells induced by
      granulocyte colony-stimulating factors (G-CSF); and 4) combined treatment (stem-cells
      transplantation plus mobilization with G-CSF).

      This clinical study is a phase II randomized trial for patients with an acute extensive
      reperfunded myocardial infarction who undergo coronary artery revascularization with
      sirolimus coated stents. The aim of this study is to compare the effectiveness of four
      different strategies for preventing the ventricular postinfarction remodelling: 1)
      Conventional treatment for reperfunded extensive acute myocardial infarction, 2) Autologous
      bone marrow stem-cells intracoronary transplantation 3) mobilization of bone marrow
      stem-cells induced by granulocyte colony-stimulating factors (G-CSF); and 4) combined
      treatment (stem-cells transplantation plus mobilization with G-CSF). The investigational
      follow-up will be at 30 days, 4 and 9 months.Effectiveness of the therapies on neomyogenesis
      will be measured by Magnetic Resonance Imaging analysis of left ventricular size and global
      and regional function and the myocardial viability.The impact of the therapies on stent
      re-endothelialization and restenosis will be analysed by angiography and intracoronary
      ultrasounds at 30 days and 9 months. The impact of the different treatments on
      neoangiogenesis will be measured by infarct related artery intracoronary study of the
      evolution of coronary flow reserve. Also, it will be measured the haematopoietic precursors
      kinetic in the different treatment branches.
