  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Epidemiological studies have firmly established the health effects of high intakes of fruits
      and vegetables and in particular in regards to the prevention of cardiovascular diseases.
      Citrus fruits are the most widely consumed throughout the world, mainly as juice. Citrus
      fruits are rich in vitamin C but also in various plant micronutrients which are the most
      abundant polyphenols. Several in vitro studies and animal models suggest that the polyphenols
      of citrus are involved in the protective effects of citrus vis-à-vis the cardiovascular
      diseases. However, profits in health associated with taking these polyphenols are unknown and
      so far no clinical studies have been conducted to determine the contribution of polyphenols
      of citrus in this protection.

      The main objectives of this project are (1) to characterize the effects of single dose and
      made repeated consumption of orange juice on vascular protection and the immune response and
      (2) to assess the specific role of polyphenols present in citrus fruits in this protection.
      To do this the investigators will conduct a clinical study, randomized and crossover, among
      healthy men 50 to 65 years that are slightly overweight. These volunteers, who continue to
      follow their usual diet, should consume daily for 4 weeks (1) orange juice or (2) an
      isocaloric control beverage or (3) the same drink spiked with a dose of polyphenols similar
      to that given by orange juice.

    <description>The main objective of this study is to evaluate, in healthy volunteers with young children (50 and 65) and slightly overweight according to their usual diet, the effects of single dose (in postprandial period) and made repeated orange juice or orange flavanones purified on vascular function. The selection criteria for age and weight should, within a healthy population to select individuals who exhibit cardiovascular risk factors, and thus for which it should be a priori easier to identify a beneficial effect of dietary factors on the parameters associated with cardiovascular risk.</description>
