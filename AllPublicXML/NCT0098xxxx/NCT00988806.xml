    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether the treatment strategy of long-term
      intermittent every 30 days, continuous intravenous infusion for 24 hours of Levosimendan,
      associated to optimal contemporary treatment for advanced heart failure reduce the incidence
      of admission for heart failure worsening at 12 months follow up, compared with the strategy
      based solely in the optimal contemporary treatment for advanced heart failure.

      Aims: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of long-term, intermittent intravenous
      administration for 24 hours of Levosimendan for the treatment of advanced heart failure. Main
      end-point: incidence of admission due to decompensation, defined as first admission to
      emergency services or hospitalization more than 12 hours due to heart failure worsening.

      Secondary end-points: major cardiac events, serious adverse events, change in NYHA scale at
      baseline, 30 days, 6 and 12 months; effects on inflammatory and neurohormonal activation in
      heart failure, identify factors associated with better survival of patients, quality of life,
      cost-effectiveness of treatment.

      Study Design: Prospective, randomized, double-blind placebo controlled trial.

      Scope of the study: patients with advanced heart failure.

      Study Subjects: Patients over 18 years old with advanced HF of any etiology, with at least
      one admission for acute decompensation treated or treatable with Levosimendan within 6 months
      prior to randomization.

      Interventions: a 24-hour infusion every 30 days of Levosimendan or placebo in addition to
      optimal pharmacological treatment for HF during 12 months.

      Determinations: clinical monitoring, protocol-specified analytical determinations,
      echocardiographic assessment, invasive hemodynamic assessment, functional assessment by 6 min
      walk test in corridor, quality of life assessment at baseline, after 30 days, 6 months and 12
      months.
