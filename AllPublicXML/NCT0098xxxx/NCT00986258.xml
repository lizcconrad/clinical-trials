  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main objective of the study is to evaluate the effectiveness, tolerability, and safety of
      tapentadol hydrochloride prolonged release in subjects suffering from severe chronic low back
      pain (LBP) who are taking WHO Step III analgesics and show lack of tolerability. This is a
      clinical effectiveness trial designed to establish a link between anticipated clinical
      outcomes and the clinical practice by means of selected measures of clinical and
      subject-reported outcome.

      The trial will compare the effectiveness of previous analgesic treatment (WHO Step III) with
      that of tapentadol hydrochloride prolonged release treatment during defined periods of
      evaluation.

    <description>Participants started with 50 mg, 100 mg or 150 mg tapentadol prolonged release (twice daily). Opioid rotation to tapentadol was scheduled as follows:
if less than 100 mg morphine equivalent start with 50 mg tapentadol prolonged release;
if on 101 to 160 mg morphine equivalent daily dose start with 100 mg tapentadol prolonged release;
if above 161 mg morphine equivalent daily dose start with 150 mg tapentadol prolonged release.
Tapentadol doses were adjusted to a level that provided adequate analgesia (upwards or downwards on a weekly basis). After 5 weeks the doses of tapentadol prolonged release was kept stable (start of Maintenance phase). Tapentadol immediate release 50 mg (no more than twice daily; at least 4 hours apart) was considered as medication for acute pain episodes however, participants were not permitted to dose tapentadol immediate release once 500 mg tapentadol prolonged release dose was reached.</description>

      <recruitment_details>The enrollment of the first participant was on the 30 October 2009 and was prematurely terminated, due to slow recruitment, on 21 January 2011 (when the last subject completed the last follow-up examination).</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>The Trial had a duration of 13 weeks. The one week Observation Period did not involve dosing with Tapentadol. For Tapentadol analyses purposes the first 6 weeks of dosing with Tapentadol are reported as one period, Titration and Optimal Dose Period. The last 6 weeks on Tapentadol are reported as the Maintenance Period.</pre_assignment_details>

          <title>Tapentadol Prolonged Release</title>
          <description>All participants started with either 50 mg, 100 mg, or 150 mg tapentadol prolonged release (twice daily). The dose of tapentadol prolonged release was adjusted to a level that provided adequate analgesia necessary to achieve a balance between pain relief and a satisfactory level of tolerability (upwards or downwards on a weekly basis as needed). After 5 weeks the doses of tapentadol prolonged release was kept stable. Participants were permitted a maximum dose of 250 mg twice a day (500 mg total daily dose). Tapentadol immediate release 50 mg (no more than twice daily; at least 4 hours apart) was considered as medication for acute pain episodes however, participants were not permitted to dose tapentadol immediate release once 500 mg tapentadol prolonged release dose was reached.</description>

Tapentadol immediate release 50 mg (no more than twice daily; at least 4 hours apart) was considered as medication for acute pain episodes however, participants were not permitted to dose tapentadol immediate release once 500 mg tapentadol prolonged release dose was reached.</description>

Each participant rated their own neuropathic pain symptoms by answering ten questions relating to neuropathic symptoms on an 11-point scale 0 (not present) to 10 (worst imaginable) for each question. The higher the score for a question (sub-scale) the more bothersome the symptom is for the participant.
Results are reported as the mean for each neuropathic symptom in the sub-scale. The mean score is reported on a scale of 0 (not present in the group) to 1 (symptom has the maximum imaginable intensity for the whole group).</description>

For the sub-scores &quot;Overall Score&quot; and &quot;Pressing Pain&quot; there were only 69 participants with data available at baseline.</population>

            <title>Tapentadol Prolonged Release</title>
            <description>All participants started with either 50 mg, 100 mg, or 150 mg tapentadol prolonged release (twice daily). The dose of tapentadol prolonged release was adjusted to a level that provided adequate analgesia (upwards or downwards on a weekly basis as needed) as necessary to achieve a balance between pain relief and a satisfactory level of tolerability. After 5 weeks the doses of tapentadol prolonged release was kept stable. Participants were permitted a maximum dose of 250 mg twice a day (500 mg total daily dose). Tapentadol immediate release 50 mg (no more than twice daily; at least 4 hours apart) was considered as medication for acute pain episodes however, participants were not permitted to dose tapentadol immediate release once 500 mg tapentadol prolonged release dose was reached.</description>

The dose of tapentadol prolonged release was adjusted to a level that provided adequate analgesia (upwards or downwards on a weekly basis as needed) as necessary to achieve a balance between pain relief and a satisfactory level of tolerability. After 5 weeks the doses of tapentadol prolonged release was kept stable. Participants were permitted a maximum dose of 250 mg twice a day (500 mg total daily dose). Tapentadol immediate release 50 mg (no more than twice daily; at least 4 hours apart) was considered as medication for acute pain episodes however, participants were not permitted to dose tapentadol immediate release once 500 mg tapentadol prolonged release dose was reached.</description>

          <description>The baseline painDETECT score was reassessed at the end of Week 12.
It is a participant completed questionnaire. A total score is calculated. Participants with a score between 0 and 12 are scored as being &quot;negative&quot; (no neuropathic pain component). Value between 19 and 38 as being &quot;positive&quot; (presence of neuropathic component)&quot;. Values from 13 to 18 are scored as being &quot;unclear&quot;.</description>

          <description>All participants started with either 50 mg, 100 mg, or 150 mg tapentadol prolonged release (twice daily). The dose of tapentadol prolonged release was adjusted to a level that provided adequate analgesia necessary to achieve a balance between pain relief and a satisfactory level of tolerability (upwards or downwards on a weekly basis as needed). After 5 weeks the doses of tapentadol prolonged release was kept stable. Participants were permitted a maximum dose of 250 mg twice a day (500 mg total daily dose). Tapentadol immediate release 50 mg (no more than twice daily; at least 4 hours apart) was considered as medication for acute pain episodes however, participants were not permitted to dose tapentadol immediate release once 500 mg tapentadol prolonged release dose was reached.</description>
