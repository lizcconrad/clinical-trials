    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to obtain data from hospitalized Community Acquired Pneumonia (CAP)
      patients on the disease including disease severity, clinical signs and symptoms and measures
      used for diagnosis in daily routine practice as well as data on Avelox® including information
      on the use, effectiveness, treatment outcome, safety and tolerability.

      As this is a non-interventional observational study, routine clinical practice is observed.
      The application of medications follows the normal routines and is decided by the treating
      physician under recognition of the package insert.
