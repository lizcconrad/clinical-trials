    <textblock>
      The aim is to evaluate the time of positive conversion after exposure to smear positive
      pulmonary tuberculosis (TB) in a platoon of Korean military, a closed communal setting.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In a platoon where TB outbreak occurred, we performed low dose chest CT (LDCT),
      QuantiFERON-TB gold in tube (QFT) and two-step (0, 4weeks) TST for outbreak investigation. We
      perform QFT at 0, 2, 4, 8 and 12 weeks after initial investigation for soldiers with negative
      QFT results, and soldiers with positive QFT and normal LDCT took isoniazid and rifampin for 3
      months as treatment of latent TB.
