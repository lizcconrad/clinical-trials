  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators hypothesize that providing subjects on a once-a-day hypertension medication
      with GlowCaps ConnectTM will lead to an improvement in their medication adherence. The
      investigators propose to conduct a 6-month randomized control trial to assess the effect of
      the GlowCaps Connect™ system on the enhancement of hypertension medication adherence among
      subjects with a diagnosis of hypertension recruited from the greater Boston area. 130
      subjects will be enrolled. Subjects will be randomized into either the control group or into
      one of two intervention groups.

      Participants will use the GlowCap system for 6 months.

      Group 1

        -  The GlowCap bottle provided for subjects in this group will passively track medication
           adherence over the course of the study

        -  The pill cap will collect data, but will not provide any visual or auditory alerts

        -  An Ethernet Gateway connector will collect adherence data from the pill bottle cap via a
           local wireless network. This data will be sent out of subject's home through the
           internet.

      Group 2

        -  Subjects in this group will be given daily visual, auditory, and phone call reminders to
           take their medication via the GlowCap system if they fail to take their hypertension
           medication at the scheduled dose time

        -  An Ethernet Gateway connector will collect adherence data from the pill bottle cap via a
           local wireless network. This data will be sent out of subject's home through the
           internet.

        -  Subjects will receive Weekly and Monthly Progress Reports by email and mail,
           respectively. Reports will include information about medication adherence and target
           goals. If a subject does not opt-out, Monthly Progress Reports will also be sent to the
           subject's primary care physician (PCP)

        -  If the subject chooses, a friend or family member will receive a Weekly Progress Report
           by email

        -  If the subject chooses, he/she will receive prompts (via automated telephone call twice
           a month) to refill his/her prescription

        -  Subjects demonstrating consistent low adherence to medication will receive additional
           support in the form of calls from Vitality reminding them to take the medication.

      Group 3

        -  Subjects in this group will be given daily visual, auditory, and phone call reminders to
           take their medication via the GlowCap system if they fail to take their hypertension
           medication at the scheduled dose time

        -  An Ethernet Gateway connector will collect adherence data from the pill bottle cap via a
           local wireless network. This data will be sent out of subject's home through the
           internet.

        -  Subjects will receive Weekly and Monthly Progress Reports by email and mail,
           respectively. Reports will include information about medication adherence and target
           goals. If a subject does not opt-out, Monthly Progress Reports will also be sent to the
           subject's primary care physician (PCP)

        -  If the subject chooses, a friend or family member will receive a Weekly Progress Report
           by email

        -  Subjects will receive financial incentives in the form of a check for meeting a target
           adherence goal of 80% adherence over each month. The check will be mailed to them at the
           end of the study.

        -  If the subjects chooses, he/she will receive prompts (via automated telephone call twice
           a month) to refill his/her prescription

        -  Subjects demonstrating consistent low adherence to medication will receive additional
           support in the form of calls from Vitality reminding them to take the medication and may
           receive increased financial incentives to meet their target.

      Study subjects will attend two study visits, one at the beginning and one at the end of the 6
      month period. At these visits they will have their blood pressure recorded and will be asked
      to complete a survey.
