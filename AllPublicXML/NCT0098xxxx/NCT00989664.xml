  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The results from Phase 1/2 (RIT-I-000) and Phase 2 (RIT-II-001) studies of Tositumomab and
      Iodine I 131 Tositumomab (TST/I-131 TST) demonstrated that TST/ I-131 TST produced a high
      response rate in patients with chemotherapy-relapsed/refractory, low-grade or transformed
      low-grade Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma (NHL). On the basis of these results this study was designed
      to compare the efficacy of TST/ I-131 TST to the last qualifying chemotherapy regimen in
      patients with chemotherapy-refractory, low-grade or transformed low-grade NHL.

    <time_frame>Participants were evaluated for up to 99.1 months in Study 104504 or were followed in the long-term follow-up study for up to 141.5 months</time_frame>
    <description>An infection is the colonization of a host organism by a parasite species. Infecting parasites seek to use the host's resources to reproduce, often resulting in disease. Specimen samples of the body fluid are cultured for testing whether the infectious organism is present and grown in the culture media to assess the growth pattern of the organisms present in the specimen. The culture results could be positive or negative. The positive culture results indicate that the tested participant has the infection under investigation, in which case therapeutic treatment with anti-infective is required.</description>

    <measure>Number of Participants With an Infection for Which Anti-infectives Were Administered</measure>
    <time_frame>Participants were evaluated for up to 99.1 months in Study 104504 or were followed in the long-term follow-up study for up to 141.5 months</time_frame>
    <description>Anti-infectives are capable of acting against infection, by inhibiting the spread of an infectious agent or by killing the infectious agent outright. Anti-infective is a general term that encompasses antibacterials, antibiotics, antifungals, antiprotozoans, and antivirals.</description>

    <measure>Number of Participants Who Were Negative for Human Anti-murine Antibodies (HAMA) at Baseline (Before Receiving the Dosimetric Dose) But Positive or Negative After Receiving the Dosimetric Dose</measure>
    <time_frame>HAMA was measured at baseline; Day5; Weeks 7, 17, 25; and then every 12 months while in study BEX104526. Participants were evaluated for up to 99.1 months in Study 104504 or were followed in the long-term follow-up study for up to 141.5 months</time_frame>
    <description>The administration of murine antibodies may form HAMA. A HAMA assay was performed using the ImmunoSTRIP HAMA IgG enzyme-linked immune absorbent assay by a central laboratory (Covance Classic Laboratory Services, Indianapolis, IN). Fludarabine, a known immunosuppressant, might decrease HAMA production in addition to reducing bone marrow involvement. To be &quot;positive,&quot; a participant had to have a positive HAMA assessment at any follow-up visit.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Time to HAMA Positivity From the First Dosimetric Dose</measure>
    <time_frame>HAMA was measured at baseline; Day5; Weeks 7, 17, 25; and then every 12 months while in study BEX104526. Participants were evaluated for up to 99.1 months in Study 104504 or were followed in the long-term follow-up study for up to 141.5 months</time_frame>
    <description>HAMA are human immunoglobulins with specificity for mouse immunoglobulins. HAMA assays were conducted in the laboratory to measure conversion to HAMA positivity following treatment. Time to HAMA positivity was calculated as the difference between the day on which HAMA positivity occurred and the first dosimetric dose administration day.</description>

          <description>Participants received a dosimetric dose (DD) consisting of 450 milligrams (mg) of tositumomab (TST) intravenously (IV) immediately followed by I 131 TST (35 mg of TST, of which 1-2 mg was labelled with 5 millicurie [mCi] of I 131) IV. The therapeutic dose (TD) consisted of 450 mg of TST IV, immediately followed by a participant-specific dose of I 131 TST (35 mg of TST labelled with I 131 to administer 75 centigray [cGy] or 65 cGy). The TD was administered 7-14 days after the DD. Participants who had completed at least 2 years of follow up after administration of TST/I 131 TST during the TD phase and had signed the informed consent to participate in the Long-Term Follow-Up (LTFU) study (BEX104526) were followed for up to 10 years.

        <description>Participants with response include those with CR, CCR, or PR. Criteria for CR: complete resolution of all disease-related radiological abnormalities and the disappearance of all signs and symptoms related to the disease. Criteria for CCR: complete resolution of all disease-related symptoms, but residual foci, thought to be residual scar tissue, are present. Criteria for PR: &gt;=50% reduction in the sum of the products of the longest perpendicular diameters of all measurable lesions with no new lesions.</description>

        <description>An SAE is any event occurring at any dose that results in any of the following: death, a life-threatening adverse drug experience (ADE; at immediate risk of death from the experience as it occurred), inpatient hospitalization/prolongation of existing hospitalization, a persistent/significant disability/incapacity, or a congenital anomaly/birth defect. Medical events that may not result in death, be life threatening, or require hospitalization may be considered to be a serious ADEs when based upon appropriate medical judgment.

        <title>Number of Participants With the Indicated Type of Infection</title>
        <description>An infection is the colonization of a host organism by a parasite species. Infecting parasites seek to use the host's resources to reproduce, often resulting in disease. Specimen samples of the body fluid are cultured for testing whether the infectious organism is present and grown in the culture media to assess the growth pattern of the organisms present in the specimen. The culture results could be positive or negative. The positive culture results indicate that the tested participant has the infection under investigation, in which case therapeutic treatment with anti-infective is required.</description>

          <title>TST and I 131 TST</title>
          <description>Participants received a dosimetric dose (DD) consisting of 450 milligrams (mg) of tositumomab (TST) intravenously (IV) immediately followed by I 131 TST (35 mg of TST, of which 1-2 mg was labelled with 5 millicurie [mCi] of I 131) IV. The therapeutic dose (TD) consisted of 450 mg of TST IV, immediately followed by a participant-specific dose of I 131 TST (35 mg of TST labelled with I 131 to administer 75 centigray [cGy] or 65 cGy). The TD was administered 7-14 days after the DD. Participants who had completed at least 2 years of follow up after administration of TST/I 131 TST during the TD phase and had signed the informed consent to participate in the Long-Term Follow-Up (LTFU) study (BEX104526) were followed for up to 10 years. Participants did not receive any study medication during the LTFU study.</description>
