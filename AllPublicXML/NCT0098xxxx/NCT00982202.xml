    <textblock>
      This study was designed to assess the safety and tolerability of pioglitazone, an approved
      drug for type 2 diabetes, in non diabetic patients with Alzheimer's disease. It was also
      designed to generate preliminary information on whether pioglitazone might slow progression
      of Alzheimer's disease.

    <textblock>
      Inflammatory processes are important in the progressive loss of memory and thinking skills in
      Alzheimer's disease (AD). Laboratory studies show that drugs that bind to a protein known as
      &quot;Peroxisome Proliferator Activated Receptor-gamma (PPARgamma)&quot; act to reduce inflammatory
      responses in brain cells known as microglia when they are exposed to amyloid peptide, a major
      part of AD pathology. Therefore, drugs that activate PPARgamma have great potential for
      reducing the progression of AD. Pioglitazone (PGZ) activates PPARgamma and has shown
      favorable clinical experiences and safety profiles in patients with diabetes. This is a pilot
      study to determine the safety and tolerability of PGZ in patients with AD. Another goal of
      the study is to assess how clinical measures of cognition, daily function, and behavior might
      respond to PGZ treatment.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  CT or MRI since disease onset excluding structural lesions sufficient to account for
             the participant's dementia

          -  Mini-Mental State Exam (MMSE) score between 12 and 26, inclusively

          -  Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) score of 1 or 2 (mild to moderate AD severity) at both
             screening and baseline

          -  Women must be 2-years post-menopausal or surgically sterile.
