  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      H pylori gastric infection is one of the most prevalent infectious diseases worldwide. The
      discovery that most upper gastrointestinal diseases are related to H pylori infection and
      therefore can be treated with antibiotics is an important medical advance. Currently, a
      first-line triple therapy based on proton pump inhibitor (PPI) or ranitidine bismuth citrate
      (RBC) plus two antibiotics (clarithromycin and amoxicillin or nitroimidazole) is recommended
      by all consensus conferences and guidelines. Even with the correct use of this drug
      combination, infection can not be eradicated in up to 23% of patients. Therefore, several
      second line therapies have been recommended. A 7 d quadruple therapy based on PPI, bismuth,
      tetracycline and metronidazole is the more frequently accepted. However, with second-line
      therapy, bacterial eradication may fail in up to 40% of cases. When H pylori eradication is
      strictly indicated the choice of further treatment is controversial. When available,
      endoscopy with culture and consequent antibiotic susceptibility testing remains the most
      appropriate option for patients with two eradication failures to avoid a widespread use of
      expensive antibiotics. The use of these drugs may also induce severe side-effects and
      development of H pylori resistant strains.

      Resistant strains of Helicobacter pylori can display a dense biofilm with mucus and
      microorganisms in a coccoid shape on the mucosal surface of stomach that may have a role in
      determining the resistance to the antibiotic therapies. Possibly, N-acetil-cysteine (NAC) may
      dissolve biofilm architecture and help to eradicate resistant strains of H pylori.

      To evaluate the usefulness of NAC as pre-treatment attempt associated with a culture-guided
      antibiotic therapy as rescue therapy after multi-attempts antibiotic failure, in the first
      phase of the study, the effect of NAC on biofilm formation and on its demolition will be
      tested in vitro by adding NAC in cultured H pylori isolates from a limited number of patients
      (n10) with an history of at least 4 failed eradicating attempts. Two biopsy samples of
      gastric mucosa will be obtained during endoscopy for microbiological purpose. Specimens will
      be used for H pylori culture. In specimens from 5 patients, H pylori will be cultured
      together with NAC 2 mg, while in the other 5 cases, H pylori culture will be carried out
      without NAC. In these latter, after the biofilm formation, H pylori isolates will be faced
      with different doses of NAC (2 mg, 10 mg, and 20 mg) to observe the behavior of biofilm. In
      the second phase of the study, 40 patients, after at least four unsuccessful H pylori
      eradication attempts, will be consecutively recruited. During endoscopy, in each patient, at
      least 4 mucosal biopsies will be obtained from the gastric body. Two of these biopsies will
      be used for biofilm study at the scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The remaining biopsies
      will be used for H pylori culture. From culture, the in vitro antibiotic susceptibility
      testing together with genetic analysis of H pylori isolates will be performed. On the basis
      of antibiotic susceptibility testing alone, patients will then randomly assigned to receiving
      two different eradication schedules: Group A, patients receiving NCA 600 mg once a day for a
      week and subsequently a culture-guided one-week regimen including a PPI plus two antibiotics
      against H pylori; group B (control), patients receiving solely a culture-guided one-week
      antibiotic treatment including a PPI plus two antibiotics. Sensitive antibiotics will be
      always chosen on the basis of the more favorable minimum inhibiting concentration value. all
      patients will have a diary to record the side effects and symptoms during therapy. Compliance
      will measured by counting the tablets returned after the 7-day treatment. Patients will take
      a control C13 urea breath test at least two months after the end of therapy. They will be
      also invited to repeat endoscopic examination for monitoring biofilm persistence or absence.
      Finally, results obtained with the two treatment arms will be compared and evaluated also on
      the light of genetic analyses of H pylori isolates.
