  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Genetic tests has been suggested to reduce side effects related to Nevirapine(NVP), a
      commonly prescribed component of highly active antiretroviral therapy(HAART) in developing
      countries. This clinical trials is designed to determine the efficacy and the
      cost-effectiveness of this approach in the developing countries setting.

      NVP-based HAART and efavirenz(EFV)-based HAART will be provided through Thai national
      universal health coverage. Information of the prescribed drug will be collected, and
      monitoring for the compliance with the prescribed highly active antiretroviral therapy will
      be conducted.

      Outcome measurements:

      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the reduction in incidences of NVP
      associated cutaneous side effects by genotype based personalized prescription. The volunteers
      will be monitored for any solicited and non-solicited adverse effects for 6 months after drug
      administration, with first 6 weeks intensive monitoring for cutaneous adverse reactions.
      Laboratory safety profiles (Complete Blood Count(CBC), Alanine transaminase(ALT), Aspartate
      transaminase(AST), Blood Urea Nitrogen(BUN), creatinine, direct bilirubin, total bilirubin,
      lactate dehydrogenase, alkaline phosphatase) will be assessed during the intensive monitoring
      period (6 weeks).

      Statistical Methods:

      Descriptive statistics will be used to evaluate the conduct of the study. Analysis variables
      will include overall follow-up rate, drug compliance, and events of protocol violation.

      Laboratory and safety data will be presented using comparative statistics for each study
      group and compared within and between groups using standard parametric or non-parametric
      comparison tests, i.e., McNemar's test or paired t-test as appropriate.

      Comparison of rate of cutaneous adverse reaction, hepatitis and severe cutaneous adverse
      reaction(SCAR) will be made with chi-square test. Variable that shown significant different
      between the &quot;standard of care&quot; or control group and the &quot;genetic test&quot; or intervention group
      will adjusted for the final analysis with Poisson logistic regression.

      The overall rate of adverse events in all participants will be monitored whether the rate of
      adverse events is lower than the predefined criteria. The extension of trial may be
      considered based on the rate of adverse events.
