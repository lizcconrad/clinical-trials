  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary goal of this study is to examine the fidelity and generalization of parenting
      effects of the KEEP foster parent training intervention as it is being delivered within a
      child welfare system of care by a community mental health provider.

      The primary goal of this study is to utilize this opportunity as a real-world platform for
      addressing three key questions that need to be answered prior to wide-scale implementation of
      the KEEP intervention. First, do the effects of the KEEP parent training generalize
      (concurrently) to other children currently in foster and kin intervention homes and lead to
      reductions in overall levels of behavior problems? Second, does the KEEP intervention
      continue to have effects after the completion of the intervention and generalize (temporally)
      to new children who enter the homes of these families at a later point in time? Finally, as
      the KEEP intervention is being implemented by a community agency in a real-world system of
      care, can the intervention be delivered and maintained in a manner that preserves the goals
      and quality of the intervention?

      Children in foster care, between the ages of 5 and 12, will be randomly assigned to one of
      two conditions - the KEEP intervention or a &quot;services as usual&quot; condition. In the KEEP
      intervention condition, foster and kin caregivers will participate in 16 weekly group
      meetings. Outcomes to be assessed include child problem behavior (of the focal child and
      other children in the household), child functioning, parental stress, family functioning, use
      of mental health services, child placement changes (e.g., reunification with biological
      parents, move to another foster home), and foster parent retention rates. In addition, for a
      year following the completion of the intervention, new children entering the home of
      foster/kin caregiver will be included in the assessments, along with the impact of these
      additional children on parental stress and family functioning. Finally, several dimensions of
      intervention fidelity (e.g., facilitator adherence and group engagement) will be assessed and
      examined in relation to child, family, and system outcomes.
