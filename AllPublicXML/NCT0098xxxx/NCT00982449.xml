  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research is being done to determine whether viral thymidine kinase (TK) expression in
      Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) and Kaposi's sarcoma herpesvirus (KSHV) virus-associated tumors is
      sufficient to image.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      EBV and KSHV are associated with a variety of malignancies including some lymphomas,
      carcinomas and other malignancies. We anticipate that viral TK expression will differ among
      tumor types and will be adjusted with standard chemotherapies and some investigational
      agents. This exploratory study is aimed in part at evaluating whether standard regimens or
      investigational regimens might bring about sufficient activation of the EBV-TK or KSHV-TK in
      tumors to be therapeutically useful if used in conjunction with FIAU as a
      radiopharmaceutical.
