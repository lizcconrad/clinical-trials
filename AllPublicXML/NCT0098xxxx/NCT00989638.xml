  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to develop a coordinated, standardized screening program for the
      early detection of breast cancer in high-risk women. This would include Breast Mammography
      and Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) examination of your breasts. The University of Chicago
      Department of Radiology is performing research to develop better ways of imaging the breast.
      The investigators would like to be able to reliably identify abnormal tissue and determine
      whether abnormal areas contain cancer without surgical procedures (i.e., a biopsy which
      involves removing breast tissue with a needle or surgical instrument). Annual mammography has
      already been recommended for the patient based on family history or personal history of
      cancer. In young women, dense breasts sometimes make it difficult to find abnormal changes on
      breast cancer screening (mammograms). MRI, in combination with mammography, may increase the
      rate of detection of early cancers. In addition, MRI can provide better images of breast
      tissue. The investigators hope to prove that combining multiple screening measures including
      biomarkers improves the chances that, if you have a small cancer or pre-cancer, it will be
      found early. This study will also evaluate quality of life measures during breast cancer
      screening and compare breast MRI and mammogram in a high-risk population. The investigators
      will establish a database of clinical characteristics, blood biomarkers and interventions
      that will be saved for future analysis and aid in the development of more effective screening
      in high-risk women. This research will also help us develop tools for studies in the future.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Each woman will meet one or more of the criteria below:

          -  Known BRCA1 or BRCA2 carrier (must be older than 21 years)

          -  Any mutation carrier in hereditary breast cancer susceptibility genes that is known to
             increase the risk for breast cancer (regardless of age). Some examples of these would
             include TP53, PTEN, BRCA1 and BRCA2, CHEK2, ATM, and CDH1 and other identified genetic
             markers conferring greater than 2.5 fold increased breast cancer risk in a polygenic
             model.

          -  For women who chose not to have genetic testing or test negative, probability of being
             a BRCA1 or BRCA2 carrier of 20% or greater based on BRCAPRO analysis or â‰¥ 25% risk of
             being a mutation carrier by any Genetic model such as Couch, Myriad, BODICEA, in
             addition to a lifetime breast cancer risk &gt;=20% by CARE, Tyler Cuzick, or Claus model

          -  Personal history of breast cancer before age 35 years and no evidence of disease
             recurrence for at least two years.

          -  Any woman of African ancestry whose 1st degree relative (mother or sister) or 2nd
             degree relative (aunt, grandmother) if paternal lineage suspected diagnosed with
             breast cancer under age 40, regardless of risk model calculation

          -  Have a personal history of ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) diagnosed at or before age
             35 AND a first degree relative who had been diagnosed with breast cancer before age 50
             OR has a first degree relative diagnosed with ovarian cancer at any age

          -  Any female cancer survivor who received chest irradiation before age 30 for any
             disease including Hodgkin's, a sarcoma, neuroblastoma, or other medical condition.

        In addition to meeting one of the above criteria, women must meet all of the following:

          -  willing to travel to University of Chicago Medical Center for imaging studies as well
             as any necessary follow-up procedures.

          -  have at least one breast that has not been irradiated for cancer

          -  be at least 25 years of age or at least 5 years younger than the first case of breast
             cancer diagnosis in the family. (This applies only to high risk women who are not
             BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation carriers)

          -  be able to give informed consent

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Women will be excluded if they meet one of the following:

          -  active cancer at the time of enrollment. A prior history of breast cancer is permitted
             if the subject has completed chemotherapy and is considered disease-free at the time
             of enrollment.

          -  current pregnancy or plans for pregnancy within two years of enrollment

          -  presence of a pacemaker or any other metallic foreign objects in their body that
             interferes with an MRI

          -  breast surgery within two weeks of study entry

          -  previous bilateral mastectomy (prophylactic or therapeutic)

          -  history of kidney disease or abnormal kidney tests

          -  Women who test negative in a family with identifiable BRCA mutations are ineligible
             regardless of risk calculation
