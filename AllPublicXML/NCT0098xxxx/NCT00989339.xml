  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Recent evidence suggests that increased levels of a circulation fat (free fatty acids or
      FFAs) can cause high blood pressure and cardiac complications. Intralipid is the only type of
      fat approved by the FDA for clinical use. It is usually used as nutrition support in
      malnourished patients. The investigators' preliminary studies indicate that Intralipid
      results in a significant rise in blood pressure, blood vessel stiffness, and inflammation in
      obese subjects. Olive oil can also be used as nutrition support. The effect of olive oil
      intravenous (IV) on blood pressure and inflammation is not known. In this study, the
      investigators will compare the effect of Intralipid and olive oil on blood pressure, blood
      vessel stiffness and inflammation in healthy subjects. The investigators hypothesize that
      Olive oil emulsions will result in less vascular changes and less inflammatory response than
      Intralipid solutions. Accordingly, the investigators propose a systematic evaluation of the
      effects of Intralipid, olive oil and normal saline on blood pressure, endothelial function
      (vascular stiffness), inflammation in normal subjects.

      A group of obese subjects will be admitted to the Clinical Research Center on 3 occasions.
      Subjects will receive repeated infusions of Intralipid, ClinOleic, and normal saline at 20
      ml/hour for 24 hours.
