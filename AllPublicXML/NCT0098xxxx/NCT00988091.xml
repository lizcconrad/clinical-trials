  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Subjects with chronic osteoarthritis of the knee will be assigned to receive an injection of
      either 1.2% sodium hyaluronate or buffered saline to evaluate its effectiveness and safety
      for 26 weeks. After 26 weeks, subjects can elect to receive a second injection of 1.2% sodium
      hyaluronate and be followed for another 26 weeks.

    <measure>Change From Baseline in the Visual Analogue Score (VAS) Pain Score of the 50-foot Walk Test at Week 26</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 0 (baseline) through Week 26</time_frame>
    <description>The level of pain is estimated by the participant following a walk of 50 feet in length which is observed by the investigator. Pain estimates were recorded on a 100 millimeter visual analog scale. A score of 0 millimeters means there was no pain; a score of 100 millimeters means extreme pain. Change from baseline is calculated: week 26 VAS Pain Score - Baseline VAS Pain Score.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Western Ontario McMaster University Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) Disability Scores at Week 26</measure>

    <description>Adjusted mean of all WOMAC pain, stiffness and physical function subscores on Visual Analog Scale (VAS) of 100 mm; 0 mm = no pain, stiffness and difficulty; 100 mm = extreme pain, stiffness and difficulty. Change from baseline calculated as: Week 26 minus baseline.</description>

    <time_frame>Day 0 (baseline), Week 26</time_frame>
    <description>The level of pain is estimated by the participant following a walk of 50 feet in length which is observed by the investigator. Pain estimates were recorded on a 100 millimeter visual analog scale. A score of 0 millimeters means there was no pain; a score of 100 millimeters means extreme pain. Change from baseline is calculated: week 26 VAS Pain Score - Baseline VAS Pain Score. The percent of participants who showed a 20mm or greater improvement in the pain scores at week 26 compared to baseline are reported.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Subjective Patient Assessment of Treatment at Week 26</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 26</time_frame>
    <description>At the end of the double-blind period (week 26), participants were asked: &quot;Are you satisfied with the results of the injection?&quot; Answers could be: 1=dissatisfied; 2=slightly satisfied; 3=satisfied; or 4=very satisfied.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Tablets of Rescue Medication Used Between Visits</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1 to week 26</time_frame>
    <description>Acetaminophen (500-mg tablets) was provided to study participants as a rescue medication in case they needed a pain medication during the study. The mean number of tablets of rescue medication should have been summarized, however the data was not captured in a reliable way and is therefore not reported.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in Patient Global Assessment at Week 26</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 0 (baseline), Week 26</time_frame>
    <description>Participants were asked to mark along a 100mm visual analog scale (VAS) indicating the point best representing the severity of the knee pain that day. The left side of the VAS was 0=no pain and the right side was 100 = extreme pain. Change from baseline was calculated as Week 26 - Baseline.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Observed Osteoarthritis Research Society International (OARSI30) Responders Using the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) to Assess Pain Following a 50-foot Walk at Week 26</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 0 (baseline), week 26</time_frame>
    <description>Responders are identified based on a calculation of three scales: 50-foot walk test for pain, function (WOMAC Disability score) and global assessment (Patient Global Assessment Score) scales. Each of the individual scales was completed by the participant. A responder showed considerable improvement in pain or function (&gt;=50 percent and absolute change of &gt;=20 millimeters), or improvement in at least two of three categories: Pain and/or Function and/or Patient Global Assessment scales of &gt;=20 percent and absolute change &gt;=10 millimeter. Response at Week 26 is compared to baseline.</description>

        <title>Percentage of Observed Osteoarthritis Research Society International (OARSI30) Responders Using the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) to Assess Pain Following a 50-foot Walk at Week 26</title>
        <description>Responders are identified based on a calculation of three scales: 50-foot walk test for pain, function (WOMAC Disability score) and global assessment (Patient Global Assessment Score) scales. Each of the individual scales was completed by the participant. A responder showed considerable improvement in pain or function (&gt;=50 percent and absolute change of &gt;=20 millimeters), or improvement in at least two of three categories: Pain and/or Function and/or Patient Global Assessment scales of &gt;=20 percent and absolute change &gt;=10 millimeter. Response at Week 26 is compared to baseline.</description>
