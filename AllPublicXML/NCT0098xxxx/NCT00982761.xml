    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to discover the health status of occupational drivers. The
      health status includes data collection of body mass index, blood pressure, central obesity,
      anxiety scale scores, smoking habit and related cessation therapy, etc.

    <textblock>
      Occupational drivers' health is essential for passengers' safety. However, occupational
      drivers' health is damaged by long-term sitting and driving, lack of exercise, stress from
      traffic, and irregular diet. The objectives of this study were to assess the health status of
      occupational drivers in Taiwan. The measures included blood pressure, central obesity,
      fasting blood sugar, triglyceride, body mass index (BMI), anxiety scale scores, and metabolic
      syndrome, etc.

        This study is to understand the health status of occupational status. Occupational drivers
        work in a sitting position for long durations, facing traffic stress, irregular mealtimes
        and lack of exercise etc, and may impede their health. For passengers, their safety is
        related to the occupational drivers' health status and should pay attention to the health
        condition of the occupational drivers.
