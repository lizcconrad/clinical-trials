      Objectives:

      Primary: Safety and immunogenicity of MVA.HIVA vaccine in 20-week-old healthy Kenyan infants
      born to HIV-1-infected mothers.

      Secondary:

        -  HIV-1 immunogenicity comparison between MVA.HIVA and age-matched unvaccinated control
           arms in each cohort (breastfeeding or formula feeding)

        -  HIV-1 immunogenicity comparison between breastfeeding and formula feeding infants
           receiving MVA.HIVA

        -  HIV-1 immunogenicity comparison between breastfeeding and formula feeding infants in the
           age-matched unvaccinated control group

        -  Comparison of responses to certain Kenyan Extended Programme on Immunization (KEPI)
           vaccines (OPV, DTP, HBV, and HiB) between MVA.HIVA versus age-matched unvaccinated
           controls in each cohort, between breast versus formula feeding infants in the
           age-matched unvaccinated control group, and between breast versus formula infants
           receiving MVA.HIVA

        -  Comparison of immune activation and phenotypic profile of lymphocytes between breast and
           formula feeding infants in each cohort (MVA.HIVA and age-matched unvaccinated control)

        -  Build capacity for Infant HIV-1 Vaccine Clinical Trials Centre in Nairobi, Kenya.

        Infant Inclusion Criteria

          -  Healthy infants

          -  &lt; 3 days of age (day of birth = Day 0) at enrolment

          -  Birth weight &gt; 2500 grams

          -  Born to an eligible woman

          -  Written informed consent by parent

        Infant Exclusion Criteria

          -  HIV infection, as determined by a filter paper and/or RNA test prior to vaccination.

          -  Participation in any other HIV-1 vaccine or drug trial.

          -  Failure to receive all standard KEPI immunizations according to national immunization
             programme.

          -  Weight for age z-scores outside of 2 standard deviations of normal at the time of
             vaccination.

          -  Acute disease at the time of vaccination (acute disease is defined as the presence of
             a moderate or severe illness with or without fever). All vaccines can be administered
             to persons with a minor illness such as diarrhoea, mild upper respiratory tract
             infection with or without low-grade febrile illness, i.e., temperature of &lt;37.5 °C).

          -  Axillary temperature of ≥ 37.5 °C at the time of vaccination.

          -  Any clinically significant abnormal finding on screening from biochemistry or
             haematology by the time of vaccination.

          -  History of allergic disease or reactions likely to be exacerbated by any component of
             the vaccine, e.g., egg products.

          -  Presence of any underlying disease that compromises the diagnosis and evaluation of
             response to the vaccine.

          -  Any other on-going chronic illness requiring hospital specialist supervision.

          -  Administration of immunoglobulins and/or any blood products within one month preceding
             the planned administration of the vaccine candidate.

          -  Any history of anaphylaxis in reaction to vaccination.

          -  Research Physician's assessment of lack of willingness by parents to participate and
             comply with all requirements of the protocol, or identification of any factor felt to
             significantly increase the infant's risk of suffering an adverse outcome.

          -  Likelihood of travel away from the study area.
