      The effect of intravenous lidocaine infusion on manifestations of fibromyalgia manifestations
      were recorded before and 4 weeks after treatment. Pain intensity was rated on a numerical
      scale.The combination of 240 mg intravenous lidocaine (once a week) and 25 mg amitriptyline
      for 4 weeks did not modify pain intensity or manifestations in patients with fibromyalgia.

      Thirty patients ranging in age from 18 to 60 years, with fibromyalgia (American College of
      Rheumatology criteria: pain in the four quadrants of the body for at least 3 months and a
      minimum of 11 out of 18 tender points) were studied. Other manifestations were also recorded:
      sleep disorders, fatigue, subjective edema, depression, and paresthesia.

      Criteria for exclusion were alterations in thyroid, rheumatological, renal and hepatic
      function; trauma; rheumatic, neuromuscular or psychiatric disease; infectious arthropathy;
      other pain syndromes; drug hypersensitivity, and pregnancy.

      All patients received amitriptyline at a dose of 12.5 mg in the first week and 25 mg over the
      subsequent 4 weeks. Patients of group 1 (n = 15) received 125 mL 0.9% saline and patients of
      group 2 (n = 15) received 240 mg lidocaine diluted in 125 mL 0.9% saline. The solutions were
      infused over a period of 1 h, once a week, for 4 weeks (T1, T2, T3 and T4).
