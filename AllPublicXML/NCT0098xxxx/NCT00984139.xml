    <textblock>
      This phase IV open study will evaluate the persistence of humoral antibodies against
      hepatitis B as well as the immune response to a challenge dose of hepatitis B vaccine in
      adolescents aged 12-13 years, who received three consecutive doses of GSK Biologicals'
      recombinant hepatitis B vaccine (Engerix™-B) in infancy.

          -  Administration of immunoglobulins and/or any blood products within the three months
             preceding HBV vaccine challenge or planned administration during the study period.

          -  Chronic administration of immunosuppressants or other immune-modifying drugs within
             six months prior to the HBV vaccine challenge..

          -  Any confirmed or suspected immunosuppressive or immunodeficient condition, based on
             medical history and physical examination (no laboratory testing required).

          -  Use of any investigational or non-registered product other than the study vaccine
             within 30 days preceding the challenge dose of study vaccine, or planned use during
             the study period.

          -  Pregnant or lactating female.

          -  Female planning to become pregnant or planning to discontinue contraceptive

             component.

          -  Acute disease and/or fever at the time of enrolment.

      <restrictive_agreement>GSK agreements may vary with individual investigators, but will not prohibit any investigator from publishing. GSK supports the publication of results from all centers of a multi-center trial but requests that reports based on single-site data not precede the primary publication of the entire clinical trial.</restrictive_agreement>

    <limitations_and_caveats>A decrease in the specificity of the anti-HB ELISA assay had been observed in some studies for low levels of antibody (10-100 mIU/mL). The table shows updated results following complete retesting and reanalysis.</limitations_and_caveats>
