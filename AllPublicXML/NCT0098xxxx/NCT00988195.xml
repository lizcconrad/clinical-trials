    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether recombinant human arginase (PEG-BCT-100) is
      safe and effective in the treatment of advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).

      The primary objectives of this study are:

        -  To establish a safe dose level for weekly intravenous administration of PEG- BCT-100
           (rhArgIpeg5000) based on clinical and laboratory safety assessments following a range of
           doses (from 500 to &gt;5000 U/kg).

        -  To define the optimal biological dose (OBD) of PEG-BCT-100 based on the pharmacodynamics
           (PD) of arginine depletion (ADD) relative to plasma PK of PEG- BCT-100.

        -  To evaluate any objective tumor responses to PEG-BCT-100 in HCC patients receiving
           weekly doses of PEG-BCT-100 alone and in combination with standard doses of doxorubicin

      Secondary objectives of this study are:

        -  To define any toxicities associated with the metabolic and cellular alterations of ADD
           relative to dose and PK of PEG-BCT-100 (rhArgIpeg5000).

        -  To develop a safe and biologically active dose and schedule for PEG-BCT-100 treatment in
           phase 2 trials, either as monotherapy or in combination with best standard of care
           chemotherapy.

        -  To confirm the safety and initial anti-tumor activity of the preferred dose and regimen
           of PEG-BCT-100 in 18 additional patients with advanced HCC
