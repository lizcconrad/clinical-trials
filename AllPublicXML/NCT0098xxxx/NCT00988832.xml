  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to quantify how infliximab therapy is being used in the UK and the
      consequent impact on health care resources, which will help to inform budget holders and
      payers on the costs associated with the treatment of Crohn's Disease.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All interested hospital physicians across the UK who prescribe infliximab as part of their
      treatment of Crohn's Disease patients. will be included. It is assumed that the physician
      population will consist primarily of gastroenterologists, though general physicians
      (hospital-based) with an interest in Crohn's Disease may also be included.

    <time_frame>12 months prior to and 12, 18, and 24 months after the first infusion of infliximab</time_frame>
    <description>Costs were calculated as those incurred to the National Health Service (NHS) to treat Crohn's Disease. Costs of outpatient consultations are based on the 2009 Unit Cost of Health and Social Care published by the Personal Social Service Research Unit. Consultations with gastroenterologists, gastric/gastrointestinal surgeons, radiologists, nurses/Inflammatory Bowel Disease nurses, dieticians/nutrition specialists, psychologists/psychiatrists, pharmacists, and occupational therapists are included in the analysis.</description>

    <measure>Mean Cost Per Participant of Elective Surgical Procedures</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months prior to and 12, 18, and 24 months after the first infusion of infliximab</time_frame>
    <description>Costs were calculated as those incurred to the National Health Service (NHS) to treat Crohn's Disease. Costs of elective surgical procedures were calculated as per the 2009 Healthcare Resource Group (HRG) descriptors. Costs were analyzed for elective surgeries that required participants to be admitted into a hospital.</description>

    <measure>Mean Cost Per Participant Due to Non-elective/Emergency Inpatient Admissions</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months prior to and 12, 18, and 24 months after the first infusion of infliximab</time_frame>
    <description>Costs were calculated as those incurred to the National Health Service (NHS) to treat Crohn's Disease. Costs of non-elective or emergency inpatient admissions were calculated as per the 2009 Healthcare Resource Group (HRG) descriptors. Costs were analyzed for unplanned hospital admissions due to emergency surgical procedures and unplanned consultations due to complications.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Mean Cost Per Participant for Admissions for Day Case Surgery</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months prior to and 12, 18, and 24 months after the first infusion of infliximab</time_frame>
    <description>Costs were calculated as those incurred to the National Health Service (NHS) to treat Crohn's Disease. Costs of day case (outpatient) surgeries were calculated as per the 2009 Healthcare Resource Group (HRG) descriptors. Costs were analyzed for any surgeries that did not require the participant to stay overnight in the hospital.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Mean Cost Per Participant for All Hospitalizations</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months prior to and 12, 18, and 24 months after the first infusion of infliximab</time_frame>
    <description>Costs for all hospitalizations, including costs associated with elective
and emergency (non-elective) admissions as well as outpatient procedures.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Mean Cost Per Participant of Accident and Emergency (A&amp;E) Visits</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months prior to and 12, 18, and 24 months after the first infusion of infliximab</time_frame>
    <description>Costs for visits to A&amp;E without admission. Costs were calculated as those incurred to the National Health Service (NHS) to treat Crohn's Disease as per the 2009 Healthcare Resource Group (HRG) descriptors.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Mean Cost Per Participant for Crohns-related Medications</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months prior to and 12, 18, and 24 months after the first infusion of infliximab</time_frame>
    <description>Costs of biologics were calculated by multiplying the number of vials of drug used per participant by the 2009 British National Formulary (BNF) cost per vial. Costs of other drugs with ≥10 prescriptions were calculated by multiplying the 2009 BNF daily cost of the standard/most-prescribed dose of the most-prescribed drug (reference drug) in each drug group (Anatomical Therapeutic Classification [ATC] Level 4) by the length of treatment. Costs for drugs in drug groups with ≤9 prescriptions were calculated using the average cost of all Crohns medications multiplied by the length of treatment.</description>

    <measure>Mean Cost Per Participant for Diagnostic Tests During Planned Outpatient Consultations</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months prior to and 12, 18, and 24 months after the first infusion of infliximab</time_frame>
    <description>Costs were calculated as those incurred to the National Health Service (NHS) to treat Crohn's Disease. Costs of diagnostic tests conducted during outpatient consultations were calculated as per the 2008-2009 NHS Reference Costs. Costs for diagnostic tests during hospitalizations and A&amp;E visits were incorporated into cost analyses for those categories and are not included here.</description>

        <title>Mean Cost Per Participant for Crohns-related Medications</title>
        <description>Costs of biologics were calculated by multiplying the number of vials of drug used per participant by the 2009 British National Formulary (BNF) cost per vial. Costs of other drugs with ≥10 prescriptions were calculated by multiplying the 2009 BNF daily cost of the standard/most-prescribed dose of the most-prescribed drug (reference drug) in each drug group (Anatomical Therapeutic Classification [ATC] Level 4) by the length of treatment. Costs for drugs in drug groups with ≤9 prescriptions were calculated using the average cost of all Crohns medications multiplied by the length of treatment.</description>
