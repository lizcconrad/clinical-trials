    <measure>Time to Event for 7%, 15%, and 25% Weight Gain for All Participants</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline up to 52 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Kaplan-Meier methodology used to estimate time to event. Participants who never reached the target weight gain contributed to the set of patients at risk up to the point at which they discontinued from the study and were then censored (i.e., removed from the risk set).</description>

    <measure>Mean Change From Baseline to 52 Weeks in Adolescent Structured Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS) for Participants With Bipolar I Disorder</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 52 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The YMRS is an 11-item scale that measures the severity of manic episodes. Four items are rated on a scale from 0 (symptom not present) to 8 (symptom extremely severe). The remaining items are rated on a scale from 0 (symptom not present) to 4 (symptom extremely severe). The YMRS total score ranges from 0 (symptom not present) to 60 (symptom extremely severe).</description>

    <measure>Mean Clinical Global Impression of Improvement (CGI-I) at 52 Weeks for All Participants</measure>
    <time_frame>52 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Clinical Global Impression of Improvement (CGI-I) is used by the clinician to record the improvement of illness at the time of assessment. The score ranges from 1 (very much improved) to 7 (very much worse).</description>

    <measure>Mean Change From Baseline to 52 Weeks in Clinical Global Impression - Severity (CGI-S) for All Participants</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 52 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The CGI-S is used by the clinician to record the severity of illness at the time of assessment. The score ranges from 1 = normal, not at all ill to 7 = among the most extremely ill.</description>

    <measure>Mean Change From Baseline to 52 Weeks in Anchored Version of the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale for Children (BPRS-C) for Participants With Schizophrenia</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 52 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The BPRS-C characterizes psychopathology. A total of 21 items are rated on a scale from 0 (not present) to 6 (extremely severe) with a total score ranging from 0 to 126. A decrease in score indicates a reduction in psychopathology.</description>
