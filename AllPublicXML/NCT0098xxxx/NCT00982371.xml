  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The number of people with type 2 diabetes is growing. This puts a lot of pressure on the
      health care systems. Type 2 diabetes is often associated with health problems, like poor
      eyesight, muscle coordination, muscle strength, and blood flow. Poor bone health may also be
      a concern for people with type 2 diabetes.

      A large proportion of people with type 2 diabetes will break a bone in their lifetime. The
      risk of this happening in older people with type 2 diabetes is greater than the risk in older
      people without diabetes. Fracturing a bone can be very painful, and lead to serious
      consequences, especially if the individual experiences a hip fracture. The elevated fracture
      risk, seen in those with type 2 diabetes, is puzzling because people with type 2 diabetes
      often appear to have normal, healthy bones compared to people of the same age without
      diabetes.

      Bone micro-structure, which is not assessed by traditional bone densitometry systems (ie:
      DXA) contributes to overall bone strength.

      The hypothesis of this study is that bone micro-structure is of poorer quality (reduced
      trabecular thickness, increased trabecular spacing) in postmenopausal women with type 2
      diabetes, compared to age-matched control participants.
