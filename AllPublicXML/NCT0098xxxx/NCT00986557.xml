      RATIONALE: An infusion of cytomegalovirus-specific T lymphocytes may prevent or reduce
      cytomegalovirus infection during the first year after a donor stem cell transplant.

      PURPOSE: This randomized phase II trial is studying T-lymphocyte infusion to see how well it
      works compared with standard therapy in treating patients at risk of cytomegalovirus
      infection after a donor stem cell transplant.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  To determine the frequency of cytomegalovirus (CMV) reactivation during the first year
           after allogeneic stem cell transplantation (ASCT) in patients at risk for CMV infection
           treated with adoptive transfer of selected CMV-specific cytotoxic T-lymphocytes.

      Secondary

        -  To monitor CMV-specific immune reconstitution within the first year following ASCT in
           these patients.

        -  To determine the time to CMV reactivation in these patients.

        -  To evaluate the use of antiviral therapy in these patients.

        -  To determine the incidence of secondary CMV reactivation and CMV disease in patients
           treated with this regimen.

        -  To determine the incidence of acute and chronic graft-versus-host disease.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. After undergoing an allogeneic peripheral blood stem
      cell transplantation (PBSCT) using an alemtuzumab-based conditioning regimen that also
      includes radiotherapy, patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive cytomegalovirus (CMV)-specific cytotoxic T-lymphocyte infusion
           on day 21-90 after allogeneic PBSCT.

        -  Arm II: Patients undergo standard follow-up care and receive standard antiviral therapy
           comprising ganciclovir IV or foscarnet sodium upon detection or confirmation of CMV
           reactivation.

      Blood samples are collected to assess CMV viral load by quantitative PCR.

      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed once a week for 100 days and then
      once a month for 1 year.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 18 patients with sibling donors and 21 patients with unrelated
      donors are accrued for each arm, resulting in a total of 78 patients accrued for this study.
