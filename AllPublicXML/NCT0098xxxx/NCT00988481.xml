      The goal of this study is to generate pilot data exploring the addition of an augmentation
      (additional) medication to patients suffering from bulimia nervosa who have responded but not
      had complete symptom resolution with a course of standard medication treatment.

      The aim of this study is to determine whether the addition of an augmentation medication
      (topiramate 200mg/d) will confer additional reductions in symptomatology in BN patients who
      have received six weeks of standard pharmacological treatment with fluoxetine 60 mg/day or
      its equivalent and had a partial response but are not in symptomatic remission.
