  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to determine whether having a telephone discussion with a nurse
      educator about making treatment decisions and participating in a clinical trial increases
      trial participation.

      The investigators hypothesize that the participants in the intervention group will be more
      likely to take part in a clinical trial than those in the usual care group.

    <description>The intervention is comprised of a letter introducing patients to the idea of participating in a clinical trial as a possible treatment option, followed by a telephone call by a nurse educator who describes the clinical trials process and answers any questions patients may have. The nurse educators will use a tailored counseling protocol that will enable them to conduct an assessment of patients' understanding about and interest in clinical trials and tailor messages according to patient health literacy and language. The protocol will consist of both proactive and reactive counseling. The nurse educator will have a general list of topics to cover but will tailor the discussion and information provided to individual patients' questions and desire for particular types of information.</description>
