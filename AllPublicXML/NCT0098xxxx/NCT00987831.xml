  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hypothesis: A reason for repeated disappointing outcomes of clinical trials testing targeted
      immune biologics for lupus may be the heterogeneity of the disease, exacerbated by the
      variable effects on immune homeostasis of the background medications that must be continued,
      in most study designs, in these flare-prone patients.

      Purpose of Study: This study was designed to purposefully study a population equivalent to
      the placebo group of typical trials in SLE. In Group A patients entered the trial in
      mild-moderate flare, were treated with depomedrol, and any background immune suppressants
      withdrawn. Biomarkers at entry on various medications can be compared to biomarkers after
      steroid efficacy with background immune suppressants withdrawn. Depomedrol usually wears off
      over one to three months. Patients were closely observed, with serial biomarkers drawn at
      monthly intervals or immediately at the time of a new flare. Those patients developing new
      flares donated blood samples, were immediately treated as deemed appropriate, exiting the
      study. Group A was designed for up to 50 patients and recruited a total of 41. An additional
      group of 62 SLE patients donated blood once without additional interventions in order to
      increase the power of exploratory cross-sectional biomarker analysis on different immune
      suppressants (Group B). A control population of matched, healthy individuals donated blood
      twice for the same biomarker studies to validate these assays (Group C).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Original Protocol for Group A: Patients with at least a SLEDAI score of 6 or a BILAG score of
      B in at least two organ systems or A in at least one organ system were immediately entered
      into this study once informed consent was obtained. Background immune suppressants (if any)
      were stopped and in about half of the patients hydroxychloroquine was also stopped. All
      patients immediately received a shot of depomedrol 160 mg IM. Over the next two weeks they
      could elect up to three more shots of depomedrol for a total of four shots by the two week
      visit period. A complete battery of blood tests to assess lupus disease was drawn at the
      screening visit, and monthly thereafter. Exploratory biomarker studies were drawn as often as
      weekly for some markers and as often as three times in the study (landmark visits) for
      others. Protocol Changes during course of study: Biomarkers were drawn at Day zero, week 2
      week 4 and monthly thereafter until flare. Patients who did not improve with protocol steroid
      treatments were withdrawn from Group A and immediately treated as warranted. Since there was
      no protocol-defined improving visit, they could not continue the protocol until flare.
      However their baseline samples were appropriate for study as part of Group B (see below).

      Landmark visits for Group A are defined as: 1.) screening (pre-dose, on background meds with
      active disease) 2.) two weeks or four weeks after screening as optimal to assess a patient
      who has stopped background meds and is now maximally improved (but at least one grade drop in
      BILAG scores in all organs entered at A or B or a four point drop in SLEDAI, otherwise the
      participant is deemed a treatment failure and could not participate further in Group A. 3.)
      Flare visit on no background immune suppression defined as an increase in SLEDAI of 4 points
      from maximal improvement or one new BILAG moderate (B) score AND the investigator considers
      the condition to be a significant flare with intent to treat. Patients were (whenever
      possible) seen within 3 days for the flare visit if flare occured between monthly scheduled
      visits.

      The primary purpose of this study was to evaluate the time to flare and safety of a treatment
      withdrawal protocol in patients with active, but non-organ threatening SLE. The following
      biomarkers were obtained for exploratory analysis: cytokine panel, B Cell studies, T Cell
      studies, autoantibody profiles, epigenetic and gene expression studies and flow cytometry
      studies.

    <description>Group A only: patients on immunosuppressive treatments had them withdrawn at baseline. All patients were allowed up to 160 mg depomedrol at baseline which could be repeated within two weeks up to a total of 4 shots maximum or until satisfactory improvement. Time to flare was calculated from baseline. moderate disease at baseline was defined as up to 3 BILAG B (moderate disease) organ scores, no BILAG A (severe disease) score and a SLEDAI &lt;/= 10. Severe disease required &gt;3 BILAG B, OR at least one BILAG A OR SLEDAI &gt; 10 or meeting criteria for a severe flare on the SELENA SLEDAI flare index. At baseline 25 patients with moderate disease. 16 patients had severe disease. Note: severe rash with A on BILAG is only SLEDAI=2, explaining some discrepancies in measures</description>

    <description>In Group A SLE patients enter with active disease. Any immune suppressant (e.g. methotrexate, azathioprine or mmf) is withdrawn and after blood drawing, depomedrol up to 160 mg IM is given. This may be repeated for a maximum of 160mg up to four times total in the first two weeks. Depomedrol is expected to last 1-3 months, serial biomarkers will be drawn until time of flare, at which time biomarkers will be drawn, patient is defined as meeting endpoint and new treatment initiated. Patients may elect to continue to donate blood samples per protocol up to one year.</description>

      <time_frame>Adverse events were collected until end of study participation (ranging one visit to 12 months) Note all patients in Group A who flared were treated and followed up within six weeks and all improved again on new treatments initiated at the time of flare.</time_frame>
      <desc>This was an interventional study using depomedrol which is a commonly used treatment in our clinic. The main safety issue in the study was the withdrawal of background immune suppressants.</desc>

          <title>Group A Medication Withdrawal, Depomedrol, Prospective Follow-</title>
          <description>When depomedrol was given, any immune suppressant being taken (e.g. aza, mmf, mtx) was stopped and biomarkers studied before and after this change. Depomedrol was expected to last 1-3 months, serial biomarkers were drawn until time of any flare, designated as end of study. Patients could elect to continue to donate blood samples per protocol up to one year. Of 41 patients who improved after depomedrol and could complete Group A, 40 flared at or before the six month visit. One patient continued for one year and did not flare. This study design allowed the comparison of 40 patients flaring at baseline on or not on background immune suppression vs themselves serving as their own control flaring later....not on immune suppression.</description>

          <description>We amended protocol with IRB approval to include more patients in this group and ended up recruiting a total of 62. This was to allow enrichment of a cross sectional study of biomarkers related to the different background immune suppressants used in Group A at baseline. By combining baseline samples from Group A and Group B data we had a total of 103 lupus samples to study cross sectionally comparing impact of methotrexate, mmf, azathioprine or no IS on a range of biomarkers.</description>
