      The objective of the study is to compare the efficacy of intranasal oxytocin versus
      intranasal placebo to improve anxiety symptoms in patients with a variety of anxiety
      disorders.

      Anxious patients treated with even the best currently available anti-anxiety drugs continue
      to experience significant symptoms.

      A variety of basic science, animal studies, and human studies support the idea that the
      neuropeptide oxytocin may be effective against anxiety in humans. For example, plasma
      oxytocin levels may function as an index of central serotonin (5-HT) function in human
      subjects, and serotonin is well-known to be involved in clinical anxiety disorders. Since
      oxytocin is released directly from limbic-hypothalamic cells, this response presumably
      represents a direct central assessment of 5-HT response in limbic-hypothalamus (Lee 2003). In
      animal models, Ring 2006 examined the effects of oxytocin on both behavioral and autonomic
      parameters of the anxiety response in male mice using three pharmacologically validated
      preclinical models of anxiety: the four-plate test (FPT), elevated zero maze (EZM), and
      stress-induced hyperthermia (SIH). The results from this study provide specific behavioral
      and autonomic evidence of anxiolytic-like effects for oxytocin. In primates, Emiliano et al
      2007 found support for the idea that that SSRIs' therapeutic effects on social affiliation
      and anxiety may be mediated in part through components of the oxytocin system. Human studies
      include Kosfeld et al (2005), who demonstrated that oxytocin administered intranasally to
      healthy human subjects in a double-blind, placebo controlled study increased levels of trust.
      As well, Kirsch et al (2005) showed that intranasal oxytocin reduced activation of brain
      circuits involved in fear in human subjects. Finally, Scantamburlo (2007) showed a
      significant negative correlation between oxytocin and the scored symptoms depression and
      anxiety. These studies clearly suggest the potential utility of OTR agonism as a
      therapeutically relevant mechanism of action for novel anxiolytics in both sexes.

      Each subject will be enrolled for 6 week treatment period after a screening phase. Study
      procedures involve weekly clinic visits as an outpatient. Forty patients will be randomly
      assigned to either 40 International Units (IU) oxytocin twice daily or vehicle placebo. After
      3 weeks, treatments will be crossed over such that subjects that received oxytocin will
      receive placebo and vice versa. The study ratio is 1:1. Dose of oxytocin is based upon
      previous studies in humans showing improvement in psychiatric populations related changes in
      behavior and brain function (Kosfeld et al, 2005; Kirsch 2005; Heinrich M 2003).

      The total study duration for each individual subject will be approximately 7 weeks, which
      includes up to 21-day screening/wash-out period, a baseline (randomization) visit, three week
      treatment period, 1 week washout, baseline, and three weeks cross over treatment.

             Disorders-Modified-Patient Edition (SCID).

          2. HAM-A total score ≥15 with Item 1 (anxious mood) and Item 2 (tension) scores ≥2 at
             randomization.

          3. Have a Clinical Global Impressions-Severity (CGI-S) scale score of at least 4
             (moderately ill) at baseline;

          4. Must be able to communicate effectively with the investigator and study coordinator
             and have the ability to provide informed consent.

          5. Must demonstrate an acceptable degree of compliance with medication and procedures in
             the opinion of the investigator

          7. Laboratory results, including serum chemistries, hematology, and urinalysis, must show
             no clinically significant abnormalities (clinically significant is defined as
             laboratory values requiring acute medical intervention, indicating a serious medical
             illness, or requiring further medical evaluation in the judgment of the investigator).
             In addition, there must be no clinical information that, in the judgment of a
             physician, should preclude a subjects' participation at study entry.

          8. Must be able to use nasal spray

          9. Must be able to communicate effectively with the investigator and study coordinator.

         10. Patients may be taking a variety of medications for anxiety at the time of enrollment,
             or may be receiving no medication treatment, but must be stable on their particular
             regiment for 3 weeks. If the subject is in the process of changing medications,
             enrollment will be deferred

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Are pregnant or are breastfeeding

          2. A urine drug screen at screening that is positive for recent use of illegal drugs or
             alcohol

          3. Any active medical condition that in the opinion of the investigator will interfere
             with the objectives of the study

          4. For any reason the investigator considers the subject to be an unsuitable candidate to
             receive Oxytocin or believes the subject would be non-compliant with taking the study
             drug or study procedures.

          5. Subjects with a score greater than 1 on question #3 &quot;Suicide&quot;. suicidal is excluded.

          6. Subjects with a total score greater than 17 on the 21 item scale, HAMD, are excluded
             from participating.

          7. Subjects with a diagnosis of Obsessive Compulsive Disorder, a psychotic disorder,
             bipolar disorder, or with substance abuse or dependence in the prior 6 months will be
             excluded.
