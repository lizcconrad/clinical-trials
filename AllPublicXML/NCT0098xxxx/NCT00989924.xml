      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the correlation among magnetocardiography (MCG)
      patterns and various known cardiovascular risk factors.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      It is well understood that diabetes mellitus (DM) causes various micro- and macrovascular
      complications. Among them, coronary heart diseases (CHDs) claim most mortality, and diabetes
      has been considered as &quot;CHD equivalent&quot;. Furthermore, the risk of CHD has been noticed to
      increase in the pre-diabetic stage, suggesting the development of CHD may start in a rather
      early stage of the disease. Thus, early detection of CHD in diabetic patients seems to be
      important. However, currently exam methods for CHD in diabetic patients seemed to have their
      limitations.

      Developed in the 1960s, magnetocardiography (MCG) is designed to detect the weak magnetic
      field generated by the electrical activity of the heart, and has been used widely in the
      study of fetal cardiac electrophysiology, arrhythmia and ischemic heart disease. However, the
      MCG pattern in diabetic patients is not fully understood. The aim of the study is to clarify
      the correlation among various cardiovascular risk factors and MCG pattern in diabetic
      patients. And, according to the results of the study, we'll evaluate the potentiality of MCG
      in early diagnosis of CHD in diabetic patients.
