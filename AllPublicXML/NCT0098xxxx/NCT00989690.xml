      RATIONALE: Studying the proteins expressed in samples of blood and tissue from patients with
      cancer may help doctors identify biomarkers related to cancer. It may also help doctors
      predict how patients will respond to treatment.

      PURPOSE: This randomized phase III trial is studying blood and tissue samples in predicting
      response to second-line therapy using erlotinib hydrochloride or chemotherapy in patients
      with advanced non-small cell lung cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  To evaluate the predictive value of proteomic profiling on the effect of second-line
           therapy with erlotinib hydrochloride vs standard chemotherapy (pemetrexed disodium or
           docetaxel) in patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer.

        -  To assess the role of other known tissue-based predictive markers (e.g., EGFR-gene copy
           number, EGFR-protein expression, pAkt, pMAPK, EGFR mutations, EMT markers, and k-Ras
           mutation).

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to smoking status,
      performance status, proteomic profile, and participating center. Patients are randomized to 1
      of 2 treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive standard chemotherapy with pemetrexed disodium, docetaxel, or
           another standard drug.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive standard non-chemotherapy treatment with erlotinib
           hydrochloride.

      Serum is collected after failure of first-line therapy for proteomic analysis by
      matrix-associated laser desorption/ionization-time of flight. Tissue and blood samples are
      collected periodically for analysis including EGFR based on IHC and FISH, EGFR and k-Ras
      mutations, pAkt, pMAPK by IHC, and EMT markers based on IHC and breath condensate protein
      profile.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 2 months.
