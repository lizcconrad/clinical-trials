  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Some patients who need kidney transplants have high levels of antibodies that make them
      incompatible with most potential deceased donor kidney offers. These patients are considered
      highly-sensitized and are very difficult to transplant because the likelihood that they will
      receive a compatible organ is very low. There are some medications and procedures that can
      decrease the antibody levels and this can increase the chance of finding a compatible donor
      for these patients. In this study the investigators will give two medications (IVIg and
      Rituximab) to highly-sensitized patients who are on the waiting list for a deceased donor
      kidney transplant. After the investigators administer these medications, the investigators
      will continue to check for compatibility as organ offers are received. If a compatible organ
      offer is received, the investigators will perform the transplant using that organ. The
      investigators hypothesize that these medications will lower antibody levels and increase the
      chance that a these patients are able to receive a compatible kidney transplant.
