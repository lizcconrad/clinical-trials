      To assess safety and toleration, systemic exposure and anti-scarring potential of intradermal
      avotermin (Juvista) in young females.

    <textblock>
      Subjects were to receive two 1cm incisions on the upper, inner aspect of each arm (four
      wounds per subject).

      On Day 0 all subjects received intradermal Juvista at a concentration of 50ng/100ul to one
      incision site on Arm 1 and 5ng/100ul to one incision site on Arm 2. The other incision sites
      were injected with placebo. Following injection, 1cm incision wounds were made at each site.

      On Day 1 all subjects were re-injected with 100ul/cm intradermal Juvista or placebo to each
      side of the wound (200ul per incision) at the same concentration as for Day 0 (50 or
      5ng/100ul).

      At month 6 all incision sites were excised for histological analysis and all excision sites
      injected with Juvista. Both sites on Arm 1 received 50ng/100ul/linear cm wound margin and
      both sites on Arm 2 received 5ng/100ul/linear cm wound margin. No excision sites received
      placebo.

      The appearance of excision scars was then assessed after 2, 4 and 6 months of healing i.e at
      months 8, 10 and 12 of the study.
