  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Refractory acute leukemia (AL) occurs in a significant percentage of the AL patients and
      presents a therapeutic challenge. Allogeneic stem cell transplantation (allo-SCT) is the only
      curative option for these patients. Although many of the patients with refractory AL that
      undergo myeloablative SCT initially achieve complete remission, most relapse later on, and
      the long-term disease free survival is poor. In order to achieve better leukemic control,
      most transplant centers employ post transplant early withdrawal of the anti-GVHD
      immunosuppression; hence exposing the patients to high risk of GVHD associated morbidity and
      mortality. This study will try to address this common scenario, namely early and late
      relapse. The investigators will try to attain better leukemic control by re-inducing the
      patients, 6 weeks after the 1st transplant with further myeloablative treatment (busulfex and
      thiotepa) followed by allogeneic stem cell support (transplant II).

      The effects of feasibility oExperimental design and methods f allo-allo tandem matched stem
      cell transplantation (AATT) in patients with refractory leukemia will be evaluated in a
      clinical setting. The current study is limited only for patients with refractory disease that
      received and failed up to 2 lines of salvage therapy, in good performance status and younger
      than 50 years old. Only patients that will achieve complete remission after transplant I,
      will have no major organ dysfunction and with acceptable performance status, will be treated
      with transplant II. Close monitoring with strict stopping rules including in case of excess
      transplant related morality, acute or chronic GVHD or graft failure will be employed.

      Treatment schedule:

      15 patients (divided into 2 cohorts, see below) with matched family member or unrelated donor
      will be included in single arm open phase I/II trial.

      Conditioning protocol:

      All patients will be prepared by the same sequential conditioning protocols:

      Transplant I: Cy-TBI followed by Transplant II: Busulfan-thiotepa.
