      To examine the efficacy and safety of total skin electron beam therapy to a dose of 12 Gray
      (TSEBT 12 Gy) in patients who have mycosis fungoides (MF) staged as IB to IIIA.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Total skin electron beam therapy will be administered in the Department of Radiation Oncology
      according to the Stanford six-field technique. Patients will receive a planned total skin
      dose of 12 Gy fractionated at 2 Gy/cycle (each cycle requiring 2 days of treatment) 4 days
      each week, for 3 weeks. Supplements will routinely be applied to the perineum and soles as
      well as any other &quot;shadowed&quot; sites involved by disease, such as the inframammary regions (1-2
      Gy fractions to a total dose of 12 Gy). Discrete tumors may receive additional &quot;boost&quot;
      treatment not to exceed 12 Gy. During the course of TSEBT patients will be evaluated weekly
      in the Department of Radiation Oncology for determination of adverse events and toxicity
      grading according the NCI Common Toxicity Criteria (CTC) Version 3.0.

      A baseline evaluation will occur on the first day of TSEBT at which time the following
      procedures will be performed: (This visit may be waived if TSEBT is initiated within one week
      of the screening visit AND there is no clinical evidence of disease progression). After the
      completion of TSEBT, patients will be followed every 4 weeks until 24 weeks , and then every
      8 weeks for a total of 12 months or until there is disease progression, relapse, or the
      initiation of a new anti-cancer therapy. Patients who withdraw during the treatment period
      due to intolerance to radiotherapy will be followed weekly until toxicities have reverted to
      Grade ≤ 2 or has stabilized in the opinion of the Investigator, at which point a final visit
      will be scheduled. A final visit should be attempted for all patients who are lost to
      follow-up.

During a clinic visit, the Investigator or co-Investigator will explain the study to the potential subject verbally, and will allow the potential subject ample opportunity to ask questions.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>Patients will undergo the following procedures during the screening period: Medical Hx, H&amp;P, Severity Weighted Assessment Tool (mSWAT) assessment, simulation/set-up for TSEBT, CT if needed, pruritus, hair, and nail assessment, standardized photos (global, nails, head: top, front, sides, back), and two 5 mm punch biopsies from an active MF lesion.</pre_assignment_details>
