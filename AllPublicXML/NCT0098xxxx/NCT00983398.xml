    <textblock>
      This phase I/II trial studies the side effects and best dose of melphalan when given together
      with carboplatin, mannitol, and sodium thiosulfate, and to see how well they work in treating
      patients with recurrent or progressive central nervous system (CNS) embryonal or germ cell
      tumors. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as melphalan and carboplatin, work in different ways
      to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from
      dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Osmotic blood-brain barrier disruption (BBBD)
      uses mannitol to open the blood vessels around the brain and allow cancer-killing substances
      to be carried directly to the brain. Sodium thiosulfate may help lessen or prevent hearing
      loss and toxicities in patients undergoing chemotherapy with carboplatin and BBBD. Giving
      melphalan together with carboplatin, mannitol, and sodium thiosulfate may be an effective
      treatment for recurrent or progressive CNS embryonal or germ cell tumors.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of intra-arterial (IA) melphalan given with
      IA carboplatin, osmotic BBBD and delayed intravenous (IV) sodium thiosulfate (STS) in
      subjects with recurrent or progressive embryonal and germ cell tumors of the CNS. (Phase I)
      II. To estimate the response rate in subjects with recurrent or progressive CNS embryonal and
      germ cell tumors treated with IA carboplatin, IA melphalan, osmotic BBBD and delayed IV STS.
      (Phase II)

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To describe 2-year progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) rates in
      subjects with recurrent or progressive CNS embryonal and germ cell tumors treated with IA
      carboplatin, IA melphalan, osmotic BBBD and delayed IV STS. (Phase II) II. To describe
      neuropsychological and audiology outcomes in subjects with recurrent or progressive CNS
      embryonal and germ cell tumors treated with IA carboplatin, IA melphalan, osmotic BBBD and
      delayed IV STS. (Phase II) III. To describe the overall toxicity of IA carboplatin and IA
      melphalan in conjunction with osmotic BBBD and delayed STS chemoprotection in subjects with
      recurrent or progressive CNS embryonal or germ cell tumors. (Phase II)

      OUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose-escalation study of melphalan followed by a phase II study.

      Patients receive mannitol IA over 30 seconds, melphalan IA over 10 minutes, and carboplatin
      IA over 10 minutes. Patients then receive sodium thiosulfate IV over 15 minutes at 4 and 8
      hours after carboplatin. Treatment repeats every 4-6 weeks for up to 12 courses in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 1 year,
      every 6 months for 1 year, and then annually for 3 years.

             suspect she is pregnant while participating in this study, she should inform her
             treating physician immediately

          -  For the phase II portion of the study, subjects must have disease that is evaluable
             for response; subjects who have had radiation to all sites of disease are not eligible
