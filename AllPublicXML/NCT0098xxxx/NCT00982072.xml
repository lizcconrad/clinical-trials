      The purpose of this study is to compare the effectiveness of tacrolimus (prograf) versus
      prednisolone for the treatment of nephrotic syndrome secondary to minimal change disease.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Minimal change disease is a common cause of nephrotic syndrome in adults. Standard treatment
      is with high dose steroids which is often effective in controlling the nephrotic syndrome but
      has a high morbidity due to the side effects of the steroids. There is also a high relapse
      rate,therefore many patients require long term steroid therapy to control their disease which
      has significant morbidity and mortality. Some patients are or also become steroid resistant.
      There are studies showing the effectiveness of alkylating agents such as cyclophosphamide but
      the use of these drugs is limited by their toxicity, including increased rates of infection,
      cancers and infertility.

      Tacrolimus (prograf) is a T-cell specific calcineurin inhibitor that shares similar
      immunosuppressive actions with cyclosporine A.In other glomerular diseases such as focal
      segmental glomerulosclerosis and membranous glomerulonephritis, prograf has been shown to be
      a very effective treatment for proteinuria. This may be due to the immunomodulatory effects
      on the underlying disease, but there may also be a direct effect of tacrolimus (prograf) on
      the podocyte, stabilising the actin cytoskeleton and therefore decreasing protein
      leak.Therefore tacrolimus (prograf) is likely to be effective in reducing proteinuria in
      minimal change disease.It has also been shown to have a good side effect profile when used to
      allow the avoidance of steroids in transplantation.This study aims to prospectively study if
      tacrolimus (prograf) is effective as treatment for minimal change disease compared with
      standard therapy with steroids, and whether it has advantages in terms of side effect profile
      and prevention of relapse.
