    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the ability of a sample of uterine muscle tissue to
      contract in the presence of various drugs. The drugs studied are typically used to contract
      the uterus when a pregnant patient continues to bleed after delivery. Amongst the uterotonic
      drugs (used to contract the uterus), namely oxytocin, ergonovine and carboprost, the most
      effective one to use is not known.

      The investigators will be testing uterine muscle samples in the presence of these drugs at
      various concentrations, to see what their contractility measures over time, as compared with
      a control sample, in which no drugs will be applied.

      Postpartum hemorrhage (PPH) is a major cause of maternal mortality and morbidity. In 80%
      cases of PPH, the primary cause is failure of the uterus to contract after delivery of the
      baby, which then requires further treatment of the mother with uterotonic drugs (drugs used
      to contract uterus and thus prevent bleeding).

      Patients participating in this study will be asked to donate a very small sample of uterine
      tissue during Cesarean section, which will be tested for the ability to contract after
      treatment with various uterotonic drugs (oxytocin, ergonovine and carboprost) in the
      laboratory. This information will help us know the effect of these drugs by comparing the
      contractile capability of the uterine tissue.
