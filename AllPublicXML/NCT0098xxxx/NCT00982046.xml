  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study was to evaluate the clinical performance of three differing contact
      lens care solutions when used in conjunction with three contact lenses.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study was conducted as three separate studies based on the contact lens brand dispensed.
      In each study, the contact lens was evaluated in conjunction with three solutions: Opti-Free
      Replenish, ReNu MultiPlus, and Clear Care. The total enrollment number of 75 represents a
      combined enrollment of the three studies, with some subjects participating in more than one
      study.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Modulus</measure>
    <time_frame>2 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Modulus is a measure of the stiffness of a contact lens material. Modulus is determined from the slope of the stress-strain curve created during tensile tests conducted on a sample of the material. Modulus is measured in mega Pascals (MPa). A higher modulus indicates a stiffer contact lens.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Bulbar hyperemia</measure>
    <time_frame>2 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Bulbar hyperemia is the injection (or redness) of the blood vessels in the tissues overlaying the white of the eye. Bulbar hyperemia is measured on a 0-4 scale, with 0=none, 1=trace, 2=mild, 3=moderate, and 4=severe. Half-grades are allowed.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Corneal staining type</measure>
    <time_frame>2 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>An ophthalmic dye is used to highlight dead or degenerated corneal epithelial cells. The type of staining is measured over the five sectors of the cornea on a 0-4 scale, where 0=none, 1=micropunctate, 2=macropunctate, 3=coalesced macropunctate, and 4=patch (1mm). The five sectors are averaged to give a single score.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Upper palpebral roughness</measure>
    <time_frame>2 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The roughness of the inner lining of the upper eyelid is measured on a 0-4 scale, where 0=uniform appearance, 1=trace, 2=mild, 3=moderate, and 4=severe. Half grades are allowed.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>High contrast visual acuity</measure>
    <time_frame>2 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>High contrast visual acuity is a measure of the clearness of vision with full room illumination. Visual acuity is measured with a computer-generated, high contrast logMAR (logarithm minimum angle of resolution) chart.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>End of day comfort</measure>
    <time_frame>2 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>As assessed by the subject as a measure of the comfort of the contact lenses at the end of an average day. End of day comfort is recorded on an 11-point scale where 0=poor and 10=excellent.</description>
