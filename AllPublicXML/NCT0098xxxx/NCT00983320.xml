      This is a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial measuring the impact of
      quetiapine on clinical and experimental measures of pain in fibromyalgia. The study also
      seeks to measure the hormonal, immunological and neurochemical correlates of clinical changes
      in time.
