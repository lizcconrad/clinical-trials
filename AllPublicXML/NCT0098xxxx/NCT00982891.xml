  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) affects at least 750,000 Canadians and is
      currently the 4th leading cause of death in Canada. Almost everyone with COPD suffers from
      shortness of breath (dyspnea) that worsens over time despite standard treatment (inhalers,
      exercise programs and oxygen). Patients and families have identified relief from dyspnea as a
      top priority for improved care. New approaches are needed for treating advanced COPD to
      lessen the burden that it places on the lives of patients and families alike. Opioid drugs,
      such as morphine, can help in COPD in many ways, including reducing dyspnea, fear and
      anxiety. Opioids are used widely in cancer for similar symptoms. However, there are
      historical biases against their use in advanced COPD (mostly due to fear of side effects when
      much higher doses than the investigators intend have been used in the past). No studies have
      assessed the value to patients of using low dose opioids in advanced COPD in addition to
      conventional treatment. The investigators are planning a study that involves recording
      interviews with about 30 patients and their partner or key family member before and after
      starting treatment with low dose morphine, to understand their experiences with using
      morphine. The investigators will also ask them to complete questionnaires about quality of
      life, dyspnea, anxiety, depression and fear. Descriptions of experiences of using morphine
      have the potential to inform patients, families, clinicians and professional societies about
      the benefits and harms of opioid use for dyspnea in the advanced stages of a common serious
      lung disease when traditional treatments often fail. The investigators will conduct the study
      in both urban (Halifax and Saskatoon) and in a rural setting (New Brunswick). The
      investigators' study of an inexpensive and widely available treatment has the potential to
      improve care and outcomes in advanced COPD for the many Canadians living and dying with this
      serious lung disease.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  We define advanced COPD as including those with severe COPD by CTS criteria (i.e.,
             severe shortness of breath resulting in the patient being too breathless to leave the
             house, or breathlessness after dressing/undressing (i.e., Medical Research Council
             (MRC) score of 5), or the presence of chronic respiratory failure (PaCO2&gt;45) or
             clinical signs of right heart failure).

          -  We will also include patients who are short of breath and stop walking after about 100
             meters or a few minutes on the level (MRC score 4) with at least one the following:

               -  BMI &lt; 21;

               -  post-bronchodilator FEV1 &lt; 30% predicted;

               -  one or more hospital admissions for acute exacerbation of COPD in the previous
                  year.

          -  MRC 4 patients will be recruited only if their baseline Chronic Respiratory
             Questionnaire - dyspnea domain (CRQ-D) score is &lt; 5, an entry criterion used in a
             Canadian RCT involving patients with advanced lung disease.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients and/or caregivers with cognitive or other difficulties that would preclude
             questionnaire completion.

          -  Inability to speak or understand English.

          -  Patients considered to be dying or with an expected survival of less than 2 months.
