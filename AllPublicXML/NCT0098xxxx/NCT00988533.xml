          -  Subject's caregiver must agree to comply with the following study restrictions:

               -  will not use any other form of lice treatment (eg, commercial,
                  community/anecdotal, or mechanical/manual) on the subject for the duration of the
                  study, unless directed to do so by study personnel.

               -  will not shampoo, wash, or rinse the subject's hair or scalp until the Day 2
                  treatment evaluation has been completed.

               -  will not cut or chemically treat subject's hair in the period between screening
                  and follow-up on Day 15.

               -  will use only study-provided shampoo on the subject for the duration of the
                  study.

               -  will follow all study instructions.

        Exclusion Criteria:

             2 weeks.

          -  Subjects or subjects' caregivers who are unable to comply with the study obligations
             and all study visits.

          -  Subjects whose caregivers do not understand the requirements for participation and/or
             may be likely to exhibit poor compliance, in the opinion of the Investigator.

             skin.

          -  Subjects with visible skin/scalp condition(s) that are not attributable to head lice
             infestation, such as an erythema score that is &gt; 2, blisters, or any other condition
             that, in the opinion of the investigative personnel or Sponsor, would interfere with
             the PK, safety and/or efficacy evaluations.

          -  Subjects with a history of allergy to ivermectin or any ingredients commonly included
             in hair products such as shampoos, hair conditioners, or styling aids.

          -  Subjects with other diagnoses that, in the opinion of the Investigator, would
             interfere with the PK, safety, and/or efficacy assessments or would preclude study
             participation.

          -  Subjects who have been treated with a systemic antibiotic within 2 weeks before
             screening.
