  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study addresses self management and maintenance of health through evaluation of a
      program of patient education in combination with physical training and with a structured
      follow-up.

      It is hypothesized that such a program will:

        1. improve quality of life, physical functioning, coping in everyday-life

        2. reduce hospitalization and (re-)admissions for patients with chronic disease, reduce
           consumption of home care services and can increase consumption of general practice and
           physiotherapy services in primary health care.

        3. improve patient satisfaction and health care providers satisfaction

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with chronically, long-lasting illness, have complex needs for treatment and care,
      which none of the service providers can fulfill on their own. Both patients and their
      relatives are in danger of experiencing severe lack of quality. Integrated care path programs
      are increasingly put into use. There is insufficient research-based documentation of the
      effect of such care paths.

      The available documentation of different integrated care paths emphasizes early mobilization
      and discharge, rehabilitation in familiar surroundings, more effective communication and
      exchange of competence between the different service providers and educational
      self-management for patients as main elements in order to expect effect.

      There are no studies that evaluate the effect of quality of life, functional skills and
      personal coping if group-based educational self management is combined with physical exercise
      and patients with different chronically illnesses participate in the same group.

    <description>The structured patient educational self - management programme consists of 6 weekly sessions à 2 hours. The educational programme will take place prior to one of the two weekly training sessions.
After the initial period of 8 weeks participants are encouraged to practicing self- management on their own for a period of 9 months. They receive,in addition to standard follow - up, an offer of extra follow - up consisting of regular contact with their group supervisors in primary health care. During the last month of the intervention year educational self - management will be offered twice and focus on themes that the participants wish to refresh.</description>
