  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cancer is the commonest cause of death in Singapore, and many cancer deaths occur in
      hospital.

      Management of cancer patients is getting more complex with constant development of new drugs,
      interventional procedures and supportive measures. Despite this, the majority of advanced
      cancer patients will die from their disease or related complications.

      There is a lack of data on the utilisation of health resources in advanced cancer patients in
      this country. In this study the investigators ask themselves how aggressive care was in the
      last 3 months of the patient's life. The investigators will be collecting data on specific
      cancer treatments, interventional procedures, and supportive measures.

        All advanced cancer patients who passed away in the National University Hospital during a
        defined 1 year period, will have a retrospective review of paper and electronic records.

        Study subjects are identified from the weekly mortality lists that are sent to the
        Department of Haemtology Oncology. We aim to include 250 patients in this retrospective
        study.
