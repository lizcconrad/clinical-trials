    <textblock>
      This is a randomized pilot study of an intervention based on principles of Cognitive
      Behavioral Therapy (CBT). This intervention is the Health Dialogue Intervention (HDI) and
      will be compared to a traditional medical model of psychoeducation known as Team Solutions
      (TS) for first-episode schizophrenia patients. Outcomes include the acceptance of HDI and TS,
      compare adherence attitudes at the end of the treatment intervention, and to compare the time
      until the first episode of nonadherence.

      Overview: Many people recovering from first-episode schizophrenia typically respond very well
      to their initial course of antipsychotic medications; however, studies indicate that
      nonadherence rates soar as high as 90% in the first year and do not improve over time. To
      date, there is no effective psychosocial intervention that improves adherence or reduces the
      adverse consequences of nonadherence after it occurs. Thus, it is imperative to develop a new
      intervention to improve medication adherence and improve clinical outcomes in patients
      recovering from first-episode schizophrenia.

      This study is to pilot an intervention specifically suited for patients with first-episode
      schizophrenia based on the principles of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT). This is to focus
      on adherence from the perspective of the patient.

      Methods: This study compares the effectiveness of a standard psychoeducation program [Team
      Solutions (TS)] to a CBT approach known as the Health Dialogue Intervention (HDI). Consenting
      patients will receive a 4 week stabilization assessment period and then be randomized to a
      prospective, random-assignment study comparing the effectiveness of TS to HDI to improve
      medication adherence of patients recovering from first-episode schizophrenia.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        There is a 2 step inclusion/exclusion criteria, the first being for assessing overall
        eligibility to enter the study, and then, for continued outpatient treatment for
        schizophrenia, schizophreniform disorder, or schizoaffective disorder.

        Inclusion criteria for entry into the Evaluation Phase:

          1. Between 16-45 years of age

          2. A provisional clinical diagnosis of schizophreniform disorder, schizophrenia, or

          4. Able to fully participate in the informed consent process

          5. The patient is judged to be an appropriate candidate for ongoing outpatient follow-up
             at the First-episode Treatment Program at the Psychotic Disorders Program at UIC

          1. Unable to understand informed consent process

          2. A history of nonresponse to prior antipsychotic trials such that long-term inpatient
