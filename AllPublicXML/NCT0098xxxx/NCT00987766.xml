      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as gemcitabine hydrochloride and oxaliplatin,
      work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by
      stopping them from dividing. Erlotinib hydrochloride may stop the growth of tumor cells by
      blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Giving gemcitabine hydrochloride and
      oxaliplatin together with erlotinib hydrochloride may kill more tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of erlotinib
      hydrochloride when given together with gemcitabine hydrochloride and oxaliplatin in treating
      patients with advanced biliary tract cancer, pancreatic cancer, duodenal cancer, or ampullary
      cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  To determine the maximum tolerated dose and the recommended phase II dose of erlotinib
           hydrochloride in combination with gemcitabine hydrochloride and oxaliplatin in patients
           with advanced biliary tract cancer, pancreatic cancer, duodenal cancer, or ampullary
           cancer.

      Secondary

        -  To describe any antitumor activity associated with this treatment regimen when given
           during the dose-escalation and expanded-cohort portions of this study.

        -  To evaluate e-cadherin, vimentin, fibronectin, amphiregulin, and Kras status in the
           tumors and assess their relationship to response.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter, dose-escalation study of erlotinib hydrochloride.

      Patients receive gemcitabine hydrochloride IV on day 1, oxaliplatin IV over 2 hours on day 2,
      and oral erlotinib hydrochloride once daily on days 3-8. Courses repeat every 2 weeks in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Tumor tissue samples are collected for biomarker and other analysis.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 30 days.
