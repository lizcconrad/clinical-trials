        <title>Number of Participants With Tolerability Assessments Resulting in Adverse Events From Baseline to Week 4</title>
        <description>Number of participants with Tolerability Assessments resulting in Adverse Events from baseline to week 4. Tolerability assessments (Pruritus, telangiectasias, and stinging/burning) are evaluated on a scale from 0 - 3 (0 = None, 1 = Mild, 2 = Moderate, 3 = Severe) with 0 being best and 3 being worst. Skin atrophy and folliculitis are evaluated as absent or present. Changes in tolerability assessments that require a dose modification or concomitant medications/therapy are recorded as adverse events.</description>
