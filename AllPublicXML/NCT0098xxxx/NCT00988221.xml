  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This 3-part study evaluated the efficacy and safety of tocilizumab in patients with active
      polyarticular-course juvenile idiopathic arthritis who have an inadequate response to, or
      were intolerant of methotrexate. In Part I of the study, all patients received intravenous
      (iv) infusions of tocilizumab (8 mg/kg for patients ≥ 30kg, 8 mg/kg or 10 mg/kg for patients
      &lt; 30kg) every 4 weeks for 16 weeks. In Part II of the study, patients with an adequate
      response in Part I were randomized to receive either tocilizumab at the same dose as in Part
      I or placebo every 4 weeks for up to 24 weeks. In Part III of the study, patients received
      tocilizumab at the same dose as in Part I every 4 weeks for up to another 64 weeks. Standard
      of care therapy with or without non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID),
      corticosteroids, or methotrexate was continued throughout the study.

    <time_frame>Baseline to Week 16</time_frame>
    <description>Functional ability is assessed with the Childhood Health Assessment Questionnaire (CHAQ-DI) disability index which consists of 30 questions in 8 domains: Dressing/grooming, arising, eating, walking, hygiene, reach, grip, and activities. There are 4 possible responses to each question (0=without any difficulty, 1=with some difficulty, 2=with much difficulty, 3=unable to do). A domain score is the highest score in that domain. If aids and devices listed in the questionnaire or assistance from a person are required to perform a task, a domain score of 0 or 1 is increased to 2; if the domain score is 2 or 3, the domain score is not adjusted. To calculate the overall score, the patient must have a domain score in at least 6 of the 8 domains. The CHAQ-DI score is the sum of the domain scores divided by the number of domains that have a non-missing score and ranges from 0 (best) to 3 (worst). A higher score indicates less ability. A negative change score indicates improvement.</description>

    <measure>Percent of Patients With a Minimally Important Improvement in the Children's Health Assessment Questionnaire-Disability Index (CHAQ-DI) Score at Weeks 16, 40, 52, 80, and 104</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Week 104</time_frame>
    <description>The CHAQ-DI consists of 30 questions in 8 domains: Dressing/grooming, arising, eating, walking, hygiene, reach, grip, and activities. There are 4 possible responses to each question (0=without any difficulty, 1=with some difficulty, 2=with much difficulty, 3=unable to do). A domain score is the highest score in that domain. If aids and devices listed in the questionnaire or assistance from a person are required to perform a task, a domain score of 0 or 1 is increased to 2; if the domain score is 2 or 3, the domain score is not adjusted. To calculate the overall score, the patient must have a domain score in at least 6 of the 8 domains. The CHAQ-DI score is the sum of the domain scores divided by the number of domains that have a non-missing score and ranges from 0 (best) to 3 (worst). A minimally important improvement is an improvement ≥ 0.13 over Baseline. Patients who withdrew due to non-safety reasons are classified as non-responders.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in the Pain Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) Score at Weeks 2, 40, 52, and 104</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Week 104</time_frame>
    <description>The patient or parent/guardian, as appropriate, provides a rating of the patient's pain (also called a discomfort index) on a 0 to 100 mm horizontal scale. The extreme left end of the line represents 'no pain' and the extreme right end represents 'very extreme pain'. A higher score indicates more pain. A negative change score indicates improvement.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline to Week 104</time_frame>
    <description>A JIA ACR30/50/70/90 response is defined as a ≥ 30/50/70/90% response on 3 of 6 variables and no more than 1 of the remaining variables worsening &gt; 30%. The 6 variables are physician global assessment of disease activity (20 units minimum on a 0-100 visual analog scale [VAS]), parent/patient global assessment of overall well-being (20 VAS units minimum), number of joints (minimum of 2 worse) with active arthritis (swelling, or pain and limitation of motion), number of joints (minimum of 2 worse) with limitation of movement, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and functional ability assessed using the disability index of the Childhood Health Assessment Questionnaire (CHAQ, 30 questions, 8 domains, 0[best]-3[worst]). Patients who withdrew due to non-safety reasons are classified as non-responders.</description>

        <description>JIA ACR30 flare is defined as a ≥ 30% worsening of 3 of 6 variables and no more than 1 of the remaining variables improving &gt; 30%. The 6 variables are physician global assessment of disease activity (worsening of 20 units minimum on a 0-100 visual analog scale [VAS]), parent/patient global assessment of overall well-being (worsening of 20 VAS units minimum), number of joints (minimum of 2 worse) with active arthritis (swelling, or pain and limitation of motion), number of joints (minimum of 2 worse) with limitation of movement, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and functional ability assessed using the disability index of the Childhood Health Assessment Questionnaire (CHAQ, 30 questions, 8 domains, 0[best]-3[worst]). Patients who withdrew or who took escape medication are classified as flared. The analysis used the Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test with the stratification variables background use of methotrexate and oral corticosteroids applied at Week 16.</description>

        <description>The patient’s treating physician provides a rating of the patient’s arthritis disease activity on a 0 to 100 mm horizontal scale. The extreme left end of the line represents ‘arthritis inactive’ (ie, symptom-free and no arthritis symptoms) and the extreme right end represents ‘arthritis very active’. A higher score indicates more disease activity. A negative change score indicates improvement.</description>

        <title>Percent Change From Baseline in the Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis (JIA) American College of Rheumatology (ACR) Component Score Functional Ability at the End of Part I of the Study (Week 16)</title>
        <description>Functional ability is assessed with the Childhood Health Assessment Questionnaire (CHAQ-DI) disability index which consists of 30 questions in 8 domains: Dressing/grooming, arising, eating, walking, hygiene, reach, grip, and activities. There are 4 possible responses to each question (0=without any difficulty, 1=with some difficulty, 2=with much difficulty, 3=unable to do). A domain score is the highest score in that domain. If aids and devices listed in the questionnaire or assistance from a person are required to perform a task, a domain score of 0 or 1 is increased to 2; if the domain score is 2 or 3, the domain score is not adjusted. To calculate the overall score, the patient must have a domain score in at least 6 of the 8 domains. The CHAQ-DI score is the sum of the domain scores divided by the number of domains that have a non-missing score and ranges from 0 (best) to 3 (worst). A higher score indicates less ability. A negative change score indicates improvement.</description>

        <description>The JADAS-27 is derived from the following components: Physician’s global assessment of disease activity on a 0-100 mm visual analog scale (VAS)/10, patient/parent’s global assessment of overall well-being on a 0-100 mm VAS/10, normalized erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) (if ESR is ≤ 20 then set to 0, if ≥ 120 then set to 10, and if &gt; 20 and &lt; 120 then apply formula [ESR-20]/10), and number of joints (maximum of 27) with active arthritis (cervical spine, left/right elbow, left/right wrist, left/right MCP1-3, left/right PIP1-5, left/right hips, left/right knee and left/right ankle). The scores for the first 3 components range from 0-10; the score for the final component ranges from 0-27. The overall JADAS-27 score ranges from 0-57. A higher score indicates more disease activity.</description>

        <description>The patient’s treating physician provides a rating of the patient’s arthritis disease activity on a 0 to 100 mm horizontal scale. The extreme left end of the line represents ‘arthritis inactive’ (ie, symptom-free and no arthritis symptoms) and the extreme right end represents ‘arthritis very active’. A higher score indicates more disease activity. A negative change score indicates improvement. Change from baseline was calculated using last observation carried forward imputation for missing values.</description>

        <description>The Childhood Health Assessment Questionnaire-Disability Index (CHAQ-DI), as a measure of functional ability, consists of 30 questions in 8 domains: Dressing/grooming, arising, eating, walking, hygiene, reach, grip, and activities. There are 4 possible responses to each question (0=without any difficulty, 1=with some difficulty, 2=with much difficulty, 3=unable to do). A domain score is the highest score in that domain. To calculate the overall score, the patient must have a domain score in at least 6 of the 8 domains. The CHAQ-DI score is the sum of the domain scores divided by the number of domains that have a non-missing score and ranges from 0 (best) to 3 (worst). A higher score indicates less ability. A negative change score indicates improvement. Change from baseline was calculated using last observation carried forward imputation for missing values.</description>

        <description>The patient or parent/guardian, as appropriate, provides a rating of the patient’s pain (also called a discomfort index) on a 0 to 100 mm horizontal scale. The extreme left end of the line represents ‘no pain’ and the extreme right end represents ‘very extreme pain’. A higher score indicates more pain. A negative change score indicates improvement. Change from baseline was calculated using last observation carried forward (LOCF) imputation for missing values. The analysis was adjusted for the randomization stratification factors background use of methotrexate and background use of oral corticosteroids, and the pain visual analog scale score at Baseline. The adjusted means from the fitted model are presented.</description>

        <description>A JIA ACR30/50/70/90 response is defined as a ≥ 30/50/70/90% response on 3 of 6 variables and no more than 1 of the remaining variables worsening &gt; 30%. The 6 variables are physician global assessment of disease activity (20 units minimum on a 0-100 visual analog scale), parent/patient global assessment of overall well-being (20 VAS units minimum), number of joints (minimum of 2 worse) with active arthritis (swelling, or pain and limitation of motion), number of joints (minimum of 2 worse) with limitation of movement, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and functional ability assessed using the disability index of the Childhood Health Assessment Questionnaire (CHAQ, 30 questions, 8 domains, 0[best]-3[worst]). Results are reported for the subgroups: Previous biologic treatment (yes/no), concomitant methotrexate use (yes/no), rheumatoid factor (positive/negative), concomitant oral corticosteroid use (yes/no). Last observation carried forward was applied to missing components at visits.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in the Juvenile Arthritis Disease Activity Score-71 (JADAS-71) at Week 104</title>
        <description>The JADAS-71 is composed of 4 components: Physician global assessment of disease activity on a visual analog scale (VAS) (range = 0-10, left end of the line = arthritis inactive, ie, symptom-free and no arthritis symptoms; right end = arthritis very active), patient/parent global assessment of overall well-being on a VAS (range = 0-10, left end of the line = very well, ie, symptom-free and no arthritis disease activity; right end = very poor, ie, maximum arthritis disease activity), normalized erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) (range = 0-10, If ESR is ≤ 20 mm/h, set to 0. If ≥ 120 mm/h, set to 10 mm/h. If &gt; 20 mm/h and &lt; 120 mm/h, apply formula: [ESR − 20 mm/h]/10 mm/h), and a count of active arthritis (swelling present or pain present and limitation of motion) in 71 selected joints (range=0-71). The JADAS-71 is the sum of the 4 component scores and ranges from 0-101. A higher score indicates more arthritis disease activity. A positive change score indicates improvement.</description>

        <title>Percent Change From Baseline in the Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis (JIA) American College of Rheumatology (ACR) Component Score Functional Ability at Week 104</title>
        <description>Functional ability is assessed with the Childhood Health Assessment Questionnaire (CHAQ-DI) disability index which consists of 30 questions in 8 domains: Dressing/grooming, arising, eating, walking, hygiene, reach, grip, and activities. There are 4 possible responses to each question (0=without any difficulty, 1=with some difficulty, 2=with much difficulty, 3=unable to do). A domain score is the highest score in that domain. If aids and devices listed in the questionnaire or assistance from a person are required to perform a task, a domain score of 0 or 1 is increased to 2; if the domain score is 2 or 3, the domain score is not adjusted. To calculate the overall score, the patient must have a domain score in at least 6 of the 8 domains. The CHAQ-DI score is the sum of the domain scores divided by the number of domains that have a non-missing score and ranges from 0 (best) to 3 (worst). A negative change score indicates improvement.</description>

          <description>A JIA ACR30/50/70/90 response is defined as a ≥ 30/50/70/90% response on 3 of 6 variables and no more than 1 of the remaining variables worsening &gt; 30%. The 6 variables are physician global assessment of disease activity (20 units minimum on a 0-100 visual analog scale [VAS]), parent/patient global assessment of overall well-being (20 VAS units minimum), number of joints (minimum of 2 worse) with active arthritis (swelling, or pain and limitation of motion), number of joints (minimum of 2 worse) with limitation of movement, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and functional ability assessed using the disability index of the Childhood Health Assessment Questionnaire (CHAQ, 30 questions, 8 domains, 0[best]-3[worst]). Patients who withdrew due to non-safety reasons are classified as non-responders.</description>
