  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes need regular insulin injections or continuous
      insulin delivery with an insulin pump in order to keep blood sugar levels normal. The
      investigators know that keeping blood sugars in the normal range can prevent long term
      diabetes complications involving the eyes, kidneys and heart. However, achieving treatment
      goals can be very difficult as the tighter the investigators try to control blood glucose
      levels, the greater the risk for the young person to develop symptoms and signs of low
      glucose levels (hypoglycaemia). This is a particular problem at night. One solution is to
      develop a system whereby the amount of insulin injected is very closely matched to the blood
      sugar levels on a continuous basis. In a closed loop system, for example, a continuous
      glucose sensor communicates with a computer algorithm which drives an insulin pump. The
      investigators have been developing such a system in Cambridge over the last year with funding
      from the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation. The investigators have found that this system
      is very effective at preventing hypoglycaemia in young people with diabetes.

      Until now the information from the sensor has been entered manually into the computer and the
      pump settings have also been changed manually. The investigators now need to move onto the
      next step which is to fully automate the system. The studies will be done in a clinical
      research facility. The investigators will study the young people on two nights in order to
      find out if the closed loop system started early in the evening is as effective as when it is
      started later before sleep. 12 young people will be recruited from diabetes clinics in the
      East Anglia region. The studies will provide further important information concerning the
      safety, efficacy and utility of closed loop systems.

             medical care.

          -  The subject is between 6 and 18 years of age (inclusive).

          -  The subject has type 1 diabetes, as defined by WHO for at least 6 months or confirmed
             C-peptide negative.

          -  The subject will have been on insulin pump for at least 3 months

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Non-type 1 diabetes mellitus including those secondary to chronic disease

          -  Any other physical or psychological disease likely to interfere with the normal
             conduct of the study and interpretation of the study results

          -  Taking medication likely to interfere with interpretation of the results

          -  Experienced recurrent severe hypoglycaemic unawareness (as judged by the
             investigator).

          -  Known or suspected allergy against insulin.

          -  Patients with clinical significant nephropathy, neuropathy or proliferative
             retinopathy as judged by the investigator.
