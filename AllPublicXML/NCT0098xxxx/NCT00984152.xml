  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Raltegravir not only has a unique mechanism of action, but may also have other unique effects
      on suppression of viral replication, viral reservoir, and immune reconstitution in blood and
      other important compartments. This may in part be due to the pharmacokinetics of Raltegravir
      in blood and gut tissue. Efavirenz will be the comparator antiretroviral drug in this study,
      with both drugs being used as part of a three-drug regimen with tenofovir and emtricitabine.

      The primary objectives are to determine differences in the effects of 2 anti-retroviral
      regimens, Raltegravir + Truvada versus Atripla, with respect to:

        1. Viral load in plasma, genital tract (vaginal secretions), and gut (by in situ
           hybridization).

        2. Latent viral reservoir (pro-viral DNA) in the peripheral blood and genital tract.

        3. Immune effects (CD4/CD8 immunophenotypes) in gut and PBMCs and plasma cytokine profiles.

      The secondary objective is to determine the pharmacokinetics of Raltegravir in blood and gut
      tissue; relative tissue/compartment penetration compared to Efavirenz.

      This is a phase III, prospective, randomized (1:1), multicenter, open label study comparing
      the effects of two HAART regimens:

        -  Arm A: Raltegravir 400 mg PO BID + TDF/FTC (Truvada, 300/200 mg) One PO Daily

        -  Arm B: Efavirenz + TDF/FTC (Atripla) Once PO Daily

      The following local sites: Mt. Sinai, Rush University Medical Center, Stroger Hospital,
      University of Chicago and University of Illinois will work together to enroll 10 eligible
      women meeting all eligibility criteria (5 per study arm) over a one year time period. These
      10 women will be randomized 1:1 to receive either TDF/FTC + Raltegravir or TDF/FTC +
      Efavirenz (Atripla). There will be 2 baseline evaluations prior to initiation of study
      therapy. Subjects will be followed for 48 weeks after initiation of study treatment.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Eligible subjects will be antiretroviral naïve (&lt; 7 days of HAART at any time prior to
             entry) with plasma HIV-1 RNA &gt; 50,000 copies/mL (obtained within 90 days prior to

          9. Contraception requirements for women who have not undergone surgical sterilization
             (e.g., hysterectomy, or bilateral oophorectomy, or bilateral tubal ligation).

         10. Female candidates of reproductive potential, who are participating in sexual activity
             that could lead to pregnancy, must agree to the following:

               -  If the regimen does not include EFV, they must agree to use at least one reliable
                  method of contraception while receiving the protocol-specified drugs and for 6
                  weeks after stopping the medications.

               -  If the regimen includes EFV, they must agree to use two reliable methods of
