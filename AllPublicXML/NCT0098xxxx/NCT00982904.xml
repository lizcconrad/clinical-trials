  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is aimed at assessing the tolerability and pharmacokinetic parameters of the
      fexinidazole in healthy volunteers. In animal models of both acute and chronic experimental
      Trypanosomiasis infections, fexinidazole shows highly promising efficacy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The present study is designed to obtain safety, tolerability and PK data after single and
      multiple oral administration of increasing doses of fexinidazole in healthy male sub-Saharan
      African subjects. This study will also assess the relative bioavailability of fexinidazole
      administered as a tablet in comparison with oral suspension, and to assess the impact of
      concomitant food intake on the relative bioavailability of fexinidazole after single oral
      dose administration.

      The study will be divided in 3 successive parts. Study Part I will be a randomized,
      double-blind, placebo-controlled, single ascending dose study with fexinidazole administered
      as an oral suspension.

      Study Part II will be a comparative bioavailability study of a fexinidazole tablet vs. the
      oral suspension and assessment of food effect, according to a three-way cross-over design.
      Clinical part will be conducted in open conditions and bioanalysis in blind conditions.

      Study Part III will be a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multiple ascending
      dose study with fexinidazole administered either as an oral suspension or as a tablet,
      depending on Part II results. Dosage regimen will be either q.d. or b.i.d., depending on Part
      I and Part II results for the unchanged drug and the metabolites. Treatment duration will be
      14 days.

      Bioanalysis will be performed in open conditions for Study Part I and Study Part III.
