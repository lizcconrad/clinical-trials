          <description>Response defined as a &gt;= 50% reduction from baseline in MADRS total score. MADRS is a 10-item instrument used for the evaluation of depressive symptoms. Each item is rated on a scale of 0 to 6 (with higher scores indicating more severe depression). The individual item scores are added together to form a total score, ranging between 0 and 60. 0 is considered the best score, 60 the worst.</description>

        <title>Hamilton Depression Rating Scale-17 Item (HDRS) Total Score</title>
        <description>Hamilton Depression Rating Scale-17 item (HDRS) is a scale that assesses depressive symptoms. HDRS consists of 17 symptoms, each of which is rated from 0 to 2 or 0 to 4, where 0 is none/absent. The total score is calculated as the sum of the 17 individual symptom scores; the total score can range from 0 to 52. Higher scores indicate more severe depression.</description>

        <description>The Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS) is a 18-item scale which measures symptoms and behaviors that are characteristic of schizophrenia. Each item is rated from 1 to 7 with higher score indicating greater severity. The total score is the sum of the 18 items, resulting in a range of scores from 18-126.
18 is considered to be the best outcome, 126 the worst.</description>
