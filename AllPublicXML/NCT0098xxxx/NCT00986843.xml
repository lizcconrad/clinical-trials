      The main objective of this study is to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of
      OratecanTM. Eligible subjects of this study are patients with histologically or cytologically
      confirmed malignant solid tumor refractory to standard therapy.

      The irinotecan hydrochloric acid (HCl) tablet is escalated and administered per body surface
      area (BSA). The dose of HM30181A 60 mg is fixed.

      The Route of administration of irinitecan and HM30181A is oral. Each cycle consists of 21
      days. Drugs are administered daily for 10 consecutive days (D1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 8, 9, 10, 11 and
      12) followed by a washout of 9 days.

      Besides the main objective, there are 3 other objectives as follows.

        1. To determine dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) of OratecanTM

        2. To characterize the pharmacokinetics of HM30181A, irinotecan and its metabolites (SN-38
           and SN-38G) following oral administration of OratecanTM

        3. To evaluate anticancer activity of OratecanTM in patients with advanced solid
           malignancies Groups of 3 patients per cohort or dose level will be treated with
           escalating doses of irinotecan in combination with a fixed 60mg dose of HM30181A.

      If 0/3 patients at any dose level experience a DLT, the dose of irinotecan will be escalated
      by 10 mg/m2 in the next dose level. If 1/3 patients at any dose level experience a DLT, the
      cohort will be expanded by 3 additional patients to 6 patients. If no additional patients
      develop DLT, the dose of irinotecan will again be escalated in the next cohort of 3 patients.
      If 2/3 or 2/6 patients develop DLT, then dose escalation will cease, and the previous dose
      will be declared the MTD.
