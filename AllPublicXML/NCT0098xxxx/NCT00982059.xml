  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The risk of colorectal cancer (CRC) is significant among cancer survivors treated with
      abdominal radiation therapy (RT). Further, CRC is once of the few cancers for which there is
      effective screening. Although some expert groups recommend early CRC screening for patients
      with prior abdominal RT, the effectiveness of early screening is unknown. It is also unknown
      if radiation-induced CRC passes through a &quot;pre-clinical&quot; phase in which precancerous polyps
      are detectable and treatable prior to becoming invasive cancers. This study will evaluate
      whether screening will detect pre-invasive colorectal polyps among survivors treated with RT.

    <textblock>
      Cancer survivors meeting the COG criteria for CRC screening will undergo colonoscopy and
      removal of colorectal polyps. Documentation of polyp number, location and pathologic
      characteristics will be made. Clinical data information will also be collected at the time of
      patient enrollment.
