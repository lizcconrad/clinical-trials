  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigation will involve a double-blind, placebo controlled, cross-over study examining
      the efficacy of armodafinil in improving neurocognitive functioning and reducing cognitive
      fatigue in MS. Patients who report MS-related cognitive difficulties and perform at least 1
      standard deviation below the mean on a brief cognitive screen will be given a thorough
      neuropsychological evaluation at two time points. Half of the patients will be randomized to
      receive a single oral dose of lactose placebo prior to the first testing session. After a
      washout period of one week, they will then receive 250mg of armodafinil prior to a second
      testing session (P/A group). The other half of patients will be randomized to receive the
      active drug first. After a washout period of one week, they will receive the placebo prior to
      a second testing session (A/P group). As plasma levels of armodafinil peak between 2-4 hours
      after administration, participants will be asked to take a single 250mg capsule 2 hours prior
      to the scheduled testing sessions.

            <groups_desc>We used a crossover design to examine whether a single dose of armodafinil would improve cognition in MS. For hypothesis testing analyses, we used a statistical approach that accounts for period (session) effects. We subtracted session 2 performance from session 1 performance on the Word Generation, yielding a difference score. We conducted an independent samples t-test with treatment order as the independent variable (A/P vs. P/A) and the difference score as the dependent variable.</groups_desc>
