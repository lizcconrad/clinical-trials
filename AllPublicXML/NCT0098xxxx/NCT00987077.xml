    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of Selective Retina Therapy (SRT) for
      treating acute idiopathic central serous chorioretinopathy (ICSC). Patients with acute
      symptomatic ICSC of at least 3 months duration were recruited. The patients were randomized
      by equal terms to SRT- (Treatment) and control group. After 3 months follow up patients of
      control group with persistence of disease activity were allocated to crossover group and
      received either SRT. Crossover group was followed up for further 3 months.

      The primary outcome measure of the study are the serial changes in Early Treatment of
      Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) letterscore and edema in optical coherence tomography
      (OCT) at 3 months. Secondary outcome measures included the proportion of eyes with complete
      absorption of subretinal fluid, leakage in fluorescein angiography and the systemic and
      ocular complications during the study at 3 months.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Idiopathic central serous chorioretinopathy (ICSC) is characterized by a serous detachment of
      the neurosensory retina in the macular region secondary to a focal or retinal pigment
      epithelial defect. Patients with ICSC, oftentimes young male adults, experience visual
      disturbances including micropsia, metamorphopsia, central scotoma, reduced visual acuity and
      loss of contrast sensitivity. Most cases of ICSC are presumed to be self-limiting and usually
      resolve spontaneously within 3 to 4 months.Nevertheless the duration of the disease is
      strongly related to the vision prognosis and reattachment within 4 months of onset is
      considered as a relevant therapeutic target because prolonged detachment is associated with
      photoreceptor atrophy.

      The therapeutic effect of focal cw laser photocoagulation has not been fully established. One
      obvious theory postulates that the beneficial effect of photocoagulation is associated with
      the establishment of a new barrier of RPE cells which subsequently reintegrate the RPE pump
      function and the integrity of the RPE as a barrier. Based on this theory, the destruction of
      tissues surrounding the RPE, in particular Bruch`s membrane, the choroid and the
      photoreceptors, would be an unwanted side effect. On the basis of this consideration
      Selective Retina Therapy (SRT), which is a innovative laser technology that selectively
      damages the RPE and spares the neurosensory retina, suggests itself as an ideal treatment for
      ICSC with focal leakage, especially if the RPE leak is located close to the fovea.

      It has been proved as safe, and microperimetry has shown that SRT does not cause
      microscotoma. SRT has already been adopted in the treatment of diverse macular diseases inter
      alia in patients with ICSC with promising performance.

    <description>Treatment was performed with the SRT-Laser system (Medical Laser Center Lübeck, Germany), which consists of a Q-switched frequency doubled Nd:YLF laser (527nm), operating with a pulse repetition rate of 100 Hz. The pulse duration (full width at half maximum) was 1.7 µs. The laser energy was transmitted via fiber to a Lumenis slitlamp allowing the application of a fixed spot size diameter of 200 µm in air. A Mainster central field contact lens with a magnification of 1.05 was used for all irradiations. Per foot switch, 30 pulses are emitted, the pulse energy was chosen by the physician up to a maximum of 370 µJ. According to the treatment protocol, prior to each treatment 5 test shots with increasing energy were applied adjacent to the vessel arcades, in each patient in order to determine the appropriate pulse energy for treatment by recording the OA-value.</description>
