  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to understand the utilization patterns of doripenem in Asia
      Pacific, including the profile of the patients treated with carbapenems.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 4, prospective, open-label, non-comparative, multicenter study to
      characterize the usage of doripenem in selected hospitals in the Asia Pacific region.
      Doripenem belongs to the carbapenem class which is a broad-spectrum antibiotic given to treat
      patients with serious infections, such as pneumonia and complicated intra-abdominal
      infections. Physicians in the selected hospital or hospital unit will refer potential
      patients to the study team. Patients will include men and women 18 years of age and older,
      hospitalized either in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) or ward, with a diagnosis of pneumonia,
      complicated intra-abdominal infections and complicated urinary tract infections. The study
      has 3 phases: a pretreatment phase with a 1-day screening/baseline visit, a treatment phase
      of 5 to 14 days, and a post-treatment phase consisting of an end-of-treatment (EOT)/early
      withdrawal visit to be conducted within 24 hours after the last dose of antimicrobial
      therapy, a test of cure (TOC) visit 7 to 14 days after EOT, a Day 28 visit, and a
      post-discharge visit 28 days after discharge from the hospital. Usage of Doripenem in terms
      of approved indications, mode of usage, duration of antibiotic therapy, and patient
      characteristics will be assessed. Safety will be assessed through monitoring for adverse
      events, serial physical examinations, and the collection of conventional laboratory data
      (chemistry panel, complete blood count with differential). Being a prospective study, patient
      data will be gathered as the patients are enrolled, starting with their present condition and
      following them until duration of the study. The study will not compare Doripenem with other
      antibiotics for the primary endpoint. One vial (500mg) of doripenem intravenously (by
      injection) every 8 hours for 5 to 14 days

    <description>APACHE II is a severity of disease classification system and the score will be determined in the participants admitted to the Intensive Care Unit upon study enrollment to help predict the risk of mortality for critically ill patients. It consists of, A: acute physiology score (APS; range, 0 to 4), B: age points (range, 0 [less than or equal to 44] to 6 [greater than or equal to 75]) and C: chronic health points (2 [elective postoperative patient] and 5 [non-operative or emergency postoperative patient]). Total APACHE II score is sum of A, B and C.</description>

It consists of, A: acute physiology score (APS; range, 0 to 4), B: age points (range, 0 [less than or equal to 44] to 6 [greater than or equal to 75]) and C: chronic health points (2 [elective postoperative patient] and 5 [non-operative or emergency postoperative patient]).
