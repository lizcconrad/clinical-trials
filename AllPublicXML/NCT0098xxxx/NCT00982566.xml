  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, single dose, open-label, multicenter crossover study to determine the
      oral bioavailability of a new ABT-263 formulation relative to that of the current ABT-263
      formulation being administered in ongoing Phase 1/2a studies. Approximately 48 evaluable
      subjects with lymphoid malignancies, including chronic lymphocytic leukemia, and solid tumors
      will be enrolled in this study.

    <textblock>
      Subjects who complete Part 1 of the study will be provided an opportunity to receive
      Formulation A under a continuous once daily dosing schedule during Part 2 of the study.
      Subjects enrolled in the second part of the study may continue to receive Formulation A under
      the continuous once daily dosing schedule for up to one year following the date of the last
      subject enrolled on study provided they continue to tolerate the drug, have no evidence of
      disease progression, and do not meet any of the protocol specific criteria for subject
      discontinuation.

         12. Subject is currently receiving or requires anticoagulation therapy or any drugs or
             herbal supplements that affect platelet function, with the exception of low-dose
             anticoagulation medications, such as heparin, that are used to maintain the patency of
             a central intravenous catheter. Note, warfarin is excluded at any dose level.
