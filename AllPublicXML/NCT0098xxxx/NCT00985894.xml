  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if an asynchronous online model of teledermatology
      can achieve similar clinical outcomes as compared to conventional in-office care for the
      management of atopic dermatitis. The investigators also aim to determine the effects of this
      online care model on patient quality of life as well as patient and physician satisfaction.

      The investigators' hypotheses include the following:

        1. Compared to in-person visits, the online care model will result in similar clinical
           improvement in atopic dermatitis disease severity.

        2. Compared to in-person visits, the online care model will result in similar improvements
           in quality of life.

        3. Providers and subjects in the online group will achieve a similar level of overall
           satisfaction as those in the in-person group.
