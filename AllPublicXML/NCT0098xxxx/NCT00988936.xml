      A Pilot Phase II Study

      The primary objective for this study is:

        -  To explore the usefulness of [F-18]RGD-K5 PET/CT to predict efficacy or early response
           to Avastin® (the anti-angiogenesis drug) plus chemotherapy treatment before the full
           course of treatment is completed

      The secondary objectives for this study are:

        -  To continue safety evaluation by collection of safety data from all patients

        -  To gain experience with [F-18]RGD-K5 PET/CT in order to improve the study design and
           conduct of future studies

      Design: An open label, non-randomized, uncontrolled, single group assignment, pilot efficacy
      study

      Duration: Screening visit (3-4 hrs), pre-treatment imaging visit of [F-18]RGD-K5 PET/CT (~
      3-4 hrs) and the standard [F-18]FDG PET/CT (~ 3-4 hrs) or diagnostic CT, followed by two
      [F-18]RGD-K5 PET/CT scans, one after the second but before the third Avastin® treatment, and
      one after the fourth but before the fifth Avastin® treatment, and a follow up standard
      [F-18]FDG PET (~ 3-4 hrs) or diagnostic CT.

      Procedures: Informed consent, collection of demographic information, medical history, blood
      labs, physical examination, vital signs, ECGs, three sets of [F-18]RGD-K5 dosing and imaging
      scans including pretreatment, early mid-treatment, and later mid-treatment, concomitant
      medication collection, adverse event monitoring, and assessment of tumor response to
      treatment

      Patients: Approximately forty (40) patients with non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer,
      metastatic breast cancer, metastatic colon or rectum cancer who will receive chemotherapy
      plus Avastin®. This allows for approximately 30 evaluable patients to complete this study at
      approximately four to eight sites internationally

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this pilot study is to examine the utility of a new molecular imaging tracer,
      [F-18]RGD-K5 to monitor treatment responses in patients scheduled to undergo treatment with
      Avastin® (Bevacizumab) plus standard chemotherapy. The changes of [F-18]RGD-K5 PET/CT image
      scans between before treatment and after both mid-treatment cycles of Avastin® (Bevacizumab)
      will be evaluated. The hypothesis for this study is that changes in the uptake of
      [F-18]RGD-K5 PET in tumors may reflect changes in the level of integrin expression and/or
      angiogenesis. This pilot study will help to define if changes in uptake of [F-18]RGD-K5 are
      an early indicator of treatment efficacy to Avastin®.
