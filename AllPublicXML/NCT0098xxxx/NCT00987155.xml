      1. Measurements of peak oxygen uptake (VO2peak) during passive leg cycling (PLC) combined
           with arm crank ergometry (ACE), leg vascular occlusion (100mmHg above systolic BP)
           combined with ACE, and FES isometric contractions combined with ACE in spinal cord
           injured (SCI). All the above mentioned parameters will be compared to Functional
           Electrical Stimulated (FES) lower extremity cycling combined with ACE (FEShybrid). The
           hypothesis is that VO2peak is significantly higher during FES hybrid cycling when
           compared to peak and submaximal PLC, leg vascular occlusion and ACE. But the values for
           VO2peak during FES isometric contractions combined with ACE is not significantly
           different from FES hybrid cycling.

        2. Comparison of sub-maximal and peak VO2 values during arm crank (ACE) and wheelchair
           ergometry (WCE) in persons with spinal cord injury. The hypothesis is that wheelchair
           propulsion due to higher energy expenditure show higher work output and VO2peak than
           ACE.

        3. Does 6 weeks of maximal strength training improve SCI subjects performance during WCE?
           WCE after 6 weeks maximal strength training is less strenuous owing to better work
           economy/ efficiency.

        4. Effect from aerobic high intensity hybrid training on stroke volume (SV) and VO2peak in
           spinal cord injured men.

      8 weeks of high intensity 4 times 4 interval training at 85-90% of peak heart rate during
      hybrid cycling. Hypothesis; VO2peak and SV will be significantly increased from training.
