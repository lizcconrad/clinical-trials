  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Aptalis' (formerly Eurand)
      pancreatic enzyme product (PEP) microtabs in pediatric participants under age 7 with cystic
      fibrosis (CF) and exocrine pancreatic insufficiency (EPI).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study sample will consist of evaluable participants, all of whom will be children younger
      than 7 years of age. Participants will receive EUR-1008 (APT-1008) Microtabs formulation. The
      study design involves a 4-day screening period, a 7-day dose stabilization period, and a
      7-day treatment period (excluding an end-of-study evaluation).

      The optimal dose of EUR-1008 (APT-1008) Microtabs, determined during the dose stabilization
      period, will be used during the treatment period. Participants are instructed to consume a
      predefined diet.
