      Primary objectives:

        -  To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of SAR103168 and to characterize the dose
           limiting toxicities (DLTs) in the proposed dose regimen

        -  To evaluate the pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of SAR103168

      Secondary objectives:

        -  To characterize the global safety profile of SAR103168

        -  To evaluate preliminary anti-leukemia activity

        -  To investigate the potential induction effect on CYP3A4 and persistence of this effect
           by using oral midazolam as a probe substrate in patients enrolled into the expanded
           cohort at the MTD

        -  To determine the metabolic pathways of SAR103168 and identify the chemical structures of
           metabolites

        -  To determine the potential impact of SAR103168 on the QTc interval in patients enrolled
           at the MTD

      Patients will receive the study drug until unacceptable toxicity, clinically significant
      disease progression, withdrawal of consent or investigator's decision, and for a maximum of 1
      year.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with refractory/relapsed acute leukemias or high-risk myelodysplastic
             syndromes with no curative option available including any of the following:

               -  Patients with de novo or secondary acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) (except acute
                  promyelocytic leukemia), meeting one of the following conditions:

               -  Refractory or relapsed AML; In case of first relapse the CR duration should be
                  less than 12 months. If the relapse failed at least one prior salvage attempt,
