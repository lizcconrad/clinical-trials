  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a 2-part study. In the first part (Part I, 8 subjects), biopsies will be obtained
      from the resection site after keloid shaving and two weeks following resection to assess and
      select biomarkers to determine the biologic effects that occur in shaved keloids. No drug
      will be administered.

      In Part II (32 patients) will be randomized to receive QAX576 or placebo. An initial drug
      infusion will be followed by shave removal of keloids 6 - 8 days later followed by two
      additional drug infusions 4 weeks apart. Two weeks following resection, punch biopsies will
      be performed to assess biomarker responses. Patients will be followed-up for 52 weeks after
      first drug administration to assess keloid recurrence (clinically and by 3D imaging), and by
      physician's and patient's cosmetic assessments, and safety.

    Negative pharmacodynamics due to lack of Interleukin-13 signature in biomarker data from Part I

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

        - Patients with two or more keloids on the trunk, upper extremities or thighs. The keloids
        must meet specified size criteria and have been present for greater than or equal to 1
        year, been stable in size and symptoms for at least 6 months.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Use of other investigational drugs at the time of enrollment, or history of
             hypersensitivity to any of the study drugs or to drugs of similar chemical classes
             (e.g. lidocaine, epinephrine, and topical antibiotics as bacitracin and neomycin).

          -  History of repeated recurrence of keloid after prior surgical removal (4-5 times
             removed).

          -  Keloids near the hands, joints, and anogenital areas as recurrence might cause
             significant problems.

          -  Any surgical or medical condition which might significantly alter the absorption,
             distribution, metabolism, or excretion of drugs, or which may jeopardize the patient
             in case of participation in the study

        Other protocol-defined inclusion/exclusion criteria may apply.
