      This open-label study will evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and effect on
      tumor growth following a single intralesional injection of PV-10 in subjects with either (a)
      hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) that is not amenable to resection, transplant or other
      potentially curative therapy or (b) cancer metastatic to the liver.

      Subject will be enrolled in one of three planned cohorts (Main Study Group, Expansion Cohort
      1 or Expansion Cohort 2).

      Main Study Group. Three initial subjects with either HCC or cancer metastatic to the liver
      will receive 0.25 mL PV-10 per cc lesion volume (Lv) to a single lesion (up to a maximum dose
      of 7.5 mL PV-10). If none of the initial three subjects experiences a new and persistent
      CTCAE Grade 3 or greater non-hematological or any Grade 4 hematological toxicity over a
      28-day follow-up interval, an additional three subjects will be enrolled and similarly
      treated with PV-10 administered at 0.50 mL per cc Lv (up to a maximum dose of 15 mL PV-10)
      provided no new and persistent Grade 3 or greater non-hematological or any Grade 4
      hematological toxicity occurs.

      Expansion Cohort 1 (EC1). Following demonstration of safety and tolerability in the Main
      Study Group, up to 48 additional subjects with cancers metastatic to the liver or with
      recurrent HCC will be enrolled into this expansion cohort. Subjects will be treated with
      PV-10 administered at 0.50 mL per cc Lv (up to a maximum dose of 15 mL PV-10). Enrollment
      will continue provided no new and persistent Grade 3 or greater non-hematological (excluding
      fatigue) or any Grade 4 hematological toxicity occurs.

      Expansion Cohort 2 (PV-10 plus Sorafenib). Following demonstration of safety and tolerability
      in the Main Study Group, up to 6 additional subjects with HCC receiving sorafenib at a dose
      that has been stable and tolerable for at least 4 weeks will be enrolled into each of two
      successive dose groups in Expansion Cohort 2.

      The first 3 subjects will be assigned to Expansion Cohort 2.1 (EC2.1) and will receive PV-10
      administered at 0.25 mL PV-10 per cc Lv (up to a maximum dose of 7.5 mL PV-10). If none of
      the initial 3 subjects experiences dose-limiting toxicity (DLT), defined as onset of any
      Grade 3 or greater non-hematological (excluding fatigue) or Grade 4 hematological toxicity
      within 28 days of PV-10 administration that is persistent for 14 days or longer, enrollment
      in Expansion Cohort 2.2 will commence. If 2 or more of the initial 3 subjects experience a
      DLT, the combination of PV-10 and sorafenib at this PV-10 dose level will be judged to be
      intolerable. If one of the initial 3 subjects experiences a DLT, an additional 3 subjects
      will be enrolled in Expansion Cohort 2.1. If none of these additional subjects experiences a
      DLT, enrollment in Expansion Cohort 2.2 will commence. If 1 or more of the 3 additional
      subjects (i.e., ≥ 2 of 6 subjects) experiences a DLT, the combination of PV-10 and sorafenib
      at this PV-10 dose level will be judged to be intolerable.

      If Expansion Cohort 2.1 has been completed with tolerable toxicity, enrollment in Expansion
      Cohort 2.2 (EC2.2) will commence at a dose of 0.5 mL PV-10 per cc Lv (up to a maximum dose of
      15 mL PV-10). If none or 1 of the first 3 subjects enrolled experiences a DLT, the cohort
      will be expanded to 6 subjects. If no more than 1 subject among 6 experiences a DLT, the dose
      of 0.5 mL PV-10 per cc Lv will be judged to be the maximum tolerable dose (MTD) for the
      study. If 2 or more of the 6 subjects experiences a DLT, the combination of PV-10 and
      sorafenib at this PV-10 dose level will be judged to be intolerable.

      If the Expansion Cohort 2.2 dose is not tolerated, Expansion Cohort 2.1 will be expanded to 6
      subjects, unless this has already occurred. If more than 1 subject of the 6 experiences a
      DLT, the Expansion Cohort 2.1 dose of PV-10 plus sorafenib will judged to be intolerable.
      Otherwise, the Expansion Cohort 2.1 dose will be the MTD for the study.

      Subjects in Expansion Cohort 1 or Expansion Cohort 2 with more than one injectable tumor ≥ 1
      cm in diameter will be eligible for treatment of an additional injectable tumor 28 days to
      120 days after prior PV-10 administration provided that any prior treatments with PV-10 were
      well tolerated. This may be repeated until all injectable tumors ≥ 1 cm in diameter have
      received PV-10.
