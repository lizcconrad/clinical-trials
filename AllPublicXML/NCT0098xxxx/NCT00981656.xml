      RATIONALE: Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to kill tumor cells. Specialized
      radiation therapy that delivers a high dose of radiation directly to the tumor may kill more
      tumor cells and cause less damage to normal tissue. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as
      cisplatin, mitomycin C, and fluorouracil, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor
      cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Giving radiation
      therapy together with cisplatin may kill more tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well radiation therapy given together with
      chemotherapy works in treating patients with stage I bladder cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  To evaluate the rate of freedom from radical cystectomy at 3 years.

      Secondary

        -  To evaluate the rate of freedom from radical cystectomy at 5 years.

        -  To evaluate the rate of freedom from the development of distant disease progression at 3
           and 5 years.

        -  To evaluate the rate of freedom from progression of bladder tumor to stage T2 or greater
           at 3 and 5 years.

        -  To evaluate disease-specific survival and overall survival.

        -  To evaluate the incidence of acute and late pelvic toxicity.

        -  To evaluate the efficacy of this treatment approach in preventing the recurrence of any
           local bladder tumor.

        -  To evaluate the potential value of tumor histopathology plus molecular genetic, DNA
           content, and urine proteomics parameters as possible significant prognostic factors for
           tumor control with this treatment approach.

        -  To collect American Urological Association symptom scores at baseline and at 3 years.

      OUTLINE: Beginning within 10 weeks of transurethral resection of the bladder tumor, patients
      undergo 3-dimensional conformal radiotherapy once daily 5 days per week during weeks 1-7 (34
      fractions). Patients also receive 1 of 2 radiosensitizing chemotherapy regimens concurrently
      with radiotherapy.

        -  Regimen I: Patients receive cisplatin IV on days 1-3 of weeks 1, 3, and 5.

        -  Regimen II: Patients receive mitomycin C IV on day 1 of radiotherapy and fluorouracil IV
           continuously over days 1-5 of weeks 1 and 4.

      Patients with a persistent tumor on re-evaluation may undergo radical cystectomy.

      Tissue, blood, and urine samples may be collected periodically for biomarker and other
      analysis.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 1 year,
      every 4 months for 1 year, every 6 months for 3 years, and annually thereafter.
