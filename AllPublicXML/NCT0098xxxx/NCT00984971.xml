  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To date, the majority of microbicide research has focused on the assessment of the safety and
      effectiveness of vaginal microbicides used for the prevention of HIV transmission via the
      vaginal compartment. Receptive anal intercourse (RAI) is common among men who have sex with
      men (MSM), and there is increasing evidence that heterosexual women in the developed and
      developing world also practice anal sex. It can, therefore, be anticipated that once vaginal
      microbicides are licensed, they will be used in both the vaginal and rectal compartments. As
      a consequence, there is a need to evaluate both the rectal and vaginal safety profile of
      candidate microbicides. Therefore, the primary objective of this study is to evaluate the
      systemic safety of 1% vaginally formulated tenofovir gel applied rectally. In addition, this
      study will evaluate the immunotoxicity of the gel and evaluate its acceptability; it will
      also use the oral tenofovir disoproxil fumarate tablets (TDF), rectally-applied tenofovir
      gel,and a placebo gel to compare their systemic and compartmental pharmacokinetic (pK)
      profiles.

      This study was designed to address the following hypotheses:

        -  Vaginally-formulated tenofovir 1% topical gel when applied rectally will be safe using a
           combination of clinical and laboratory markers including assays specifically designed to
           measure mucosal toxicity

        -  Tenofovir will be detectable at different concentrations in the various anatomic
           compartments sampled for pharmacokinetics following single and 7-day topical exposures

        -  Exposure to tenofovir 1% gel will demonstrate prevention of ex vivo HIV-1 challenge
           using in vivo drug-exposed tissue as compared to baseline tissue samples

        -  Orally delivered, single dose, 300 mg tenofovir disoproxil fumarate tablets will have
           similar safety profiles using routine blood safety indices as have been established in
           other trials and will show no mucosal safety concerns

        -  The oral dose will have different multi-compartment concentration kinetics than the
           topical tenofovir and will also demonstrate preliminary (ex vivo) prevention using the
           explant infectivity assay

        -  Vaginally formulated tenofovir 1% topical gel applied rectally will be acceptable to
           participants, as indicated by a score in the upper one third of the 10-point Likert
           scale on intentionality to use in the product in the future
