      This study is under Molecular and Cellular Characterization of Myelodysplastic Syndromes
      (MDS) (eProtocol 15369). The purpose of this proposed study is to analyze existing samples
      taken from participants participating in a clinical trial evaluating the efficacy and safety
      of investigational agent ON 01910.Na (eProtocol 16214). This study will use existing blood
      and marrow samples to determine the rate and duration of objective hematologic and marrow
      responses, and duration of progression-free survival in ON01910.Na-treated MDS patients.
