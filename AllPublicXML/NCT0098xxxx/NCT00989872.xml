  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, ascending single dose safety,
      tolerability, and pharmacokinetic study of orally administered EDP-322. This study was
      conducted at a single site. EDP-322 has a benefit to risk profile that supports testing in
      target patient populations.
