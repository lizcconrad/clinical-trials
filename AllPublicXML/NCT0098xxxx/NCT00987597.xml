    <textblock>
      The aim of the present study is to assess if a personal care program of smokers hospitalised
      for acute coronary syndrome can change the smoking habits as compared with similar patients
      in conventional care program at 6 months. The program includes a cognitive-behavioural
      approach associated with a nicotine replacement treatment presented as an obligatory non
      optional treatment. Patients are men and women of less than 70 years old hospitalised for
      acute coronary syndrome. Major exclusion criteria is the presence of another dependence. The
      program includes a cognitive-behavioural approach based on the specific technique of
      &quot;exposure&quot; and the prescription of nicotine patch considered as other usual cardiologic
      treatments for at least 6 months. The end point is the smoking habits at 6 months classified
      as: no smoking confirmed by CO measurement, smoking or doubtful (declaration of no smoking by
      the patient but a CO level &gt; 10 ppm). 72 patients in each group will be included in 2 majors
      sites.

      The cognitive behavioural approach group : This group will receive an inclusion visit at
      first, then two &quot;cigaret exposures cessions&quot; during hospitalisation. Thereafter-one week
      after he's out- the patient will come for 5 follow up visits consisting in the specific
      technique of cigaret exposure and nicotinic treatment adjustment. Then the last visit, at six
      months, will tell us if the patient is an effective non smoker or not; We'll be also
      collecting psychological and medical informations (such as the treatment, IMC, cardiovascular
      check up and psychological tests). The control group : This group is managed as &quot;usual&quot; : the
      nurse gives very rapid recommendations to the patients concerning smoking cessation.
      Nicotinic substitutes are proposed to the patients but the patient must find them by itself.
