  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Inactivation of the FAAH (Fatty Acid Amide Hydrolase) enzyme has been shown to relieve pain
      and inflammation in animal studies. PF-04457845 has been shown to inactivate the FAAH enzyme
      in animals and healthy human volunteers. The purpose of this study is to evaluate whether
      PF-04457845 can inactivate the FAAH enzyme in patients experiencing pain due to OA and
      whether this results in these patients experiencing less pain.
