      The purpose of the study is to investigate the effect of vitamin D on muscle tissue and
      physical performance.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators have recently observed that among healthy women age 65 and older who
      participated in a placebo-controlled vitamin D and calcium intervention trial, those treated
      with supplements had a lower risk of falling than those in the placebo group. Vitamin D
      receptors (VDRs) are present in muscle tissue and are thought to mediate the favorable
      effects of vitamin D on muscle performance. Vitamin D insufficiency is common particularly in
      the elderly and supplementation with a relatively high dose of vitamin D may be a useful
      approach for improving muscle performance and potentially lowering the risk of falling in
      sedentary older women and other high-risk populations.

      The investigators will aim to study women, age 65 and older, with 25(OH)D levels below 60
      nmol/l in a double-blind, 4-month randomized controlled pilot study. Eligible subjects will
      be randomized to treatment with 4000 IU per day of vitamin D3 or placebo. Blood and 24 hour
      urine will be measured at the beginning and end of the study as outlined in the intervention
      and measurement schedule below. In addition, a safety random spot urine will be analyzed for
      calcium and creatinine on day 30. Muscle performance measures will be measured and muscle
      biopsies will be performed at the beginning and end of the study.
