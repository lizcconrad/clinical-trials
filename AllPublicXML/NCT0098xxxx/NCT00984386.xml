  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate early wound healing of one application of four
      different doses of intradermal Zesteem (17β-Estradiol) in male subjects and female subjects
      two years post-menopausal.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Each subject received a total of six, 3mm punch biopsy wounds; three wounds to the upper
      inner aspect of each arm. Each punch biopsy site was randomly allocated to receive one of six
      treatments: Zesteem (0.02μg, 0.1μg, 0.2μg and 0.4μg/100μl), Placebo (vehicle), and Standard
      Care (moist wound healing dressings) only.

      Zesteem and Placebo were administered to marked, anaesthetised sites, by intradermal
      injection 10 to 30 minutes before wounding. Sites randomised to receive Standard Care only
      received no additional treatment before wounding. After wounding, all sites received moist
      wound healing dressings (Standard Care).

      Three days after wounding, all biopsy sites were anaesthetised and the wounds excised using a
      5mm punch biopsy, for histological analysis. The Investigator closed all excision sites using
      sutures and Steri-strips to achieve a cosmetically acceptable result. Subjects attended a
      post-trial follow-up visit (13-18 days after dosing) where their sutures were removed and
      final safety assessments were performed.
