  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research is to examine the effect of a broccoli sprout preparation on
      specific factors in breast tissue that are related to breast cancer risk and to assess
      whether sulforaphane a key component of broccoli sprouts increases the levels of protective
      enzymes in breast tissue. In addition, the investigators will also examine how acceptable the
      broccoli sprouts preparation is to the study participants.

    <description>Patients will be randomized to 14 day intervention of broccoli sprout extract consisting of a consistent dose of sulforaphane dissolved in mango juice compared to a placebo preparation of mango juice alone.

    <description>Women newly diagnosed with DCIS on core biopsy prior to definitive surgery will be randomized to either a prepartion of broccoli sprout extract and mango juice or a placebo preparation of mango juice alone. All women will be on a cruciferous free diet for the duration of the study (14 days) and complete a daily dietary check list. Twelve hour urine collections and blood samples will be collected at various time points during the study. Acceptability of the 14 day dose will be evaluated by monitoring indices of compliance, including urinary measurements of ITC excretion, the daily food check list and a questionnaire administered at the end of the study.</description>
