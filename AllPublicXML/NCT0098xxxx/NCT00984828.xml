      The is a randomized control study for newly-diagnosed myeloma patients 18-65 year old. All
      patients will receive 4 cycles of velcade and Dexamethasone as front-line therapy. Then
      patients will be randomized into standard group which will receive a single autologous
      hematopoietic stem cell transplantation with standard conditioning of melphalan 200mg/m2 and
      the study group which will receive single autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation
      with conditioning of melphalan 200mg/m2 + velcade followed by 3 more cycles of velcade alone
      as consolidation.

      The is a randomized control study for newly-diagnosed myeloma patients 18-65 year old.
      Newly-diagnosed myeloma patient enrolled will receive 4 cycles of velcade and Dexamethasone
      as front-line induction therapy. All patients finished the induction therapy will be
      randomized into standard group and the study group. All patients will mobilized by
      cyclophosphamide with G-CSF to collect a target of 2x106 CD34+/kg and then undergo autologous
      stem cell transplantation. For standard group, patients will receive single auto-SCT with
      standard conditioning of melphalan 200mg/m2. The patients in the study group will receive
      single auto-SCT with conditioning of melphalan 200mg/m2 added with 4 dose of velcade at
      1.0mg/m2 during the transplantation procedure and then followed by 3 more cycles of velcade
      alone as consolidation.
