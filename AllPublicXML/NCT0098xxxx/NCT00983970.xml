  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Exercise is an important component in the treatment of of child obesity and associated
      medical conditions. However, one of the strongest predictors of non-compliance from exercise
      programs in obese youth is lack of enjoyment, thus creating a more pleasurable environment,
      by using TV or video games as incentives, may be an effective way of increasing exercise in
      obese youth. The purpose of this study was to compare interactive video game stationary
      cycling (GameBike ®) with cycling to music on aerobic fitness, body composition,
      cardiovascular disease risk markers, and exercise behaviour as measured by attendance, energy
      expenditure, duration, intensity and distance pedaled in obese adolescents. Twenty six obese
      adolescents had an equal chance of being assigned to either interactive video game cycling
      (n=13) or cycling to music serving as controls (n=13). The 10-week program consisted of twice
      weekly sessions lasting a maximum of 60 minutes per session.

      Background: Energy expenditure through exercise is important for weight loss and reduction of
      medical morbidity associated with adolescent obesity. However, attrition from aerobic
      exercise programs is high in obese children as they do not tolerate it or enjoy it.
      Capitalizing on technology to use TV or video games as incentives to exercise may improve
      adherence to exercise and associated health benefits in obese adolescents.

      Objective: The purpose of this study was to compare the efficacy of interactive video game
      stationary cycling (GameBike ®) with cycling to music on aerobic fitness, body composition,
      cardiovascular disease risk markers, and exercise behaviour as measured by attendance, energy
      expenditure, duration, intensity and distance pedaled in obese adolescents.

      Method: Twenty six obese adolescents were stratified by gender and randomized to a either
      interactive video game cycling (n=13) or cycling to music serving as controls (n=13). The
      10-week program consisted of twice weekly sessions lasting a maximum of 60 minutes per
      session.

    <description>Interactive video cycling arm utilized the Gamebike that interfaced a Sony Play Station 2 with a stationary bicycle and a 42 inch flat screen TV. The Gamebike has a handle bar mounted game controller allowing the participant to play most Sony Play Station 2 raced-based video games. The Gamebike reads the participants' speed by cycling cadence and the faster the individual pedalled, the faster they moved in the virtual world on screen. Participants were asked to come to the lab for two sessions per week for 60 minutes for 10 weeks.Participants were told that they could exercise at any intensity or duration that they desired, and reading materials were provided for those who did not chose to exercise for the full 60 minute session.</description>

    <description>Each participant exercised twice weekly for 10 weeks on the Gamebike® but the games and controls were turned off. The Gamebike® was used by both groups to control for any differences between two cycle ergometers such as comfort or usability. However, participants were allowed to listen to music of their choice via radio, CD or personal music device.</description>

    <description>Participants were required to exercise on a Gamebike® (Cat Eye Electronics Ltd, Boulder Col.) interactive video gaming system that was interfaced with a Sony Play Station 2® (Sony computer Entertainment America Inc. Foster, City, CA) and a 42&quot; flat screen television monitor. The Gamebike® has a handlebar mounted game controller allowing the participant to play most Sony Playstation 2- race-based video games. The Gamebike® reads the participant's speed by cycling cadence and the faster the individual pedalled, the faster they moved in the virtual world on screen. Participants were told that they could exercise at any intensity and duration they desired. Participants were asked to come to the lab for two sessions per week for 60 minutes for 10 weeks. Although participants were required to stay in the lab for 60 minutes, they could take breaks or stop when they wanted, and reading materials were available for those who did not or could not cycle for the full 60 minute session.</description>

    <description>Each participant exercised twice weekly for 10 weeks on the Gamebike® but the games and controls were turned off. The Gamebike® was used by both groups to control for any differences between two cycle ergometers such as comfort or usability. However, participants were allowed to listen to music of their choice via radio, CD or personal music device. We incorporated music into the control condition because most youth and young adults exercise to music and this provides a more stringent test of the Gamebike® while improving the ecological validity of the research design. We also wanted to minimize drop-out and felt that expecting overweight/obese adolescents, who often report disliking aerobic exercise, to bike in a lab with no form of distraction would create a less than desirable exercise environment and result in high drop-out rates.</description>
