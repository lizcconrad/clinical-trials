  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this study is to (1) determine the maximally tolerated dose (MTD) of
      L-377202 administered once every 3 weeks, (2) evaluate the safety and tolerability of
      L-377202 including the dose-limiting adverse effects of treatment with L-377202, and (3)
      assess the pharmacokinetics of various doses of L-377202 and the plasma profile of liberated
      doxorubicin and leu-doxorubicin.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open, nonrandomized, rising-dose study in patients with hormone refractory
      prostate cancer. Patients will be treated with L-377202 once every three weeks. Plasma
      concentrations of L-377202, liberated doxorubicin, and leu-doxorubicin will be obtained at
      defined time intervals throughout the study. At least 1 patient will be treated at each dose
      level until there is evidence of greater than or equal to Grade 2 drug-related toxicity. Each
      patient will be treated at only 1 dose level, although multiple cycles may be administered
      until signs of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity are evident. Doses will be
      doubled for each subsequent cohort of patients until evidence of greater than or equal to
      Grade 2 drug-related toxicity. Upon documentation of greater than or equal to Grade 2
      drug-related toxicity, subsequent dose escalations will proceed along the modified Fibonacci
      scale and enroll at least 3 patients per dose level until 1 patient experiences dose-limiting
      toxicity (DLT).

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patient is at least an 18-year-old male and has histologically documented, progressive
             carcinoma of the prostate which is refractory to hormonal manipulation. Progressive
             disease may be documented by new lesions on bone scan, increase in radiologically
             measurable disease, or an increase in PSA (at least 50% increase from nadir confirmed
             twice and measured at least 2 weeks apart.)

          -  An appropriate interval of time has passed since alteration of any hormonal therapy
             (e.g., 4 weeks for steroids, LHRH agonists, flutamide or megestrol acetate and 6 weeks
             for nilutamide and bicalutamide).

          -  Patient has a serum PSA of 20 ng/mL or higher.

          -  Patient has an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 to 2.

          -  Patients has a life expectancy of &gt;3 months.

          -  Patient understands and agrees to participate in the study by providing written
             informed consent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patient is mentally or legally incapacitated at the time of the study or has a history
             (less than 5 years prior to entry) of drug or alcohol abuse or is currently a user
             (including &quot;recreational use&quot;) of any illicit drugs.

          -  Patient has known HIV or a known HIV-related malignancy.

          -  Patient has participated in another study (including FDA approved drugs for a non-FDA
             approved indication) of an investigational agent within the last 4 weeks.

             or chemotherapy within 4 weeks of the study. However, patients who are receiving
             thyroid replacement therapy may be included. For mitomycin or nitrosourea, there must
             be a 6-week treatment free interval.

          -  Patient has received strontium treatment within 12 weeks prior to treatment.

          -  Patient is anticipated to require immunologic therapy, radiation therapy, surgery, or

             anticoagulants may be considered on an individual basis pending discussion between the
             clinical monitor and investigator. Such patients will require more intensive
             monitoring of PT (INR) and aPTT (at least every other day).

          -  Patient has an active infection.

          -  Patient has an active (edema, progressive disease, or clinical neurologic symptoms)
             metastatic CNS lesion.

          -  Patient has received the equivalent of &gt;180 mg/m2 of doxorubicin or &gt;40 mg/m2
