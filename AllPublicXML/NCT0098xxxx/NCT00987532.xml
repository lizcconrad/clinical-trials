      The aim of this study is to test whether a parent-focused participatory intervention in
      addition to gym lessons can enhance preschoolers physical activity compared to gym lessons
      alone.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Over the last 20 years, physical activity (PA) in children has rapidly decreased in both
      developed and developing nations. More effective interventions to prevent inactivity in
      childhood thus are urgently needed. The preschool years, including the adiposity rebound
      period, might represent a good window of opportunity. Study literature suggests that
      targeting parents is crucial for lasting changes in young childrens' behavior. However, it is
      not known which methods are effective for involving parents in physical activity promotion.
      Consistent with experience from community-based participatory research, encouraging parents
      to participate the intervention in terms of content and structure might lead to higher
      intervention effectivity and sustainability. In our study, we therefore &quot;enriched&quot; a
      child-centered physical activity intervention in preschools (twice weekly gym lessons over 6
      months) with a parent-focused participatory community intervention component.

    <description>The core of the parent-focused intervention is a menu of 15 easy to realize project ideas to promote the everyday physical activity of children and families. The 15 ideas are presented to the parents and teachers via a webpage, a printed book and a film. During a face-to-face meeting, parents and teachers are guided into discussions of their own preschool environment's and community's physical activity shortcomings and encouraged to generate their own ideas of how to enhance the physical activity of their families and preschools. Over the course of three structured follow-up meetings, parents and teachers are instructed to choose maximally 3 to 4 ideas from either the menu or the network's own ideas, and then are empowered to realize and implement them together.</description>
