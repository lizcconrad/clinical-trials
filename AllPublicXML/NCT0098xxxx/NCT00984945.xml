      The primary objective is to assess the safety and tolerability of two consecutive doses of
      plant-based H5 VLP, (H5N1) pandemic influenza vaccine combined with Alhydrogel®, given 21
      days apart, at three dose levels: 5µg, 10µg and 20µg., compared to the placebo, and combined

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Male and female adults, 18 to 60 years of age

          -  Healthy as judged by the Principal Investigator (PI) and determined by medical
             history, physical examination, vital signs, screening laboratories and medical history
             conducted no more than 30 days prior to study vaccine administration

          -  BMI of ≥18 and ≤29

          -  Comprehension of the study requirements, expressed availability for the required study
             period and ability to attend scheduled visits

          -  Accessible by telephone on a consistent basis

          -  In the opinion of the Investigator, competence and willingness to provide written,
             informed consent for participation after reading the informed consent form. The
             subject must have adequate opportunity to discuss the study with an Investigator or
             qualified designee

          -  If female and capable of child-bearing, have a negative urine pregnancy test result at
             study entry and agree to employ adequate birth control measures for the duration of
             the study

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Presence of significant acute or chronic, uncontrolled medical or neuropsychiatric
             illness. &quot;Uncontrolled&quot; is defined as:

               1. Requiring a new medical or surgical treatment within one month prior to study
                  vaccine administration

               2. Requiring a change in medication dosage in one month prior to test article
                  administration due to uncontrolled symptoms or drug toxicity (elective dosage
                  adjustments in stable subjects are acceptable), or

               3. Hospitalization or an event fulfilling the definition of a serious adverse event
                  within one month prior to test article administration

          -  Any medical or neuropsychiatric condition which, in the Investigator's opinion, would
             render the subject incompetent to provide informed consent or unable to provide valid
             safety observations and reporting

          -  Any confirmed or suspected immunosuppressive condition or immunodeficiency including
             history of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection or presence of
             lymphoproliferative disease

          -  Presence of any febrile illness, oral temperature of &gt;38.0 C within 24 hours of test
             article administration. Such subjects may be re-evaluated for enrolment after
             resolution of illness

          -  History of autoimmune disease

          -  Administration of any vaccine (including any other influenza vaccine) within a 30 day
             period prior to study enrolment, or planned administration within the period from the
             first vaccination up to blood sampling at Day 42 or within 30 days prior to blood
             sampling at Day 228. Immunization on an emergency basis of a tetanus and diphtheria
             toxoids adsorbed for adult use (Td) will be allowed provided the vaccine is not
             administered within two weeks prior to test article administration. Receipt of any
             other emergency immunizations (e.g. rabies) will result in a case-by-case review of
             continued participation.

          -  Use of any investigational or non-registered product within 90 days prior to study
             enrolment or planned use during the study period. Subjects may not participate in any
             other drug study while participating in this study

          -  Treatment with systemic glucocorticoids at a dose exceeding ≥ 10 mg of prednisone per
             day, or equivalent for more than 7 consecutive days or for 10 or more days in total,
             within one month of first test article administration, or any other cytotoxic or
             immunosuppressant drug or any immune globulin preparation within three months of
             vaccination. Nasal or inhaled glucocorticoids are allowed

          -  Any significant disorder of coagulation or treatment with coumadin derivatives or
             heparin. Persons receiving prophylactic anti-platelet medications, e.g., low-dose
             aspirin, and without a clinically apparent bleeding tendency are eligible

          -  History of previous H5N1 vaccination

          -  History of allergy to any of the constituents of H5 VLP (H5N1) study vaccine,
             Alhydrogel® (aluminium hydroxide), or the phosphate buffer.

          -  History of severe allergic reactions or anaphylaxis

          -  History of tobacco allergy

          -  Have received a blood transfusion or immunoglobulins within 90 days of study entry

          -  If female, and of childbearing potential, has not been consistently using effective
             birth control for the 28 days prior to study entry. An example of highly effective
             birth control is oral contraceptives, hormone implants, abstinence (confirmed by
             Investigator), or male condom plus spermicide. All female subjects, regardless of
             birth control history must provide a urine sample for pregnancy screening. Effective
             birth control must be used for the duration of the study. The subject must have no
             plan to become pregnant during the study period. Females who are post-menopausal (no
             spotting at all) for at least two (2) years will not require a urine pregnancy test.

          -  Among female subjects, either known pregnancy or urine beta-human chorionic
             gonadotropin (ß-hCG) test results consistent with pregnancy prior to test article
             administration on Day 0

          -  Female subjects who are lactating

          -  Vital sign abnormalities: systolic blood pressure ≥150 mmHg, diastolic blood pressure
             ≥90 mmHg, resting pulse rate &lt;40 bpm or &gt;100 bpm

          -  Cancer or treatment for cancer within 3 years of test article administration. Persons
             with a history of cancer who are disease-free without treatment for 3 years or more
             are eligible. Persons with treated and uncomplicated basal cell carcinoma of the skin
             are eligible.
