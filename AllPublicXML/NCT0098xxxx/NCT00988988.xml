  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Participants are asked to be in this study because they have multiple sclerosis, are
      currently treated with glatiramer acetate (GA, Copaxone®) injections and have redness, pain,
      swelling, itching or a lump at the injection site.

      The purpose of this study is to determine if the use of ethyl-a-guanida-methyl ethanoate
      (AGEE) will decrease histamine response measured by redness, swelling, and itch response
      following subcutaneous injection of glatiramer acetate (GA) for the treatment of Multiple
      Sclerosis (MS).
