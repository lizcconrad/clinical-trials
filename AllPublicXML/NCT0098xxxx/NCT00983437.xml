    <description>The self-reported S-HAM-D6 is a validated scale developed from the core depressive items of the 17 Item Hamilton Depression Inventory (HAM-D17). The HAM-D6 (Items 1, 2, 7, 8, 10, 13 from the 17-item HAMD) evaluates &quot;core&quot; symptoms of Major Depressive Disorder (MDD). The assessment consists of 6 items representing depressed mood, guilt, work and activities, retardation, psychic anxiety, and general somatic symptoms. Each item is evaluated and scored using either a 5-point scale (e.g. absent, mild, moderate, severe, very severe) or a 3-point scale (e.g. absent, mild, marked). Total scores range from 0 (normal) to 22 (severe). Scores greater than 12 indicate moderate to severe depression. Baseline was defined as the baseline value from the double-blind study C10953/3067/ES/MN (NCT00893789) from which the participants entered into this open-label study.</description>

    <description>The participant's evaluation of excessive daytime sleepiness was measured by the ESS. The ESS score is based on responses to questions referring to 8 everyday situations (eg, sitting and reading, talking to someone, being stopped in traffic) and reflects a patient's propensity to fall asleep in those situations. The ESS score is derived from the sum of the values from questions corresponding to the 8 situations. Scores for the ESS range from 0 to 24, with a higher score indicating a greater daytime sleepiness. This test was self-administered. Baseline was defined as the baseline value from the double-blind study C10953/3067/ES/MN (NCT00893789) from which the participants entered into this open-label study.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) at Week 2 and Months 1, 2, 3, 6, 9, and Endpoint (Month 12 or Last Postbaseline Observation)</title>
        <description>The participant's evaluation of excessive daytime sleepiness was measured by the ESS. The ESS score is based on responses to questions referring to 8 everyday situations (eg, sitting and reading, talking to someone, being stopped in traffic) and reflects a patient's propensity to fall asleep in those situations. The ESS score is derived from the sum of the values from questions corresponding to the 8 situations.

          <description>The participant's evaluation of excessive daytime sleepiness was measured by the ESS. The ESS score is based on responses to questions referring to 8 everyday situations (eg, sitting and reading, talking to someone, being stopped in traffic) and reflects a patient's propensity to fall asleep in those situations. The ESS score is derived from the sum of the values from questions corresponding to the 8 situations. Scores for the ESS range from 0 to 24, with a higher score indicating a greater daytime sleepiness. This test was self-administered. Baseline was defined as the baseline value from the double-blind study C10953/3067/ES/MN (NCT00893789) from which the participants entered into this open-label study.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Traumatic Brain Injury - Work Instability Scale (TBI-WIS) Score Values at Months 3, 6, 9, and Endpoint (Month 12 or Last Postbaseline Observation)</title>
        <description>The TBI-WIS is a validated participant-rated instrument for assessing a participant's functional ability after TBI and the functional demands of their job. The assessment consists of 36 questions to which the participant responded with a &quot;true&quot; or &quot;not true&quot; answer. To score the questionnaire, the number of &quot;true&quot; responses is counted: if &lt; 2, the risk for work instability is low; 2 to 23, the risk is medium; and &gt;23, the risk is high. Score range is 0 (lowest risk for work instability) to 36 (highest risk for work instability). Baseline was defined as the baseline value from the double-blind study C10953/3067/ES/MN (NCT00893789) from which the participants entered into this open-label study.</description>
        <time_frame>Baseline, Months 3, 6, 9, and Endpoint (Month 12 or last postbaseline observation); median (full range) of treatment was 98 (5.0 to 326.0) days.</time_frame>

For overall, the worst postbaseline finding (the abnormal finding if there are both normal and abnormal findings) for the participant between baseline and endpoint (defined as last postbaseline observation, up to Week 12) is summarized. Any ECG finding that was judged by the investigator as a clinically meaningful change (worsening) compared to baseline was recorded as an adverse event. Baseline was defined as the baseline value from the double-blind study C10953/3067/ES/MN (NCT00893789) from which the participants entered into this open-label study.</description>

        <title>Safety and Tolerability: Physical Examination Findings Shifts From Baseline to Endpoint (Month 12 or Last Postbaseline Observation)</title>
        <description>Number of participants with shifts from normal/abnormal physical examination findings at baseline (BL) to (→) normal/abnormal findings at endpoint (EP). Shifts (normal and abnormal) from baseline to endpoint are summarized using participant counts for each physical examination category. A newly diagnosed finding was defined as being normal or missing at baseline and abnormal at least once during the study. Any physical examination finding that was judged by the investigator as a clinically significant change (worsening) compared to a baseline value was considered an adverse event. HEENT= head, eyes, ears, nose, throat. Baseline was defined as the baseline value from the double-blind study C10953/3067/ES/MN (NCT00893789) from which the participants entered into this open-label study.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in the Total Score From the Self-Reported Hamilton Depression Rating Scale, 6 Item Version (S-HAM-D6) at Week 2, Months 1, 2, 3, 6, 9, and Endpoint (Month 12, or Last Postbaseline Observation)</title>
        <description>The self-reported S-HAM-D6 is a validated scale developed from the core depressive items of the 17 Item Hamilton Depression Inventory (HAM-D17). The HAM-D6 (Items 1, 2, 7, 8, 10, 13 from the 17-item HAMD) evaluates &quot;core&quot; symptoms of Major Depressive Disorder (MDD). The assessment consists of 6 items representing depressed mood, guilt, work and activities, retardation, psychic anxiety, and general somatic symptoms. Each item is evaluated and scored using either a 5-point scale (e.g. absent, mild, moderate, severe, very severe) or a 3-point scale (e.g. absent, mild, marked). Total scores range from 0 (normal) to 22 (severe). Scores greater than 12 indicate moderate to severe depression. Baseline was defined as the baseline value from the double-blind study C10953/3067/ES/MN (NCT00893789) from which the participants entered into this open-label study.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in the Medical Outcomes Study 6-Item Cognitive Functioning Scale (MOS-CF6) Total Score at Months 3, 6, 9, and Endpoint (Month 12 or Last Postbaseline Observation)</title>
        <description>The MOS-CF 6 is an instrument to assess patient self-reported cognitive function. Items were selected to cover 6 relevant aspects of cognitive functioning as follows: confusion, concentration/thinking, attention, memory, reasoning, problem solving, and processing speed. The CF 6-item responses include 6 choices, ranging from “none of the time” to “all of the time.” The CF-6 is scored by summing responses across the 6 items and converting the total to a 0- to 100-point scale, with higher scores indicating better cognitive functioning. Baseline was defined as the baseline value from the double-blind study C10953/3067/ES/MN (NCT00893789) from which the participants entered into this open-label study.</description>

This assessment was not performed in study C10953/3067/ES/MN (NCT00893789); therefore, the data obtained at screening for the current study would represent true baseline data only for new participants, of which there were none.</population>
