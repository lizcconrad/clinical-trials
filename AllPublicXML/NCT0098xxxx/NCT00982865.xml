    <textblock>
      This is a first in man trial with a primary objective being the determination of the Maximum
      Tolerated dose (MTD) and the dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) in several regimens of MEK
      inhibitor MSC1936369B administered orally once a day, in subjects with malignant solid tumors
      to see how safe is treatment with MSC1936369B.

    <measure>Number of subjects experienced at least a Dose-Limiting Toxicity (DLT) over the first cycle - Day 1 to 21</measure>
    <time_frame>21 days</time_frame>
    <description>DLT was defined using the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events v3.0 (CTCAE), as any of the following toxicities at any dose level and judged to be possibly or probably related to the trial medication by the investigator and/or the sponsor: any Grade 3 or more non-haematological toxicity excluding: Grade 3 asymptomatic increase in liver function tests reversible within 7 days for subjects without liver involvement, or Grade 4 for subjects with liver involvement. Grade 3 vomiting if it is encountered despite adequate and optimal therapy (e.g. 5HT3 antagonists and corticosteroids). Grade 3 diarrhoea if it is encountered despite adequate and optimal anti diarrhoea therapy. Any Grade 4 neutropenia of &gt; 5 days duration or febrile neutropenia lasting for more than 1 day. Grade 4 thrombocytopenia &gt; 1 day or Grade 3 with bleeding. Any treatment delay &gt; 2 weeks due to drug-related adverse effects.</description>
