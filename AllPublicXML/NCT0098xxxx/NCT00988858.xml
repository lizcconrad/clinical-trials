  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of LY2603618 in
      combination with pemetrexed and any side effects that might be associated with it along with
      determining the effects of LY2603618 in combination with pemetrexed in participants with
      advanced or metastatic Non-small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC).

    <measure>Overall Tumor Response - Percentage of Participants Achieving Complete Response (CR) or Partial Response (PR) [Overall Response Rate (ORR)]</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline until Progressive Disease or Study Discontinuation (Up to 23 Months)</time_frame>
    <description>Overall response rate is the best response of complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) as classified by the investigators according to the Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST v1.1). CR is a disappearance of all target and non-target lesions and normalization of tumor marker level. PR is an at least 30% decrease in the sum of the diameters of target lesions (taking as reference the baseline sum diameter) without progression of not-target lesions or appearance of new lesions. Overall response rate is calculated as a total number of participants with CR or PR divided by the total number of participants with at least 1 measurable lesion, multiplied by 100.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Participants Who Achieved a Best Response of Complete Response (CR), Partial Response (PR), or Stable Disease (SD) (Clinical Benefit Rate)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline until Progressive Disease or Study Discontinuation (Up to 23 Months)</time_frame>
    <description>Clinical benefit rate is the best response CR, PR, or stable disease (SD) as classified by the investigators according to the RECIST v1.1. CR is a disappearance of all target and non-target lesions and normalization of tumor marker level. PR is an at least 30% decrease in the sum of the diameters of target lesions (taking as reference the baseline sum diameter) without progression of not-target lesions or appearance of new lesions. SD is neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for progressive disease, taking as reference the smallest sum diameter since treatment started. Clinical benefit rate is calculated as a total number of participants with CR, PR, or SD divided by the total number of participants with at least 1 measurable lesion, multiplied by 100.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Progression-free Survival (PFS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Progressive Disease or Death Due to Any Cause (Up to 27.1 Months)</time_frame>
    <description>Progression-free survival (PFS) time was defined as the time from the date of randomization to the first date of progressive disease (symptomatic or objective) or death due to any cause, whichever occurred first. For participants who were not known to have died or progressed as of the data-inclusion cutoff date, PFS time was censored at the date of the last objective progression-free disease assessment prior to the date of any subsequent systematic anticancer therapy. PFS was summarized using Kaplan-Meier estimates.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Duration of Response</measure>
    <time_frame>First Observation of CR or PR until Progressive Disease or Death Due to Any Cause (Up to 23 Months)</time_frame>
    <description>Duration of Response is defined as the time from the first observation of CR or PR to the first observation of progressive disease (PD) or death from any cause. A response is defined as a confirmed objective status of CR or PR. For participants who are not known to have died as of the data inclusion cut-off date and who do not have PD, the duration will be censored at the date of the last objective progression free disease assessment prior to the date of any subsequent anticancer therapy.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Symptom Burden Scores of Lung Cancer Symptom Scale (LCSS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline until End of Study (Up to 27.1 Months)</time_frame>
    <description>The LCSS participants scale is a 9-item questionnaire. Six questions are symptom-specific measures for lung cancer (appetite, fatigue, cough, dyspnea, hemoptysis and pain), and 3 summation items describe total symptomatic distress, activity status, and overall quality of life. Participant responses were measured using visual analogue scales (VAS) with 100-milliliter (mm) lines. Scores range from 0 (for best outcome) to 100 (for worst outcome). The Average Symptom Burden Index (ASBI) was calculated as the mean of 6 symptom-specific questions from the LCSS.</description>

        <title>Overall Tumor Response - Percentage of Participants Achieving Complete Response (CR) or Partial Response (PR) [Overall Response Rate (ORR)]</title>
        <description>Overall response rate is the best response of complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) as classified by the investigators according to the Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST v1.1). CR is a disappearance of all target and non-target lesions and normalization of tumor marker level. PR is an at least 30% decrease in the sum of the diameters of target lesions (taking as reference the baseline sum diameter) without progression of not-target lesions or appearance of new lesions. Overall response rate is calculated as a total number of participants with CR or PR divided by the total number of participants with at least 1 measurable lesion, multiplied by 100.</description>

        <description>Clinical benefit rate is the best response CR, PR, or stable disease (SD) as classified by the investigators according to the RECIST v1.1. CR is a disappearance of all target and non-target lesions and normalization of tumor marker level. PR is an at least 30% decrease in the sum of the diameters of target lesions (taking as reference the baseline sum diameter) without progression of not-target lesions or appearance of new lesions. SD is neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for progressive disease, taking as reference the smallest sum diameter since treatment started. Clinical benefit rate is calculated as a total number of participants with CR, PR, or SD divided by the total number of participants with at least 1 measurable lesion, multiplied by 100.</description>

        <description>Duration of Response is defined as the time from the first observation of CR or PR to the first observation of progressive disease (PD) or death from any cause. A response is defined as a confirmed objective status of CR or PR. For participants who are not known to have died as of the data inclusion cut-off date and who do not have PD, the duration will be censored at the date of the last objective progression free disease assessment prior to the date of any subsequent anticancer therapy.</description>

        <title>Change in Symptom Burden Scores of Lung Cancer Symptom Scale (LCSS)</title>
        <description>The LCSS participants scale is a 9-item questionnaire. Six questions are symptom-specific measures for lung cancer (appetite, fatigue, cough, dyspnea, hemoptysis and pain), and 3 summation items describe total symptomatic distress, activity status, and overall quality of life. Participant responses were measured using visual analogue scales (VAS) with 100-milliliter (mm) lines. Scores range from 0 (for best outcome) to 100 (for worst outcome). The Average Symptom Burden Index (ASBI) was calculated as the mean of 6 symptom-specific questions from the LCSS.</description>
        <time_frame>Baseline until End of Study (Up to 27.1 Months)</time_frame>
        <population>The LCSS evaluable population consisted of all enrolled participants who had a baseline LCSS measurement and at least 1 post-baseline measurement. The population was evaluated for changes in the ASBI (improved, stable, worsened), with improvement/worsening based on trends seen in sets of consecutive ASBI assessments with respect to baseline ASBI.</population>
