  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Subjects have acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) that has come back (relapsed) after initial
      treatment or has not gone away with initial therapy. This research study involves testing an
      investigational drug called Tamibarotene in combination with standard treatment for relapsed
      APL called arsenic trioxide. Tamibarotene has been approved in Japan to treat patients with
      relapsed APL since April 2005. Tamibarotene is in the same family of drugs as all-trans
      retinoic acid (ATRA), a medication that subjects received previously in their treatment. ATRA
      and tamibarotene both cause the APL cells to differentiate (or become) normal non-leukemia
      cells. Laboratory studies of tamibarotene have shown to be effective in APL. The purpose of
      this study is to determine if tamibarotene in combination with arsenic trioxide is safe and
      effective.
