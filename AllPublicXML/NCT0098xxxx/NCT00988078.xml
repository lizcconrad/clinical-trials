    <textblock>
      The polycystic ovary syndrome is the most common endocrinopathy in reproductive age women.
      The pathophysiology of this syndrome remains unclear, but there are evidences that a
      decreased in insulin sensitivity may be related in this syndrome. There are studies that
      showed the action of factors on the sensitivity of the insulin receptor, such as melatonin.
      It is a hormone produced by the pineal gland, whose role is still uncertain in human
      reproduction, although many studies have found that it may relate sex hormone effect. Many
      patients with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) may have hyperinsulinemia, and that
      pinealectomized rats determined hypoglycemia and hyperinsulinemia, with reduced release of
      insulin in response to glucose. Therefore, it is supposed that blood levels of melatonin
      might correlate with the blood insulin concentration in patients with the syndrome. Moreover,
      the insulin sensitizing agents have been used in the treatment of patients with insulin
      resistance and PCOS, based on its main pathophysiological substrate which is the
      hyperinsulinemia. In fact, the metformin is the most used in the literature. However, there
      are few studies on the use of metformin in adolescents. The evidences of this drugs in this
      group of patients have showed good therapeutic response with few side effects. The objective
      of the study is to evaluate the effects of metformin on insulin resistance and levels of
      melatonin in adolescents with PCOS. It will be performed a prospective, randomized,
      double-blind and placebo-controlled study with 90 adolescents with PCOS. It will be evaluated
      clinical and laboratory parameters (TSH, free T4, prolactin, FSH, LH, estradiol, total
      testosterone, androstenedione, DHEA-s, 17-OH progesterone, SHBG, free androgen index, index
      of HOMA-IR and QUICKI from fasting glucose and insulin, total cholesterol and fractions,
      triglycerides, creatinine, AST and ALT and creatinkinase, fibrinogen and PAI-1, and melatonin
      for 6 months of treatment.

      Design: 90 patients will be selected to a prospective, randomized and double-blinded study.
      They will be assigned to two groups: A) 45 patients, treated with OC (oral contraceptive) and
      metformin 1500mg/ day. B) 45 patients, treated with OC and placebo. The length of treatment
      was six months.

      Inclusion criteria: patients until 19 years-old, at least 2 years after menarche, with
      Polycystic Ovary Syndrome based on Rotterdan criterion. Exclusion criteria: patients with
      Diabetes Mellitus, hypertension, hyperprolactinemia, adrenal enzymatic deficiency, Cushing
      syndrome, thyroidopathy, renal or hepatic disfunction, use of OC or insulin-sensitising drugs
      in the last 90 days before, pregnancy, androgen tumors, hormonal-sensitive tumors in the
      past, contra-indication to the medications used in the study.

      Clinical parameters included are weight and height (for BMI), waist to hip ratio, habits like
      smoking or drinking, drug addiction, blood pressure measurement, hirsutism and acne.

      Laboratorial parameters included are TSH, free T4, prolactin, FSH, LH, estradiol, total
      testosterone, androstenedione, s-DHEA, 17-OH progesterone, SHBG, free androgen index, fasting
      glucose and insulin, total cholesterol and fractions, triglycerides, creatinin, TGO, TGP, CK,
      PAI-1, fibrinogen, melatonin.

      Patients will be evaluated using these parameters in the beginning, 1, 3 and 6 months after
      use of the drugs.
