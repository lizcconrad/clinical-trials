      To verify the efficacy of topical applications of Chamomilla recutita infusion for phlebitis
      treatment, before dose response curve study and pilot study.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The hypothesis adopted was that patients with phlebitis due to peripheral intravenous
      infusion in anti-neoplasm chemotherapy, treated with a compress of Chamomilla recutita
      infusion for 20 minutes three times per day, would present a shorter phlebitis regression
      time in comparison with patients treated with a lukewarm water compress.
