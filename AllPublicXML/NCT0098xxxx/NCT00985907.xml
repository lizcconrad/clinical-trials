  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The median overall survival (OS) of relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma (MM) is less than
      nine months. However, phase II data with the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib (Velcade®) has
      been heartening, with 35% overall response rates and median survival of 16 months. In-vitro
      data has shown that this agent dramatically increases the sensitivity to chemotherapeutic
      agents. Liposomal doxorubicin (Doxil), melphalan, and bortezomib all have different
      mechanisms of action and toxicity profiles. Clinical studies employing two drug combinations
      with these agents in patients with refractory MM have found favorable efficacy (nearly no
      progression of disease) and tolerance data. Thus, the investigators are initiating a phase
      I/II study to examine the safety and efficacy of combining all three agents into the regimen
      DMV (Doxil® + melphalan + Velcade).

      Dose Level 1: Doxil 10 mg/m2, Melphalan 5 mg/m2, Velcade 0.7 mg/m2

      Dose Level 2: Doxil 10 mg/m2, Melphalan 10 mg/m2, Velcade 0.7 mg/m2

      Dose Level 3: Doxil 20 mg/m2, Melphalan 10 mg/m2, Velcade 0.7 mg/m2

      Dose Level 4: Doxil 20 mg/m2, Melphalan 10 mg/m2, Velcade 1.0 mg/m2

      Adjunctive therapy with a bisphosphonate, either pamidronate or zolendronic acid, will be
      given monthly.

      Dose Escalation Schedule: Dose escalation will occur only after patients have completed at
      least two cycles at a given dose level.

        1. If 0/3 experience DLT (as defined in attachment Section 6.0), the next three patients
           will be escalated by one dose level.

        2. If 1/3 experience DLT, 3 additional patients enrolled at this dose level.

             -  If 0, 1, or 2 of these additional patients experience DLT (i.e. total 3/6), the
                dose will be escalated.

             -  If 3/3 experience DLT (i.e. total 4/6) then the next lower dose will be considered
                the MTD..

        3. If 2/3 experience DLT, 3 additional patients enrolled at this dose level.

             -  If 0 or 1 of these additional patients experience DLT (i.e. total 3/6), the dose
                will be escalated.

             -  If 2 or more/3 experience DLT (i.e. total more than 3/6) then the next lower dose
                level is MTD
