      <pre_assignment_details>The patients started the study with a PK period. The PK period had a cross-over design (Kogenate vs Human cl rhFVIII) and subjects received either Kogenate first and Human cl rhFVIII second or vice versa. Once the PK measure had been done, the patient started the treatment period with Human cl rhFVIII only.</pre_assignment_details>

        <description>After each infusion of IMP and at the end of a BE, the following efficacy assessment is made by the subject (together with the Investigator in case of on-site treatment):
Excellent: Abrupt pain relief and/or unequivocal improvement in objective signs of bleeding within approximately 8 hours after a single infusion.
Good: Definite pain relief and/or improvement in signs of bleeding within approximately 8 – 12 hours after an infusion requiring up to 2 infusions for complete resolution.
Moderate: Probable or slight beneficial effect within approximately 12 hours after the first infusion requiring more than two infusions for complete resolution.
None: No improvement within 12 hours, or worsening of symptoms, requiring more than 2 infusions for complete resolution.
