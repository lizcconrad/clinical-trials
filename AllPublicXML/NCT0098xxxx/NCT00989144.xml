  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study of early, acute HIV infection is critical to understanding subtype-specific
      pathophysiologic differences, since up to 50% of acute HIV infections may be incapacitating.
      This study will establish whether the patient population of the Thai Red Cross Anonymous
      Clinic is suitable for the study of early, acute infection.

      This study will utilize existing (collected after 1 January 2006) and prospectively collected
      HIV seronegative clinical specimens not used as part of any research protocol. The specimens
      in this study are discarded anonymous samples from the Voluntary Counseling and Testing (VCT)
      facilities at the Thai Red Cross Anonymous Clinic in Bangkok, Thailand. The specimens cannot
      be linked to the tested subjects. The samples will be labeled using the anonymous clinic
      identification number which is a 7 digit number with the first 2 digits representing the year
      and the following 5 digits representing the sequence of which the client sought care in that
      calendar year. Preliminary Study of Early, Primary HIV Infection in a High Risk Cohort.

      Pools will be made by aliquoting 40ul per subject into each pool, with a maximum of 20
      subjects per pool, yielding a maximum pool volume of 800 ul. Samples will be run with the
      Roche Amplicor ver 1.5 test in ultrasensitive mode with appropriate controls as per
      manufacturer's instructions. Quality assurance will be per SOP. Pools testing positive will
      be re-analyzed at the individual sample level. Positive samples will be confirmed by Bayer
      bDNA NAT. Frequency of infection will be tabulated.
