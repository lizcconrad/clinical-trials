    <textblock>
      The purpose of this natural history study is to understand more about the progression of
      infantile Krabbe disease, a very rare genetic disease. There is very little published
      longitudinal data with only anecdotal cases. This natural history study will be important in
      understanding the effect of future therapies that are presently in the preclinical phase.

      Infantile globoid cell leukodystrophy (GLD, or Krabbe disease) is a rare, inherited
      degenerative disorder of the central and peripheral nervous systems. It is characterized by
      the presence of globoid cells (multinucleated cells), the breakdown of the nerve's protective
      myelin coating, and destruction of brain cells. Globoid cell leukodystrophy is one of a group
      of genetic disorders called the leukodystrophies. These disorders impair the growth or
      development of the myelin sheath, and causes severe degeneration of mental and motor skills.
      Myelin, which lends its color to the &quot;white matter&quot; of the brain, is a complex substance made
      up of a number of different glucoproteins and glucolipids, the most important of which is
      galactocerebroside. Each of the leukodystrophies affects one of these substances. Globoid
      cell leukodystrophy is caused by a deficiency of galactocerebroside ß-galactosidase (GALC),
      an essential enzyme for myelin metabolism. The disease most often affects infants, with onset
      before the age of 6 months, but can occur in adolescence or adulthood. Symptoms include
      irritability, unexplained fever, limb stiffness (hypertonia), seizures, feeding difficulties,
      vomiting, and slowing of mental and motor development. Other symptoms include muscle
      weakness, spasticity, deafness, and blindness.

      There is no cure for globoid cell leukodystrophy. Generally, treatment for the disorder is
      symptomatic and supportive.

      Infantile globoid cell leukodystrophy is generally fatal before age 2 years. Patients with
      juvenile- or adult-onset disease generally have a milder course of the disease and live
      significantly longer.

      Globoid cell leukodystrophy is a autosomal recessive disorder with a wide geographic
      distribution. The incidence in the United States is estimated as 1 in 100.000 births.
      However, the incidence appears to be higher in the Scandinavian countries. 32 Swedish cases
      were reported during the period from 1953 through 1967 with calculated incidence at 1.9 per
      100.000 births.

      To be able to compare the benefits experienced by infants with globoid cell leukodystrophy,
      who receive a possible future treatment, to those untreated, a better understanding of the
      natural course of infantile GLD is necessary. The current literature contains only case
      studies of individual or small groups of GLD patients. A longitudinal study of a larger
      population of patients with infantile GLD has yet to be performed. This protocol is a 1.5
      years longitudinal observational study to capture natural history data in patients with
      infantile GLD. This data will provide information on the range and diversity of clinical
      disease parameters that can in the future be used to evaluate treatment effects.

        Patients will be enrolled regardless of gender, race or ethnicity. Patients will be
        identified through clinical referrals from other physicians or medical centers and also
        those patients receiving clinical care at the Program for Neurodevelopmental Function in
        Rare Disorders.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Informed consent obtained before any study-related activities. (Study-related
             activities are any procedure that would not have been performed during normal
             management of the subject)

          -  The patient must have a documented diagnosis of infantile globoid cell leukodystrophy
             with galactocerebroside ß-galactosidase (GALC) activity &lt; 0.50 nmol/h/mg protein and
             evidence of two pathogenic mutations in the GALC gene must be confirmed after the
             baseline visit

          -  The patient must have an age at the time of screening &lt; 2 years

          -  The patient's parent(s) and/or legal guardian must have the ability to comply with the
             clinical protocol

             participation in the study

          -  Use of any investigational product within 30 days prior to study enrollment or
             currently enrolled in another study which involves clinical investigations

          -  The patient's parent(s) and/or legal guardian is unable to understand the nature,
             scope, and possible consequences of the study

          -  Patient is unable to comply with the protocol, i.e. inability to return for follow-up
             evaluations or otherwise unlikely to complete the study as determined by the principal
             investigator
