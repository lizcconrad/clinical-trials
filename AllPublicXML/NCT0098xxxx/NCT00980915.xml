      The purpose of the study is to identify the patients at high risk of developing Acute Lung
      Injury (ALI) at the time of hospital admission, and before intensive care unit admission.

      Aim 1- To validate the prediction model (Lung Injury Prediction Score) in a population based
      sample of hospitalized patients.

      Aim 2- To determine the significance of health-care related ALI risk modifiers in a
      population based sample.

      Aim 3- To compare the short and long term outcomes between patients at high risk who do, and
      do not develop ALI.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Acute lung injury (ALI) is an example of a critical care syndrome with limited treatment
      options once the condition is fully established.Not surprisingly, many treatments targeting
      the mechanisms identified in preclinical studies have failed to improve patient outcomes.The
      most likely reason could be due to inadequate and delayed recognition of patients at risk and
      the subsequent development of the full blown syndrome.ALI/ARDS usually develops during the
      first hours of ICU admission, and often is the very reason for ICU admission.

      Clinical prediction models have been extensively used in the clinical practice to identify
      patients at high risks who may benefit from specific interventions. However, no such tool
      exists to predict the development of ALI in patients at risk. We have recently developed an
      ALI prediction model (Lung Injury Prediction Score:LIPS)which incorporates demographic,
      environmental and clinical characteristics at the time of, and before, hospital admission. If
      validated, this model will serve to find the population of patients at high risk of ALI in
      whom future prevention trials will be conducted. By determining not only patients at high
      risk but also the attributable burden of ALI/ARDS in contemporary cohorts of patients at
      risk, our findings will facilitate the prioritization of preventive strategies and future
      clinical trials.

      We will collect time sensitive peripheral blood samples for collaborative genome-wide
      association, gene expression, cytokines and proteonomic studies. Blood samples of the
      enrolled patients will be collected as baseline, after 24, 48 hours and at the time of
      development of ARDS.
