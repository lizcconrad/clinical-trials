  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In older, normal-weight women (60-75 yrs, BMI=18-28 kg/m2), an acute bout of higher-intensity
      (60% of maximum effort) aerobic exercise, in comparison to an isocaloric bout of
      lower-intensity (45% of maximum effort) exercise (caloric expenditure of 3.5 kcal/kg body
      weight for both), will result in differential:

        1. decline in non-exercise activity calorie expenditure in the subsequent 48 hours after
           exercise;

        2. increase in resting metabolic rate 48 hours after exercise;

        3. increase in serum free triiodo-L-thyronine (free T3) concentrations immediately
           following exercise;

        4. decline from pre-exercise in plasma leptin and serum free T3 concentrations 48 hours
           after exercise.
