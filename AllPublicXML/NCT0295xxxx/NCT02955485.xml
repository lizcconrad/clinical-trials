  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic ankle instability is a common problem that may follow an ankle sprain. Until a
      patient has developed chronic ankle instability they are ineligible for surgical treatment
      although early surgical treatment yields better results compared to surgical treatment of
      subjects that have experienced recurrent ankle sprains. However, treating all patients with
      an ankle sprain surgically is not an option due to the high amount of unnecessary invasive
      interventions.

      The objective of this study is to identify which patients will develop chronic ankle
      instability and to develop a model to predict which patients should receive early surgical
      treatment.

      In this prospective observational cohort all patients (older than 18 years) that report at
      the emergency department of the participating hospitals after a lateral ankle sprain, of whom
      an x-ray is made after positive Ottawa Ankle Rules and on which there is no visible fracture
      or other pathology.

      The main study parameter is a significant difference in patient characteristics, foot and
      ankle configuration and joint pathology between patients who develop chronic ankle
      instability and patients who do not experience recurrent ankle sprains and restriction during
      daily live after an initial sprain.

        All patients reporting at the ED in the AMC after an ankle sprain are eligible for
        inclusion. Their condition may vary from a severe sprain to an ankle fracture. All patients
        will be checked for ankle fractures using the Ottawa Ankle Rules (OAR). In 5-20% of cases a
        fracture is present with positive OAR, or there is doubt on the presence of a fracture and
        an x-ray will be taken. However there is always a chance of false positive results on the
        OAR. In these cases there is may have been a severe ankle sprain without intraarticular
        pathology visible on the x-ray. These are concluded to be severe sprain cases the
        investigators will extract for this study to include them in a questionnaire follow-up on
        the development of CAI.
