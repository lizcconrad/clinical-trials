      The purpose of this study is to determine whether use of a suite of smart phone enabled
      mobile health devices can reduce burnout in medical trainees. Such applications can then be
      used in more general populations with the same goal in mind.

      Wearable sensors and mental health platforms delivered via smartphones offer an opportunity
      to passively and actively acquire quantifiable signs and symptoms related to mental health
      status. These features include both physiological and cognitive performance measures.
      Collectively they serve as a set of metrics whereby an estimation of a person's mental state
      can be gauged. Additionally, use of these platforms allows those who are identified as high
      risk for mental illness to have targeted therapy delivered via their smartphone and if
      necessary connected with a suitable healthcare provider. Applications of such technology
      platforms serve to potentially reduce the substantial morbidity and mortality in a population
      at increased risk for mental illness and burnout.

        The study is a single site prospective cross over observational study involving physicians
        at Scripps Clinic/Green Hospital, La Jolla, California. Subjects will serve as their own
        control group during a roll in phase of up to 3 months. All subjects will undergo at entry
        a baseline psychological survey (Maslach Burnout Index and PHQ-9). After the roll in phase,
        subjects will be provided with 3 smartphone-enabled devices (Oura Ring, Spire and Beyond
        Verbal voice analytics application). In addition to the devices, physicians will also be
        provided access to online educational content specific to physician burnout. Physicians
        will use the 3 devices for a 3 month period and Maslach Burnout Index and PHQ-9 assessments
        will be performed at a 6 week midpoint and at completion of the study.
