    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the feasibility of endotracheal intubation via
      glidescope videolaryngoscope (GVL) using different curve of stylet in 120 children aged
      between 1 and 5 year old.

    <textblock>
      Pediatric patients aged 1-5 year old are randomly assigned to one of two groups; standard
      curve (S) and tip-manipulated curve (T) groups. After routine anesthetic induction,
      endotracheal intubation is performed with GVL. Size of GVL blade is selected according to
      weight; GVL 0: &lt;1.5kg, GVL 1:1.5-3.6kg, GVL 2: 1.8-10kg, GVL 2.5: 10-28kg). Before
      intubation, stylet curve is differently manipulated according to group. The style is curved
      in accordance with the curve of GVL blade in S group, whereas the distal tip of style is
      additionally bended to the left (15-20 degree) in T group.

      Time from visualization of glottis with GVL to approaching of endotracheal tube to glottis,
      and time to completion of intubation are measured. In addition, the easiness of intubation is
      assessed using Visual Analogue Scale (0: extremely easy, 10: extremely difficult) and will be
      compared in both groups.
