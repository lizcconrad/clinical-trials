  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Through this study, the investigators seek to identify the benefits (improved survival) and
      harms (more procedures, more treatment, side effects, and quality-of-life impact) from
      different surveillance frequenciesâ€”every three vs. six vs. 12 months. Using the National
      Cancer Database and quality-of-life data from a large group of prostate cancer survivors, the
      investigators aim to compare survival, procedures/tests, treatments, and side effects in
      prostate cancer survivors who are followed with alternative surveillance frequencies and
      compare quality-of-life outcomes. The overall goal of the study is to provide high-quality
      data that will allow development of a personalized, risk-based tailored approach to
      post-treatment surveillance for prostate cancer.

        A total of 14,000 prostate cancer patients in the National Cancer Data Base (nationwide
        cancer registry) will be analyzed.

        The investigators will analyze data from the National Cancer Data Base (NCDB), a cancer
        registry which is maintained by the American College of Surgeons Commission on Cancer
        (CoC). Cancer registry staff review hospital and provider records to collect necessary data
        for the cancer registry so data are available for analysis for this project. There are
        &gt;1400 CoC-hospitals; 10 patients will be sampled at each hospital thus 14,000 patients will
        be available for analysis.
