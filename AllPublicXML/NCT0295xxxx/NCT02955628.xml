  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicentre, open-label, phase II study of ibrutinib 560 mg in combination with
      R-ICE for treatment of transplant-eligible relapsed/refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All patients will receive R-ICE therapy for 2 cycles followed by PET-CT assessment (PET-2).
      Ibrutinib 560 mg will be added to the RICE regimen based on results of PET-2 as follows:

        -  Patients in CR will continue with 2 more cycles of R-ICE and proceed onto ASCT. These
           patients will not receive ibrutinib.

        -  In patients with stable disease or achieving a response that is less than CR, ibrutinib
           560 mg will be added. The combination of ibrutinib-RICE will be given for 2 cycles and
           will be followed by PET-CT assessment (PET-4). Patients who achieve ≥ PR at this point
           will proceed onto ASCT.

        -  Patients who have disease progression will be removed from the trial. Hematopoietic stem
           cell harvesting can be performed following count recovery at any cycle of R-ICE, but
           preferably cycle 2.

      Transplant conditioning regimen will be with standard BEAM chemotherapy (carmustine,
      etoposide, cytarabine, melphalan).

      Following ASCT, ibrutinib will be given as maintenance therapy for patients who did not
      achieve a CR at the time of PET-2 assessment. This will be continued for up to 1 year after
      ASCT.
