    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to address the United States Office of AIDS Research highest
      priorities: improving the workforce, reducing health disparities, and addressing HIV
      comorbidities. UCLA will randomize the government-funded community health workers (CHW) from
      16 clinics in matched rural areas in the Eastern Cape in South Africa to either: 1) the
      Accountable Condition (AC) in which additional monitoring and accountability systems that
      Philani routinely uses are implemented or 2) a Control Condition (CC), of initial Philani
      training, but ongoing supervision and monitoring consistent with local government practices.

      Each dollar invested in maternal, child health (MCH) yields a nine-fold benefit. Home
      visiting has been repeatedly demonstrated efficacious in improving MCH outcomes, including
      when delivered by CHW in low and middle income countries (LMIC). However, when home visiting
      programs are scaled, they are not effective. Africa has particular challenges with broad
      implementation of effective interventions often associated with the poorly trained and poorly
      monitored health personnel, in this case, CHW who are perinatal home visitors.

      The investigators have shown that with training, supervision, and accountability, CHW home
      visits are effective in a successful randomized controlled trial (RCT) conducted in
      peri-urban townships in Cape Town, South Africa. CHW were trained to address HIV, alcohol,
      and malnutrition among all pregnant women in a neighborhood - to avoid stigma and to address
      multiple challenges concurrently. The visits significantly improved maternal and child
      outcomes over three years. Based on these results, the Philani Intervention Model served as
      one model for re-engineering primary health care for 65,000 CHW in South Africa. The Mthatha
      Provincial Government has agreed for the Philani Program to train, monitor, and supervise
      their already-hired CHW. This RCT will evaluate whether routinely implementing training and
      monitoring CHW behavior and MCH outcomes with mobile phones, and providing data-informed
      supervision, will result in CHW becoming more effective. Stellenbosch University interviewers
      will independently assess outcomes of each mother at pregnancy, and of the mothers and
      infants within two weeks of post-birth, 6 months, 15 months, and 24 months later. The primary
      outcome will be maternal HIV/TB testing, linkage to care, treatment adherence and retention
      in medical regimens, depression, and parenting; and her child's physical growth, cognitive
      functioning, and behavior adjustment.

    <description>Mothers will receive home visits by government-funded CHW who will be trained under Philani as well as receive ongoing monitoring and supervision. CHW will monitor mother's health and linkage to care; CHW will refer all mothers to local clinics for HIV, blood sugar, and pregnancy testing. CHW will also have a mobile phone to record information at each visit. CHW will log their home visits each day, rate the content and skills addressed on the mobile phone, weigh children, and report outcome achievements (e.g., receiving the child grant, immunizations, breastfeeding, and retention/ adherence to HIV care). The CHW in this arm will receive data-informed supervision. CHW will be monitored weekly with review of contact logs, recorded outcomes, and random site visits by supervising in-service training on a monthly basis. The Accountable Condition will last for two years (until the child is 24 months old).</description>
