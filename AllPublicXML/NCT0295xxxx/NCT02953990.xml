  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will provide information about the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary
      effects of a biobehavioral self-management approach for perinatal depressive symptoms. This
      line of research will contribute to the body of knowledge about adjunctive therapies for
      depressive symptoms in pregnancy, a serious problem which contributes to poor maternal-child
      outcomes. Ultimately, this will contribute to the development and implementation of
      theoretically driven depression prevention/ resiliency building interventions and measurement
      of appropriate biobehavioral outcomes to determine the effectiveness of interventions.

      The investigators longitudinal mixed-methods study will use a one-group repeated measures
      intervention design coupled with qualitative methods to provide a comprehensive view of the
      feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary effects of the MOMS intervention. Semi-structured
      interviews, recruitment and retention numbers, and participant logs will be used to evaluate
      feasibility and acceptability of the intervention (Specific Aim 1). Recently collected
      archival comparison group data from an existing study will be used to contribute to
      explorations of preliminary effects of the intervention by comparing longitudinal
      psychobehavioral data, birth weight data (Specific Aims 2 and 3).
