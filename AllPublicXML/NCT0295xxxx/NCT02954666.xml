  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Different approaches to cardio-neuroablation (CNA) to treat neurally mediated syncope, sinus
      node dysfunction, and functional atrioventricular block have been published. Investigators
      have developed a more limited and specific approach of CNA, called cardio-neuromodulation
      (CardNM). This treatment is based on a tailored vagolysis of the sinoatrial node through
      partial ablation of the anterior right ganglionated plexus (ARGP); it is also based on an
      innovative anatomic strategy. The feasibility of CardNM has already been tested in our center
      in a limited first study in humans (CardNMH1), with a favorable outcome for the patients
      involved. The results of CardNMH1 have been submitted for publication. The purpose of this
      second study of CardNM in humans (CardNMH2) is to collect more procedural and clinical data
      in well-defined patient groups.

      This is a phase II A prospective, interventional study. All patients will undergo CardNM. The
      study will involve eight different steps, from the screening procedure through study
      completion: screening, enrollment, pharmacological testing, group allocation, preprocedural
      assessment, procedure, follow-up, study completion.The dedicated study nurse and the PI are
      responsible for recording all data from the trial on the case report forms (CRFs) and
      completing the study database. A dedicated independent physician will be responsible for the
      safety monitoring. The PI will permit inspection of the trial files and the database by
      national or international official controlling scientific authorities, if required. The PI
      will review and monitor completed CRFs and the database at regular intervals throughout the
      trial.

    <description>Patients will undergo a tailored radio-frequency ablation of the ARGP with the Smart Touch™ catheter or with the nMARQ™ catheter. Radiofrequency applications will be interrupted if no significant P-P interval shortening is observed after 30 seconds or if P-P interval is ≤ 550 ms during ablation.
The ablation procedure is considered complete when one of the following conditions is fulfilled:
P-P interval &lt; 70% baseline procedural P-P interval after 5minute of waiting time; P-P interval &lt; 600 ms after 5 minute of waiting time; 5 radiofrequency applications &gt; 30 seconds have been delivered with the nMARQ™ catheter or 10 applications with the Smart Touch catheter.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

        Candidates must meet all of the inclusion criteria required for inclusion in one of the two
        groups (summarized in Table 2). All of the patients need to have a positive P wave of &gt; 0.5
        mm in lead 2. Patients must have had ≥ 1 syncope during the 6 months preceding enrollment
        and ≥ 2 syncopes in their lifetime except if the last syncope was complicated by an injury
        or an accident, in which case further waiting for CardNM may be less desirable. Patients &lt;
        18 years must have least 3 syncopes with an interval exceeding 1 month unless 1 syncope was
        complicated by an injury or an accident.

        If a significant rate drop (&gt; 15%) is noted during head-up tilt test (HUT), either isolated
        or combined with vasoplegia, and associated with syncope or severe presyncope, patients
        will be eligible for inclusion in group A. If the HUT is negative and a pause &gt; 3 seconds
        has been documented, patients will be assigned to group B. If both conditions are present,
        patients will be eligible for inclusion in either group but will be preferentially assigned
        to group A.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Candidates will be excluded if ANY of the following criteria apply (detailed in Table 3):

          -  &lt; 14 years of age;

          -  Inability to provide consent;

          -  Chronotropic negative medications (excepted in patients with a previous history of
             atrial fibrillation);

          -  4 g amiodarone intake during the 2 months preceding enrollment;

          -  Alternating right bundle branch block (RBBB) and left bundle branch block (LBBB), HV
             interval &gt; 70 ms;

          -  LBBB, bifascicular block (RBBB + left anterior hemiblock [LAHB], RBBB + left posterior
             hemiblock [LPHB]);

          -  PR interval permanently &gt; 240 ms;

          -  Permanent AF, PAF or electrical cardioversion during the last 6 months;

          -  Valvular or subvalvular aortic stenosis, mitral stenosis;

          -  Any unstable medical condition, life expectancy &lt; 12 months;

          -  Syncopes due a non-cardiac disease (excepted NMS) or advanced neuropathy;

          -  Current pregnancy;

          -  glaucoma.

        Patients with transient atrioventricular conduction disturbances and normal
        atrioventricular conduction during an exercise test and normal QRS complexes are eligible
        for this study.

        Patients with a high risk of bleeding are eligible, but clopidogrel (75 mg daily, 1 month
        of treatment) will then be preferred to oral anticoagulants.
