  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Synthetic phosphoethanolamine is a primary amine which has a critical role in the
      biosynthesis of cell membranes. Pre-clinical models have shown potential anticancer activity.

      Phase II multi-cohort study based on two-stage Simon design. The primary goal of the study is
      response rate at 8 weeks in participants with advanced solid tumors treated with synthetic
      phosphoethanolamine, as defined by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors version 1.1
      (RECIST v 1.1) or specific criteria for prostate cancer.
