  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patient-facing eHealth technologies are those that connect patients and the healthcare
      system, and include online patient portals. Although many organizations are adopting patient
      portals, there is limited understanding of how the different portal features help improve
      health outcomes. This study is designed to develop and test an intervention to improve
      adoption and use of patient portal features for diabetes management.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Currently over 3 million Veterans have adopted the VA Patient Portal, My HealtheVet (MHV),
      however actual use of the portal varies considerably, and the investigators have little data
      on how the portal features can best improve patient outcomes, or whether effective use varies
      by subgroups. By examining the patient portal features associated with improved outcomes and
      clarifying how patients can best leverage these features to better manage their diabetes, the
      investigators will develop and test an intervention to improve adoption and use of the
      patient portal for diabetes management. The goal of this small scale study, using a
      randomized encouragement design, is to to test the feasibility of engaging Veterans in a
      supported adoption intervention to promote effective MHV use, in a sample of Veterans with
      diabetes (with or without comorbid mental health problems).

      The investigators will recruit from Veterans at the study sites who have uncontrolled glucose
      (HbA1c &gt;= 9%) and have not used the patient portal. Participants will be randomized to one of
      two conditions: 1) Encouragement and 2) Comparison. Participants randomized to the
      encouragement arm will receive a mailing to emphasize the importance of setting health goals
      and explain how MHV can help and will have the opportunity to participate in the Supported
      Adoption intervention. Those in the intervention will receive a one-on one session (to sign
      up and learn how to use secure messaging), a group training session (which will emphasize the
      features most meaningful for diabetes management) , and follow-up support after the training
      sessions to to provide further encouragement. Those in the comparison condition will receive
      a mailing with only the goal setting content (no MHV nor intervention component offer).
