  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to evaluate the quadrivalent meningococcal conjugate vaccine when
      used as a single-dose toddler vaccine in individuals who are either meningococcal vaccine
      naïve or have received one or more doses of monovalent meningococcal C (MenC) vaccines during
      infancy.

      Primary Objectives:

        -  To demonstrate the non-inferiority of the antibody response to meningococcal serogroups
           A, C, Y, and W after a single dose of MenACYW conjugate vaccine or Nimenrix® in toddlers
           who either are meningococcal vaccine naïve or have received monovalent MenC vaccination
           during infancy

        -  To demonstrate the non-inferiority of the antibody response to meningococcal serogroups
           A, C, Y, and W after a single dose of MenACYW conjugate vaccine or Nimenrix® in
           meningococcal vaccine naïve toddlers

      Secondary Objectives:

        -  To compare the antibody responses (geometric mean titers [GMTs]) to meningococcal
           serogroups A, C, Y, and W after a dose of MenACYW conjugate vaccine or Nimenrix® as
           measured by hSBA in toddlers who either are meningococcal vaccine naïve or have received
           monovalent MenC vaccination during infancy

        -  To compare the antibody responses (GMTs) to meningococcal serogroups A, C, Y, and W
           after a dose of MenACYW conjugate vaccine or Nimenrix® as measured by hSBA in
           meningococcal vaccine naïve toddlers

        -  To compare the antibody responses (GMTs) to meningococcal serogroups A, C, Y, and W
           after a dose of MenACYW conjugate vaccine or Nimenrix® as measured by hSBA in toddlers
           who received monovalent MenC vaccination during infancy.

      Observational Objective:

        -  To evaluate the safety profile of MenACYW conjugate vaccine and Nimenrix®.

      Healthy toddlers aged 12 to 23 months will be enrolled and randomized depending on the
      meningococcal background to receive either MenACYW conjugate vaccine or Nimenrix®. They will
      be assessed for immunogenicity assessment at baseline (pre-vaccination) and post-vaccination.
      Safety information will be collected post-vaccination and through the entire study.
