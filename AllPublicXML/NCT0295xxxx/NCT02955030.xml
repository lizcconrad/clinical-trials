      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of a sublingual
      administration of NSV0001 in healthy male volunteers.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      NSV0001 is a quadrivalent influenza vaccine with the new adjuvant (ND002) administered by
      sublingual route.

      This study will enroll healthy male adults. Participants will receive two doses of the
      vaccine, 4 weeks apart, and will stay in the investigational site for 2 consecutive days
      after each vaccination.

      Participants will keep a patient diary to record the local and systemic reactions for one
      week after each vaccination. In addition, the safety monitoring will be extended through 6
      months from the last vaccination to detect the potential immune mediated disorders (pIMD).
