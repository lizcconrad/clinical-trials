  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sixty patients with partially edentulous posterior maxilla requiring a transcrestal sinus
      floor elevation technique to insert one implant will be selected. The purpose of this
      multi-center, prospective, double blind, and randomized investigation is to analyze a
      platform switched implant when placed at limited maxillary residual bone height with low bone
      density compared to a platform matching implant with or without bone graft material.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Approximately 60 subjects who require at least one posterior maxilla implant in the areas of
      the second pre-molars or (first or second) molars with 6 to 9 mm of crestal bone below the
      sinus floor, as determined on the computerized axial tomographic (CT) scan, will be recruited
      for the study. Subjects will receive dental implants to replace a missing tooth (second
      pre-molar or first/second molar) on one side of the maxillary arch. Each subject will receive
      one type of implant: platform switched (PS) or platform matching (PM). Each site will receive
      either a bone graft material composed of anorganic bovine bone mineralized (ABBM, Bio-Oss,
      Geistlich Pharma) or no graft material (collagen membrane used for wound healing (Collatape,
      Zimmer)). At implant placement surgery and post-surgical follow-ups, the treated site will be
      examined, clinically measured, and radiographs and photographs will be taken.

      The central hypothesis is that the mean crestal bone level for the platform switched (test
      implants) implants will be superior to the mean crestal bone level for the platform matching
      (control implants) implants when placed in limited maxillary residual bone in the posterior
      regions, regardless of the use of bone graft material or collagen membrane.

             to perform adequate oral hygiene.

         13. Subjects who are pregnant or intending to become pregnant during the duration of the
             study.

         15. Subject allergic to collagen or porcine derived products.

         16. Subjects with conditions or circumstances, in the opinion of the investigator, which
             would prevent completion of study participation or interfere with analysis of study
             results, such as history of non- compliance or unreliability.
