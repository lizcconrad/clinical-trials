  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      the trial is a randomized, open label, crossover, single-administration bioavailability study
      to compare the pharmacokinetic parameters of Omexa sumatriptan transmucosal sublingual tablet
      versus commercial Imitrex速 sumatriptan oral tablet in 14 healthy volunteers.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Volunteers will randomly receive either the commercial oral tablet 100 mg Imitrex速 or 75 mg
      Omexa sublingual tablet under fasted conditions. One week following the first administration,
      the volunteers will receive the alternative treatment.

      Blood samples will be collected at each visit before drug administration and at 5, 15, 30,
      45, 60, 90, 120, 240, 360 and 480 min after drug administration, in order to characterize the
      drug's absorption and pharmacokinetics, as well as to evaluate Omexa formulation safety.
