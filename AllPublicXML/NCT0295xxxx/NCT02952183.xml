  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Although nerve-sparing surgery has been introduced for female patients with the pelvic
      tumors, its success rate depends on operators. To achieve consistency of surgical procedure,
      It is necessary to adopt pelvic autonomic nerve monitoring technique.

      The Aims of this study is

        1. Development of pelvic autonomic nerve monitoring system (PAMS I) by using urodynamic
           system.

        2. Evaluation of autonomic nerve sparing by intraoperative monitoring with PAMS I

        3. Evaluating the efficacy of PAMS I by intraoperative neurophysiological monitoring (IOM)

      After surgery for pelvic tumor, most of patients complain voiding dysfunction, defecation
      dysfunction and sexual dysfunction which lead to decrease quality of life. Recently,
      nerve-sparing surgery has been introduced. But it is difficult to establish standard surgical
      procedure for nerve-sparing. And it is the concern that performing nerve sparing surgery may
      reduce radicality of surgery which influence prognosis.

      Through pelvic autonomic nerve monitoring system (PAMS I), this trial is expected to raise
      the possibility of nerve-sparing with maintaining radicality of surgery.

      Pressure sensor of PAMS I and needle prove of IOM are very thin and these instruments have
      been used clinically. Taking this into consideration, additional risk by nerve monitoring is
      considered to be minimal.
