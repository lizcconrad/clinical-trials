      This prospective cohort study is designed to examine the association between blood and urine
      biomarkers (including genetic variants) and long-term kidney disease progression among 2000
      Chinese IgA nephropathy patients with relatively normal kidney function (eGFR≥60 ml/min/1.73
      m2).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Glomerulonephritis is the leading cause of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) in China, where IgA
      nephropathy (IgAN) is the most common primary glomerulonephritis among individuals undergoing
      renal biopsy. The outcomes of IgAN vary highly among individuals; some have the stable renal
      function for lifetime and some quickly progress to ESRD. No biomarker is widely applied to
      predict the outcomes in IgAN yet. Previous GWAS studies including ours have identified some
      susceptibility loci associated with the development and clinical features of IgAN. In
      addition, a few cohort studies have revealed several genetic loci related to the progression
      of IgAN. But, all of the reported GWAS studies were based on a case-control design, which may
      not provide the information about the effect of genetic variants on the progression of
      disease. Previous cohort studies which focused on certain specific candidate genes cannot
      unbiasedly explore the progression related susceptibility loci. Furthermore, there is no
      study that integrates the information from whole genomic loci and serum and urine biomarkers
      to predict the long-term progression in IgAN. Therefore, we design a relative large
      prospective cohort study to examine the association between blood and urine biomarkers
      (including whole genomic loci) and long-term kidney disease progression among 2000 Chinese
      IgAN patients with relatively normal kidney function (eGFR≥60 ml/min/1.73 m2).
