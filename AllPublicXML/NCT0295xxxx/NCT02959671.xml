    <textblock>
      A cohort of 15 patients starting orthodontic treatment with fixed appliances will receive
      EXD-952 Ceramic Self-ligating brackets on all mandibular incisors and a different type of
      brackets on the remaining mandibular teeth. Tooth movement will be initiated using 0.014&quot; or
      0.016&quot; Nickel-Titanium archwires.

      A second cohort of 15 patients will receive EXD-952 Ceramic Self-ligating bracket on all
      mandibular incisors in a later phase of their ongoing orthodontic treatment. The mandibular
      incisor brackets will be removed and EXD-952 Ceramic Self-ligating brackets placed instead.
      Other mandibular brackets will remain in place. Tooth movement will be performed using
      0.019x0.025&quot; Stainless Steel archwires.

      In both cohorts bracket door stability, the ability of the door to hold the archwire in the
      bracket slot, the bracket's ability to rotate teeth, clinicians' satisfaction with the
      bracket, and patient comfort in comparison with other brackets will be assessed.

      The evaluation for each patient will last for at least until one archwire change (cohort 1)
      or one appointment interval (6-8 weeks, cohort 2).

      After the evaluation period, EXD-952 Ceramic Self-ligating brackets will remain in place
      until the orthodontic treatment is completed.
