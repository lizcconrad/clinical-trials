    <textblock>
      This study assess the effectiveness of novel cognitive intervention utilizing tablet apps
      (TECH protocol: Tablet Enhancement of Cognition and Health) to improve cognitive abilities,
      daily function and health-related quality of life of older adults with MCI. Forty six older
      adults with MCI will be randomly allocated to the TECH protocol (experimental group) or
      standard care (control group). Assessments will be administered pre and post the 6-week TECH
      protocol and at 6-month follow-up by assessors blind to group allocation.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A single-blind randomized controlled trial (RCT) will be conducted, by assessors blind to
      group allocation. Participants will be referred to the study from 'Maccabi Healthcare
      Services' by family physicians and geriatric physician of 'Maccabi Healthcare Services
      Central District'. The majority of TECH protocol training will take place in the
      participants' home as self-practice. The assessment and weekly group meetings will take place
      at clinics of Maccabi Healthcare Services in the Central District. A Helsinki approval
      (#2016009) has already been obtained. Participants will receive information regarding the
      study and if eligible will sign a consent form, undergo the screening and then the
      pre-intervention assessments. Then they will be randomly allocated into experimental or
      control group by a computer program (stratification of the severity of the cognitive decline
      according to the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) scores of above or below 23 points).
      The experimental group participants will receive the TECH protocol, while participants in the
      control group will continue to receive standard care. Following the intervention a second
      assessment will be performed, as well as follow-up assessment six months later.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>WebNeuro</measure>
    <time_frame>20 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>A computerized web-based battery assessment of neurocognitive functioning. The battery will include seven subtests that examine three cognitive domains: memory (Memory recognition/verbal list-learning task), executive planning (Switching of attention test, Verbal interference test, Maze test, Go-no-go test), and attention (Digit span test, Continuous performance test).</description>

    <measure>The Montreal Cognitive Assessment</measure>
    <time_frame>10 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>A cognitive screening tool with high sensitivity and specificity, aimed to distinguish individuals with MCI from healthy adults. The MoCA assesses eight cognitive domains: attention and concentration, executive functions, memory, language, visuo-constructional skills, conceptual thinking, calculations, and orientation.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The Tower of Hanoi (ToH) task</measure>
    <time_frame>10 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>A commonly used goal-directed measure assessing problem-solving, and specifically, planning. The ToH consists of three bars and three to eight different-sized disks that can slide onto any bar. The objective of the task is to move an entire stack (organized in ascending order of size on one bar) to another bar while obeying two rules: Only one disk can be moved at a time and no disk may be placed on top of a smaller disk. The score of the task is the number of moves for achieving each level. A computerized version of the task will be used (http://vornlocher.de/tower).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>The 12-Item Short Form Health Survey (SF-12)</measure>
    <time_frame>8 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>SF-12 includes 12 questions from the SF-36 Health Survey. The SF-36 is a widely used and investigated, and validated instrument for measuring quality of life. The SF-12 was developed using normative data for the SF-36 in the United States. The shorter version designed to reproduce the Physical and the Mental Components Summary scores.
A greater score indicates better health measures.</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>General Self-Efficacy Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>8 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>Designed to assess optimistic self-beliefs to cope with a variety of difficult demands in life. It consists 10 statements such as 'I can solve most problems if I invest the necessary effort'. Possible responses are scored 1-4 (1 - not at all true to 4 - exactly true), the total score range from 10 to 40. Higher scores represent higher levels of general selfefficacy.</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>The Lawton Instrumental Activities of Daily Living (IADL) Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>8 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>This reliable and valid self-report measurement consists of eight items (telephone use, shopping groceries, food preparation, housekeeping, laundry, transportation, medication use, and handling finances). Each item has three answer categories (not able, able with support, independent). The total score ranges from 0 (completely dependent) to 23 (completely independent).</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>The Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS)</measure>
    <time_frame>8 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>Valid and reliable self-rating screening tool developed to detect depressive symptoms in elderly (D'ath, Katona, Mullan, Evans, &amp; Katona, 1994; Lesher &amp; Berryhill, 1994). The questionnaire includes 15 yes/no statements and takes up to10 minutes to complete. Score above 10 points indicates the presence of depressive symptoms (Yesavage et al., 1983).</description>

    <description>TECH protocol - Daily self-training using tablet apps facilitated by weekly group sessions. The self-training will take place independently at participants' home and will include mostly playing puzzle-apps to train different cognitive components. Participants will be requested to play (and log) various apps three to five times a week for 30-60 minutes each time, for a total of 15-25 training sessions. In addition they will use the tablets for a variety of everyday uses. The individual self-training will be accompanied by five weekly sessions (of 60-90 minutes) in a small group setting (5-6 participants) led by an experienced occupational therapist.</description>
