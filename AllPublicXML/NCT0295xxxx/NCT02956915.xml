  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) has been rapidly adopted worldwide since the
      first-in-man TAVI performed in 2002. With increasing experience and improvements in valve
      design, the &quot;minimalist&quot; approach to transfemoral TAVI (using local anesthesia and
      fluoroscopic guidance) has become an attractive concept, and the technical feasibility of
      this approach has been well documented.

      While earlier data showed prolonged length of stay after TF-TAVI [10.5 ± 8.1 days in the
      FRANCE 2 registry and 10.2 ± 11.1 days in the PARTNER Cohort A data, the UK TAVI registry
      (reference) showed a decline in post-TAVI length of stay from 10 days to 8 days over the time
      period of 2007 to 2012. More contemporary data from other centers has been published showing
      that 23% of TF-TAVI patients were discharged within 3 days after TAVI. With an increasingly
      minimalist approach to TF-TAVI, the duration of monitoring required post-procedure remains
      indeterminate with a lack of formal consensus.

      Early discharge (within 3 days of TAVI) is hypothesized to have multiple potential
      advantages, including reduction in unnecessarily lengthy hospitalization of frail and elderly
      patients in addition to cost-saving benefits. Rouen University Hospital has previously
      published a retrospective study on the feasibility and safety of early discharge, in which
      discharge within 72 hours of uncomplicated TF-TAVI was safe and attained in 36% of our
      patients. Pre-existing pacemaker and the absence of acute kidney injury were independent
      predictors of a successful early discharge. Moreover, in a prospective study, Rouen
      University Hospital recently shown that early discharge afterelective TF-TAVI with
      SAPIEN-XT/SAPIEN-3 prostheses was attainable in a large proportion of patients (59%) with no
      evident compromise in safety. Factors associated with failure of early discharge were
      postprocedural blood transfusion and permanent pacemaker implantation. But currently, there
      are no guidelines for the length of stay after a TF-TAVI.
