  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the usability and pilot testing for the project &quot;Developing a Bi-national
      Buddy Intervention for Smoking Cessation and Cultural Education&quot; is to better understand how
      users interact with the smoking cessation app, and to improve the product based on the
      results. In pilot testing the smoking cessation app the investigators will examine the
      feasibility of our approach. The usability testing portion of the study is intended primarily
      to improve on the design of the smoking cessation app, and will: gather quantitative data on
      participant's performance, identify usability problems, and determine user satisfaction with
      the app. The pilot testing portion of the study will evaluate the feasibility, time, cost and
      statistical variability in an attempt to predict an appropriate sample size and improve upon
      the study design prior to performance of a full-scale research study.

      Objective 1:To collect quantitative data on participant's performance while using the app for
      smoking cessation.

      Objective 2:To identify problems with usability of the smoking cessation buddy app.

      Objective 3:To assess user satisfaction with the smoking cessation buddy app. Objective 4:To
      improve upon the design of the smoking cessation buddy app Objective 5:To assess the
      feasibility, time, cost, and statistical variability for a full-scale implementation of this
      study with the intervention group.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Tobacco use cessation among youth is not adequately addressed in the US and Russia. The
      proposed intervention utilizes an innovative evidence-based approach while addressing the
      shortcomings of prior individual intervention components. In this project, investigators seek
      to refine a smoking cessation app by conducting two rounds of usability testing followed by a
      pilot test of the final app, to access usability problems, user satisfaction, and
      user-friendliness. This data will be collected in a de-identified and confidential manner,
      and will then be analyzed and used to refine the final app that will later be used.

    <description>The app will be downloaded on participants' phones, and used by the participant for 30 days to make a quit attempt. Participants will be encouraged to use the app every day and to utilize all of its features, including features such as setting a quit date, taking the assessment section, and entering cigarette use and reasons for cravings</description>
