  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this Phase 1b study is to assess the safety and maximum tolerated dose (MTD)
      of Decitabine in combination with Gemcitabine among previously treated patients diagnosed
      with advanced pancreatic adenocarcinoma or sarcoma (soft tissue and bone).

      The objectives of this study are to assess the safety and tolerability of the combination of
      Decitabine with Gemcitabine in previously treated patients with advanced pancreatic cancer
      and advanced sarcoma and to define the recommended Phase II dose and describe the
      dose-limiting toxicity of the combination of Decitabine with Gemcitabine. The preliminary
      efficacy parameters of the combination of Decitabine with Gemcitabine will be estimated in
      terms of response rate and disease control rate and progression-free survival.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients must have metastatic histologically or cytologically confirmed pancreatic
             adenocarcinoma or sarcoma (soft tissue or bone) for which progression was documented
             for at least one line of therapy.

          2. Age ≥18 years.

          3. ECOG performance status ≤2 (Karnofsky ≥60% (See Appendix 1).

          4. Life expectancy of greater than 3 months (does not apply to pancreatic cancer
             population).

          5. Measureable disease per RECIST criteria.

          6. Patients must have normal organ and marrow function as defined below:

               -  Absolute neutrophil count ≥1,500/mm3

               -  Platelets ≥100 k/mm3

               -  Total bilirubin within normal institutional limits

             administered to &lt;/= grade 1 or stable grade 2, at the discretion of the treating
             physician.

          2. Patients who are receiving any other investigational agents.

             composition to Decitabine or other agents used in study.

          5. Prior Decitabine for the treatment of this cancer. Patients with previous exposure to
             therapy with Gemcitabine are allowed in the study.

          6. Pregnant or breast feeding women are excluded from participating in this study. WOCBP
             must have a negative serum pregnancy test within 7 days of the first administration of
             Decitabine.

          7. Patients with known positivity for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) or hepatitis C;
             baseline testing for HIV and hepatitis C is not required.

          8. Patients with any significant history of non-compliance to medical regimens or with
             inability to grant a reliable informed consent.

          9. Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac
             arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with
             study requirements.
