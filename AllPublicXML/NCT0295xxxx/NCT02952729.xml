    <textblock>
      This Phase 1b trial is an open label, multi-center study of XMT-1522 administered as an
      intravenous infusion once every three weeks. The dose escalation part of the study will
      establish the maximum tolerated dose or recommended Phase 2 dose for in patients with
      advanced breast cancer and either a HER2 immunohistochemistry (IHC) score of at least 1+
      using a validated IHC assay or with evidence of HER2 amplification. Patients with HER2
      positive (by IHC or amplification) gastric cancer or nonsmall cell lung cancer may also be
      eligible for participation in dose escalation. Upon completion of dose escalation, the cohort
      expansion segment of the study will consist of four parallel cohorts of different patients
      groups to confirm the maximum tolerated dose or the recommended Phase 2 dose and estimate the
      objective response in each of the patient populations.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The dose escalation segment of the study utilizes a 3+3 design. Initially, 3 patients will be
      dosed at each dose level. The first 3-week cycle of treatment constitutes the dose limiting
      toxicity (DLT) evaluation period. If none of the 3 patients experience a DLT during the
      evaluation period and the Safety Review Committee agrees this was a reasonably well tolerated
      dose, 3 patients will be enrolled at the next dose level. However, in the event of 1 DLT, 3
      additional patients will be enrolled at the same dose level. Any dose level with 2 or more
      DLTs will be considered to have exceeded the maximum tolerated dose and subsequent patients
      will be enrolled at lower dose levels. After the first cycle, patients may continue to
      receive XMT-1522 until disease progression as long as the drug is well-tolerated and patients
      continue to derive clinical benefit in the opinion of the Investigator.

      After completion of the dose escalation, the expansion segment will enroll the patients with
      the following kinds of cancer:

        -  Cohort 1: Advanced breast cancer, HER2 IHC 1+, or HER2 IHC 2+ without HER2 gene
           amplification

        -  Cohort 2: Advanced breast cancer, HER2-positive, who have received prior ado-trastuzumab
           emtansine

        -  Cohort 3: Advanced gastric cancer, HER2-positive, who have received prior trastuzumab

        -  Cohort 4: Advanced non-small cell lung cancer, HER2 IHC 2+ or 3+, any HER2 gene
           amplification or mutation status
