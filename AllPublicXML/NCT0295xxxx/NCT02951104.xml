    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion criteria:

          -  Age &gt; 18 years

          -  Diagnosis of Group 1 or Group 4 PAH based on PAPm &gt; 25 mmHg, PAWP &lt;15 mmHg, PVR &gt;3 WU
             and consistent clinical history. Note: for logistical reasons, patients at high
             suspicion for Group 1 or Group 4 PAH will sign informed consent to have the NICOM
             device applied during right heart catheterization before the procedure; if it is found
             that the patient does not meet the definition of Group 1 or Group 4 PAH during right
             heart catheterization, he/she will be excluded.

          -  Willingness and ability to comply with study procedures.

          -  No known hypersensitivity to the components of NICOM electrodes

        Exclusion criteria:

          -  Unwillingness to sign informed consent or inability or unwillingness to comply with
             study procedures

          -  Evidence of postcapillary pulmonary hypertension on right heart catheterization
