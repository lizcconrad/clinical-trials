  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Actinic keratosis are of utmost medical and economical interest because of their high
      prevalence (20 % of 60 year-old people and older in the Northern hemisphere) and their
      important cosmetic impact as such actinic keratosis mostly appear on photo-exposed skin
      sites. The surgeon in charge of such lesions' removal (i) some actinic keratosis adjoining
      carcinoma to be resected therefore causing the problem of functional areas damaging (eyelids,
      lips, etc.) or (ii) numerous actinic keratosis localized away from carcinoma
      (photo-carcinogenesis field) faces the issue of clinical evaluation of such lesions: which
      ones will spontaneously regress (it is supposed to be the case for 20 % of such
      lesions);which ones will remain and which ones will develop into invasive carcinomas ?

      A non-invasive, non-traumatic, automated and real-time help for the clinical diagnosis
      orientation of such skin lesions could help improving diagnosis accuracy of the medical
      practitioner's visual inspection:

        -  In terms of sensitivity in order to potentially decrease the number of actinic keratosis
           evolving towards invasive carcinoma,

        -  In terms of specificity in order to potentially decrease useless resections and reduce
           resection margins and therefore reduce scars surface.
