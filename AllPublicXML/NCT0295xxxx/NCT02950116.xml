  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic respiratory diseases (CRDs) affect the airways and other structures of the lungs and
      thereby lead to ventilation inhomogeneity. The most common CRDs in children are asthma,
      bronchiectasis and cystic fibrosis (CF). All three are obstructive diseases. However, while
      asthma is mostly characterized by obstruction due to bronchoconstriction of the airways,
      obstruction in bronchiectasis and CF originates primarily from mucus retention due to
      abnormal airway clearance mechanisms.

      The Nitrogen Multiple Breath Washout test (N2-MBW-test) is a robust and sensitive detector of
      early pulmonary changes and ventilation inhomogeneity. The minimal cooperation which is
      required for this test makes it very convenient for use in any age category.

      Research on LCI described it as a reliable indicator of obstructive lung disease in pediatric
      CF patients as from 6 years of age. Whether LCI is a reliable parameter for early lung
      disease in asthma children is less clearly demonstrated. No data were found on LCI calculated
      from the N2-MBW-test in children with bronchiectasis.

      Subjects of all the intervention groups will perform three consecutive nitrogen multiple
      breath washout tests (N2-MBW-tests) when attending the Universitair Ziekenhuis Brussel (UZB)
      for their scheduled pulmonology consultation. Only the best measurement (based on LCI result)
      will be taken into account when comparing the groups. Every subject will be positioned in the
      same seated position.

    <description>Patient is sitting in upright position, nose clip in place and breathing through a mouth piece with filter (neither sitting forward with back bent, nor supporting arms such that shoulders are raised)
Patient's breathing pattern is stable for a minimum of 5 breaths
Start of washout by inhaling 100% oxygen (initiated by lab technician)
Continuous stable breathing pattern until end of washout test
End target = 1/40th of start N2 concentration
To ensure end of washout is achieved, patients should breathe 5 more breaths below the target concentration before the trial is terminated
Three N2-MBW-tests are performed consecutively. Time between each test is [duration of the previous test*1.5] (e.g. test duration = 6 min., time to next test = 6*1.5 = 9 min.)</description>
