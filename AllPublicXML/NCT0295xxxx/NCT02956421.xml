      Phase II clinical study for an investigational PIKA(Polyinosinic Polycytidylic Acid Based
      Adjuvant) rabies vaccine comprising Inactivated and Purified Rabies Virus (IPRV) and the PIKA
      adjuvant. The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety profile
      of the vaccine composition in healthy adult volunteers under the accelerated regimen. The
      secondary objective is to achieve higher seroconversion of the vaccine under accelerated
      regimen at Day 7.

    <textblock>
      A multi-center, open labelled, randomized study in healthy naïve adult subjects. Subjects
      were randomly assigned to groups A (60) and B (60). Group A as a control arm of the study,
      had received a commercially available rabies vaccine, RABIPUR®. Group B had received doses of
      the investigational PIKA rabies vaccine in an accelerated regimen.

      Group A followed the vaccine regimen of (1-1-1-1),one injection on days 0, 3, 7 and 14 was
      administered respectively. Group B received the accelerated regimen (2-2-1), two injections
      on both days 0 and 3 were administered in different arms; and only one injection was
      administered on day 7.

      Each vaccine dose comprise 1.0 ml of PIKA rabies vaccine for Group B and 1.0 ml of RABIPUR®
      for Group A after reconstitution. The route of administration is intramuscular injection,
      given in the deltoid region of the arm.
