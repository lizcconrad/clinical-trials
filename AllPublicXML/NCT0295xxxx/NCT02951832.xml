      The investigators are going to select the normal child-bearing period women as the study
      subjects and draw their peripheral blood to observe and analyze the change of quantity and
      percentage of lymphocyte subsets along with the change of menstrual cycle.

      Recording their BMI\menstrual history\and childbearing history, the investigators would
      select 300 healthy women in 6 different age groups which are aged 20-24, aged 25-29, aged
      30-34, aged35-39, aged 40-44 and aged 45-49, then draw 1-2 ml blood form their peripheral
      vein (adding EDTA for anti-coagulation). The investigators are going to perform routine
      examination on the blood samples and detect T\B\NK lymphocyte through flow cytometry (FCM),
      thus calculating the absolute number of every species of lymphocyte. The investigators make
      assessment for the cellular immune function of the women during child-bearing period via
      comparing distinction in percentage and absolute number of every lymphocyte subset among
      reproductive-age women in different ages.
