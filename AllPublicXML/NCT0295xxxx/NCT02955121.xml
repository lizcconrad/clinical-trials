      Randomized controlled study to examine physician use of pharmacogenetic information in
      patients receiving antiplatelet medication after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI).
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will randomize patients who have completed PCI and who are prescribed dual
      antiplatelet therapy to a genotype guided arm, in which CYP2C19 pharmacogenetic testing will
      be performed and a standard therapy arm without genetic testing. The study will examine the
      impact of pharmacogenetic testing on physician medication choice and clinical outcomes.
