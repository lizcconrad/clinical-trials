  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A genomics-based approach will target specific genes that may explain the response in
      biomarkers and symptoms before and after supplementation. One objective is to generate
      evidence-based recommendations for vitamin D supplementation in Soldiers who often experience
      musculoskeletal disorders and immune dysfunction impacting physical performance and military
      readiness. The investigation is designed to address these specific aims: 1) explore vitamin D
      status in 105 Service Members to determine common symptoms associated with deficiency; 2)
      examine the effect of vitamin D levels on gene expression from select genes known to
      influence metabolism, bone density, and immune function; and 3) evaluate changes in gene
      expression between groups receiving high or low supplementation, and compare to healthy
      controls. Follow-up at 15 months will evaluate circulating vitamin D.

    <textblock>
      A genomics-based approach will target identified candidate genes and search for variants that
      may explain the response observed in biomarkers and symptoms when deficient individuals are
      repleted. The long-term objective of this study is to translate findings from next-generation
      sequencing (NGS) technology into clinically meaningful data regarding vitamin D
      supplementation for Service Members (SM) who may be at risk for musculoskeletal disorders and
      immune dysfunction that impacts physical performance and military readiness. We propose the
      following specific aims: 1) explore the phenotypic expression of vitamin D status in a cohort
      of SM to determine common symptoms associated with deficiency/insufficiency states; 2)
      examine the effect of vitamin D levels on broad gene expression from carefully chosen
      candidate genes known to influence vitamin D status, bone density, and immune function; 3)
      evaluate changes in gene expression levels between and within groups supplemented with low vs
      high vitamin D, and compare to healthy controls, and 4) examine the relationship between
      vitamin D deficiency and the clinically relevant outcomes of stress fracture and high blood
      pressure before and after supplementation to a therapeutic plasma level of 25(OH)D. This
      prospective, randomized, double-blind trial will enroll 105 SM in the Northwest to evaluate
      frequency, symptoms, and genomic expression of vitamin D levels using survey instruments,
      immunologic and bone biomarkers, and NGS of white blood cells pre- and post-supplementation
      with oral vitamin D over 3 months. Participant follow-up at 12 months will evaluate
      maintenance of adequate circulating vitamin D; this timeframe represents a typical deployment
      period.
