    <textblock>
      HTL0018318 is a selective muscarinc M1 agonist. This study is a phase I, open label,
      randomised, crossover, single dose, trial in healthy volunteers to compare the relative

          1. Male or female healthy volunteer.

          2. Aged 18-55 years.

          3. A body mass index (Quetelet index) in the range 18.0-34.

          4. Sufficient intelligence to understand the nature of the trial and any hazards of
             participating in it. Ability to communicate satisfactorily with the investigator and
             to participate in, and comply with the requirements of, the entire trial.

          5. Willingness to comply with the contraception requirements of the trial.

          6. Willingness to give written consent to participate after reading the information and
             consent form, and after having the opportunity to discuss the trial with the
             investigator or his delegate.

          7. Willingness to give written consent to have data entered into The Overvolunteering
             Prevention System.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Clinically relevant abnormal history, physical findings, ECG, or laboratory values at
             the pre-trial screening assessment that could interfere with the objectives of the
             trial or the safety of the volunteer.

          2. QTcF outside range 300-450 msec for males, and 300-470 msec for females at resting ECG
             at screening and baseline.

          3. Family history of unexplained sudden death, or sudden death due to long QT syndrome.

          4. Clinically relevant abnormal findings based on 24 h ECG Holter monitoring during
             screening, including any of the following: &gt; 200 ventricular ectopic heart beats,
             ventricular tachycardia, defined as &gt;= 3 successive ventricular ectopic beats at a
             rate of &gt;120 bpm, second degree heart block, sustained cardiac arrhythmias, including
             atrial fibrillation, complete heart block and supraventricular tachycardia (SVT), any
             symptomatic arrhythmia except isolated extra systoles.

          5. Aspartate transaminase (AST), alanine transaminase (ALT), gamma glutamyl transferase
             (GGT) or total bilirubin &gt;1.5 x ULN at screening, or other laboratory blood chemistry
             test results outside the normal reference range unless deemed not clinically
             significant by the investigator.

          6. Clinically significant renal insufficiency as indicated by a glomerular filtration
             rate lower than the age-related L at screening. In the event of a glomerular
             filtration rate &gt;80, eligibility may be confirmed by a second measurement.

          7. Blood pressure and heart rate in supine position at the screening examination outside
             the ranges 90-140 mm Hg systolic, 50-90 mm Hg diastolic; heart rate 45-100 beats/min.
             Subject with borderline values can be included if the values are deemed not clinically
             significant by the investigator.

          8. Presence of acute or chronic illness or history of chronic illness sufficient to
             invalidate the volunteer's participation in the trial or make it unnecessarily
             hazardous.

             nutritional supplement, during the 21 days before the first dose of trial medication
             until the end of the study, with the exception of acetaminophen (paracetamol),
             hormonal contraceptives or hormone replacement therapy (HRT).

         17. Presence or history of drug or alcohol abuse in the last 5 years, or intake of more
             than 21 units of alcohol weekly (for men) or 14 units of alcohol weekly (for women),
             or use of cigarettes or nicotine-containing products during the 3 months before the
             first dose until the end of the study.

         18. Evidence of drug abuse on urine testing.

         19. Positive test for hepatitis B, hepatitis C or HIV.

         20. Positive test for alcohol or smoking before dosing.

         21. Participation in another clinical trial of a new chemical entity or a prescription
             medicine within the previous 3 months.

         22. Loss of more than 500 mL blood during the 3 months before the trial, eg as a blood
             donor.
