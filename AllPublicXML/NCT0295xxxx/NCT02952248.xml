  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main objective of the dose-escalation part of the trial is to determine the safety and
      tolerability, and to determine the Maximum Tolerated Dose and/or the Recommended Phase 2 Dose
      (RP2D) of BI 754091 on the basis of patients with dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) in patients
      with selected advanced solid malignancies. Safety and tolerability will be evaluated by
      monitoring the occurrence of adverse events (AEs), serious AEs (SAE), and laboratory
      parameter abnormalities, as well as changes to vital signs.

      Secondary objectives are the determination of the PK profile of BI 754091 after single and
      multiple doses of BI 754091, and the preliminary assessment of antitumour activity.

      In the dose-expansion part of the trial, the main objectives are to further assess the
      safety, efficacy, PK profile, and biomarkers of BI 754091in tumours with specific tumour
      types and/or genetic mutations at the RP2D.

               -  Ejection fraction (EF) &lt;55% or the lower limit of normal of the institutional

                  physician or both) suspects cardiac disease with negative effect on the EF will
                  the EF be measured during screening using an appropriate method according to
                  local standards to confirm eligibility (e.g., echocardiogram [ECHO], multi-gated
                  acquisition scan [MUGA]). A historic measurement of EF no older than 6 months

          -  Interstitial lung disease

          -  Chronic alcohol or drug abuse or any condition that, in the Investigator's opinion,
             makes him/her an unreliable trial subject, unlikely to complete the trial, or unable
