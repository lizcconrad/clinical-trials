    <textblock>
      Fetal heart rate [FHR] monitoring is used widely to assess the well-being of the baby in the
      delivery period. If it is determined that an urgent cesarean delivery is required because of
      fetal distress, FHR is discontinued once the mother is in the operating room in order to
      allow for surgical site preparation. From this point, there is no real-time monitoring that
      permits assessment of the well-being of the infant. The investigators are evaluating the
      feasibility of intraoperative FHR monitoring using fetal ECG placed on the mother's upper
      abdominal wall and the standard acoustic device routinely used. The investigators will
      compare these to the traditional well-being tests: umbilical arterial blood gas and Apgar
      score.

      The first 15 subjects will be recruited from pregnant women who have scheduled induction of
      labor. The subsequent 40 subjects will be recruited from pregnant women who have scheduled
      cesarean sections.

    <textblock>
      Fetal heart rate (FHR) monitoring has become the most widely used assessment of fetal
      well-being in the peripartum period and the only routinely used method that provides
      continuous fetal monitoring. Despite a false positive rate for the detection of intrapartum
      asphyxia leading to cerebral palsy of over 99% [1-3] FHR monitoring continues to be the
      mainstay of peripartum fetal surveillance. FHR monitoring is routinely available in the
      operating room, where it is typically reassessed in cases of urgent cesarean delivery for
      fetal distress since it may direct immediate anesthetic and peripartum management. However,
      despite the ubiquitous use of FHR monitoring in labor and the typical use of FHR monitoring
      on arrival to the OR, FHR monitoring is universally stopped once anesthesia has been
      performed in order to allow abdominal skin preparation and for surgery to proceed. From the
      moment of anesthesia induction until fetal delivery, no real-time data is available that
      allows assessment of fetal well-being. A few isolated studies and case reports in the
      1970s-1980s examined intraoperative FHR monitoring using scalp-clip electrodes during
      Cesarean deliveries [4-7]. None of these studies assessed external FHR monitors or current
      anesthesia techniques. To the investigators' knowledge no studies since that time have
      examined FHR monitoring during Cesarean deliveries using external monitoring or spinal
      anesthesia
