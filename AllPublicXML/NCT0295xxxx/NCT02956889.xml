      This is a Fleming-A' Hern, single arm, multicenter, no-profit, phase II study of radiotherapy
      and Vismodegib in adult patients with high risk or locally advanced basal cell carcinoma not
      amenable to radical surgery cell carcinoma (BCC) (comparator: not applicable).

      The recruitment period is expected to be approximately 24 months. The trial will consist of a
      Screening/Baseline period (Day -28 to -1), a Treatment Period when patients will be treated
      with radiotherapy (4 weeks) followed by Vismodegib 150 mg/die continuously for six cycles (24
      weeks).

      The study will end 14 months after start of treatment of the last patient enrolled and
      evaluable according to primary end point.

      This is a Fleming-A' Hern, single arm, multicenter, no-profit, phase II study of radiotherapy
      and Vismodegib in adult patients with high risk or locally advanced basal cell carcinoma not
      amenable to radical surgery cell carcinoma (BCC) (comparator: not applicable).

      The recruitment period is expected to be approximately 24 months. The trial will consist of a
      Screening/Baseline period (Day -28 to -1), a Treatment Period when patients will be treated
      with radiotherapy (4 weeks) followed by Vismodegib 150 mg/die continuously for six cycles (24
      weeks).

      The study will end 14 months after start of treatment of the last patient enrolled and
      evaluable according to primary end point.

      The primary objective is to evaluate the activity of the study therapy (radiotherapy followed
      by six cycles of Vismodegib 150 mg/d continuously) in terms of proportion of patients
      progression free at 12 months.

      The secondary objectives are: to evaluate the efficacy of the study therapy in terms of
      progression free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS); to assess the response in terms of
      overall response rate (ORR) (complete response (CR), partial response (PR), stable disease
      (SD), progressive disease (PD)); to assess duration of response (DoR); to assess the safety
      in terms of incidence, type, and severity of adverse events (AEs) and serious adverse events
      (SAEs) ;to measure the effects of skin disease on quality of life (QoL) of patients under
      therapy (Skindex-16)

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Written, signed informed consent

          2. Age ≥ 18 years

          3. Histopathologic confirmation that the lesion is BCC before enrollment

          4. Patients with high risk of relapse BCC not undergone radical surgery, for which
             treating physician must consider the disease to be no more operable.

          5. Clinical features defining high risk of relapse include infiltrative growth margins,
             size, tumor location, histological subtype (the morpheaform, the sclerosing, the
             infiltrating, the micronodular and the metatypical subtypes are associated with higher
             risk of relapse as compared to the risk associated with the superficial and the
             nodular types), recurrent-refractory tumors (see Table 1), basal cell carcinoma size
             (largest tumor diameter) ≤ 5 cm for head and neck tumors

          6. Clinical features for definition of &quot;BCC not amenable for radical surgery&quot; include:

               -  BCC that has recurred in the same location after minimum 2 surgical procedures
                  (excluding biopsies) and/or curative resection is deemed unlikely

               -  multifocal BCC or extensive tumors (see table 1) with bleeding or infected areas

               -  anticipated substantial morbidity and/or deformity from surgery (e.g., removal of
                  all or part of a facial structure, such as nose, ear, eyelid, eye; or requirement
                  for limb amputation)

          7. Patients with BCCs localized where surgery is technically difficult, or would result
             in unacceptable tissue destruction

          8. Patients with a clinical contraindication to surgery

          9. Previous radiotherapy on other BCC

         10. Patients with measurable and/or non-measurable disease (as defined by RECIST, v1.1)
             are allowed

         11. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0-1

         12. Adequate hematopoietic capacity, defined as the following:

               -  Hemoglobin : 8.5 g/dl

               -  Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥ 1500/mL

               -  Platelet count ≥ 75,000/mL

         13. Adequate hepatic function, defined as the following:

             Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) ≤ 3 times the
             upper limit of normal (ULN)Total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 × ULN or within 3 × ULN for patients
             with documented Gilbert syndrome. Adequate renal function, defined by calculated serum
             creatinine clearance (CrCl) ≥ 30 mL/min

         14. For women of childbearing potential, a negative serum pregnancy test within 7days
             prior to commencement of dosing is required.

         15. Women of child-bearing potential must use two methods of acceptable contraception
             including one highly effective method and a barrier method, as directed by their
             physician, during treatment and for at least 24 months after completion of study
             treatment. Highly effective methods of contraception are defined as those which result
             in a low failure rate (i.e., less than 1% per year) when used consistently and
             correctly (e.g., implants, injectables, combined oral contraception, or intra-uterine
             devices). At the discretion of the Investigator, acceptable methods of contraception
             may include total abstinence. Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation,
             symptothermal, and post ovulation methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods
             of contraception (See Appendix B).

         16. For male patients with female partners of childbearing potential, agreement to use a
             condom, even after a vasectomy, during sexual intercourse with female partners while
             being treated with Vismodegib, and for 2 months after completion of study treatment

         17. Agreement not to donate blood or blood products during the study and for at least 24
             months after completion of study treatment (Vismodegib).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Inability or unwillingness to swallow capsules

          2. Inability or unwillingness to comply with study procedures

          3. Pregnancy or lactation (lactation not allowed for at least 24 months after completion
             of study treatment)

          4. Concurrent non-protocol-specified anti-tumor therapy (e.g., chemotherapy, other
             targeted therapy, photodynamic therapy, including participation in an experimental
             drug study)

          5. Metastatic BCC

          6. Gorlin Syndrome or any other contraindication to radiotherapy

          7. Recent (i.e., within the past 28 days prior to enrollment in this study) or current
             participation in another experimental drug study

          8. Uncontrolled medical illness, including advanced malignancies, at the discretion of
             the Investigator

          9. History of other disease, metabolic dysfunction, physical examination finding, or
             clinical laboratory finding giving reasonable suspicion of a disease or condition that
             contraindicates the use of an investigational drug or that might affect interpretation
             of the results of the study or renders the patient at high risk for treatment
             complications
