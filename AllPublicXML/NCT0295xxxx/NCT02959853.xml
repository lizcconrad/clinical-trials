  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      After the age of 40, there is a gradual decline in the production of testosterone. Among
      obese men, the decline in testosterone levels is exacerbated by the suppression of the
      hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis by hyperestrogenemia. The high expression of aromatase
      enzyme in the adipose tissue enhances the conversion of androgens into estrogens which in
      turn exert a negative feedback on the hypothalamus and pituitary, leading to the inhibition
      of production of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH), luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle
      stimulating hormone (FSH), and as a consequence, of testosterone by the testis resulting in
      hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (HH). Though bone loss is a well recognized side effect of AI
      in certain populations, such as women with breast cancer, HH obese men present high levels of
      circulating estrogens that could potentially prevent them from bone loss, estradiol being the
      main regulator of the male skeleton. This study is designed to determine if aromatase
      inhibitors in combination with weight loss, compared to weight loss alone, will have a
      positive effect on muscle strength, symptoms of hypogonadism, and body composition without
      negatively impacting bone mineral density and bone quality. Results from this study will help
      determine if certain groups of obese patients would benefit from therapy with aromatase
      inhibitors.
