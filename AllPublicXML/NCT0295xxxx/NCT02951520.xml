  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to describe and to evaluate the effectiveness (success rate) of a supine
      ultrasound (US) guided single-puncture sciatic, obturator and femoral neve block technique
      (SOFT block) in knee surgery.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Under aseptic technique, all the patients will receive US-guided femoral, obturator and
      sciatic nerve blocks using a single puncture point. All blocks will be performed by an expert
      anesthetist. The femoral nerve will be blocked lateral to the femoral artery. The obturator
      nerve will be blocked after it exits the obturator canal (deep to pectineus muscle). While
      the sciatic nerve will be blocked deep (posterior) to the inferior border of quadratus
      femoris muscle. The motor block of the femoral, obturator and sciatic nerves and sensory
      block of the lateral femoral cutaneous nerve (LFCN) will be assessed before shifting the
      patient to the operating room.

      The performance time, patient discomfort, technique success rate, the associated successful
      LFCN block and any complication will be recorded by the assistant. All patients were assessed
      neurologically before discharge and during the physiotherapy visits for 3 weak after surgery.

    <description>The patients will be in supine position. The block needle will be inserted at the inguinal crease (medial to the femoral vein) and advanced towards the femoral nerve, then redirected towards the obturator nerve (deep to the pectineus muscle). Lastly, it will be redirected posteriorly towards the sciatic nerve (deep to the quadratus femoris muscle). A ropivacaine-lidocaine-epinephrine mixture will be used to block these nerves. The block success rate (painless surgery), performance time and patient discomfort will be recorded.</description>
