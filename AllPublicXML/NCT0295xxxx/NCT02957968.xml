  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a 2-cohort, open-label, multicenter, phase 2 study of a short course of
      immunotherapy consisting of sequential decitabine followed by pembrolizumab administered
      prior to a standard neoadjuvant chemotherapy regimen for patients with locally advanced
      HER2-negative breast cancer. The primary efficacy objective is to determine if the
      immunotherapy increases the presence and percentage of tumor and/or stromal area of
      infiltrating lymphocytes prior to initiation of standard neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Efficacy
      will be evaluated in 2 cohorts based on hormone receptor status.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Both cohorts will receive the identical doses and treatment schedules of decitabine and
      pembrolizumab followed by a standard neoadjuvant chemotherapy regimen. Both cohorts will
      receive 4 cycles of dose-dense AC followed by 12 doses of weekly paclitaxel. Paclitaxel will
      be combined with carboplatin for Cohort A (TNBC). The primary safety objective will be to
      evaluate the safety and toxicity of sequential decitabine plus pembrolizumab followed by
      dose-dense AC, weekly paclitaxel (or paclitaxel plus carboplatin) administered as neoadjuvant
      therapy. If the breast tumor is resectable following completion of all protocol therapy,
      breast-conserving surgery or mastectomy and axillary surgical staging (either sentinel node
      biopsy and/or axillary dissection) will be performed.
