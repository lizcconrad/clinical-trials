        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Signed Informed Consent

          2. Healthy men and women (not of child bearing potential) as determined by medical
             history, surgical history, physical examination, vital signs, electrocardiogram (ECG),
             and clinical laboratory tests including coagulation parameters.

          3. Subjects with body mass index of 18 to 30 kg/m2, inclusive and with normal kidney
             function.

          4. Women participants must have documented proof that they are not of childbearing
             potential.

          5. Men who are sexually active with WOCBP must agree to follow instructions for method(s)
             of contraception for the duration of treatment with BMS-986177 plus 5 half-lives (3
             days) plus 90 days (duration of sperm turnover) for a total of 93 days after
             completion of BMS-986177 treatment.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Any significant acute or chronic medical illness, including any other condition listed
             as a contraindication in the rifampin package insert

             months.

          4. Evidence of organ dysfunction or any clinically significant deviation from normal in
             physical examination, vital signs, ECGs, or clinical laboratory determinations beyond
             what is consistent with the target population

          5. History of allergy to BMS-986177, FXIa inhibitors , rifampin or related compounds
