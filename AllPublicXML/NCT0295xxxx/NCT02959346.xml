  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Minimal invasive thoracoscopic surgery has been used widely for common thoracic diseases in
      recent years. Patients who received thoracoscopic surgery recovered much quickly and returned
      to their daily life sooner because of small operation wound and less invasion. However,
      operative pain was still an important factor, which might contribute to several
      post-operative complications.

      In daily practice, patients received oral/intravenous form non-steroidal anti-inflammatory
      drugs and opioid agents, or patient-controlled analgesia for post operative pain control.
      However, some side effects were observed occasionally.

      The role of acupuncture in post-operative pain control was frequently discussed in recent
      research. The main mechanisms of acupuncture in pain control were (1) to stimulate the
      release of endogenous opioid and (2) to block TRPV1 receptor.

      The randomized controlled trial arranged by Gary Deng and his colleagues in 2008, was the
      first clinical trial investigated the role of acupuncture in post-operative pain control for
      traditional thoracotomy patients. However, there was no further research about the role of
      acupuncture applied to minimal invasive thoracoscopic surgery.

      Thus, the aim of this randomized controlled trial was to investigate the role of acupuncture
      in post-operative pain control for minimal invasive thoracoscopic surgery patients. In order
      to deliver a safe and effective way in pain control, and to save medical cost and promote
      quality of patient care.

    <description>Procedure:
Sham Acupuncture(ipisilateral side, 0.3cun, No needle sensation (de qi) was elicited) Sham acupuncture will be applied by inserting acupuncture needle into acupoints(1cm away from the true acupoint):upper limb: Waiguan TE5; lower limb: Zusanli ST36.
All procedures were carried out to a depth of 0.5 cm with disposable needles measuring 0.16 mm in diameter (40-gauge) and 12.7 mm in length (Yu Kuang, Taipei, Taiwan).
Acupuncture treatment will consist of one session per day and consecutive three days after thoracoscopic surgery.</description>
