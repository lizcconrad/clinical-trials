  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In total 200 subjects with diagnosis of sepsis, are planned for inclusion in this trial.
      After signing an informed consent a blood sample will be obtained from each participant. The
      investigators will measure the thrombin generation in plasma assessed by the calibrated
      automated thrombogram (CAT). Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score SOFA will be
      calculated. The relation between SOFA score and thrombin measurements will be determined.

    <description>The Calibrated Automated Thrombogram (CAT). Thrombogram describes the concentration of thrombin in clotting plasma and is therefore a general physiologic function test of the thrombotic hemostatic system. The CAT measures thrombotic as well as bleeding tendency.</description>
