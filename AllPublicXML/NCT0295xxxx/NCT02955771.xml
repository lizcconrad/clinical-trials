    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center, randomized, controlled, open-label, phase IIa clinical study.The
      study will observe the efficacy and safety of Deuteporfin photodynamic therapy in addition to
      stenting compared to stenting alone in patients with unresectable advanced Perihilar
      Cholangiocarcinoma.
