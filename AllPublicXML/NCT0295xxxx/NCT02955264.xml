  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to better characterize the metabolic alterations and sugar
      structure alterations (glycosylation abnormalities) in patients diagnosed with Congenital
      Disorders of Glycosylation. The investigators aim to assess the safety and tolerability of
      oral galactose treatment in a small pilot group of Congenital Disorders of Glycosylation
      patients. The investigators will also determine the relationship between simple milk sugar
      intake (galactose dose) in the diet and the blood and urine markers of protein glycosylation
      abnormalities.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary hypothesis in this study is that adding simple milk sugar (galactose) to the diet
      of Congenital Disorders of Glycosylation patients will normalize the metabolic abnormalities.
      The secondary hypothesis posits that galactose intervention in Congenital Disorders of
      Glycosylation patients will normalize specific physiological biomarkers of protein
      glycosylation that can be utilized for future phase II/III trial development. The knowledge
      gained from the investigation of these two aims will help the investigators learn more about
      the disrupted metabolic mechanism of this disease and should lead to the identification of
      new disease biomarkers that can be used to evaluate clinical efficacy in future therapeutic
      trials.

      Over a two-year period, the investigators will enroll patients diagnosed with Congenital
      Disorders of Glycosylation. The investigators propose to administer oral galactose
      supplementation for a period of 18 weeks in increasing dose to assess its effectiveness at
      normalizing glycosylation. Galactose will be given in a series of doses within the range of
      normal dietary intake of galactose over fixed time points. To assess the effects of oral
      galactose supplementation for each participant, changes in participant growth, as well as
      blood sugar levels, coagulation parameters and liver function (the primary clinical features
      of Congenital Disorders of Glycosylation) will be correlated with biomarkers derived from
      participant blood and urine samples obtained at key time points and then compared to standard
      normative ranges of data for each measure.

    <description>Assess if the introduction of galactose into the subject's diet will normalization metabolic function. Metabolic function will be based on liver function and used for muscle enzyme tests, thyroid and growth hormone measurement, coagulation and anti-coagulation factors, blood sugar and milk-acid and biochemical/metabolic parameters. These measurements will be assessed together to see how many subjects will remain with abnormal values or change to within normal levels.</description>

    <measure>Biomarkers for protein glycosylation</measure>
    <time_frame>18 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Identify potential biomarkers for glycosylation and metabolic dysfunction. And learn the physiological effect of adding galactose to the diet on known biomarkers for protein glycosylation. Specific biomarkers that will be examined include: transferrin glyco isoforms, antithrombin III, coagulation factor IX and XI, IGFBP3 and TSH. These measurements will be assessed together to see how many subjects will remain with abnormal values or change to within normal levels.</description>
