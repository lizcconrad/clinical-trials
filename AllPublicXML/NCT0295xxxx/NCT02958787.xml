    <textblock>
      Prostate cancer patients have a number of excellent treatment options to consider, and
      quality of life following treatment is often a consideration in treatment choice. One
      critical quality of life concern for patients diagnosed with prostate cancer is sexual
      function. Previous studies point to a vascular mechanism of impotence post-radiation therapy,
      as opposed to a nerve-based mechanism following surgery. In this study, the critical vascular
      structures (internal pudendal artery and corpus cavernosum) are defined by MRI-based imaging
      and included in treatment planning for radiation treatments, hopefully preserving critical
      artery function. This study will collect erectile function preservation rates at 5-years
      post-vessel-sparing radiotherapy with or without aids using the patient reported using the
      simplified three-question erectile function scale.

      The vast majority of patients diagnosed with prostate cancer in the modern era of PSA
      screening have localized and potentially curable disease. Patients have a number of excellent
      treatment options to consider, and quality of life following treatment is often a
      consideration in treatment choice. One critical quality of life concern for patients
      diagnosed with prostate cancer is sexual function. Studies of sexual function post-radiation
      therapy fall into three categories: incidence studies; correlative (dose and toxicity)
      studies; mechanism(functional) studies. All these studies point to a vascular mechanism of
      impotence post-radiation therapy, as opposed to a nerve-based mechanism following surgery. In
      this study, the critical vascular structures (internal pudendal artery and corpus cavernosum)
      are defined by MRI-based imaging and included in treatment planning for radiation treatments.
      Investigators propose that this technique will improve quality of life, sexual function, and
      relapse-free survival.

      This study's primary aim is to determine erectile function preservation rates at 5-years
      post-vessel-sparing radiotherapy with or without aids using the patient reported using the
      simplified three-question erectile function scale.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Histologically confirmed diagnosis of prostate cancer

          -  Patients must have measurable erectile function. Patients with erectile function on
             Viagra and drugs of the same class are eligible. Patients who require 6 months of
             hormonal therapy or less are eligible, provided baseline erectile function is measured
             prior to or within 14 days of the start of hormonal therapy.

          -  Baseline PSA (Prostate Specific Antigen), TNM stage (a classification of malignant
             tumors in cancer), and Gleason Score (A system of grading prostate cancer tissue based
             on how it looks under a microscope): Patients with low (PSA less than 10, T2a or less,
             Gleason 6 or less), intermediate, or high (Gleason 8-10, T3a, PSA over 20) risk
             disease are eligible for this protocol. Patients on finasteride or drugs of the same
             class are eligible.

          -  Patients must be 18 years or older. No upper age restriction.

          -  Patients treated with external beam radiotherapy alone or external beam therapy plus
             implant therapy are eligible.

          -  Patients must have an ECOG (Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group system of grading
             patient status that attempts to quantify cancer patients' general well-being and
             activities of daily life) performance status &lt;2.

          -  The patient must sign study specific informed consent approved by the IRB of U of M
             indicating they are aware of the investigational nature of the treatment.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients who are impotent or have an IIEF (International Index of Erectile Function)
             &lt;16.

          -  Patients who are medically ineligible for radiation therapy due to other medical
             conditions.

          -  Patients given hormonal therapy before baseline questionnaires filled out.

          -  Patients who receive implant only therapy.

          -  Patients unable to undergo MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging).
