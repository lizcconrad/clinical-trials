      Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, research pilot study. 30 subjects aged 22-55
      years old of all skin types will be asked to sign an informed consent form prior to any study
      procedures. Subjects must have at least 1 but up to 3 acne scars ≥3 mm or ≤ 10 mm located on
      the cheeks or forehead. Subjects will receive one treatment (Restylane® Silk or Placebo) in
      each scar at day 0, and Month 1 (2 total treatments per scar during the study). Subjects will
      be asked to come to 10 visits: Screening visit (up to 35 days prior to Baseline), Baseline
      (Day 0), Day 7, Day 14, Month 1, Month 2, Month 3, Month 4, Month 5, and Month 6 (study exit
      visit). The treatment area will be evaluated at each visit by the unblinded investigator
      regarding erythema, bruising, inflammation, itching, stinging/burning, brightness, fullness,
      smoothness, and clarity. Safety and adverse events will be captured at each visit only by the
      unblinded investigator.

      (Day 0), Day 7, Day 14, Month 1, Month 2, Month 3, Month 4, Month 5, and Month 6 (study exit
      visit). The blinded investigators will evaluate the target scar using the Acne Scar Rating
      Scale (ASRS), rate the target acne scar regarding treatment effect on a -5 (&quot;Markedly
      worse&quot;), to 0 (&quot;Neutral Improvement&quot;), to 5 (Markedly Improved (Clear or nearly clear)) point
      scale, and evaluate the skin quality (regarding brightness, fullness, smoothness, and
      clarity). Subjects will give the acne scar a score on the subject VAS acne scar satisfaction
      scale marking between 0 (&quot;Not satisfied with Acne Scar at Day 0&quot;) and 10 (&quot;Extremely
      Satisfied with Acne Scar at Day 0&quot;). The treatment area will be evaluated at each visit by
      the unblinded investigator regarding erythema, bruising, inflammation, itching,
      stinging/burning, brightness, fullness, smoothness, and clarity. The subject will have their
      vital signs taken, complete a symptom diary (only if the subject experiences side effects or
      adverse events), complete a DLQI, and have photos (VECTRA and 2D digital photographs) taken
      of the treatment area. Efficacy measures will only be completed by the blinded investigator.
      Safety and adverse events will be captured at each visit only by the unblinded investigator.
