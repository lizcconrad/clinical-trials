  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate complete response plus (+) very good partial
      response (CR+VGPR) rate following 4 cycles of induction therapy of daratumumab in combination
      with cyclophosphamide, bortezomib, and dexamethasone (Dara-CyBorD), in previously untreated
      subjects, and in relapsed subjects with multiple myeloma, as defined by the International
      Myeloma Working Group (IMWG) criteria.

             immunomodulatory drug (IMiD) agents (such as lenalidomide), defined as failure to
             respond or progression within 60 days of the end of PI therapy

          -  Exhibiting clinical signs of or has a known history of meningeal or central nervous
             system involvement by multiple myeloma
