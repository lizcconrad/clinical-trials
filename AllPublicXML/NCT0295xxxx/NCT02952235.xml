  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>

    <measure>Side-by-side Comparison (overall difference) of Sunburn.</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 2</time_frame>
    <description>The side-by-side comparison utilized the following condensed two side overall difference scale: L1 = subject's left side noticeably more sunburned than right side, 0= no difference in sunburn, R1= subject's right side noticeably more sunburned than left side. The 0 outcomes were excluded from the analysis.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Difference in Erythema Score Between Left and Right Sides at Day 2</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 2</time_frame>
    <description>Erythema was assessed using a scale of 0 = no burn, 1 = possible burn, not clearly defined; 2 = defined redness clearly caused by UV; 3 = severe sunburn with pronounced redness; and 4 = edema and blisters</description>

             hypertension, hyper/hypothyroidism, hypercholesterolemia

             sun sensitive (e.g., Tetracyclines, antifungals, certain diuretics, etc.)

          7. Skin diseases on tested sites (e.g., photosensitivity disorders, etc.), which may

             significantly with the subject's participation in the study

         12. Individual viewed by the PI as not being able to complete the study
