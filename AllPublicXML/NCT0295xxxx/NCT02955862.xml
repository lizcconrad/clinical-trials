    <description>Patients with symptoms of CNS disease will be treated according to Vietnam national guidelines for HIV/AIDS management.
For CrAg-positive patients, the initial dosage of fluconazole will be 900 mg taken each day for 2 weeks. This will be followed by fluconazole 450 mg orally each day for 8 weeks. Finally, maintenance treatment with fluconazole 200mg orally each (2 tablets of 100 mg procured especially for the study) day will continue until CD4 &gt;200 cells/µL for at least 6 months.</description>

    <description>Drug: Fluconazole HIV-infected patients with CD4 ≤100 cells/μL who present for HIV care at outpatient clinics (OPCs) in Vietnam where CrAg screening is offered will be recruited into the study. Study participants will be screened for cryptococcal antigen using the Lateral Flow Assay (LFA). Those who are CrAg-positive, but have no features of central nervous system (CNS) disease, will be treated with high-dose fluconazole.
