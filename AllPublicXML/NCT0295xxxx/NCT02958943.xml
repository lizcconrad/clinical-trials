    <textblock>
      Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most preventable cause of stroke. However, despite widely
      available risk stratification tools, five options for oral anticoagulation, and
      evidence-based practice guidelines, anticoagulation for stroke prevention in AF is
      consistently under-prescribed. Data from our center (Brigham and Women's Hospital [BWH]) (1)
      demonstrate that fewer than 50% of outpatients with AF at high-risk for stroke according to
      2012 Focused Update of the European Society of Cardiology Guidelines for the Management of AF
      (2) receive anticoagulation.

      Aim #1: To determine the impact of electronic alert-based computerized decision support (CDS)
      on prescription of anticoagulation in high-risk AF patients in the outpatient setting who are
      not being prescribed anticoagulation for stroke prevention.

      Hypothesis #1: Electronic alert-based CDS will increase prescription of anticoagulation by
      80% in high-risk AF patients in the outpatient setting who are not being prescribed
      anticoagulation for stroke prevention.

      Aim #2: To determine the impact of electronic alert-based computerized decision support (CDS)
      on the frequency of stroke and systemic embolic events in high-risk AF patients in the
      outpatient setting who are not being prescribed anticoagulation for stroke prevention.

      Hypothesis #2: Electronic alert-based CDS will reduce the frequency of stroke and systemic
      embolism in high-risk AF patients in the outpatient setting who are not being prescribed
      anticoagulation for stroke prevention. Data acquired through this study regarding the
      frequency of stroke and systemic embolism will be used to calculate sample size requirements
      for a future clinical end-point driven randomized controlled trial of electronic alerts to
      prevent stroke in high-risk AF patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      AF is associated with an increased risk of fatal and disabling ischemic stroke. Despite
      widely accessible evidence-based clinical practice guidelines, risk stratification tools
      (CHA2DS2-VASc and HAS-BLED) and five effective oral antithrombotic agents for stroke
      prevention (22), at least 40% of high-risk patients with AF worldwide remain unprotected
      because of failure to prescribe anticoagulation. The failure to prevent stroke in AF has
      become a critical international patient safety crisis. The root causes of underutilization
      include lack of provider and patient education about the importance of stroke prevention in
      AF, inadequate risk stratification, and concerns regarding the bleeding risk with
      anticoagulant therapy. We were surprised to learn that even at BWH, underutilization of
      anticoagulation for stroke prevention in AF continues to be a concern (1).

      The failure to prevent stroke in AF is similar to the crisis in VTE prevention among
      hospitalized patients from a decade ago. To address this critical patient safety problem, we
      evaluated the impact of alert-based CDS on VTE prevention (18). First, we designed software
      linked to our Electronic Health Record (EHR) and provider order entry program to identify
      hospitalized patients at risk for VTE using a weighted risk score and for whom prophylaxis
      was not ordered. Patients were randomized to the intervention group, in which the responsible
      physician received an electronic alert regarding the risk of VTE and recommendation regarding
      prophylaxis, or to the control group, in which no alert was issued. Compared with the control
      group, electronic alerts more than doubled the rate of thromboprophylaxis orders (from 14.5%
      to 33.5%; p&lt;0.0001). The risk of symptomatic VTE was reduced by 41% (hazard ratio, 0.59; 95%
      confidence interval 0.43-0.81; p=0.001) among patients for whom an electronic alert was
      issued. We have also shown that &quot;human&quot; (person-to-person) alert-based decision support for
      the prevention of VTE in at-risk hospitalized patients more than doubled the rate of VTE
      prophylaxis compared with controls during hospitalization (21) and after discharge (19).

      The current study will determine the impact of electronic alert-based CDS on prescription of
      anticoagulation in high-risk AF patients in the outpatient setting who are not being
      prescribed anticoagulation for stroke prevention. Because this is a Quality Improvement
      initiative, we will not mandate a specific antithrombotic agent, regimen, or duration. We
      will provide options for anticoagulation to prevent stroke in AF and allow the provider to
      make the best choice based on their clinical judgment. If there is a contraindication to
      anticoagulation or if the risks outweigh the benefits of antithrombotic therapy, the provider
      can elect to omit anticoagulation but will need to provide the rationale for doing so. The
      current study will also determine the impact of electronic alert-based CDS on the frequency
      of stroke and systemic embolic events in high-risk AF patients in the outpatient setting who
      are not being prescribed anticoagulation for stroke prevention. Data acquired through this
      study regarding the frequency of stroke and systemic embolism will be used to calculate
      sample size requirements for a future clinical end-point driven randomized controlled trial
      of electronic alerts to prevent stroke in high-risk AF patients.
