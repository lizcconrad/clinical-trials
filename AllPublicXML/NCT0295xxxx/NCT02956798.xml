  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The proposed study is a phase II randomized trial testing an innovative concept of comparing
      local therapy to systemic therapy, e.g. pazopanib, in patients with newly diagnosed limited
      metastatic RCC. We hypothesize that local therapy can prolong progression-free survival for
      patients with limited metastasis, and delaying the initiation of systemic therapy does not
      adversely affect survival. Patient will be stratified by Heng's criteria. Patients that are
      curable by metastatectomy as well as patients with poor prognosis and high chance of disease
      dissemination according to the prognostic factors will be excluded.
