      The hemoglobin concentrations of patients assigned to the restrictive strategy of transfusion
      were maintained in the range of 6.0 to 8.0 g per deciliter, with a transfusion given when the
      hemoglobin concentration fell below 6.0 g per deciliter. Patients assigned to the liberal
      strategy of transfusion, the hemoglobin concentrations were maintained in the range of 8.0 to
      10.0 g per deciliter, with a threshold for transfusion of 8.0 g per deciliter.

      The primary outcome: Death from all causes in the Six months after randomization,
      Perioperative complications: sepsis , Pulmonary complications, Portal vein thrombosis,
      Hepatic artery thrombosis, Adverse event of transfusion.

      Secondary outcomes included: Intraoperative blood transfusion, Postoperative blood
      transfusion, Postoperative inflammatory reaction, Mechanical ventilation time in the
      intensive care unit, Lengths of stay in the intensive care unit and the hospital were also
      recorded.
