    <textblock>
      The purpose of the research study is to test new methods that could improve diagnosis and
      assessment of brain tumors. One of these methods is a new MR (magnetic resonance) imaging
      technique called magnetic resonance fingerprinting (MRF), which allows for rapidly scanning
      the patient and provides quantitative information on tumor tissue. The investigators will
      compare the data gathered from MR Fingerprinting with other imaging tests, clinical
      information, treatment details and biopsy results to evaluate the accuracy of this new
      technique.

      The primary objective of this study is to 1) evaluate the utility of quantitative MRI imaging
      including 3D-MRF in differentiating among different brain tumors and differentiating
      recurrent brain tumor (TR) from treatment effects

      Secondary objectives include evaluating the correlation between quantitative MRI imaging with
      histopathological characteristics and genetic markers in pre-therapy setting and with
      treatment response and clinical outcomes in post treatment setting.

      GROUP 1: All patients with newly diagnosed intra-axial brain neoplasms undergo volumetric MRI
      study with contrast for surgical planning or clinical diagnosis. Diffusion, diffusion tensor
      imaging and perfusion imaging are often performed as a part of standard clinical imaging. In
      addition to these acquisitions, the research 3D-MRF acquisition through the entire tumor will
      be acquired. The imaging parameters will be correlated individually and in combination with
      biopsy/ resection outcomes.

      GROUP 2: All patients with brain tumors who present at post therapy follow up with imaging
      progression undergo serial imaging as a part of clinical care. The research 3D-MRF
      acquisitions will be added to these clinical scans. All the quantitative parameters will be
      evaluated individually and in combination to differentiate post treatment changes from tumor
      recurrence.

    <description>Non-contrast MRF acquisition will be acquired through the region of tumor in all patients. For patients receiving intravenous gadolinium based contrast, a post contrast MRF acquisition will also be acquired. This acquisition will be skipped in patients who do not receive or are not eligible for receiving IV contrast as a part of their clinical scan. The research scan will take approximately 10-15 minutes</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Diagnosis of intra-axial brain tumor at initial diagnosis or patients with known
             treated brain tumors on follow-up with concern for imaging progression

          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document,
             or, in cases where the patient may have cognitive impairment, consent by a legal
             authorized representative or power of attorney

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with ferromagnetic or otherwise non-MRI compatible aneurysm clips.

          -  The presence of an implanted pacemaker or implanted defibrillator device.

          -  Patients with contraindications for MRI due to embedded foreign metallic objects.
             Bullets, shrapnel, metalwork fragments, or other metallic material adds unnecessary
             risk to the patient.

          -  Pregnancy. Regular clinical practice already excludes pregnant patients from
             gadolinium contrast.

          -  Implanted medical device not described above that is not MRI-compatible.

          -  Known history of severe claustrophobia.

          -  History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic
             composition to MR contrast material.

          -  Prisoners and members of other vulnerable populations will be excluded from this
             study. The subject selection population will not regularly include prisoners and other
             vulnerable population members as these populations will not provide any additional
             unique information to or uniquely benefit from the study. Non-English speaking
             population will be excluded from the study due to lack of sufficient resources to pay
             for translator and interpreter services.

          -  Minors will be excluded.
