    <textblock>
      We aim to characterize the bioavailability and pharmacokinetics of dexmedetomidine after
      intranasal dosing employing pharmacometrics methods in otherwise healthy 1 month to 11 years
      of age children scheduled for minor surgery or other procedures requiring sedation or
      anesthesia.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  1. The child is scheduled for intra-articular drug injections, hernia repair,

             requiring sedation or anesthesia

          -  2. Guardians and patient (if relevant) with fluent skills in the Finnish or Swedish
             language (to understand the given information, to be able to give informed consent and

          -  4. Normal developmental status including growth (SD -1.5-1.5)

          -  5. Written informed consent from the guardian and the patient (when relevant).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  1. A previous history of intolerance to the study drug or to related compounds and
             additives

          -  2. Prior drug therapy with dexmedetomidine in the 14 days prior to the study.

          -  3. Use of any drugs known to cause enzyme induction or inhibition for a period of 30
             days prior to the study, use of any natural products (including grapefruit products)
             for at least 14 days prior to the study and caffeine containing products for at least
             24 hours prior to the study. The use of regular doses of paracetamol is allowed.

          -  4. Existing or recent significant disease that could influence the study outcome or
             cause a health hazard for the subject if he/she would participate in the study.

          -  5. Participation in any other clinical study involving investigational or marketed
             drug products concomitantly or within one month prior to the entry into this study.

          -  6. Clinically significant abnormal findings in physical examination or laboratory
             screening [routine haematology (haemoglobin, haematocrit, red blood cell count, white
             blood cell count, platelets), renal function tests (creatinine, urea) and liver
             function tests (bilirubin)].
