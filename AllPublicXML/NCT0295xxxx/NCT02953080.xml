      PROTOCOL SUMMARY Abstract Current estimates point towards a huge increase in the number of
      people that are eligible to start ART in Uganda and globally. As many of the newly eligible
      patients are largely asymptomatic, there are concerns about adherence and retention of these
      individuals and especially those starting ART with a higher CD4 counts. Urgent information is
      required to plan for implementation of most recent WHO and National guidelines in the most
      cost effective manner as well as maximizing retention of HIV positive individuals in care and
      achieving virological suppression.

      We plan to undertake research designed to see if we can optimize adherence, virological
      outcomes and HIV knowledge, in order to give an overall increased quality of life in
      vulnerable populations starting or established on ART in Kampala, Uganda. We will test
      implementation of an open source software-based tool to send text messages and to give access
      to an interactive voice response system to support self-monitoring and provide health
      information using patients' mobile phones.

      We aim to undertake an open labeled randomised trial at two sites: the IDI which is an urban
      center of excellence in HIV care, and Kasangati Health Center, which is a peri-urban public
      health care facility. The project aims to enroll patients starting ART, already established
      on first line ART or switching to second line ART. We will include special populations
      including pregnant women, discordant couples and young people. The estimated length of the
      project is 30 months. The technology to be evaluated in this study is based on CONNECT FOR
      LIFETM m-health technology (CFL2015.01 or higher). CFL2015.01 provides text messages or
      Interactive Voice Response (IVR) functionalities, a technology that allows a computer to
      interact with humans through the use of voice and tones input via keypad, including pill
      reminders, clinic visit reminders, health tips and functionality to support symptom
      reporting.

      The Primary Objective of this study is to determine the effect of the CFL2015.01 tool on
      quality of life of HIV patients receiving care at IDI and Kasangati HCIV. At the start of the
      intervention, all patients will undergo quality of life assessment, which will be repeated at
      months 6, 12 and 24 months. The scores will be compared to assess the effect of the tool on
      quality of life. The Secondary Objectives are virological outcomes baseline, 6, 12 months and
      24 months, retention in care, aversion of early treatment failure, disease knowledge, clinic
      attendance and cost analysis.

      5. DESCRIPTION OF INTERVENTION Call for Life UgandaTM Janssen Global Public Health Research
      and Development, in close collaboration with the Infectious Disease Institute Kampala (IDI),
      has developed Call for Life UgandaTM tailored to the needs of PLHIV in Uganda. Call for Life
      UgandaTM is based on the CONNECT FOR LIFETM technology (CFL2015.01 or higher version) and the
      MOTECH platform, an open source platform developed by Grameen Foundation and the University
      of Southern Maine with financial support from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, and was
      released under the terms of the MOTECH open source license agreement.

      All patients consenting will;

        1. At enrolment receive detailed information from a nurse/counsellor on the Call for Life
           UgandaTM system and how it operates

        2. Receive calls or text messages from Call for Life UgandaTM will include recording of
           self-reported adherence (soliciting active feedback via keypad) and symptom management
           triggering alerts for the clinic.

        3. Participants with an undetectable viral load (after discussion with their counselors)
           will have the option chose the frequency of their calls, between daily to weekly to a
           minimum of an appointment reminder (every 1-2months) only.

        4. Participants with a detectable viral load at any time will receive daily calls or text
           messages. They will only be able to decrease the frequency of calls when their VL
           becomes undetectable and on discussion with their counsellor

        5. In addition all patients will receive

             1. an appointment reminder before their appointment (exact timing will be patients
                choice).

             2. health tips on HIV, ART and related conditions each week (or repeat of the old one
                if they wish).

             3. have the opportunity to report symptoms to the clinic at any point in time, which
                send an alert to the clinic (with a call back from clinic staff).

                After the 12 month interim analysis the study team and a trial steering group made
                of 3 independent member (a statistician, a mental health specialist and a clinical
                researcher) will review the data, and if there is no harm seen all of those on the
                control arm will be offered Call for Life Lite, which provides weekly adherence
                calls and appointment reminders only, as we plan to offer Call for Life Lite to all
                patients in the clinic by this time. Those on the full Call for Life arm will
                continue on this arm. If a positive benefit is seen full Call for Life will be
                offered to all in the clinic (as long as there are sufficient funding to allow for
                the phone connection aspect of the tool).

                6. STUDY PROCEDURES 6.1. Screening The subjects will be screened and enrolled over
                a period of 6 months These are the screening procedures

                  -  All consecutive eligible patients will be approached for participation in the
                     study.

                  -  For patients interested in participating the inclusion and exclusion criteria
                     will be ascertained.

                  -  The patients will receive information about the study by the study nurse or
                     counselor Patients who agree to participate in the study will sign the
                     informed 6.3. Follow-up Visit The participants will come to the clinic monthly
                     or 2 monthly to pick up their ART and concomitant medications (non-study
                     visits).

                The participants will come for their study follow up visits every 6 months Every 6
                months The patients will be assessed by the study staff.

                  -  The study doctor will collect General Medical History and perform Physical
                     Examination and enter it in an electronic CRF.

                  -  The counselor will collect the Quality of life and Knowledge questionnaires
                     and enter them in an electronic CRF.

                At baseline, 6, 12 and 24 months the following samples will be collected;

                • Viral load

                  -  Storage plasma (1 aliquot) serum (3 aliquots)

                In case of death

                • Verbal autopsy by phone or by visiting the home of the deceased

                • Review of the clinical information in the clinic and study file to identify a
                presumptive cause of death

                Additional procedures Resistance testing: It will be done on stored samples

                • Baseline. Resistance testing will be carried out if subsequent viral failure in
                order to investigate transmitted resistant virus

                • Biological samples will also be stored at 6, 12 and 24 months and resistance
                testing carried out in case of viral load &gt;1,000 copies/ml

                On stored sample Additional procedures on stored samples may be conducted during
                the course of the study if deemed to be relevant to improve clinical care will be
                made available to the clinicians and the study participants.

                6.4. Subject Withdrawal Subjects may withdraw from the study at any time at their
                own request, or they may be withdrawn at any time at the discretion of the
                investigator for safety or behavioral reasons, or the inability of the subject to
                comply with the protocol required schedule of study visits or procedures.

                If a subject does not return for a scheduled visit, every effort should be made to
                contact the subject. In any circumstance, every effort should be made to document
                subject outcome, if possible. The investigator should inquire about the reason for
                withdrawal and follow-up with the subject regarding any unresolved adverse events
                (AEs).

                If the subject withdraws from the study, and also withdraws consent for disclosure
                of future information, no further evaluations should be performed, and no
                additional data should be collected. IDI may retain and continue to use any data
                collected before such withdrawal of consent.

                7. ASSESSMENTS 7.1. Safety Safety monitoring for this study will focus on
                unanticipated problems involving risks to participants, including unanticipated
                problems that meet the definition of a serious adverse event.

                7.1.1. Unanticipated Problems

                Unanticipated problems involving risks to participants are defined as, any
                incident, experience, or outcome that meets all of the following criteria:

                • Unexpected in terms of nature, severity, or frequency given (a) the research
                procedures that are described in the protocol-related documents, such as the
                IRB-approved research protocol and informed consent document; and (b) the
                characteristics of the participant population being studied;

                  -  Related or possibly related to participation in the research (possibly related
                     means there is a reasonable possibility that the incident, experience, or
                     outcome may have been caused by a procedures involved in the research); and

                  -  Suggests that the research places participants or others at a greater risk of
                     harm (including physical, psychological, economic, or social harm) than was
                     previously known or recognized.

                7.2. Pregnancy Testing Pregnancy testing will be performed if required as standard
                of care at IDI, i.e. at the woman's request or missed menstrual period. Pregnant
                women will not be withdrawn from the study.

                7.3. Post-Recruitment Illness Patients with post-recruitment illness will be
                managed in accordance with standard of care in Uganda's public health sector.

                8. ADVERSE EVENT REPORTING 8.1. Adverse Events During each study visit the study
                clinician will assess AEs which may have occurred since the previous visit. ART
                toxicities and opportunistic infections will be entered in the electronic medical
                records as per standard of care, as well as other outcomes (e.g: death,
                hospitalization).

                The investigators will generate and submit annual reports summarizing these adverse
                events.

                8.2. Serious Adverse Events

                An SAE is any untoward medical occurrence at any dose that:

                Results in death; Is life-threatening (immediate risk of death); Requires inpatient
                hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization; Results in persistent
                or significant disability/incapacity (substantial disruption of the ability to
                conduct normal life functions); Results in congenital anomaly/birth defect, 8.3.
                Severity Assessment This is not an intervention study and no specific drug will be
                investigated. Patients will be enrolled in the study to document in details the
                outcomes occurring during their care at the IDI clinic.

                8.4. Causality Assessment Since we are not testing any specific
                intervention/drug/device causality cannot be assessed 8.5. Reporting Requirements
                The investigators will generate and submit annual reports summarizing AEs. Since
                the study does not test any investigational drug or intervention, and causality
                assessment is not applicable, SAEs will also be reported to the SRC, IRB and the
                Uganda National Council of Science and Technology (UNCST) annually in aggregate.

                9. DATA ANALYSIS/STATISTICAL METHODS 9.1. Sample Size Determination Based on a pre
                and post ART assessment in Burkino Faso and Uganda we anticipate that the quality
                of life score (MOS-HIV) in ART naïve patients will increase at least by 15 points
                for physical health summary (PHS) between baseline and 12 months ART use (34, 35).
                We estimate there will be an additional 5 points improvement in those receiving
                C4LTM which would give 20 point improvement for those on C4LTM and 15 points for
                those not on call for Life. In those already on ART we estimate an improvement for
                those established on ART with a 5 point improvement for those on C4LTM and nil for
                those not accessing C4LTM. We also estimate a 5 point increase in mental health
                score in those receiving C4LTM compared to no change in those without C4LTM
                starting ART, and a lower improvement of 2 points in mental health score in those
                already on ART. The study is powered on the PHS for QOL. For a power of 0.9 and
                precision of 0.05 we would need a minimum of 273 in each arm (overall 546)
                patients, if the mean PHS among patients with C4L was 58.2 compared to 55.2 among
                patients without C4L. We will include a 10% LTFUP/mortality rate to give a sample
                size of 600.

                The composition of the study participants is estimated as 300 patients at
                Kasanagati and 300 patients at IDI.

                With the proposed sample size, the numbers above depict over 90% power to test even
                the smallest differences in mean PHS at 12 months in the group of patients with and
                without C4L. We also anticipate that we will be able to detect changes in MHS QOL
                with this sample size.

                9.2. Analysis of Endpoints 9.2.1. Analysis of Primary Endpoint Scales to measure
                quality of life There are numerous measures of quality of life. For this study we
                have chosen to use the Medical Outcomes Study (MOS-HIV) Health Survey which is the
                most widely used health related HRQoL measure in PLHIV(36).

                A recent review of the HRQoL measures currently in use in HIV/AIDS clinical trials
                found the MOS-HIV to be one of the two most suitable HIV targeted HRQoL measures
                [2]. The other measure was the Functional Assessment of HIV Infection (FAHI)(37).
                The MOS-HIV scale was chosen because it has been validated in various settings
                including Uganda, has a Luganda language version, and was found to be useful in
                assessing HRQoL in PLHIV(38-40). In an HIV population in Uganda the MOS-HIV was
                reported to have Crohnbach's α coefficients &gt; 0.70 for five out of the eight
                multi-item scale and factor analysis supported the underlying physical and mental
                health dimensions (38). In addition, the measure can be self-administered in ≤10
                minutes.

                The MOS-HIV measures HRQoL in 11 areas: health perceptions, bodily pain, physical
                function, role function, social function, mental function, vitality, health
                distress, cognitive function, QoL, and health transition. One scores scale in a
                range from 0-100 with a higher score implying better health (41). In addition to
                these subscales, a Physical Health Summary score (PHS) and Mental Health Summary
                score (MHS) can be calculated.

                Intra patient in QoL scores will be compared using Paired T-tests and overall
                change will be investigated. The effect of calendar time on QoL life scores will be
                accounted for during analysis. Furthermore, the changes and or effect of the
                intervention on different sub-groups of HIV positives patients will be carried. For
                example, subgroups group analysis by type and duration of ART exposure, time from
                ART initiation, gender differences and other categories. All analysis will use
                robust standard errors to account for individual patient level
                variances/correlations, as well as cluster (facility) correlation. The effect of
                the intervention will also be compared between IDI and Kasangati sites. All
                analysis will be conducted using STATA, USA.Analysis of Secondary Endpoints.

                Analysis of secondary endpoints

        1. We will undertake analysis of MHS as discussed in the primary endpoint (PHS) above

        2. We will undertake an intention to treat analysis of virological outcomes (logistic
           regression) at 6, 12 and 24 months. A viral load &gt;50 c/ml will be considered to be
           virological failure

        3. We will undertake an intention to treat analysis of lost to follow up (Cox regression).
           Lost to follow will be defined as not attending appointment for &gt;3 months.

        4. We will compare knowledge about HIV, ART and associated health conditions which will be
           delivered as messages in the health tips section of Call for Life UgandaTM in both arms
           at 6, 12 and 24 months of Call for Life UgandaTM use. We will add additional questions
           to the MOSHIV tool will be adapted for each key population.

        5. We will assess perceptions and attitudes to the Call for Life UgandaTM tool thorough
           focus group discussions and Key informant interviews, targeting each special population.
           We will use purposeful sampling and will continue until no new themes emerge. We will
           use NVIVO software for coding of themes.

        6. Cost analysis along with the study evaluation; appropriate and detailed cost evaluation
           will also be performed. It is anticipated that if the intervention is proved effective,
           a cost effective analysis would contribute to developing a sustainable scale up strategy
           for similar service across Uganda.

           The overarching research questions addressed by this evaluation would be :

           A) From a societal and health care perspective, is the Call for Life UgandaTM
           intervention, in comparison with usual care, preferable in terms of costs, effects and
           utilities? B) What is the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of Call for Life
           UgandaTM in comparison with usual care? C) In comparison with usual care, is the Call
           for Life UgandaTM intervention preferable in terms of cost and utilities during the
           remaining life expectancy of the study population?(model based economic evaluation).

        7. We will undertake an intention to treat analysis of attendance (Cox regression). Failure
           to attend will be defined as not attending appointment within 3 working days of
           scheduled attendance in each arm.

        8. For the primary outcome, we will undertake sub-analysis for the following groups;

             1. Pregnant women already receiving ART or starting ART .

             2. Male and female positive partners in discordant couples already receiving ART or
                starting ART with Call for Life UgandaTM

             3. Male and female young people (aged 15 to 24 years) already receiving ART or
                starting ART with Call for Life UgandaTM

             4. Male and female patients already receiving second line ART or starting second line
                ART with Call for Life UgandaTM

             5. Adult patients starting ART

                We intend to report the study by using standard reporting methods for randomized
                trials (COHORT) but also to follow the newly published mERA guidelines for
                reporting mHealth tools which include the outcomes in the table below(33).

                Radomisation Patients will randomly be assigned to either one of the two arms, that
                is, with and without CDL. To ensure that all patients in each of the arms are
                represented and equally balanced out in both arms, the study will use stratified
                randomization where each of the categories of patients at the start of the study
                will form the strata on interest. Within each stratum, the patients will randomly
                assigned to C4L or no C4L. Randomization lists wil be generated by an independent
                statistician and kept under lock and key in the two sites.

                9.3. Interim Analysis Interim analyses will be undertaken at the 6 month and one
                year visits to inform the study team on change in QOL and assess the impact of the
                intervention. However, the study will continue to collect information to the 24
                month time point, unless there is a negative effect of the intervention at 6 or 12
                months.

                10. QUALITY CONTROL AND QUALITY ASSURANCE During study conduct periodic monitoring
                may be conducted to ensure that the protocol and Good Clinical Practices (GCPs) are
                being followed. The monitors may review source documents to confirm that the data
                recorded on CRFs is accurate. Additionally, the study site may be subject to review
                by the Institutional Review Board (IRB) and/or to inspection by appropriate
                regulatory authorities.

                11. DATA HANDLING/RECORD RETENTION 11.1. Case Report Forms (CRF)/Electronic Data
                Record A CRF is required and should be completed for each included subject at
                enrolment and during study visits.

                The investigator has ultimate responsibility for the collection and reporting of
                all clinical, safety and laboratory data entered on the CRFs and any other data
                collection forms (source documents) and ensuring that they are accurate, authentic
                / original, attributable, complete, consistent, legible, timely (contemporaneous),
                enduring and available when required. The CRFs must be signed by the investigator
                or by an authorized staff member to attest that the data contained on the CRFs is
                true. Any corrections to entries made in the CRFs, source documents must be dated,
                initialed and explained (if necessary) and should not obscure the original entry.

                11.2. Record Retention To enable evaluations and/or audits, the investigator agrees
                to keep records, including the identity of all participating patients (sufficient
                information to link records, for example CRFs and hospital records), all original
                signed informed consent documents, copies of all CRFs, safety reporting forms,
                source documents, and detailed records of treatment disposition, and adequate
                documentation of relevant correspondence (for example letters, meeting minutes,
                telephone calls reports).

                Investigator records must be kept for as long as required by applicable local
                regulations (UNCST generally requires a minimum of 5 years). When more than one
                requirement can be applied, records must be maintained for the longest period
                provided.

                11.3. Confidentiality Clinical data will be entered into a study specific database
                by designated staff on a regular basis from completed Case Record Forms (CRF). Case
                Record Forms and other source documents will be kept in locked cabinets. Data will
                be entered on a regular basis to ensure that it is up to date. The database will be
                entered on regular basis on a secure PC, as will the pharmacokinetic database that
                will be received by from the laboratories. Access to database will be given to
                authorized personnel only (members of the immediate study team) and a log of
                authorized personnel will be stored in the trial master file. CRF and trial
                documents will be kept in locked cabinets. No participant identifying information
                will be disclosed in any publication or at any conference activities arising from
                the study.

                12. ETHICS 12.1. Institutional Review Board (IRB) It is the responsibility of the
                investigator to have prospective approval of the study protocol, protocol
                amendments, informed consent documents, and other relevant documents from the IRB.
                All correspondence with the IRB should be retained in the regulatory or trial
                master file. Copies of IRB approvals should be filed with other study documents.

                12.2. Ethical Conduct of the Study The study will be conducted in accordance with
                legal and regulatory requirements, as well as the general principles set forth in
                the International Ethical Guidelines for Biomedical Research Involving Human
                Subjects and the Declaration of Helsinki.

                In addition, the study will be conducted in accordance with the protocol, GCP
                guidelines, and applicable local regulatory requirements and laws.

                12.3. Subject Information and Consent All parties will ensure protection of subject
                personal data and will not include subject names on any forms, reports,
                publications, or in any other disclosures, except where required by laws.

                The informed consent document used in this study, and any changes made during the
                course of the study, must be prospectively approved by the IRB.

                The investigator, or a person designated by the investigator, will obtain written
                informed consent from each subject or the subject's legal representative before any
                study-specific activity is performed. The investigator will retain the original of
                each subject's signed consent document.

                12.4. Data Privacy Any and all data generated in IDI's use of Call for Life
                UgandaTM shall be owned solely by IDI. Janssen and Grameen shall not be able to
                directly access or utilize patient data and information. Therefore IDI will take
                all reasonable steps to restrict disclosure of personal data including
                patient-identifiable to third parties.

                In addition the following Security Measures are in place to protect Patient's
                privacy when using Call for Life UgandaTM • Call for Life UgandaTM database hosted
                locally at IDI Kampala • Call for Life UgandaTM Web access is password protected •
                Inactivity of 30 minutes on Call for Life UgandaTM web interface will log the web
                user out. The user will have to re-login into Call for Life UgandaTM • Study
                sponsor has no access to patient level data

                • Data at Call for Life UgandaTM backend is maintained in encrypted format

                • History of Changes made by investigator via web interface are tracked

                • History of all web access by investigator and Admin - login/logout events is
                maintained

                  -  Patients calling on Call for Life UgandaTM IVR are authenticated by their
                     registered mobile number and the PIN they enter

                  -  Call for Life UgandaTM will initiate calls to patients only on their
                     registered mobile numbers and authorize Call for Life UgandaTM usage only when
                     the called person will authenticate himself with his personal PIN

                  -  Call for Life UgandaTM does not ask the person calling its own identity till
                     the person has been authenticated himself as a registered patient (only Call
                     for Life UgandaTM signature music is played)

                     13. DEFINITION OF END OF TRIAL The trial will be considered ended at the time
                     of the &quot;Database Lock&quot; 14. PUBLICATION OF STUDY RESULTS We aim to publish in
                     high-impact, peer-reviewed journals with focus on open-access. Full anonymity
                     of subject's details will be maintained throughout.

                We will present data at national, regional, and international congresses (poster or
                oral presentation) e.g. CROI (Conference on Retroviruses and Opportunistic
                Infections) or IAS conferences (International AIDS Society).

                The study results will also be presented to officials in charge of the
                antiretroviral treatment program at the Ministry of Health. Study summaries will be
                communicated to health care workers in Uganda through the AIDS Treatment
                Information Centre newsletter which is published by the IDI and distributed to all
                health workers in the public and not-for profit sectors in Uganda.

                The study will be registered on Clinicaltrials.gov.

                15. CAPACITY BUILDING We will be employing one clinical trial co-ordinator who will
                be trained in clinical trials management as a result of the study. This study will
                also build capacity in social science by Dr Rachel King who is a senior social
                scientist mentoring our junior research staff. Janssen will assist our
                statisticians at IDI with cost analysis and so build capacity in this regard.

                16. FUNDING Funding has been foreseen by Janssen Global Public Health which would
                be made available by the Johnson &amp; Johnson Corporate Citizenship Trust through a
                grant to the Uganda Academy for Health Innovation and Impact .
