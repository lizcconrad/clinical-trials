  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate whether the DMTS, compared with a placebo patch,
      will provide adequate pain relief during the first 3 days following bunionectomy surgery.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the analgesic efficacy of the DMTS,
      compared with placebo in subjects with acute moderate to severe pain following unilateral
      bunionectomy.

      The secondary objectives are:

        -  To assess the safety and tolerability of the DMTS, including assessment of skin
           irritation

        -  To assess adhesion of the DMTS

        -  To assess the sedation effect of the DMTS
