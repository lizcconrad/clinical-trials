      The purpose of this research is to develop an objective assessment based on the virtual
      reality techniques which is used for evaluate addiction severity.

    <textblock>
      In order to evaluate the addiction severity and the effect of rehabilitation objectively,
      this study develops a virtual environment model based on the virtual reality technique,
      making the subjects in a drug related or neutral scene , at the same time recording the
      physical signs and eye movements index. Reliability and validity of this system will also be
      tested in this study. And we will construct the norm of addiction assessment system in
      Shanghai .The evaluating system will be very beneficial to develop novel and practical
      assessment for synthetic durg related disorder, and provide a reference for other drug
      dependence diagnosis.

    <description>The patients who used the amphetamine type stimulants will be diagnosed by the chief physician、associate chief physician or attending physician first to evaluate their addiction severity. And then the patients will finish the test in the virtual environment, at the same time their eye movement index and other physiological data will be recorded .Physiological data includes cardiac rate、galvanic skin response and electroencephalogram and so on.The test will proceed at the beginning of withdrawl、3 months later、 6 months later and 1 year later and record the information synchronously.</description>

        The study includes the synthetic drug abusers and healthy control into the experiment.The
        drug abusers will be recruited from compulsory isolated detoxification centers and non
        compulsory isolated detoxification institutions.The healthy control will be recruited from
        the residential communities.
