  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In-depth understanding of molecular characteristics of gastric cancer enabled us to realize
      personalized medicine with targeted agents in gastric cancer treatment.The investigators
      initiated open-label, randomized, controlled phase II, multi-arm trial comparing targeted
      therapy based on tumor molecular profiling with standard paclitaxel therapy as second line
      treatment.

    <description>400 Her-2 (-) metastatic/recurrent gastric cancer patients will be centrally screened for druggable targets [Epstein-Barr virus, Microsatellite instability, HER2, EGFR, c-MET, and PTEN] by immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization during first line chemotherapy. At the time of second line treatment, patients will be randomized to the biomarker vs control group as 4: 1 ratio. The biomarker group will be offered for entry into a specific protocol based on their molecular cohort and treated with specific targeted agents in combination with weekly paclitaxel; 1) EGFR cohort (EGFR 2+ or EGFR 3+) for pan-ERBB inhibitor (afatinib), 2)PTEN loss cohort (PTEN score less than 100) for PIK3CB inhibitor (GSK2636771), 3) PD-L1 positive, MSI-high, or EBV positive cases for nivolumab, 4) none for weekly paclitaxel.</description>
