  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Current dose escalation regimens with and without chemotherapy have failed to achieve
      improved local control and overall survival over standard of care therapy to date.
      Difficulties with dose escalation have been largely due to dose limiting toxicities of
      surrounding normal organs, in particular to the normal lung parenchyma, and esophagus. Real
      time, online adaptive planning using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) could achieve
      significant volume reduction of primary lung disease over the course of therapy, thereby
      reducing dose to normal structures, and providing a mechanism in which to dose escalate
      safely, and more effectively with accurate target delineation.

      The investigators hypothesize that MRI based adaptive planning will provide a novel method to
      dose escalate safely with acceptable organ at risk doses. In addition, further improvements
      in radiotherapy targeting accuracy, normal tissue avoidance, and conformality of
      target-tissue coverage will be achieved through the use of 4D real-time tracking which is
      derived by deformably registering daily MR and planning MR (MRsim) and Computed Tomography
      Simulator (CTsim) with advanced non-rigid image-registration tools.

    <description>MRI-based adaptative radiation planning can provide a method for dose escalation to improve locoregional Failure (LRF/LRP) rates at 2 years in study participants. Locoregional failure/progression (LRF/LRP) will be defined as development of progressive lung cancer centered within 1 cm from the initial planning target volume (PTV). Progressive disease in any of the 14 nodal stations will be considered as regional recurrence. Progression will be assessed by Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1 criteria. with integration of MRI/CT.</description>

                  Control and Prevention (CDC) definition (Note: HIV testing is not required for
                  entry into this protocol) The need to exclude patients with AIDS from this
                  protocol is necessary because the treatments involved in this protocol may be
                  significantly immunosuppressive. Protocol-specific requirements may also exclude
