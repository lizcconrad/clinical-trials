      The purpose of the study is to determine the impact of the offer to participate in the
      Practice Self-Regulation (PS-R) (treatment) relative to the offer to participate in the
      Therapy Practice Group (control) on increasing knowledge of sexual health and the impact of
      trauma on sexual decision-making and preventing teen pregnancy and high-risk behaviors nine
      months after the end of treatment.

      The Policy &amp; Research Group (PRG) will be evaluating the Teen Pregnancy Prevention program,
      Practice Self-Regulation (PSR). This intervention is designed to address gaps in the existing
      evidence, reduce disparities in teen pregnancy and associated sexual and reproductive health
      outcomes, and serve high-need populations. The intervention is composed of ten structured,
      individual therapy sessions intended to promote optimal sexual decision making. By increasing
      knowledge of sexual health and the impact of trauma on sexual decision-making, youth are
      encouraged and supported in practicing self-regulation. The primary focus of the study will
      be to investigate the impact of the intervention on participants' self-reported sexual
      behaviors (condom use and number of sexual partners). In addition, the study will include
      exploratory investigations of the following theoretically relevant antecedents to behavior
      and pathways to behavior change: (1) knowledge of STIs and safe sex practices (including
      avoiding unintended pregnancies); (2) attitudes and beliefs toward safe sex practices; (3)
      attitudes and beliefs regarding emotions and self-regulation; (4) self-efficacy to engage in
      safe sex behaviors; (5) affect regulation self-efficacy; (6) safe sex intentions; (7) safe
      sex commitment; (8) self-regulatory intentions; (9) self-regulatory commitment; (10)
      self-esteem; (11) self-regulatory behaviors and tendencies; and (12) emotional regulation
      behaviors. The control (counterfactual) condition, Therapy Practice Group, consists of
      therapy as usual without the incorporation of elements vital to the Practice Self-Regulation
      (PSR) intervention. All eligible individuals who provided the proper consent to participate
      were randomized and enrolled into the study at the time they attended their first scheduled
      study session. Outcomes will be assessed using self-reported, participant-level data gathered
      (by way of a questionnaire) at three time points: baseline (enrollment); post-program
      (immediately after the end of the intervention period; 18 weeks after baseline) and 9 month
      follow-up (9 months following the end of the intervention period; 13 months after baseline).
      The study is taking place in New Mexico, Michigan, and Maine at 5 clinics that are serving
      youth between the ages of 14 and 19 who have been impacted by adverse childhood experiences
      (ACEs).

    <description>The primary outcome will be the mean differences between the treatment and control group participants in self-reported sexual behaviors at 9-month follow-up; exploratory analyses will examine differences in sexual behaviors post-program and differences in other theoretically relevant outcomes (e.g., attitudes, self-efficacies, self-regulatory behaviors) at both post-program and 9-month follow-up.
The independent variable of interest will be the treatment assignment, which will be operationalized as being randomly assigned to the active treatment (1) or the control condition (0).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>consistency of contraceptive use</measure>
    <time_frame>9 months after the end of the intervention</time_frame>
    <description>The risk outcome is operationalized as the proportion of times a person reports having sexual intercourse without using any form of birth control (including condoms). The measure is calculated from the following items:
The measure is calculated by dividing the total number of times a person reported having sexual intercourse without using any contraception by the total number of times she reported having sexual intercourse.
The resulting variable is a continuous proportion with values that range from 0 to 1, where 0 indicates that a person has not engaged in sexual intercourse without birth control in the past three months, and 1 indicates that the person has engaged in sexual intercourse without birth control (risk behavior) 100% of the times they had sex in the past three months.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>frequency of sexual activity</measure>
    <time_frame>9 months after the end of the intervention</time_frame>
    <description>The risk outcome is operationalized as the number of times in the past three months a person reports having any type of sex.
The measure is taken directly from the following item:
â€¢ In total, how many times have you had any type of sex in the past 3 months?
The variable is continuous, with values ranging from 0 to k, where 0= no sexual activity reported in past 3 months and k = number of times sex reported.</description>
