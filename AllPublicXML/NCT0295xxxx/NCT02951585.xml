  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Intra-articular hyaluronic acid injections, also known as viscosupplementation, are a
      treatment option for knee osteoarthritis that serves to restore the decreasing rheological
      properties of synovial fluid. KARTILAGE® CROSS is a visco-elastic gel of highly purified
      reticulated hyaluronic acid. It contains mannitol to provide an anti-oxidative action and to
      avoid hyaluronic acid depolymerization. Reticulation and mannitol increase the residency time
      of the product in the joint cavity then allowing a single injection in painful knee
      osteoarthritis patients.

      The US food and drugs administration (FDA) and European medicine agency (EMA), have recently
      published guidelines recommending a higher level of integration of biomarkers in the
      development and testing of new drugs to advance decision-making on dosing, time and treatment
      effect, trial design, and risk/benefit analysis. Biomarkers can be used not only in the
      process of drug development, but also in the future in assessment of individual patient's
      response to treatment.

      Several soluble biomarkers have been identified as potential candidates to predict or monitor
      the efficacy of intervention. Coll2-1, a degradation product of type II collagen, and
      Coll2-1NO2, a nitrated form of the Coll2-1 peptide have been studied in human osteoarthritis
      and entered the qualification process. Evidences demonstrated them to be pertinent and to be
      foresee as markers used for the diagnosis, the prognosis, the burden of disease and the
      monitoring of a treatment efficacy.

      The aim of this study was to provide with the first kinetic data regarding biomarkers in
      painful knee osteoarthritis patients treated with a new reticulated hyaluronic acid. The
      effects of the treatment were compared to those of saline solution. The primary endpoint was
      a specific osteoarthritis biomarker, Coll2-1. The secondary endpoints were the effects of the
      treatment or placebo on other biomarkers of osteoarthritis, its clinical efficacy and
      tolerance
