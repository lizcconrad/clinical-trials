      The purpose of this study is to determine whether manipulative osteopathic treatment
      associated exercises improves pain and function in individuals with chronic non-specific neck
      pain Design: a randomized single blind placebo controlled trial will be conducted trial.
      Patients (n=40) with non-specific neck pain will be randomized to receive 1) osteopathic
      manipulative treatment and exercise (n=20) or 2) exercise alone (n=20). Participants will
      receive 8 treatments during 4 weeks.

      Clinical outcomes will be obtained at 1 week, four weeks and 24 weeks after end of treatment.

      Methods:

      The primary outcome will be pain measured by 11-point numerical pain rating scale.

      The secondary outcome will be disability measured by the Neck Disability Index, range of
      motion measured by Cervical Range of Motion device, Pressure pain threshold measured by
      electronic algometer.
