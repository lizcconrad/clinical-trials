  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate whether daily laughter frequency is associated
      with pain intensity and emotional state ratings in individuals who have fibromyalgia
      syndrome.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Participants will be asked to provide (or authorize the researcher to obtain) fibromyalgia
      diagnosis confirmation from a health care provider.

      Initially, participants will complete a demographics form and two screening assessments. Then
      for 14 days, they will be asked to rate their momentary mood and overall pain levels three
      times per day (shortly after waking up, around 3:00 p.m., and at about an hour before
      bedtime). At the same time, they will be asked to log each instance of laughter as it occurs,
      daily, for 14 days. They will carry the log with them throughout each day in order to
      document each instance of laughter.
