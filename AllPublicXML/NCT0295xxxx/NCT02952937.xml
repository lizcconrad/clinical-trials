      The purpose of this clinical trial is to (1) evaluate the bioequivalence(BE) of GLA5PR
      GLARS-NF3 tablet 300mg administered regular diet relative to GLA5PR GLARS-NF1 tablet 300mg
      administered regular diet and (2) determine the safety and tolerability of a single dose of
      GLA5PR GLARS-NF3 tablet 300mg administered regular diet and GLA5PR GLARS-NF1 tablet 300mg
      administered regular diet.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      To assess the single dose pharmacokinetics, safety, and tolerability of GLA5PR GLARS-NF3
      tablet 300mg administered regular diet relative to GLA5PR GLARS-NF1 tablet 300mg administered
      regular diet. IP will be administered 1 tablet(300mg) once a day(QD) after evening meal.
