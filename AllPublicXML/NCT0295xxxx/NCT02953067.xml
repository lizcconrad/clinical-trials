    <textblock>
      This trial is designed to compare different treatments on Lisfranc fractures. The trial
      consist of 2 different strata. Stratum 1: In mild injuries the comparison is between
      conservative treatment and operative treatment with open reduction and internal fixation
      (ORIF). Stratum 2: In severe injuries the comparison is between operative treatment with open
      reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) and primary arthrodesis. The primary outcome measure
      will be AOFAS Midfoot Score, and secondary outcome measure will be VAS Foot and Ankle.

    <description>Between group differences in pain and function of the foot measured with Visual Analog Scale of the Foot and Ankle (FA VAS). FA VAS scale is a self-administered patient questionnaire based on 20 questions in three different question categories (pain, function and other complaints). The total value of all questions is 2000. This total value is divided with 20 resulting in a possible score from 0 to 100 points, where 100 is the perfect score.</description>
