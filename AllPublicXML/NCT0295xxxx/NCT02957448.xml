        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Signed Informed Consent

          2. Healthy men and women (not of child bearing potential) as determined by medical
             history, surgical history, physical examination, vital signs, electrocardiogram (ECG),

          5. Men who are sexually active with WOCBP must agree to follow instructions for method(s)
             of contraception for the duration of treatment plus 5 half-lives of Rifampin (1 day)
             plus 90 days for a total of 91 days post-treatment completion.
