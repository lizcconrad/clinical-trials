      Two part, dose escalation and dose expansion study. Open label, multi center, non randomized,
      multiple dose, safety, pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic study of single agent PF-06747143
      in sequential dose levels of adult patients with refractory or relapsed AML in order to
      establish maximum tolerated dose (MTD), recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) or maximally
      permitted dose (MPD) following by a 3 arm dose expansion with PF-06747143 in combination with
      standard of care chemotherapy in adult patients with AML.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients will receive intravenous (IV) PF-06747143 as a weekly infusion (QW) in 28 day cycles
      at escalating doses. The proposed dosing scheme includes 0.3, 1.0, 3.0, 10, 15, and 20 mg/kg.
      Patients will be monitored for dose limiting toxicity (DLT) in the dose escalation in order
      to define the MTD. Two of the three arms in the dose expansion will include PF-06747143 in
      combination with standard of care chemotherapy and will include a safety lead in. The third
      arm, pending clinical data, will be PF-06747143 as a single agent.
