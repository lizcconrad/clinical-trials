      The purpose of this study is to evaluate predictability of a a respiratory variation in pulse
      oximeter plethysmography (delta POP) for fluid responsiveness in children undergoing major
      surgery.

      When there are clinical signs of hypovolemia, such as hypotension, decreased urine output and
      central venous pressure less than 5 mmHg, the study will be started. At index fingers of both
      hand, pulse oximeter sensors are applied by gradually increasing the contact force (from 0 to
      1.4N, being increased by 0.2-0.3N). Then, pulse oximeter plethysmography (POP) waveforms are
      obtained for 90 seconds. Then, intravenous crystalloid fluid 10 mL/kg is infused for 15 min.

      To evaluate the change of cardiac output, transesophageal or transthoracic echocardiography
      is performed before and after fluid administration. In addition, hemodynamic parameters
      including pulse pressure variation, systolic pressure variation, pleth variability index and
      central venous pressure are also recorded before and after fluid administration.

      Finally, patients will be divided into fluid responder group and non-responder group. If
      stroke volume index measured using echocardiography increases over 15% after fluid
      administration, the patient will be fluid responder.

      Delta POP (%) obtained from each finger with different contact force is calculated as
      follows;(POPmax - POPmin)/{(POPmax + POPmin)/2}. Using receiver operating characteristic
      curve, diagnostic power of delta POPs from different contact forces for fluid responsiveness
      will be evaluated. In addition, difference between delta POP from low contact force and that
      from high contact force will be evaluated.

    <description>Delta POP (%) obtained from each finger with different contact force is calculated as follows;(POPmax - POPmin)/{(POPmax + POPmin)/2}. Delta POP differs according to contact force. After calculation of each delta POP, we will evaluate the ability to predict fluid responsiveness of delta POP using receiver operating characteristic curve.</description>
