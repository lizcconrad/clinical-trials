      Phase I Study to Evaluate the Safety of Dexibuprofen 300mg (Apsen Pharmaceuticals A / S.)

      A single oral dose of test medicine will be administered to participants in a practical
      period with the aid of 200 mL of water at room temperature. During administration,
      participants should stay in seated position. Participants will be confined at least 12 hours
      prior to administration and will remain for about 24 hours after the same, totaling about 36
      hours of confinement.

      After 36 hours of confinement the participantes will proceed to the multi-dose use phase for
      seven days in fed conditions.

      To assess safety, an evaluation of the vital signs, laboratory tests and health status of the
      participants will be carried out throughout the study.
