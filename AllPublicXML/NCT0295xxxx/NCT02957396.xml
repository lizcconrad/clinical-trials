  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Finerenone is developed for the treatment of diabetic kidney disease (adults) and chronic
      kidney disease (children). The purpose of the proposed trial is to test the pharmacokinetics
      of a novel liquid formulation for the treatment of children in comparison to the adult tablet
      formulation.
