  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Differences in pDCs function related to gender have been demonstrated in adults but have
      never been addressed in children. Yet, differences in immune responses related to gender also
      exist in children, both in responses to pathogens and susceptibility to autoimmune diseases.
      The investigators suppose that these differences are partly linked to difference in pDCs
      functions. This study aim is to compare pDCs functions in children based on gender and
      pubertal status. This study will be performed in healthy children, boys with Klinefelter
      syndrome and girls with Turner syndrome.

    <textblock>
      There are differences in immune responses according to gender. Women have stronger responses
      against pathogens, especially viruses but are also more susceptible to develop autoimmune
      diseases. These points reflect more robust innate and adaptive responses in women.
      Plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) are key actor of innate immune responses through their
      ability to produce large amounts of type 1 Interferons (IFN1) secondary to stimulation of
      their toll like receptors (TLR) 7 and 9 by nucleic acids. Thus, pDCs play a major beneficial
      role in antiviral responses. In autoimmune diseases like Systemic Erythematous Lupus, pDCs
      also play a role, mostly deleterious, through inappropriate production of IFN1 upon
      stimulation of their TLR's by self nucleic acids. In these diseases, pDCs from women have
      been demonstrated to produce more IFN1 as compared to men, a phenomenon that can be linked to
      both hormonal and genetic factors. Indeed, the investigators research team demonstrated that
      IFN1 production by human pDCs can be increased by oestradiol through a specific receptor
      present in pDCs. Regarding genetics, some studies recently shown in a humanized mouse model,
      that pDCs developing from female hematopoietic precursor cells have an enhanced TLR 7
      mediated IFN1 response as compared to male ones. These results indicate that X chromosome
      dosage could contribute independently to the enhanced TLR 7 mediated response of pDCs from
      women. Although some genes implicated in IFN1 production are on the X chromosome, including
      TLR 7, the mechanism underlying this observation are presently unknown.
