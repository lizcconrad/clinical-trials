    <textblock>
      The study is a double-blind (within dose level), placebo-controlled Phase I study to assess
      the safety, reactogenicity and tolerability of two intranasal dose levels of SynGEM®: a low
      dose level (140 μg F-protein/2mg BLPs) and a high dose level ( 350 μg F-protein/5mg BLPs),
      each administered twice according to a prime-boost schedule 28 days apart at Day 1 and Day
      29. The two dose levels will be recruited sequentially.

      Immunogenicity end-points will include assessment of humoral and cellular responses at
      selected time-points.

      A total of 48 healthy adult volunteers aged 18 to 49 years will be recruited. The first 24
      subjects will be randomized 3:1 to SynGEM® low dose level (140 μg F-protein/2mg BLPs) or
      placebo administered at Day 1 and Day 29 (Group 1). After completion of recruitment of Group
      1, if no pausing rule is met until 7 days post prime in all Group 1 subjects, 24 additional
      subjects will be randomized 3:1 to SynGEM® high dose level (350 μg F-protein/2mg BLPs) or
      placebo administered at Day 1 and Day 29 (Group 2).

      Recruitment will be guided by pre-specified pausing rules. Recruitment of Group 1 will be
      staggered as follows: a sentinel cohort of 2 subjects (1 subject receiving SynGEM® and 1
      subject receiving placebo) will be recruited on study Day 1; subjects will be followed up to
      Visit 2 (3 days post-dosing) and if no pausing rule is met, a second cohort of 2 subjects (1
      subject receiving SynGEM® and 1 subject receiving placebo) will be vaccinated; subjects will
      be followed up to Visit 2 (3 days post-dosing) and if no pausing rule is met, recruitment
      will be extended to the remaining 20 subjects (16 on SynGEM®/4 on placebo) of Group 1.

      Escalation to the high dose level will be implemented only after collection of safety data of
      all subjects in Group 1 for at least 7 days post-prime if no pausing rule is met. Group 2
      will also be comprised of a total of 24 subjects and recruitment will be staggered and
      subjected to the same pausing rules as in Group 1.

      Each subject will return to the site for study visits 3, 7 and 28 days post-prime
      vaccination; 28 days after prime vaccination the boost vaccination will be administered and
      subjects will return 3, 7, 28 days after boost vaccination. A primary analysis will be
      carrying out on data collected up to this timepoints. Subjects will be followed up for safety
      and immunogenicity thereafter up to 180 days post-prime.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Male or female aged 18 - 49 years inclusive.

          2. Able to give written informed consent to participate.

          3. Comprehension of the study requirements, expressed availability for the required study
             period, and ability to attend scheduled visits.

          4. Healthy, as determined by medical history, physical examination, vital signs, and
             clinical judgment.

          5. Must have acceptable laboratory parameters* within 28 days before Day 1. Acceptable
             laboratory parameters are defined as follows:

             A. Hemoglobin, Red Blood Cell (RBC) count and hematocrit: within laboratory normal
             sex-specific range.

             B. White Blood Cell (WBC) count within the normal laboratory range C. Sodium and
             potassium within laboratory normal range D. Total bilirubin within laboratory normal
             range E. Alanine aminotransferase (ALT)/aspartate aminotransferase (AST): ≤1.1x
             institutional ULN.

             F. Serum creatinine: ≤1.1x institutional upper limit of normal (ULN).

             *Note: If the acceptable laboratory screening parameters listed above are out of the
             above defined range, repeat of screening tests is permitted once, provided there is an
             alternative explanation for the out-of-range value. Out of range results for
             laboratory tests either listed or not in Section 8.6.3 other than those covered in the
             list above are acceptable if considered not clinically significant by the
             Investigator.

          6. A Body Mass Index (BMI) between 18 and 32, inclusive. BMI = weight (kg)/height2 (m2).

          7. Women of childbearing potential must have a negative serum β-human chorionic
             gonadotropin (β-hCG) pregnancy test at screening and a negative urine β-hCG pregnancy
             test within 24 hours preceding receipt of each dose and agree to practice, if not
             already practicing, highly effective birth control measures from 28 days before the
             prime vaccination until at least 90 days after the boost vaccination. For women
             already practicing highly effective birth control measurements for at least 28 days at
             screening start, recruitment can occur as soon as all screening procedures are
             completed. The following birth control measure will be considered highly effective:

               1. Combined (estrogen and progestogen containing) hormonal contraception associated
                  with inhibition of ovulation (oral, intravaginal, transdermal), progestogen-only
                  hormonal contraception associated with inhibition of ovulation (oral, injectable
                  or implantable), intrauterine device, intrauterine hormone releasing system,
                  bilateral tubal ligation, vasectomized partner (if the partner is the sole sexual
                  partner and has received medical assessment of the surgical success).

               2. True abstinence: when this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of
                  the subject. [Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal,
                  post-ovulation methods), declaration of abstinence for the duration of a trial,
                  and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception].

               3. If not heterosexually active at screening, must agree to practice highly
                  effective birth control measures described above if they become heterosexually
                  active from that moment onwards until at least 90 days after the boost
                  vaccination.

               4. Agree not to donate eggs (ova, oocytes) for the purposes of assisted reproduction
                  from the start of screening onwards until at least 90 days after the boost
                  vaccination.

          8. Women of non-childbearing potential, defined as postmenopausal (&gt;45 years of age with
             amenorrhea for ≥2 years; for female of &gt;45 years of age with amenorrhea for more than
             6 months but less than 2 years confirmation of a serum follicle stimulating hormone
             (FSH) &gt;40 mIU/mL will be required to consider them of non-childbearing potential) or
             surgically sterile (hysterectomy, bilateral tubal ligation, or bilateral
             oophorectomy), are not required to use the birth control methods as described in
             Inclusion Criterion #7.

          9. A man who has not had a vasectomy with medical assessment of the surgical success and
             is sexually active with a woman of childbearing potential must agree to consistently
             use a barrier method of birth control, such as condom with spermicidal
             foam/gel/film/cream/suppository. Men must also agree not to donate sperm from the
             first study vaccine administration (Day 1) until 90 days after the boost vaccination.

         10. Subjects must be willing to provide verifiable identification and their National
             Insurance/Passport number for the purpose of The Over-volunteering Prevention System
             (TOPS) registration.

         11. Subject must have a means to be contacted.

        Exclusion Criteria:
