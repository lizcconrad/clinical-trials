      This is a phase 2 study to see how effective investigational drug, JNJ-42756493, is when
      given in combination with dexamethasone in two groups of patients with multiple myeloma
      (cancer of the plasma cells, a type of white blood cell present in bone marrow) that has
      relapsed (has come back after a period of improvement) or refractory (did not respond to
      standard treatment).

      Participants in the study will be assigned to one of two groups: One group of participants
      will be FGFR3 wild-type (participants whose tumors have no mutations or changes of a gene
      called FGFR3) and the other group will be FGFR3 mutated (participants whose tumors have
      mutations of FGFR3).

      Participants will receive JNJ-42756493 with dexamethasone for as long as their diseases do
      not progress (worsen) and they do not experience unacceptable side effects for a maximum of
      24 cycles (approximately 22 months).

      While on the study drugs, participants will be asked to visit the clinic about 2 times during
      Cycles 1 and 2 and once during Cycle 3 and subsequent cycles for tests and procedures.

    <description>JNJ-42756493: For the first cycle, 8 mg orally (by mouth), once each day for 14 days of each 28-day periods called cycles. Then dose of JNJ-42756493 may then be increased to 9 mg taken orally if no significant side effects related to JNJ-42756493 are seen during the first 14 days.
Dexamethasone: 40 mg, orally, on days 1-4, 9-12, 17-20 for the first two cycles. Starting cycle 3, dexamethasone will be taken on days 1, 8, 15 and 22 (once weekly).
Patients over the age of 75 will take a reduced dose of dexamethasone of 20 mg on starting cycle 1 on days 1-4, 9-12, 17-20 for the first two cycles. Starting cycle 3, dexamethasone will be taken on days 1, 8, 15 and 22 (once weekly).</description>
