    <textblock>
      Through an online survey, participants will be shown different visual presentations of
      vaccination data related to schools and child care centers. Participants will rate how
      important this information is when thinking about their child's health and school choice.
      Participants will also be asked survey questions about their knowledge of Colorado state
      vaccination legislation, their opinions and practices related to childhood vaccinations, and
      their views of a Zika virus vaccine.
