  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the current study is to test the efficacy of two brief, behavioral
      interventions intended to improve burnout among doctoral-level graduate students (n = 102).
      Specifically, individuals will be randomly assigned to one of three intervention conditions:
      1) Reward: a brief intervention to help participants increase engagement in healthy and
      rewarding values-driven behaviors, 2) Approach: a brief intervention to help participants
      identify and decrease emotion-driven avoidance of important goals, or 3) Control: a control
      condition that involves monitoring only. Multilevel modeling will be used to assess changes
      in burnout, mood, and stress, following the interventions, controlling for participants'
      individual baseline levels of these variables.
