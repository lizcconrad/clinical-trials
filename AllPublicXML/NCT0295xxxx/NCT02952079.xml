  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to compare which treatment - BlephEx or MiBoFlo - will be a better
      option for patients suffering from dry eye secondary to Meibomian Gland dysfunction.

    <textblock>
      The investigators have previously studied the effect of the BlephEx instrument (debridement
      of lid debris) in relieving signs and symptoms of blepharitis (Connor CG et al, ARVO 2014).
      This previous study demonstrated positive results from the BlephEx treatment. Warming the
      eyelids (e.g., using warm wash cloths) still remains a viable treatment option for this
      disease. However, patients are often non-compliant with warm compress therapy due to the
      requirement of performing it at least twice per day. The MiBoflo delivers uniform and
      consistent amounts of heat to the eyelid. It is suggested that two treatments over 30 days is
      adequate to relieve signs and symptoms of Meibomian gland dysfunction. This equipment is
      currently used in optometric practices in this country.

      There are no clinical studies comparing BlephEx and MiBoflo as treatment options for
      blepharitis. Hence, the current study will provide new and useful information on which
      treatment option may be better for treating blepharitis and Meibomian gland dysfunction. Part
      of this study will also investigate if a combination of BlephEx and MiBoflo treatments is
      more beneficial to the patient. The data generated will directly benefit clinical practice
      and impact several millions of patients who suffer from this Blepharitis and / or Meibomian
      gland dysfunction.
