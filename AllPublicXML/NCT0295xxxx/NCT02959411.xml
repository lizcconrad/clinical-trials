  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will clarify the clinical usefulness of Tolvaptan therapy in patients with
      complicated acute decompensated heart failure and hyponatremia (low blood sodium).
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Despite its demonstrated efficacy and tolerability, Tolvaptan remains underutilized for the
      treatment of acute decompensated heart failure (ADHF) in many centers. Post-hoc analysis
      suggests that Tolvaptan may provide optimal outcomes in patients with more advanced heart
      failure (HF) including those with cardiorenal syndrome, marked hyponatremia and severe
      congestion, or a combination of those conditions. The efficacy of Tolvaptan in HF patients
      with loop diuretic resistance and in those requiring inotropic support remains uncertain.

      The purpose of this study is to examine the benefit of Tolvaptan versus the current standard
      of care diuretic therapy for patients hospitalized with ADHF and evidence of advanced or
      complex HF with severe hyponatremia. Patients with advanced or complex disease are defined as
      those with suboptimal diuretic response over a 48 hour period.

    <description>Tolvaptan is a selective vasopressin receptor antagonist that inhibits activation of the V2 receptor and synthesis and insertion of the aquaporin2 channel into the apical membrane of the renal collecting duct. Tolvaptan inhibits the reabsorption of free water, inducing free water diuresis and increasing serum sodium levels without adversely influencing electrolyte levels or stimulating the sympathetic nervous system or renin-angiotensin system.</description>
