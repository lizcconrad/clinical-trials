  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research is to test the clinical value of a new P-wave sensitive
      recording vector compared to a standard ECG limb lead II vector from similar easy-to-use
      long-term cardiac rhythm monitoring patch systems, the Carnation TM Ambulatory Monitoring
      (CAM) System and the Zio-XT iRhythm. The P-wave is a critical aspect of the
      electrocardiogram. The purpose of this study is to see if the P-wave centric focus of the CAM
      system improves arrhythmia diagnosis.

      This study is intended to compare the new Carnation patch monitoring system with the Zio
      patch, which represents the current standard for continuous recording of the ECG over
      extended periods. The primary endpoint for this comparison will be diagnostic yield with
      secondary endpoints being ease of use and comfort.
