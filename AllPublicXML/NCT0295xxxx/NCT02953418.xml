          2. Patient has evidence of ESCN, within the last 3 months, patient demonstrated a new
             diagnosis or a reconfirmed diagnosis of squamous MGIN or HGIN of the esophagus

          3. On endoscopic examination, subject has at least one USL that measures at least 3 cm in
             at least one dimension and is greater than ¼ of the esophageal circumference and has
             MGIN or HGIN on biopsy, confirmed by central pathologist

          4. All lesions are completely flat (type 0-IIb) both on WLE and Lugol's chromoendoscopy

          5. The maximum allowable linear length of &quot;USL-bearing esophagus&quot; is 12 cm

          6. Baseline endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) (if applicable) shows no exclusionary findings
             for the trial

          7. Computed tomography (CT) scan of chest and upper third of the abdomen (if applicable)
             shows no exclusionary findings for the trial

          8. Based on the judgment of the study endoscopist, the patient is eligible for treatment
             and follow-up endoscopy and biopsy as required by the protocol

          9. The subject is willing to provide written, informed consent to participate in this
             clinical study and understands the responsibilities of trial participation

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patient has esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC)

          2. Any non-flat (Paris type 0-I, 0-IIa, 0-IIc, 0-III) abnormalities anywhere in the
             esophagus

          3. Any USL with MGIN or worse on biopsy outside the treatment area

          4. Esophageal stricture preventing passage of a therapeutic endoscope

          5. Any prior endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR) or endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD)

          6. Any esophageal dilation in the past 12 months

          7. Any history of a non-squamous cell cancer of the esophagus, or any history of a
             squamous cell cancer of the esophagus (any stage)

          8. Any previous ablative therapy within the esophagus (photodynamic therapy, multipolar
             electrical coagulation, argon plasma coagulation, laser treatment, or other) or any
             radiation therapy to the esophagus.

          9. Previous esophageal surgery, except fundoplication without complications (i.e., no
             slippage, dysphagia, etc.)

         10. Evidence of esophageal varices detected within last 6 months or at initial RFA

         16. Patient has an implantable pacing device (examples: automated implantable cardioverter
             defibrillator, neurostimulator, cardiac pacemaker) and has not received clearance for
             enrollment in this study by specialist responsible for the pacing device

         17. Patient has life expectancy less than 2 years

         18. Patient suffers from psychiatric or other illness and/or has a known history of
             unresolved drug or alcohol dependency that would limit ability to comprehend or follow
             instructions related to informed consent, post- treatment instructions, or follow-up
             guidelines
