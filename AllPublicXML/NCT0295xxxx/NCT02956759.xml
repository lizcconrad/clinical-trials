  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To compare immediate laser pan-retinal photocoagulation (PRP) treatment of severe or very
      severe non proliferative diabetic retinopathy (NPDR) stage versus deferral of treatment until
      the appearance of any proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR) in rural and urban patients in
      China.

      Interview data from some patients and survey data from ophthalmologists in the study
      hospitals will help determine acceptability of early treatment, and how to overcome barriers
      to increased use of this option.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      China now has the world's largest number of diabetic persons. Population studies show that
      only 10% of Chinese rural-dwellers with DR receive therapy. The current standard approach to
      treatment of DR often requires patients to return for multiple examinations over years,
      before they reach trial-proven criteria for treatment. This long process is ill-suited to
      support good compliance with care in low-resource settings. Our recent published review
      suggests that earlier PRP treatment, which could reduce the burden of compliance, may be
      clinically effective and cost effective, but the current evidence base is insufficient to
      make a firm recommendation.
