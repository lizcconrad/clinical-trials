      Method: Observational study of 44 men with spinal cord injury, age above 18 years, injury
      time more than six months, sexually active and accompanied in Recife referral hospitals. The
      degree of neurological impairment was assessed using the revised version in 2011 ASIA
      Impairment Scale (AIS), depressive symptoms were detected by the Beck Depression Inventory,
      and the evaluation of sexual function was obtained through the Erectile Function of
      International Index (IIEF). Descriptive statistics and bivariate analysis to assess the
      association were applied, with 0,05 significance level.

        The study included 44 men, aged between 18 and 60 years with a clinical diagnosis of
        traumatic spinal cord injury, injury time less than six months heterosexual and sexually
        active. The study excluded patients who had erectile dysfunction attributed to endocrine or
        metabolic disease order, those who underwent surgery in the genital area, such as radical
        prostatectomy or penile implant and cognitive impairment.
