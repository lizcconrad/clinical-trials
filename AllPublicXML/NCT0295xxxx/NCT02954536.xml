    <description>Pembrolizumab 200 mg IV every 3 weeks, trastuzumab (8 mg/kg loading dose; 6 mg/kg maintenance) IV every 3 weeks with cisplatin IV every 3 weeks with oral capecitabine 2 weeks on/1 week off. Each cycle consists of 21 days. Treatment will be administered on an outpatient basis. In Cycle 1, patients will initiate therapy with trastuzumab 8 mg/kg IV with pembrolizumab 200 mg IV. CT/MRI scan will be performed after the initial 3 weeks (1 cycle) to determine response to pembrolizumab and trastuzumab combination. With subsequent cycles, all patients will begin systemic chemotherapy with the capecitabine/cisplatin regimen in addition to pembrolizumab 200 mg IV with trastuzumab 6 mg/kg maintenance. Patients will receive cisplatin 80 mg/m2 IV on Day 1, and capecitabine 850mg/m2 twice a day on Days 1 through 14, every 3 weeks.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patient must have pathologically or cytologically MSKCC confirmed esophageal, gastric
             or gastroesophageal junction (GEJ) adenocarcinoma by the enrolling institution.

             immunohistochemistry (IHC 3+) or fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH+ is defined
             as HER2:CEP17 ratio ≥ 2.0). MSKCC or enrolling institution confirmation of HER2 status
             is not mandatory prior to enrollment and treatment on study. For patients with outside
             HER2 testing, if sufficient tissue is available HER2 testing will be repeated at MSKCC
             or enrolling institution for purpose of analysis and will not impact the patient's

             should be submitted to MSKCC for future correlative analysis, but will not be required
             prior registration. Note: if tissue is depleted, patient will still be eligible after
             discussion with the MSK PI.

          -  Patients may have received no prior chemotherapy for Stage IV disease. Patients may
