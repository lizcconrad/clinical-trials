  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pregnant women with a positive preoperative Supine stress test were found to be a subgroup at
      increased risk of symptomatic hypotension after spinal anesthesia
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients will be placed in dorsal decubitus dislocating the uterus to the left for a few
      minutes, with blood pressure and heart rate recorded three times, with a three-minute
      interval between measurements to obtain mean baseline levels and this will be repeated in an
      upright position to record the same measurement.Orthostatic hypotension (Orthostatic
      hypotension &quot;OH&quot; is defined specifically as a 20mmHg drop in systolic, and/or a 10mmHg drop
      in diastolic blood pressure within 3 minutes of standing.
