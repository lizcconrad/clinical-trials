  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this project is to establish a bio-repository of diverse specimen types to provide
      investigators access to specimens in order to further research related to metabolism and the
      microbiome in the pediatric population.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Human microbial cell lines, stool and/or DNA and RNA will be collected from participants
      10-18 years with a BMI greater than 95th percentile and their healthy siblings.

      Specimens will be collected at 3 time points over a seven month period. Healthy siblings will
      provide just one blood and stool sample. Samples will be maintained at the Duke Medical
      Science Research Laboratory.
