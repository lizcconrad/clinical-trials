  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this randomized controlled trial is to establish feasibility and provide
      initial estimates of efficacy of two computerized cognitive training procedures (a form of
      Positive Mental Imagery Training, PMIT, and a form of Cognitive Control Training, CCT)
      delivered as adjuncts to treatment as usual (TAU) in inpatient mental health treatment
      settings.

    <description>The Joviality, Self-Assurance, Attentiveness, and Serenity subscales of the extended PANAS (PANAS-X; Watson &amp; Clark, 1994) will be administered, following previous experimental research examining the effect of positive mental imagery on state mood (e.g. Holmes, Lang, &amp; Shah, 2009). Participants will be asked to rate the items according to how they have been feeling 'in the past week, that is, during the past seven days, including today'.</description>

    <description>Computerized Positive Mental Imagery Training (PMIT), a form of mental imagery-based cognitive bias modification adapted from previous experimental (e.g. Holmes, Lang, &amp; Shah, 2009) and clinical (e.g. Blackwell &amp; Holmes, 2010) work. The intervention consists of 8 sessions completed over a period of 2 weeks. The training takes place alongside participants' treatment as usual (TAU) in the inpatient setting.</description>
