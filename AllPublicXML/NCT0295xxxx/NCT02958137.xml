      The purposes of this study were to report 1) long-term outcomes on a large series of patients
      that underwent arthroscopic resection arthroplasty (ARA) for thumb basal joint arthritis
      (BJA) and 2) to compare outcomes of ARA for isolated carpometacarpal osteoarthritis versus
      those undergoing simultaneous ARA of CMC plus the scaphotrapeziotrapezoid joint for
      pantrapezial disease.

      Please note, all patients treated by Dr. Cobb for CMC and/or STT OA received the same
      treatment regardless of whether or not they chose to participate in the study. Patients who
      chose to enroll in the study received the same treatment as those who did not only their data
      was analyzed. Data collection is the same for those who do not participate, only their data
      is not analyzed.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Primary cases of ARA for thumb BJA with isolated CMC ARA or simultaneous ARA of the
             CMC and STT joints.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Exclusions included 19 cases that received interposition materials that since have
             been shown to produce unfavorable postoperative inflammatory responses, (Orthadapt
             Bioimplant, Pegasus Biologics, Irvine, CA and Artimplant Artelon CMC-I Spacer, Small
             Bone Innovations, LLC, New York, NY), 6 cases that had prior CMC surgery, and 27 cases
             that underwent concomitant surgeries that would potentially effect outcome.
