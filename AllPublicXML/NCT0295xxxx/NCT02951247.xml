  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A methodical evaluation of new CE-labelled Phonak Hearing Systems is intended to be conducted
      on hard of hearing participants to grant quality control prior to product launch. The aim of
      the investigation series is to ensure zero-defect overall performance of the new hearing
      systems as well as maximum benefit for the participant with the devices in comparison to
      previously outstanding Phonak Hearing Systems.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Phonak Hearing Systems pass through different development and study stages. At an early
      stage, feasibility studies are conducted to investigate new algorithms, features and
      functions in an isolated manner. If the benefit is proven, their performance is then
      investigated regarding interdependency between all available algorithms, features and
      functions running in parallel in a hearing aid (pivotal/pre-validation studies) and, as a
      result, they get optimized. Afterwards, and prior to product launch, the Phonak Hearing
      Systems undergo a final quality control in terms of clinical trials in the way as planned for
      this study (&quot;phase of final inspection&quot;). This will be a controlled, single blinded and
      randomised active comparator clinical evaluation which will be conducted mono centric at
      Sonova AG Headquarters based in Stäfa (Switzerland).

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Zero-defect performance in daily life</measure>
    <time_frame>Four weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The data, serving as primary outcomes are collected in a series of home trials taking place between the lab trial appointments. The zero-defect performance in daily life (that means: no interruptions, distortions, artefacts, feedback, system noise or other malfunctions) will be assessed with the aid of quantitative questionnaires. The results are &quot;Yes/No&quot; replies and open-ended.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Speech intelligibility in noise as signal to noise ration in dB (dB SNR)</measure>
    <time_frame>Two weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The data, serving as secondary outcomes are collected in a series of lab appointments. The speech intelligibility in noise will be assessed with the aid of the german Oldenburger sentence test. The result is the signal to noise ratio in dB (dB SNR). Descriptive statistics will be executed in the form of determining the median and quartiles. Interference statistics will be executed by applying the appropriate parametric or non-parametric test, depending on the data's distribution. A significance level of 5% is pursued.</description>

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Initial first fit acceptance (pre-calculation) in lab</measure>
    <time_frame>Two weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The data, serving other pre-specified outcomes are collected within the first lab appointment. The acceptance of the initial first fit will be assessed with the aid of quantitative questions within an interview. The results are points on a scale and open ended (e.g. Question: Please rate the sound quality; Answer scale: bad, poor, fair, good, excellent) . Descriptive statistics will be executed in the form of determining number of answers. Interference statistics will be executed by applying the appropriate parametric or non-parametric test, depending on the data's distribution. A significance level of 5% is pursued.</description>
