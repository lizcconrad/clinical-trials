    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this study is to determine the extent to which the Regenerative
      Peripheral Nerve Interface ( i.e. reinnervation of partial muscle grafts by residual
      peripheral nerves) enables both the generation of high-performance motor control signals for
      prosthetic limbs, and the input of sensory percepts by electrical stimulation.
