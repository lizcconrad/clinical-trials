  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to document lymphedema rates in patients requiring
      regional nodal irradiation (RNI) who receive hypofractionated radiation as compared to
      conventional radiation.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Participants with stage II or stage III node-positive breast cancer, or T3N0 node-negative
      will receive hypofractionated radiation for 4 weeks. We hypothesize that patients receiving a
      shorter course of radiation will have reduced lymphedema. Lymphedema is diagnosed when the
      patient's arm circumference measures 10% or more as compared to pre-treatment (baseline) arm
      circumference measurement. Secondary endpoints will address the effectiveness, quality of
      life, and side effect profile of a shortened course of treatment.

          -  Karnofsky Performance Status 50% - 100%

          -  Diagnosis of stage II or III node-positive breast cancer (NOTE: Stages include:
             T4a-cNany, T3N1, TxN2.) OR T3N0 node-negative breast cancer.

          -  For patients with TxN1 disease, one of the following criteria must be met: Grade 3; ≤

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Diagnosis of inflammatory breast cancer

          -  Previously diagnosed malignancy excluding basal or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin
             (unless disease-free for 5 years or more)

          -  Diagnosis of scleroderma

          -  Diagnosis of lupus

          -  Diagnosis of active dermatomyositis
