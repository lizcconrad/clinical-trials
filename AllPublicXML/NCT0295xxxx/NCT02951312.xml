  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study assessed the safety and ability of several doses of an orally inhaled medicine [ie,
      Glycopyrrolate Inhalation Solution = GIS] to improve airflow in the lungs when delivered with
      an electronic eFlow nebulizer system in patients with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease
      (COPD). The study was conducted in 12 patients in 2 parts. Part 1 was designed to find the
      once-a- day GIS dose that produced the highest improvement in lung airflow. Part 2 tested the
      GIS dose with the highest improvement in lung airflow and a placebo (ie, no drug) delivered
      by a general purpose nebulizer. The airflow improvements of the same GIS dose were compared
      between the two nebulizer systems to determine what effect the device had on GIS delivery.

      In Part I, 12 subjects were randomly allocated to one of 2 cohorts, running in parallel. The
      6 cohort 1 subjects received 25 mg and then 200 mg during their treatment periods 1 and 2,
      respectively. The 6 cohort 2 subjects received 75mg, 500mg, and 1000 mg during their
      treatment periods 1, 2, and 3, respectively. During Part II of the study, the same 12
      subjects from Part I were randomized to receive either 200 mg jet or placebo in a 1:1 ratio.
