      Background: The aim of this study was to investigate the levels of malondialdehyde (MDA),
      total antioxidant status (TAS), 8-hydroxy-2´- deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) in blood serum and
      saliva samples in female patients with chronic periodontitis (CP) and to compared healthy
      individuals.

      Materials and Methods: A total of 88 women were into four groups each which were consisted of
      twenty-two subjects. Groups were designed as periodontally and systemically healthy women
      (PCOS-CP-); periodontally healthy women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) (PCOS+CP-),
      systemically healthy women with CP (PCOS-,CP+) and women with PCOS and CP (PCOS+CP+). Serum
      and salivary samples were obtained, clinical periodontal parameters were recorded. MDA, TAS,
      8-OHdG levels were measured as biochemically.
