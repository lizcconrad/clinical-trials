  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In the last decades the prevalence of allergies has reached epidemic proportions. 10 to 15%
      of the population suffers from cat allergy. Investigators perform this study in order to
      further investigate symptom records and their evaluation in cat allergic patients.

      Investigators primarily aim to better standardize the symptom recording of cat allergic
      persons under real-life conditions and to evaluate the effect of hypoallergenic cats on
      symptom strength.
