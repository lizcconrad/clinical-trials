    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine how the body handles LY3185643 and rGlucagon and
      what effects LY3185643 and rGlucagon have on the body. This study will also help to determine
      if LY3185643 is safe and well-tolerated.

      This study will last at least 35 days, not including screening.
