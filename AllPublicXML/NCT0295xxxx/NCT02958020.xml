  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter cohort study on osteoporosis in six cities of China which locate in the
      east, south, north, west, middle of China respectively. At least 3000 middle-aged and elderly
      permanent residents (women aged from 45 to 79, and men aged from 50 to 79) in every city were
      enrolled. Residents with severe mental diseases, physical diseases or acute infectious
      diseases who could not cooperate with the survey as well as lactating or pregnant women were
      excluded. All the enrolled residents who signed informed consent will finish questionnaire
      including demographic characteristics, history of smoking, alcohol drinking, falls and
      fracture, family, chronic diseases and medicine,diary and physical practice. Osteoporosis
      risk, health status (EQ-5D) and constitution of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) will be
      evaluated. Fasting blood tests, bone mineral density and physical examinations (height,
      weight, waist circumference, hip circumference,grip,sit-to-stand test, tongue coating and
      pulse) will be performed at enrollment and every two years after enrollment. DNA of blood
      cells will be preserved.
