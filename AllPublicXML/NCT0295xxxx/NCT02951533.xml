      The purpose of the study is to compare the efficacy of Guselkumab with commercially available
      active comparator Fumaderm initial/Fumaderm tablets for the treatment of adult participants
      with moderate to severe plaque-type psoriasis who have not yet received any systemic therapy.

    <measure>Number of Participants who Achieve a Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) 90 Response at Week 24</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>The PASI is a system used for assessing and grading the severity and area of involvement of psoriatic lesions and their response to therapy. In the PASI system, the body is divided into 4 regions: the head, trunk, upper extremities, and lower extremities. Each of these areas is assessed separately for erythema, induration and scaling, which are each rated on a scale of 0 to 4 and area of involvement from 0 to 6. Total PASI score ranges from 0 to 72. A higher score indicates more severe disease. PASI 90 response is defined as at least a 90 percent (%) reduction in PASI relative to Baseline.</description>

    <measure>Number of Participants who Achieve a Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) Score of 0 or 1 at Week 24</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>The Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) (10) is a dermatology-specific quality of life instrument designed to assess the impact of the disease on a participant's quality of life. It is a 10-item questionnaire that, in addition to evaluating overall quality of life, can be used to assess 6 different aspects that may affect quality of life: 1) symptoms and feelings, 2) daily activities, 3) leisure, 4) work or school performance, 5) personal relationships, and 6) treatment. The DLQI score ranges from 0 to 30. A higher score indicates a low quality of life due to more severe disease. A score of 0 or 1 indicates no impact of disease on quality of life.</description>

    <description>Participants will receive Guselkumab 100 milligram (mg) administered as 100 milligram per milliliter (mg/mL) solution subcutaneously (SC) by single-use prefilled syringe (PFS) at weeks 0, 4, 12 and 20.</description>

    <arm_group_label>Group II: Fumaric Acid Esters (FAE)</arm_group_label>
    <arm_group_type>Active Comparator</arm_group_type>
    <description>Participants will receive Fumaderm initial/Fumaderm tablets by self administration at week 0. The individual FAE dose representing the optimal efficacy/tolerability ratio needs to be determined for each participant according to local prescription information. To this aim, FAE doses will be slowly increased beginning with increasing doses of Fumderm initial (containing 30 mg dimethylfumarate) over the first 3 weeks. Thereafter, participants will be switched to Fumaderm tablets (containing 120 mg dimethylfumarate) starting with 1 tablet per day. Fumaderm dose may be increased to a maximum of 3*2 tablets per day. The decision to maintain, increase or decrease the FAE dose depends on efficacy, safety and tolerability.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Have a diagnosis of plaque-type psoriasis for at least 6 months before the first
             administration of study drug

          -  Have a Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) greater than (&gt;)10 or Body Surface
             Area (BSA) &gt;10 at screening and at baseline

          -  Have a Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) &gt;10 at screening and at baseline

          -  Agree not to receive a live virus or live bacterial vaccination during the study, or
             within 3 months after the last administration of study drug; for information on
             Bacille Calmette-Gu√©rin (BCG) vaccination, agree not to receive a BCG vaccination
             during the study, or within 12 months after the last administration of study drug

          -  No dipstick detection of proteins or glucose in urine. If there are signs of proteins
             and/or glucose on urine test strip, the urine sample must be analyzed centrally. Here,
             protein and glucose levels must not exceed trace levels, example, &lt;=(+); one re-test
             (central urine analysis) is allowed

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Has a history or current signs or symptoms of severe, progressive, or uncontrolled
             liver or renal insufficiency, significant cardiac, vascular, pulmonary,
             gastrointestinal, endocrine, neurologic, hematologic, rheumatologic, psychiatric, or
             metabolic disturbances

          -  Participants with nonplaque forms of psoriasis (for example, erythrodermic, guttate,
             or pustular) or with current drug-induced psoriasis (for example, a new onset of
             psoriasis or an exacerbation of psoriasis from beta blockers, calcium channel
             blockers, or lithium)

          -  Known allergies, hypersensitivity, or intolerance to Guselkumab or its excipients

          -  Is pregnant, or breast-feeding, or planning to become pregnant while enrolled in this
             study or within 12 weeks after the last dose of study drug

          -  Any condition for which, in the opinion of the investigator, participation would not
             be in the best interest of the participant (for example, compromise the well-being) or
             that could prevent, limit, or confound the protocol-specified assessments
