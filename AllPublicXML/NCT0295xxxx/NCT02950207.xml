  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Mono-centric, observational, prospective study, designed for pts with diagnosis of
      hormone-positive breast cancer to evaluate the correlation between the response to hormonal
      treatment indicated by the reduction of the level of Ki67 and miRNA100 in two groups of
      patients
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The potential role of miRNAs will be studied as a predictor of hormone sensitivity in
      hormone-positive breast carcinomas. The miRNA100 obtained on biopsy will be compared with the
      expression levels of those obtained from the surgically removed tumor, in order to assess the
      possible modulation of miRNA100 following hormonal treatment.

    <description>the natural logarithm value of Ki67 &lt;1.0 defines the proliferative response to treatment. Response evaluation will be performed by measuring the reduction of Ki67 as a result of hormonal treatment according to a schedule defined on the basis of the stage of disease: patients with immediate operable cancer will be valued at the time of surgery (about 3 weeks).
