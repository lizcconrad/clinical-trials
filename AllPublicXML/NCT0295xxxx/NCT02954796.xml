    <textblock>
      This study tests the safety of a drug called SGN-CD352A, to find out what its side effects
      are. SGN-CD352A will be given every 4 weeks to a small group of patients with multiple
      myeloma.

    <textblock>
      The study will have 2 parts. In the first part, different doses of SGN-CD352A will be given
      to different patients (each individual patient will get the same dose for all treatments).
      The doses will be very low at the start of the trial, and will increase only when the lower
      dose levels are proven safe.

      In the second part of the study, up to 2 dose levels that are both safe and show promising
      activity against MM will be given to more patients

The dose of SGN-CD352A is different in each cohort of the study, with the lowest dose in Cohort -1 (4 mcg/kg) and the highest in Cohort 6 (65 mcg/kg). Patients can only be enrolled into a higher dose level arm if lower doses have proven safe.</description>
