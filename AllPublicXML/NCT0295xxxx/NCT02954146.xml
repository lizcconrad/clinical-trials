      Purpose: we will examine feasibility, tolerability, utilization, and effectiveness of using
      the SupportTeam mobile application in the context of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) for
      veterans with PTSD.

      Participants: (N=100) 50 veterans who have served in the military since October 2001 and have
      PTSD with anger problems; and 50 collateral family members/close friends above the age of 18.

      Procedures (methods): All Veterans with PTSD will receive a 12 session standard CBT for
      anger. Veterans in the intervention group will additionally receive instructions for using
      SupportTeam with a family member or friend that will provide data for the CBT clinician.
      Veterans in the control group will receive the CBT sessions, but will not receive the
      SupportTeam mobile application.

    <description>Connectd is a mobile application that collects and automatically analyzes input from patients with PTSD/TBI, as well as their families, for clinician review. The app will aggregate patient and family input on current issues, relationship stressors, and situational stressors to better focus (personalize) treatment as well as to more efficiently and accurately understand key factors and root causes. In addition, the app provides informational resources for veterans and family regarding treatment options and mental health supports.</description>
