    <textblock>
      This study will enroll approximately 30 adult subjects with T2DM from age 20 to 75 inclusive.

      Following a 7-10 day Screening period, eligible subjects will enter a 3-day single-blind
      placebo run-in. On Day 4, each subject will be randomized to a treatment sequence that will
      include three treatment assignments for each of three treatment Periods according to the
      randomization scheme.
