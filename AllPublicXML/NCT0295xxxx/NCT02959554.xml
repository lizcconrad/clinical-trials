      This study aims to assess the survival benefit from an early switch approach from sunitinib
      or pazopanib (10-12 weeks of 1st-line therapy) to nivolumab (anti-angiogenic to immunotherapy
      switch).

      This is a randomized, open-label, phase II trial. Patients with advanced or metastatic renal
      cell carcinoma (RCC) will be randomized into two arms either receiving Nivolumab or
      continuation of the Tyrosin Kinase Inhibitor (TKI) treatment that they have received as
      1st-line therapy.

      Patients must have received first line therapy with a VEGFR-TKI (Sunitinib or Pazopanib)
      prior to study inclusion for 10-12 weeks with documented disease control (PR/SD) according to
      RECIST 1.1 at time of study entry.

      Eligible patients will be randomized 1:1 either in the Nivolumab or in the TKI arm.

      Dosage of Nivolumab: 240 mg i.v. on D1 of every cycle (Q2W) for 16 weeks. After 16 weeks 480
      mg i.v. on D1 of every cycle (Q4W) until disease progress, intolerable toxicity, withdrawal
      of consent or end of study.

      Dosage of Sunitinib: According to Standard of Care (SOC). Recommended dose is 50 mg p.o. once
      daily for 4 consecutive weeks followed by a 2-week rest period (schedule 4/2) to comprise a
      complete cycle of 6 weeks (until disease progress, intolerable toxicity, withdrawal of
      consent or end of study.).

      Dosage of Pazopanib: According to Standard of Care (SOC). Recommended dose is 800 mg p.o.
      daily continuously (until disease progress, intolerable toxicity, withdrawal of consent or
      end of study.).
