      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the pharmacokinetics profile of the formulation of
      eplerenone coated tablets in the concentration of 25mg, 50mg and 100mg (2 coated tablets of
      50mg) in male and female healthy subjects under fasting condition.

    <textblock>
      This is a phase I study of eplerenone coated tablets of 25mg, 50mg and 100mg (2 coated
      tablets of 50mg) in fasting administration. Sample size is 12 subjects, male and female, aged
      between 18 and 50 years old.

      This is an open-label, unicenter study with three periods, three treatments and one sequence.
      Each subject will receive the following treatments at the following periods:

        -  Period 1: one coated tablet of eplerenone 25mg in fasting

        -  Period 2: one coated tablet of eplerenone 50mg in fasting

        -  Period 3: two coated tablets of eplerenone 50mg (100mg of eplerenone) in fasting
           Formulations will be administered in a single dose, orally in each period. Trial
           subjects will be admitted in three different periods of 24 hours each, when
           investigational product will be administered and blood samples will be collected at
           pre-determined periods of time for pharmacokinetics evaluation.

      Primary objective is to evaluate the pharmacokinetics of formulations of eplerenone coated
      tablets of 25mg, 50mg and 100mg (two coated tablets of 50mg) in healthy subjects under
      fasting condition. As a secondary objective, it will be also evaluated the safe and
      tolerability of coated tablets of eplerenone.
