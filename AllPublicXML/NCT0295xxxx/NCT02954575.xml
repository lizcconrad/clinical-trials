  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to obtain additional data on the safety and efficacy of Wilate
      in PTPs with hemophilia A with at least 150 previous exposure days (EDs) to a FVIII
      concentrate who undergo prophylactic treatment with Wilate for 6 months and at least 50 EDs,
      thus supplementing the existing database to obtain approval of Wilate for the indication
      hemophilia A in the USA.

    <criteria>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Severe hemophilia A (&lt;1% FVIII:C) according to medical history

          2. Male patients aged ≥12 years

          3. Previous treatment with a FVIII concentrate for at least 150 exposure days (EDs)

          4. Immunocompetence (CD4+ count &gt;200/µL)

          5. Good documentation of the historical bleeding rate (at least for the 6 months
             preceding study start)

          6. Voluntarily given, fully informed written and signed consent obtained by the patient
             (or parent/legal guardian in case of adolescents) before any study-related procedures
             are conducted

        Whenever possible, the interval between the Screening Visit and the PK or Non-PK Visit
        should not exceed 30 days. If the 30-day interval is exceeded, determination of the CD4+
        count is to be repeated and must be &gt;200/µL for patients to be enrolled (i.e., exclusion
        criterion no. 4).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Any coagulation disorders other than hemophilia A

          2. History of FVIII inhibitor activity (≥0.6 BU) or detectable FVIII inhibitory
             anti-bodies (≥0.6 BU using the Nijmegen modification of the Bethesda assay) at
             screening, as determined by the central laboratory

          3. Severe liver or kidney diseases (alanine aminotransferase [ALAT] and aspartate
             transaminase [ASAT] levels &gt;5 times of upper limit of normal, creatinine&gt;120 µmol/L)

          4. Patients receiving or scheduled to receive immunomodulating drugs (other than
             anti-retroviral chemotherapy) such as alpha-interferon, prednisone (equivalent to &gt;10
             mg/day), or similar drugs

          5. Treatment with any investigational medicinal product in another interventional
             clinical study currently or within 4 weeks before enrollment
