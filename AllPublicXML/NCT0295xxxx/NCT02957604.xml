      This is a prospective observational registry study to evaluate fetal, infant and childhood
      outcomes in women exposed to evolocumab during pregnancy
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This pregnancy registry will be conducted by University of California Research Center for the
      Organization of Teratology Information Specialists (OTIS) which is a network of university
      and health department based telephone information centers serving pregnant women and
      healthcare providers throughout North America. Participants will be enrolled on an ongoing
      basis through year 10 of the study and each will be followed from the time they enroll,
      through the 5-year postnatal follow up period for an overall study period of 15 years.
      Participants are recruited concurrently from callers to OTIS centers, from healthcare
      providers and through direct to consumer marketing efforts.

          -  For all groups: Qualified subjects will agree to the conditions and requirements of
             the study including the interview schedule, release of medical records, the physical
             examination of live born infants, and 5 years of follow-up.

          -  For the Specific Evolocumab-Exposed Cohort: Currently pregnant women (maternal report
             validated by medical records) diagnosed with hypercholesterolemia and ASCVD, or
             hypercholesterolemia associated with FH who have been exposed to evolocumab for any
             number of days, at any dose, and at any time from the first day of the LMP up to and
             including the end of pregnancy.

          -  For Comparison Group I: Currently pregnant women (maternal report validated by medical
             records) diagnosed with hypercholesterolemia and ASCVD, or hypercholesterolemia

             within 90 days prior to the first day of the LMP.

          -  For Comparison Group II: Currently pregnant women not diagnosed with
             hypercholesterolemia and ASCVD, or hypercholesterolemia associated with FH who have
             not been exposed to evolocumab during pregnancy or any time within 90 days prior to

             determined by the OTIS Research Center

          -  For General Evolocumab-Exposed Case Series group: Women with exposure to evolocumab
             during pregnancy who do not meet the criteria for the Specific Evolocumab-Exposed
             cohort for reasons including (but not limited to): they do not have ASCVD with
             hypercholesterolemia and/or hypercholesterolemia associated with FH (off-label use),
             they were exposed to evolocumab but the pregnancy has already completed, they enrolled
             in the cohort study with a previous pregnancy, or they already have a prenatal
             diagnosis of a major birth defect

        Exclusion Criteria:

        For all groups except the General Evolocumab Exposed Case Series Group:

          -  Women who first contact the Registry after prenatal diagnosis of a major structural
             defect

          -  Women who were exposed to a different PCSK9 inhibitor during their current pregnancy
             or at any time within 5 half-lives prior to the first day of the LMP

          -  Women who have enrolled in this Registry with a previous pregnancy
