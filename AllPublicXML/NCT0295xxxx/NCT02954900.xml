    <textblock>
      The purpose of this pilot study is to evaluate a decision support website (RealRisks)
      designed to inform patients about breast cancer chemoprevention. It is coupled with a
      physician-centered (BNAV) decision support website as part of clinical workflow in the
      primary care setting. The investigator hypothesizes that improving accuracy of breast cancer
      risk perception and understanding of the risks/benefits of chemoprevention will enhance
      informed decision-making and uptake of breast cancer prevention strategies in the primary
      care setting.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Breast cancer is the most common malignancy among women in the U.S. and the primary
      prevention of this disease is a major public health issue. The U.S. Preventive Services Task
      Force and other professional organizations recommend that clinicians discuss chemoprevention
      with high-risk women. Breast cancer chemoprevention with anti-estrogens, such as tamoxifen,
      raloxifene, exemestane, and anastrozole, is under-utilized, despite several randomized
      controlled trials demonstrating a 40-65% decrease in breast cancer incidence among high-risk
      women. Compounding this underutilization is the fact that a large proportion of women may be
      unaware of their high-risk status due to the investigators inability to adequately screen
      them in the primary care setting. Further research is needed to determine how knowledge about
      breast cancer, actual/perceived risk, and risks/benefits of chemoprevention are best
      communicated to women in order to promote breast cancer prevention strategies.

      This study assesses risk communication and shared decision-making in patient-clinician dyads
      by administering validated measures at baseline, after interacting with the tools prior to
      the clinic visit, and after the clinical visit (quantitative analysis); and by using
      observer-based methods of audio-tape recordings of their clinical encounters (qualitative
      analysis).

      The investigator hypothesizes that combining a patient-centered decision aid with a
      physician-centered decision support tool integrated into clinic workflow will improve
      accuracy of breast cancer risk perception, facilitate referrals for specialized risk
      counseling, and increase chemoprevention uptake.

    <description>To measure the patient's accuracy of perceived breast cancer risk before and after exposure to the RealRisks decision aid. Perception will be assessed by comparing the difference between a patient's perceived risk and their actual risk based on the Gail breast cancer model. Patients are asked to make a comparative risk assessment about themselves on a 3-point Likert scale.</description>
