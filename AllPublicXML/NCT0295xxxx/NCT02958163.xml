  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This will be multicentre a phase II randomized controlled and open-label trial. It will
      compare the 6-months objective response (CR+PR) rates obtained with Drug Eluting Bead
      Trans-Arterial Chemo-Embolization (DEB-TACE) alone versus DEB-TACE followed by Stereotactic
      Ablative Radiotherapy (SABR) in patients with hepatocarcinoma stage BCLC B.

      This trial will also include one substudy. This substudy will confront the
      immuno-histochemical results collected on tumoral biopsies to the biological and imaging
      (MRI) results. Every patient participating to the trial can also participate to this
      substudy.

    <description>Trans-arterial Embolisation will be performed with drug-eluting beads loaded with Doxorubicin. First session will be given within 4 weeks after randomization.
4-phase MRI will be performed every 2 months to assess the response. In case of insufficient response according to the MRI performed at 2 or 4 months, a second or third session of DEB-TACE will be allowed, according to the physician's choice.
Once complete response is achieved, the follow-up period will start. The date of the last session of TACE corresponds to the treatment completion date.</description>

    <description>The first part of the treatment, which is the DEB-TACE delivery, will be exactly the same than in arm A. The radiotherapy (SABR) will then start within 4 to 6 weeks after.
Afterwards, 4-phase MRI will be performed every 2 months to assess the response. In case of insufficient response according to the MRI performed at 2 or 4 months, a second or third session of DEB-TACE will be allowed, according to the physician's choice.
Once complete response is achieved, the follow-up period will start. The date of the last SABR fraction or the last session of TACE corresponds to the treatment completion date.</description>

    <description>SABR schemes will be adapted according to the CP score and the vicinity of surrounding organs at risk. These are the different schemes proposed in this trial:
48Gy = 3x16Gy BED 124.8Gy ( α/β=10) 50Gy = 5x10Gy BED 100Gy ( α/β=10) 48Gy = 6x8Gy BED 86.4Gy ( α/β=10) 40Gy = 5x8Gy BED 72Gy ( α/β=10)
For patients with Child-Pugh (CP) A cirrhosis : the choice of the scheme will be left to each physician. The highest BED should be favored if dose constraints to the organs at risk are respected.
For patients with CP B cirrhosis : only the latter scheme will be allowed: 40Gy = 5x8Gy.</description>
