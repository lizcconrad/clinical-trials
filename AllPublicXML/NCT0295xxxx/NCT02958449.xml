    <textblock>
      A prospective, randomized, controlled, multicenter non-inferiority study comparing standard
      wound closure technique with drains (control) to standard wound closure techniques with
      TissuGlu® and no drains (test) in mastectomy. Patients will be enrolled for 90 Days from day
      of Surgery. It is expected that it will take 6-9 months for the full duration of the study
      including the 90 day follow up period.
