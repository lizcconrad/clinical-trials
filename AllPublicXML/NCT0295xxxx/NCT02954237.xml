  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to observe the safety and effectiveness of the AMPLATZER™
      Cardiac Plug (ACP) device in Chinese population indicated for use of AMPLATZER™ Cardiac Plug
      after its market approval by China FDA (CFDA). This is a prospective, multi-centre, single
      arm, post approval, observational study. The clinical study will be conducted at up to 35
      sites in China. Approximately 343 subjects will be enrolled in this study.

      The total study duration is expected to be approximately 7 years. Patients who have
      non-valvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF) and are contraindicated to long-term oral
      anticoagulant; or patients who experience stroke or other thromboembolic event despite taking
      warfarin.

      Scheduled office visits occur at (45 days+ 2 weeks), 6M (+/- 3 weeks) 12M (+/- 6 weeks) and
      24 M(+/- 6 weeks) post procedure; Phone contact follow up visits occur at, 36 M (+/- 6
      weeks), 48M (+/- 6 weeks) and 60 M (+/- 6 weeks) post procedures.

    <description>The AMPLATZER™ Cardiac Plug is a transcatheter, self-expanding device intended for use in preventing thrombus embolization from the left atrial appendage. The device is constructed from a nitinol mesh and consists of a lobe and a disc connected by a central waist. The device is designed to facilitate occlusion. The lobe has stabilizing wires to improve device placement and retention. The device has threaded screw attachments at each end for connection to the delivery and loading cables. The device has radiopaque markers at each end and at the stabilizing wires. Device Sizes: 16, 18, 20, 22, 24, 26, 28, and 30 mm (lobe diameter) Delivery System: AMPLATZER TorqVue® 45º x 45º (sheath sizes 9, 10, or 13 Fr)</description>
