    <textblock>
      With 42,150 new cases per year, colorectal cancer is the third cause of cancer in France
      according to the latest report from the Institut national du Cancer (INCa). Second leading
      cause of cancer death in men, its management is a public health problem. According to
      projections by WHO, the prevalence of cancers expected to increase 50% by 2050 especially in
      digestive oncology. These projections can be concluded that the demand for care will continue
      to be growing.

      Medical advances and societal leading to increased life expectancy, have operated a mutation
      of the cancer disease. Formerly fatal disease, it is now a chronic disease in some cases.
      These changes are causing new challenges for the health system.

      To address this problem, it is asked health professionals to adapt the organization of health
      care delivery to improve efficiency, in a constrained economic environment. To this end,
      action 4.1 of the cancer plan includes the creation of clinical nursing profession, a
      proposal reiterated in article 120 of the French Health System Law. Nursing clinicians will
      be empowered to ensure, under certain conditions, prescription treatments protocolized of
      follow-up tests, further treatment and support, as well as the extension or adaptation of
      specific treatments.

      This project is a first step, in France, in thinking around new organizations in the supply
      of care in oncology.

      For patients, strengthening their monitoring during chemotherapy, will better know their
      tolerance regarding chemotherapy. This optimized management of chemotherapy-induced effects
      will help reduce the use of emergency care.

      The establishment of such a practitioner will free medical time to handle the most complex
      patients and perform tasks related to research.

      For hospital pharmacies this type of organization will optimize their productivity by
      anticipating orders for chemotherapy pockets.

      This project represents an opportunity to demonstrate the added value of advanced practice
      nurses in France in the health system and particularly in oncology. It also adds value to
      clinical expertise nurse and register the profession in the research.

      The hypothesis is that the quality and safety of care provided by a nurse practitioner are
      equivalent to those provided by a doctor at follow-up of patients with gastrointestinal
      cancer, treated with intravenous chemotherapy.
