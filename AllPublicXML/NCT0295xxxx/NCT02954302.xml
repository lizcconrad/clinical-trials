    <textblock>
      This study aims to evaluate whether the incidence of delayed gastric emptying (DGE) can be
      reduced by proximal Roux-en-y gastrojejunal anastomosis in comparison with the standard
      gastrojejunal anastomosis in pylorus-resecting pancreaticoduodenectomy (PrPD).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Delayed gastric emptying (DGE) is a common complication after pancreaticoduodenectomy (PD),
      occurring in 20% to 70% of the patients. DGE is usually not a life-threatening complication,
      but it contributes significantly to increased length of hospital stay, health care costs, and
      patient discomfort. In a recent study by Sakamoto et al, proximal Roux-en-y gastrojejunal
      anastomosis is associated with a reduced incidence of DGE after pylorus-resecting
      pancreaticoduodenectomy (PrPD); however, these results may have been biased because of the
      retrospective nature. Therefore, the investigators conducted the present randomized
      controlled trial (RCT) to evaluate the impact of the proximal Roux-en-y gastrojejunal
      anastomosis on reducing DGE following PrPD.

    <description>The severity of DGE was classified into 3 grades (A, B, or C) according to the ISGPS's clinical criteria, based on the patient's clinical course and postoperative management, such as the need for NGT in the postoperative period or the inability to tolerate solid oral intake.
Grade A was defined as needing the NGT for more than 7 days or reinsertion of the NGT after postoperative day 3, or as being unable to tolerate a solid diet by postoperative day 7.
Grade B was defined as needing for NGT for 8 to 14 days after surgery or reinsertion of the NGT after day 7, or as being unable to tolerate a solid diet by postoperative day 14.
Grade C was defined as needing the NGT for more than 14 days or reinsertion of the NGT after day 14, or as being unable to tolerate a solid diet by day 21.</description>

    <description>the distal antrum was divided about 1 to 2 cm proximal to the pylorus ring, preserving more than 95% of the stomach. The proximal jejunum was divided approximately 2 to 4 cm distal to the duodeno-jejunal junction. After completion of the resection, the proximal end of the first loop of jejunum was then brought through the transverse mesocolon, and the gastrojejunal anastomosis (GJA) was performed in two layers by using 3-0 PDS sutures and 4-0 silk sutures in an end-to-side fashion. The jejunum was then divided 35 to 40 cm distal to the GJA, and the distal limb was brought separately through the transverse mesocolon to be placed in the duodenal bed for reconstruction of the pancreatojejunal anastomosis (PJA) and hepatojejunal anastomosis (HJA).</description>

    <description>After completion of the pancreatojejunal anastomosis (PJA) and hepatojejunal anastomosis (HJA), a hand-sewn, isoperistaltic GJA was performed 25 to 30 cm distal to the HJA in two layers by using 3-0 polydioxanone (PDS) sutures and 4-0 silk sutures.</description>
