    <textblock>
      This study tests whether people receiving clinician support to use a mobile application on
      their smartphone can manage their post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms better than
      those who do not. Half of the participants will receive the clinician supported smartphone
      application intervention and the other half will remain on the waiting list.
