  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Activation of neutrophils by ANCA (&quot;Anti-Neutrophil Cytoplasm Antibodies&quot;) and subsequent
      microvascular endothelial cell damage is the main feature of ANCA-associated vasculitis
      (AAV), a severe autoimmune disease that often targets the kidney. There is no specific
      treatment for AAV to date and 25% of patients with renal damage evolve towards end-stage
      renal disease, requiring dialysis and kidney transplantation. In addition, there is no
      reliable biological marker of the disease activity available, which makes the diagnostic,
      follow-up and treatment of patients difficult. Therefore, the identification of new
      therapeutic targets and non-invasive biomarkers constitutes a major clinical challenge to
      improve AAV patients care and to ameliorate their renal outcome.

        This will be done in total in 50 patients with ANCA-associated vasculitis (AAV) and 20
        control patients. Among the 50 patients with AAV, 30 patients will be newly diagnosed and
        20 already followed for AAV
