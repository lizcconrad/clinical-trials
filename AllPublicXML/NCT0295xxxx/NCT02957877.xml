  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is a lack of data in the literature about the use of low-molecular weight heparin
      (LMWH) as anticoagulation for nocturnal home hemodialysis (NHHD). This study aims to evaluate
      the efficacy and safety of LMWH, administered by infusion method, as compared to
      unfractionated heparin as anticoagulation for NHHD treatment.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Low-molecular weight heparin (LMWH) and unfractionated heparin (UFH) are established systemic
      anticoagulants for the patients who receive conventional thrice-weekly hemodialysis in
      absence of significant bleeding risk. For the patients who undergo nocturnal home
      hemodialysis (NHHD), LMWH is seldom utilized because of the need of an additional bolus
      injection during a long dialysis treatment, which is impractical as the patients are sleeping
      during hemodialysis. Moreover, there is a potential risk of LMWH accumulation due to its
      longer half-life. As there is a paucity of data in the literature on the use of LMWH for NHHD
      treatment, this trial is conducted to assess the safety and efficacy of LMWH, administered by
      infusion method, in this particular group of dialysis patients.
