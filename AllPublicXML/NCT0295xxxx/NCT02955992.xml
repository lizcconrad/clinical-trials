  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      As ICU mortality is high, end-of-life is a subject of major concern for intensivists. With a
      mortality rate of 20%, end-of-life care has become a daily responsibility. Among those
      deaths, 60 to 80% follow a decision to withhold or withdraw treatment, situations where
      physicians, nurses and relatives must work together towards the most consensual decision. In
      this context, patients' relatives feel vulnerable and, in the months that follow the death,
      they are most likely to present symptoms that negatively affect their quality of life
      (anxiety, depression, PTSD, prolonged grief). Many studies have shown that communication with
      caregivers is one of the most highly valued aspects of care that impacts on family members'
      experience during the patient's stay and after the patient's death. Improving communication
      during the end-of-life process in the ICU context is a necessity that has been put forward in
      palliative care and family-centered care guidelines.

      This study aims to improve both communication skills and behaviour by giving precise
      recommendations to physicians (3 step strategy) in their direct contact with patients'
      relatives. A 3-step physician-driven support strategy is used, that consists in 3 meetings
      with the relative - one before, one during and one after the patient's death. The underlying
      hypothesis is that this strategy will improve communication in the end-of-life setting and
      thus should reduce post-ICU burden for family members, specifically the development of
      prolonged grief 6 months after the death.

    <description>All caregivers will receive a leaflet about the importance of end of life (EOL) communication: key elements and recommendations regarding verbal and non-verbal communication.
A &quot;local champion&quot; (&quot;opinion leader&quot;) will be designated by each team in order to help implement the strategy. These physicians will help colleagues to connect external knowledge and requirements of the study to the local context.
Development of a 3-step physician-driven support strategy starting after a decision to withhold or withdraw life-sustaining therapies is implemented:
Preparation for the death : Prepare the relative for the patient's imminent death
During the dying and death process: The physician enters the patient's room at least once to check on the relatives
After the patient's death: the physician and the nurse meet the relative</description>
