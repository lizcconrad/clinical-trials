  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Before a heart operation, patient outlook may be either pessimistic or optimistic. Previous
      research on this topic has focused on patient reported quality of life but has never examined
      measurable clinical outcomes such as length of hospital stay.This pilot study hopes to
      establish whether patient outlook (optimistic or pessimistic) before a heart operation can
      influence recovery and length of hospital stay. If there is a difference, then a case can be
      made for providing psychological support before an operation in the hope of modifying outlook
      and thus improving patient care and reducing hospital stay and NHS costs. Patients will be
      recruited over a 12month period. Their outlook (pessimistic or optimistic) will be
      ascertained using two standardised questionnaires. Their recovery and length of stay will be
      recorded. The study will answer the research question and determine whether outlook has an
      impact on recovery. Depending on the results, this study could provide opportunities for
      additional future research into modifying outlook with a view to improving patient care and
      recovery.
