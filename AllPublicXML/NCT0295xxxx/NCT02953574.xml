      nursing protocol for hospitalized people living with dementia is feasible and if it has an
      effect on bedtime and daytime variables.

    <description>A 7 step nursing protocol. Each step is daily provided to the demented patient through a nurse by bedtime.
Step 1: serve a late snack Step 2: evening care (brush teeth, get pyjama on, go to toilette) Step 3: note and treat physical circumstances that restrain sleep (pain, obstipation,...) Step 4: ensure comfortable position abed Step 5: assist to eliminate stressful situation (calm, reorientating conversation) Step 6: turn off the light Step 7: care for a silent environment (turn off Television, radio and &quot;do not disturb&quot;-sign at the door)</description>
