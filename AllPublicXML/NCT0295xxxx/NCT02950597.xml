      Study Details What is the study design? (eg, randomized, double-blind) Observational
      Prospective Study What are the overall objectives of the study? This project is designed to
      assess the feasibility of using a non-invasive hemodynamic monitoring device in heart failure
      outpatient clinics. There will be no alteration to patient management for this study. Rather
      this study seeks to assess the utility of the device in this patient care setting by
      surveying the clinicians involved.

      What is the primary endpoint? For this phase I study, the primary endpoint will be the heart
      clinician's survey results.

      What is/are the secondary endpoint(s)? Secondary markers will include: patient survey
      results, heart failure classification, renal function, blood pressure, cardiac function
      tests, and pulmonary function tests.

      B. BACKGROUND:

      Nearly five million Americans experience heart failure (HF) and greater than 250,000 die
      annually. 1 The prevalence has continued to increase with the aging of the US population and
      HF is now the leading cause of hospitalization among adults &gt;65 in the United states. Despite
      remarkable improvements in medical therapy, the prognosis of patients with myocardial failure
      remains poor, with almost 20% of patients dying within 1 year of initial diagnosis and &gt; 80%
      8-year mortality. 2 In addition patients who are admitted to the hospital for heart failure
      have over a 50% readmission rate within six months of discharge. 3,4 These patients require
      routine clinical care and often require diagnostic and therapeutic procedures. This project
      seeks to assess if the use of hemodynamic (HD) monitoring technologies (ClearSight/Nexfin)
      that are currently used in the intraoperative and critical care settings can provide
      additional patient benefit if used more longitudinally for the patients' &quot;routine&quot; medical
      care.

      This project is designed to assess the impact of non-invasive hemodynamic monitoring
      technologies to improve care of heart failure patients. Currently, these patients are
      assessed in the outpatient setting with no routine ability to assess hemodynamics related to
      contractility (dp/dt, stroke volume, cardiac output) or vascular resistance. Rather, the
      health care provider relies on their patient history, physical exam, and static vital signs
      (heart rate and blood pressure) to make their patient care decisions. This is despite the
      large body of evidence suggesting how poor these markers are at determining cardiac function
      and volume status. The investigators seek to &quot;assist&quot; the management of these high-risk
      patients by providing &quot;routine&quot; parameters of contractility and vascular resistance (via the
      ClearSight/Nexfin) system to the health care providers during the patients' clinic visits.

      Nexfin system This device provides continuous blood pressure monitoring and parameters of
      heart function (stroke volume, cardiac output, stroke volume variation, systemic vascular
      resistance and dp/dt) via finger cuff that contains photo-plethysmograph sensor to monitor
      arterial volume and pressure. The sensor is a small, 6 by 3 cm cuff, that is placed over the
      middle of the finger (see picture below). The parameters from the device have been validated
      to traditional non-invasive blood pressure measurements 5 and traditional cardiac output
      assessment devices 6. The device inflates to a pressure that allows for assessment of the
      pulsatility of the arteries of the digit. It is important to note that the device does not
      significantly reduce perfusion to the digit and has been FDA approved for over two hours of
      continuous use (www.
      http://www.edwards.com/eu/products/mininvasive/pages/clearsightsystem.aspx). For this study
      the device will be placed on the patient for no more than 5 minutes.

      C. STUDY HYPOTHESIS &amp; AIMS

      This study seeks to assess the utility of &quot;routine&quot; flow guided HD monitoring via the Nexfin
      systems for patients with known heart failure. Patients enrolled in the study will include
      those who are classified as New York Heart Association (NYHA) Functional Classification of
      three or greater and have Objective Assessment Classification of B or greater. Once
      consented, the patients will have the device placed for 5 minutes during their clinic visits.
      The care team will have the data displayed to them to evaluate the device. It is important to
      note that this study is an observational survey study to evaluate if heart failure
      specialists find the device useful. The data shown to the team will not be used to guide
      treatment and it will not be captured in the chart. Rather the clinicians will be surveyed to
      evaluate the clinical utility of this device (see primary outcome marker above). It is the
      hope of the investigators that the heart failure specialists do report to find the device
      useful based on the results of this study. If so the investigators will submit for a research
      study (new IRB submission) to evaluate the clinical impact of implementing this device in
      this setting.

      Outcome data will be collected using our electronic medical records. The primary marker will
      be the heart failure clinicians' evaluation surveys on the hemodynamic device. Secondary
      markers will include: patient comfort survey results, heart failure classification, renal
      function, blood pressure, cardiac function tests, and pulmonary function tests. Patients'
      medical records will reviewed for up to six months after consent secondary to ensure that all
      relevant cardiac and pulmonary function tests are captured to correlate to the data from the
      Nexfin system.

      D: RESEARCH METHODOLOGY/STUDY PROCEDURES

      Study Protocol:

      Phase 1:

      The initial phase of the study will involve a 2-month trial period in which the
      ClearSight/Nexfin device will be used for all consented patients. This period will allow for
      all providers to become familiar with the device and determine the logistics for which
      outpatient setting will be best suited to have the two study devices available during the
      week. In addition, the health care provider will fill out a survey (included with this
      submission) for each consented patient, evaluating the utility of this device. As this
      technology is a limited resource (only 2 devices available), the survey will allow the
      research team to determine which providers and which clinical settings will maximize its
      utility to carry out the below described study protocol.

      E. INVESTIGATIONAL DEVICE:

      The are no investigational devices being tested for this study. The ClearSight/Nexfin System
      is an FDA approved device that is widely used in the perioperative setting. To restate, this
      study is similar assessing its utility in the outpatient heart failure clinics. All devices
      used for this study will be cleared by biomedical engineering prior to use as per hospital
      equipment protocol.

      9. DATA COLLECTION

      How will patient data be collected and stored? Data that will be collected will include
      clinical documents (Both paper and electronic), electronic patient medical records, patient
      comfort surveys, and physician surveys. Who is responsible for the collection of study data?
      The department has a research coordinator and research manager that controls access to all
      study data. The team of research assistants will collect and store research data (both paper
      and electronic) in a secure locked area. All patient electronic research data will be stored
      on the research Intranet that is monitored and protected by the university.
