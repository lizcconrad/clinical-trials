  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to evaluate safety and efficacy of dimethyl fumarate treatment in patients
      with primary progressive multiple sclerosis (PPMS).

      Half of the patients will receive dimethyl fumarate and the other half will receive placebo.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic, inflammatory disease of the central nervous system and
      is presumed to be caused by T cell-mediated autoimmune processes. PPMS has no registered
      treatment options only symptomatic treatment exists. Progressive forms of MS are
      characterized clinically by gradual symptom development with or without superimposed
      relapses.

      Fumarates have long been known to have disease-attenuating effects in psoriasis. They have
      been in routine use in dermatology in Germany for several decades. Dimethyl fumarate has the
      interesting property of combining immunological effects, at least partly mediated by
      interference with nuclear factor kappa B and other transcription factors, and also
      anti-oxidative and neuroprotective effects mediated by activation of the transcription factor
      Nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)-Related Factor 2 (NRF2). Dimethyl fumarate is currently
      approved for treatment of relapsing-remitting MS by the European medicines Agency in a dose
      of 240 mg twice per day.

      Neurofilament light chain (NFL) is a treatment responsive biomarker of neuronal and axonal
      death when appearing in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and it has been associated with
      long-term prognosis in MS. The concentration is often elevated in progressive MS patients.
      Treatment effect is measured by measuring changes in neurofilament light chain concentration
      over the course of 48 weeks of treatment with either active drug or placebo.
