  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of a multimodal pre-operative
      prehabilitation programme during neo-adjuvant therapy on cardiopulmonary exercise performance
      and insulin resistance prior to resection for oesophago-gastric cancer.

      The trial objectives are as follows: Primary: To evaluate the effect of a prehabilitation
      programme during neo-adjuvant therapy on CPX performance prior to resection for
      oesophago-gastric cancer. Secondary: To investigate the impact of neo-adjuvant chemotherapy
      on insulin resistance; to determine whether a prehabilitation exercise programme is feasible
      during neo-adjuvant chemotherapy; to determine whether rehabilitation has a positive impact
      on quality of life outcomes; to investigate the impact of prehabilitation on clinical
      outcomes; to assess the effect of prehabilitation on nutritional status; to determine whether
      prehabilitation affects the stress response to surgery.

      This study is a randomised controlled trial where patients will be stratified into 'fit' and
      'unfit' groups based upon their anaerobic threshold and then randomised in a 1:1 ratio to
      receive multimodal prehabilitation or standard care prior to OG cancer surgery, during
      neo-adjuvant chemotherapy.
