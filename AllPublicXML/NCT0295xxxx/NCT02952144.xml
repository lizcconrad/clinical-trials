  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Dialysis-related amyloidosis (DRA) is a serious complication of long-term hemodialysis (HD).
      Its pathogenic mechanism involves accumulation of β2-microglobulin (β2M) in the blood. β2M is
      produced by most cells in the body and is metabolized in the kidney in healthy individuals.
      However, in HD patients with renal dysfunction, β2M which is not removed entirely by HD
      accumulates excessively in the blood. Then it forms amyloid fibrils that are deposited in
      bones, joints, and soft tissues. The fibrils are further modified by advanced glycation end
      products (AGE), inducing local macrophage infiltration and production of cytokines leading to
      chronic inflammation and activation of osteoclasts. Consequently, severe complications with
      various symptoms are developed, which are collectively referred to as DRA.

      Lixelle® is a whole-blood β2M apheresis column developed to adsorb and eliminate β2M
      selectively from the blood of DRA patients. The treatment is performed with Lixelle®
      connected upstream of the dialyzer in series on a HD circuit in every session. The Lixelle®
      column contains porous cellulose beads with covalently linked hexadecyl alkyl chain ligands,
      which selectively adsorb β2M, via a molecular sieving effect because of its porous structure
      and hydrophobic interaction with ligands. Lixelle® has been used to relieve symptoms and
      prevent the progression of DRA in Japan since 1996, when health insurance coverage and
      reimbursement for the treatment were approved by Japanese Ministry of Health, Labor, and
      Welfare. Improvement of the activities of daily living (ADL) and remission of arthralgia by
      Lixelle® treatment has been shown in several clinical studies.

    <description>The treatment will be performed with the Lixelle® column connected to upstream of the dialyzer in series on the routine HD circuit according to the description in the IFU. The dialyzer and the Kt/V urea in the conventional HD for each patient will be kept equal in Lixelle®-treatment. Since the maximum blood flow rate for Lixelle® is 250 ml/min, the dialysis time will be extended to achieve the target Kt/V urea. The study will not restrict the type of hemodialyzer and other conditions of HD as specified by the physician. However, any changes to the HD procedure should be recorded properly, and the Kt/V urea should be kept equal to that at the enrollment.</description>
