  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients are being offered participation in this pirfenidone trial because They have been
      diagnosed with fibrotic hypersensitivity pneumonitis (FHP), a type of interstitial lung
      disease (ILD). This is a disease where scarring of lung tissue occurs as the result of
      inhaling substances called antigens. These antigens can be substances such as molds,
      chemicals or dust. As a result of this scarring the lungs are is not able to move oxygen into
      the bloodstream to reach other organs.

      Currently over 1400 subjects have been treated with pirfenidone in 15 clinical trials. This
      drug has been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for use in Idiopathic
      Pulmonary Fibrosis, a different type of ILD, but requires special permission for use in your
      condition. The use of pirfenidone has not been approved for the treatment of FHP. It is
      considered experimental treatment in this study.

      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the potential benefits and the safety of treatment
      with pirfenidone compared to placebo in subjects with FHP.

      STUDY SUMMARY This study will include about 40 subjects at National Jewish Health. This is a
      &quot;double blind study&quot; which means neither the subject nor the study staff will know if the
      subject is get pirfenidone or placebo during the study. This is done to be sure that no one
      knows who is getting pirfenidone or placebo and the effects of the treatment can be measured
      objectively, without bias. Subject's that enroll in this study will have an equal chance of
      getting pirfenidone or placebo. The decision about which treatment the subject will receive
      (randomization) is made through a central organization.

      Subjects in the study will receive either pirfenidone (2403 mg every day) or placebo capsules
      (a safe, inactive substance that will look the same as the pirfenidone capsules). Both the
      placebo and pirfenidone will be supplied in opaque, hard, white gelatin capsules and will be
      taken as 3 capsules by mouth, 3 times a day (a total of 9 capsules per day) and should be
      taken with food.

      Subjects participate in this study, will be asked to take the capsules as prescribed every
      day for 52 weeks (12 months).
