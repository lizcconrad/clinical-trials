  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The following are hypothesized:

        1. The Diabetes Engagement and Activation Platform (DEAP) can be integrated into primary
           care workflow to facilitate the care of patients with type 2 diabetes.

        2. The DEAP intervention will be feasible and acceptable to patients with type 2 diabetes.

        3. The DEAP intervention will enhance patient activation and improve type 2 diabetes self
           management and glucose control
    </textblock>

      Aim 1: To evaluate how primary care practices adopt and integrate DEAP into routine workflow
      including identification of barriers and facilitators to support acceptable, feasible, and
      sustainable use of the system.

        -  Sub-aim 1.1: Measure the proportion of clinicians and care team members who engage
           patients through the DEAP intervention as well as the types of patient support
           activities they address; assess the representativeness of participating clinicians and
           care team members in relation to all practice staff; and assess how they integrated DEAP
           into the care of type 2 diabetes patients.

        -  Sub-aim 1.2: Assess how practices redesign workflow, overcome barriers, and enhance
           facilitators in order to integrate DEAP.

        -  Sub-aim 1.3: Determine processes for sustaining DEAP beyond the project funding period .

      Aim 2: To compare, relative to usual care, the effectiveness of the DEAP intervention.

        -  Sub Aim 2.1: Measure the proportion and representativeness of eligible patients who
           choose to enroll; access the DEAP curriculum; complete the DEAP curriculum; and contact
           care team members. .

        -  Sub Aim 2.2: Compare the change in the average glycosylated hemoglobin (primary
           outcome), Body Mass Index, systolic blood pressure, and type 2 diabetes (T2D)
           medications and patient activation (secondary outcomes) from baseline to 3 months and
           from 3 to 6 months for patients randomized to DEAP versus usual care.

      Sub Aim 2.3: Assess the clarity, readability and acceptability of the DEAP curricula
      materials for T2D patients enrolled in the intervention.

    <time_frame>From date of study enrollment A1C will be retrieved from electronic health record (EHR) at baseline, 3 and 6 months after enrollment. Data will continue to be collected at these intervals on all participants until target sample of 160 is complete.</time_frame>
    <description>The A1C test is a blood test that provides information about a person's average levels of blood glucose, also called blood sugar, over the past 3 months. The A1C test is sometimes called the hemoglobin A1c, HbA1c, or glycohemoglobin test.</description>

    <measure>Body Mass Index (BMI)</measure>
    <time_frame>From date of study enrollment BMI will be retrieved from EHR at baseline, three and six months following enrollment. Data will continue to be collected at these intervals on all participants until target sample of 160 is complet</time_frame>
    <description>The BMI is an attempt to quantify the amount of tissue mass (muscle, fat, and bone) in an individual, and then categorize that person as underweight, normal weight, overweight, or obese based on that value.</description>

    <measure>Blood Pressure (BP)</measure>
    <time_frame>From date of study enrollment BP will be retrieved from EHR at baseline, 3 and 6 months following enrollment. Data will continue to be collected at these intervals on all participants until target sample of 160 is complete.</time_frame>
    <description>Systolic blood pressure represents the pressure in the arteries when the heart is contracting, and the pressure when the heart is at rest is called diastolic blood pressure. Blood pressure is measured using a blood pressure cuff, which is wrapped around the upper arm.</description>
