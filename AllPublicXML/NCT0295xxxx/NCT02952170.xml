  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will assess the impact of weight loss surgery (WLS) on non-alcoholic fatty liver
      disease (NAFLD) in adolescents as well as the interaction between NAFLD and cardiometabolic
      risk.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      While the impact of WLS has been studied in adults, little is known about NAFLD in
      adolescents undergoing WLS. At present, only a small number of adolescents undergo WLS each
      year and thus this area has not been well studied. However, as the prevalence of severe
      obesity continues to rise the investigators anticipate that so will WLS in adolescents.

      This study will establish the impact of WLS on NAFLD in adolescents. Currently, it is assumed
      that adolescents with NAFLD diagnosed at the time of WLS have universal resolution of their
      disease with appropriate weight loss, and no further evaluation is conducted. Our group has
      shown that up to 40% of adolescents who undergo WLS have persistently abnormal
      aminotransferase levels, suggesting that many may have persistent NASH and are at risk of
      progressive liver disease. The study will elucidate the history of NAFLD following WLS. Such
      data have not been previously published and will represent a significant contribution to this
      field.
