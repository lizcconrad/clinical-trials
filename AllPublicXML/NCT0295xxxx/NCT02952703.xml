      This study tests whether a smoking cessation intervention for pregnant women that extends
      postpartum (Striving to Quit (STQ)) can be implemented and disseminated outside of the
      research environment that established its effectiveness (40% maintained biochemically
      verified 6-month abstinence). The research aim is:

      Is Striving to Quit more effective in achieving postpartum smoking cessation than &quot;First
      Breath,&quot; the current standard of care for pregnant women in Wisconsin who smoke?

      250 women will be randomized into one of two study groups. Pregnant women in Group A (n=125)
      will receive the existing First Breath prenatal intervention. Those in Group B (Striving to
      Quit (STQ), n=125) will receive all Group A interventions, plus 1 additional prenatal home
      visit, 3 postpartum in-home smoking cessation counseling visits, 3 postpartum phone calls,
      and up to an additional $100 in gift cards. The primary outcome will be biochemically
      confirmed smoking cessation at 6-months postpartum.
