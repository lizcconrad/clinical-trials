      The purpose of this study is to explore the effectiveness of 3D printing in small pulmonary
      nodule localization by the design of an assisted device to facilitate the localization
      procedure.

      Patient recruitment : The chest CT was reviewed by two experienced doctors to determine
      whether the patient was suitable for localization. data collection and management: The data
      was collected and reviewed by a specialized researcher and to reduce heterogenicity. The
      following data were collected: age , sex, nodule size,location,density,distance to the
      pleura,radiation dose, localization time,complications and pathologic results.

      data analysis: statistical analysis was performed with SPSS 22.0. Fisher exact test was used
      for comparison between two groups. Mann-Whitney U test was used for numeric variables. P&lt;0.05
      was considered significant.

    <description>By the use of CT data, digital model was created through computer design and delivered to 3D printing machine. The device was printed according to the patient's CT which could fit the outline of the patient and indicate the puncture site. Thus the localization procedure was facilitated.</description>
