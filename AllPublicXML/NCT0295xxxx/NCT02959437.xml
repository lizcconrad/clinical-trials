  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, Phase 1/2 study in subjects with advanced or metastatic solid tumors.
      The study has three separate treatment groups where separate epigenetic agents are evaluated
      with an immunotherapy combination. Treatment Group A will evaluate the DNA methyltransferase
      inhibitor azacitidine in combination with the programmed death receptor-1 (PD-1) inhibitor
      pembrolizumab and the indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO-1) inhibitor epacadostat; Treatment
      Group B will evaluate the bromodomain and extra-terminal (BET) inhibitor INCB057643 with
      pembrolizumab and epacadostat; and Treatment Group C will evaluate the lysine-specific
      demethylase 1A (LSD1) inhibitor INCB059872 with pembrolizumab and epacadostat. The study will
      be divided into 2 parts (Part 1 and 2). Part 1 is a dose-escalation assessment to evaluate
      the safety and tolerability of the combination therapies. Once the recommended doses have
      been determined, subjects with previously treated NSCLC, microsatellite-stable colorectal
      cancer (CRC), head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, urothelial carcinoma, and melanoma will
      be enrolled into expansion cohorts in Part 2.

    <description>A treatment-emergent AE was defined as an event occurring after exposure to at least 1 dose of study drug. A treatment-related AE was defined as an event with a definite, probable, or possible causality to study medication. A serious AE is an event resulting in death, hospitalization, persistent or significant disability/incapacity, or is life threatening, a congenital anomaly/birth defect or requires medical or surgical intervention to prevent 1 of the outcomes above. The intensity of an AE was graded according to the National Cancer Institute common terminology criteria for adverse events (NCI-CTCAE) version 4.03: Grade 1 (Mild); Grade 2 (Moderate); Grade 3 (Severe); Grade 4 (life-threatening).</description>
