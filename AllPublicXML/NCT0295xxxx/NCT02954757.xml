  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Uterine adenomyosis is a common uterine benign condition. They can cause abnormal menstrual
      bleeding, and menstrual pain. Although surgical intervention is the definitive treatment,
      some women prefer to have their uterus preserved. High-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU)
      therapy is receiving increasing interest in the management of uterine adenomyosis by inducing
      focal thermocoagulation of the fibroids. Results obtained by various research groups have
      shown that HIFU treatment is safe, effective and is highly acceptable to patients. The main
      objective of this study is to evaluate the therapeutic efficacy of HIFU in the treatment of
      uterine adenomyosis.

      In this proposed study, 10 patients who have symptomatic uterine adenomyosis who meet the
      study inclusion criteria will be invited to participate in the study which involves the use
      of HIFU in the management of the adenomyosis. Background information of the patients such as
      age, body mass index, hormonal (pre- or postmenopausal) status and the presence of chronic
      medical disease will be collected. Subjects will also be asked to complete an eight-item
      section of a Uterine Fibroid Symptom and Quality Of Life Questionnaire (UFS-QOL) and
      menstrual pain score which evaluate the effect of the adenomyosis on the quality of life of
      women.
