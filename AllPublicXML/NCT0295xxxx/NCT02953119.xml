    <textblock>
      Major abdominal surgery is a great stressor to patients and causes large physiological
      changes, leads to tissue trauma, immobility, psychological distress and reduced quality of
      life. Physical capacity appears to be an important predictor for postoperative recovery after
      major abdominal surgery. Prehabilitation is a concept that challenges the traditional models
      of recovery by initiating the recovery process preoperatively. Improvement of physical
      capacity by means of prehabilitation may facilitate better recovery after surgery. More
      specifically prior to major abdominal surgery, preoperative exercise therapy is associated
      with improved physical fitness of patients, but whether or not this results in fewer
      complications or faster convalescence remains unclear.

      The aim of the present study is to evaluate the impact of preoperative physical exercise
      training (prehabilitation) on postoperative recovery and clinical outcomes after major
      abdominal surgery.

    <description>The patients will undergo an exercise test on a cycle ergometer (VO2 max), a grip strength test (Jamar dynamometer), a Time Up and Go (TUG) test and a 6 Minutes Walking Test (6-MWT), before and after prehabilitation, in the sports medicine department. The prehabilitation (intervention) involves 3 training sessions per week during 3 weeks preoperatively, according to the High Intensity Interval Training (HIIT) model, wich consists of:
5 minute warm-up (50% of Cardiopulmonary exercise testing, CPET)
Two 10 minute series of 15 sec sprint intervals (100%) interspersed by 15 sec pauses and a 4 min rest between the two series
Cool down with a 5 min active recovery period (30%)
The grip strength test (Jamar dynamometer), TUG-test and 6-MWT will be repeated between 4 and 6 weeks and 8 and 10 week postoperatively.</description>
