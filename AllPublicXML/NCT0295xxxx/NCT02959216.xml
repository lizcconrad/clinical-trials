    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the efficacy of aerobic exercise in the acute phase of recovery for
      pediatric patients with a concussion. Half of participants will complete sub-symptom
      threshold aerobic exercise and half of participants will complete a placebo stretching
      protocol.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The safety of aerobic exercise in the management of pediatric patients with post-concussion
      syndrome (PCS) has been established, but there is no existing data on exercise treatment for
      pediatric patients in the acute phase of recovery after sports-related concussion. While
      intensive exercise too soon after concussion has been associated with delayed recovery and
      used to justify prolonged periods of rest, recent studies have shown that controlled,
      sub-symptom threshold aerobic exercise may aid recovery by improving autonomic balance and
      cerebral blood flow auto-regulation after concussion. This study will randomly assign
      pediatric patients with concussion to a treatment group in which they will complete
      sub-symptom threshold aerobic exercise or to a placebo group in which they will complete a
      standardized stretching protocol. All participants will have routine clinical visits that
      consist of a physical examination and exercise test, which will be terminated with the
      exacerbation of symptoms.

    <description>Aerobic exercise participants will receive an exercise prescription based on their heart rate threshold (HRT) for symptom exacerbation during an initial treadmill test. Participants will be asked to exercise once a day at 80% of their assigned HRT for up to 20 minutes depending on their age. Participants will wear a heart rate monitor to track their frequency, duration, and heart rate during aerobic exercise. The treatment will continue until the participant is fully recovered from their concussion, as determined by exercise tolerance and a normal symptom count and clinical examination.</description>
