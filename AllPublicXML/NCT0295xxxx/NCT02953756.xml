  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) is increasingly applied in patients with brain metastases
      (BM) and is expected to have less adverse effects on cognitive functioning than Whole Brain
      Radiation Therapy (WBRT). Because cognitive functions are essential for daily functioning,
      and may affect therapy compliance and quality of life in general, a full understanding of
      cognitive functioning in patients with BM after SRS is essential.

      CAR-Study A is a prospective study to evaluate cognitive functioning in patients with 1-10 BM
      accepted for treatment with Gamma Knife radiosurgery (GKRS).

    <textblock>
      CAR-Study A is a prospective study to evaluate cognitive functioning after GKRS in patients
      with 1-10 newly diagnosed brain metastases on a triple dose gadolinium-enhanced MRI-scan.
      Neuropsychological assessment will be performed at baseline and at 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, and 21
      months after treatment. Follow-up assessments will be combined with 3-monthly MRI-scans.

    <description>Local brain tumor control of the initial GKRS-treated lesions is defined as a complete, partial, or stable response, or less than a 25% increase in diameter on contrast-enhanced MRI follow-up and not requiring resection. Any initial treated lesions increased by more than 25% in diameter on contrast-enhanced MRI or required resection will be considered a local failure.</description>
