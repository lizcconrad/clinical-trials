    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this study is to:

        -  Document the developmental outcomes of individuals with Pompe disease treated with
           long-term enzyme-replacement therapy (ERT) through school-age (ages 6-18) using measures
           of cognitive functioning, academic skills, and speech and language abilities.

        -  Investigate possible cognitive processing speed weaknesses using BrainBaseline
           neurocognitive assessment software.

        -  Investigate the relationship between behavior and other developmental factors including
           speech and language ability and cognitive ability.

        -  Explore if the use of selected iPad applications may help strengthen cognitive
           processing speed in children with Pompe disease

    <textblock>
      The study will last approximately 2-3 years. It includes 2-4 visits to Duke for developmental
      assessments. The baseline/year 1 visit may take place at Duke (may take 1-2 days) or remotely
      via iPad. The follow up 1/year 2 visit may take place at Duke (1-2 days) or remotely via an
      iPad, depending upon each child's particular situation.
