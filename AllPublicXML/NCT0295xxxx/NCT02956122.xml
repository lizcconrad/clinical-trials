      The purpose of the study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of GLASSIA as an add-on
      biopharmacotherapy to standard-of-care steroid treatment as the first-line treatment in
      participants with acute GvHD with lower GI involvement.

          2. Recipient of an hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT)

          3. The disease indication for which the participant required HSCT must be in remission

          4. Newly diagnosed acute graft-versus-host disease (GvHD), including lower
             Gastrointestinal (GI) involvement (modified International Bone Marrow Transplant
             Registry [IBMTR] Severity Stage 1 to 4 [&gt;500 mL diarrhea/day]), with or without other
             organ system involvement.

          5. Willing to undergo or must have had a lower GI biopsy within 7 days of informed
             consent to confirm GI GvHD. Biopsy results are not needed to initiate treatment;

             be discontinued.

             cyclosporine and/or mycophenolate mofetil, etc) or corticosteroid therapy. In
             addition, a participant who received the first dose of corticosteroid therapy for
             acute GvHD with lower GI involvement more than 72 hours before the first dose of study
             treatment is not eligible for the study

          8. Participant with severe sepsis involving at least 1 organ failure

          9. Participant who is seropositive or positive in the nucleic acid test for human
             immunodeficiency virus (HIV)

             device during the course of this study

         12. If female, participant is pregnant or lactating at the time of enrollment, or has
             plans to become pregnant during the study
