  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, multicenter clinical trial designed to evaluate the safety and
      potential efficacy of venetoclax and ABBV-838 combination therapy with dexamethasone in
      participants with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma (MM) who have received 2 or more
      prior lines of therapy for multiple myeloma (MM). The study will consist of 2 arms: Arm A and
      Arm B (if applicable). Each arm will have a dose escalation and dose expansion portion.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will consist of 2 arms: Arm A and Arm B (if applicable). Arm A dose escalation will
      investigate up to 3 doses of ABBV-838 at 3-week dosing intervals (Q3W) in combination with
      venetoclax and dexamethasone. Arm A dose expansion portion will investigate the ABBV-838 Q3W
      dosing interval with venetoclax and dexamethasone at the recommended phase two dose (RPTD)
      combination defined from the Dose Escalation portion.

      Based on data from the ongoing ABBV-838 monotherapy study (Study M14-467) Arm B dose
      escalation may be conducted, if deemed necessary. If conducted, Arm B dose excalation will
      investigate up to 3 doses of ABBV-838 at either weekly (Q1W) or bi-weekly (Q2W) dosing
      intervals in combination with venetoclax and dexamethasone. Arm B dose expansion portion will
      investigate either the ABBV-838 Q1W or Q2W dosing interval in combination with venetoclax and
      dexamethasone at the RPTD combination defined from the Dose Escalation portion.
