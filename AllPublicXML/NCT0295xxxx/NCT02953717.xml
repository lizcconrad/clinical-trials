  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Whole Brain Radiation Therapy (WBRT) has long been the mainstay of treatment for patients
      with multiple brain metastases (BM). Meanwhile, Gamma Knife radiosurgery (GKRS) has been
      increasingly employed in the management of multiple BM to spare healthy tissue. Hence, GKRS
      is expected to cause fewer cognitive side effects than WBRT. Treatment of multiple BM without
      cognitive side effects is becoming more important, as more patients live longer due to better
      systemic treatment options. There are no published randomized trials yet directly comparing
      GKRS to WBRT in patients with multiple BM, including objective neuropsychological testing.

      CAR-Study B is a prospective randomized trial comparing cognitive outcome after GKRS or WBRT
      in eligible patients with 11-20 BM.

      CAR-Study B is a prospective randomized trial comparing cognitive outcome after GKRS or WBRT
      in eligible patients with 11-20 BM on a triple dose gadolinium-enhanced MRI-scan.
      Neuropsychological assessment will be performed at baseline and at 3, 6, 9, 12 and 15 months
      after treatment. Follow-up assessments will be combined with 3-monthly MRI-scans.

      Patients will be randomized to either GKRS or WBRT. Groups will be balanced at baseline
      (prior to radiotherapy), taking into account several (stratification) factors that may
      influence cognitive functioning over time, such as: total tumor volume in the brain, systemic
      treatment, KPS, age, histology, and baseline HVLT-R total recall score.
