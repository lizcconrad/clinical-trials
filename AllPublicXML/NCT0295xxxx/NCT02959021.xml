    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to examine whether a primary care weight management intervention
      delivered by peer coaches produces greater weight loss than a self-directed program without
      peer coach support.

    <ipd_description>With the documented permission of the IRB, the PI may develop a transportable de-identified database, codebook, and mechanism by which data can be shared with qualified investigators. Interested investigators will be asked to complete a standardized request form stating the specific aims of the analyses, the analytic plan, available resources for completing the proposed project, proposed timeline, and goals (i.e., manuscripts, presentations, and/or grant applications). The PI and research team will review these requests to determine whether the proposed analyses constitute an innovative and significant exploration of the data, whether the proposed team has sufficient resources to complete the request, and whether data will be adequately protected and managed. If any of these issues are problematic, the PI and research team will attempt to negotiate a fair resolution with the interested investigators and NIH program staff.</ipd_description>
