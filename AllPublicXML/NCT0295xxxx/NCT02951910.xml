  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hyaluronic acid, a natural polymer, helps to maintain ocular surface hydration and can
      already be found in several artificial tears recommended to alleviate symptoms of dry eye. A
      recent hyaluronate modification involves zinc-hyaluronate complex formation by adding
      zinc-chloride to an aqueous sodium-hyaluronate resulting in a very stable molecular
      structure, which functions as both a mechanical barrier and a biocompatible film on the
      ocular surface. Apart from its beneficial elastoviscous characteristics, previous results
      indicate that hyaluronate can also reduce the excitability of the peripheral nociceptor
      endings underlying pain. Although hyaluronate is widely used in artificial tears to improve
      tear film stability, its effect on ocular surface sensitivity was not evaluated in patients
      with dry eye. The aim of this study is to investigate the characteristics of ocular surface
      sensations and corneal sensitivity in dry eye patients before and after long-term tear
      supplementation with zinc-hyaluronate.

    <description>Corneal sensitivity to selective (thermal, mechanical, chemical) stimulation will be assessed using the noncontact Belmonte gas esthesiometer. Mechanical, chemical (CO2 in air), and cold stimuli were used during three-second air pulses of adjustable flow rate, composition (CO2%) and temperature.The good reproducibility of mechanical, heat and chemical threshold measurements using noncontact esthesiometers has been previously reported in several studies.</description>

    <description>Tear film dynamics is assessed by non-invasive tear film breakup time (NI-BUT) in parallel with continuous recordings of ocular sensations during forced blinking. Corneal sensitivity thresholds to selective stimulation of corneal mechanonociceptors, thermal receptors and chemical nociceptors are assessed using the Belmonte gas esthesiometer. All baseline measurements are repeated after one month of tear supplementation with zinc-hyaluronate (Ophylosa eye drop) 4x/day</description>
