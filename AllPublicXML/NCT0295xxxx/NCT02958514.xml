    <description>Intense pulse light (IPL) has been used in dermatology practices for several years as a treatment for rosacea and acne.IPL uses Xenon flashlamp to emit wavelengths of light from 400 to 1200nm. When placed on the light, a filter restricts the wavelength to the visible light range of *500nm.In 2007-2008, an IPL treatment technology-the Diamond Q4 by DermaMed Solutions-was specifically configured to our specifications with the goal of stimulating secretion of normal meibum via skin treatment effects on the meibomian glands. It was discovered that dry eye patients are better positioned for gland expression, as IPL seems to liquefy the abnormal viscous meibum and dilate the glands.</description>
