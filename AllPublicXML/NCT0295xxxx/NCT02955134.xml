  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate long-term efficacy of Chinese medicine treatment for
      chronic atrophic gastritis. It is a multi-center, randomized, placebo-controlled trial.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A prospective, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, multi-center trial is carried
      out in this study.The sample size is 468 patients ( 312 in experimental group, 156 in control
      group). The investigators will screen the patients for inclusion according to the inclusion
      and exclusion criteria. All patients undergo carbon-13 labeled urea breath test, upper
      digestive endoscopy and biopsies for histological investigation. Patients infected of
      H.pylori must receive H.pylori eradication therapy under the guidance of Kyoto global
      consensus report on H.pylori gastritis. Then they are assigned to experimental group or
      control group with an allocation ratio of 2:1. Patients in experimental group take the
      traditional Chinese medicine prescription, while the control group take simulate granule of
      the prescription. Both two groups are under symptomatic treatment. Treatment duration lasts
      24 weeks. Investigators also follow up another 24 weeks. Histological changes are used as the
      primary outcome index. Endoscopy findings, symptoms are assessed. Serum level of pepsinogen
      and patient-reported outcome instrument are also administered during the study. All biopsy
      specimens are collected to build the biological specimen bank. Central blinded histological
      assessment (Histological diagnosis is determined independently by three experienced
      pathologists who are blinded to the information of the patients.) are used to insure the
      accuracy and consistency. Tele-medicine and information management system is established to
      help achieve follow-up interviews.

      Random numbers are generated by SAS 9.4 software. The subjects, caregivers, investigators and
      outcomes assessors in this study are all blinded.

    <description>Gastric mucosa samples are subsequently evaluated according to updated Sydney system with the degree of H.pylori density, polymorphonuclear neutrophil activity, chronic inflammation, glandular atrophy, and intestinal metaplasia classified as: 0,'normal'; 2, 'mild'; 4, 'moderate'; and 6, 'marked'. Grade of histological gastritis is evaluated with this score 0, 2, 4, and 6.</description>

    <measure>Change of endoscopic atrophy</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline endoscopic atrophy at 6 months and 1 year</time_frame>
    <description>Endoscopic atrophy are defined using an endoscopicatrophic border scale previously reported by Kimura and Takemoto. This scale correlates with histological results and includes the following classifications: 1 close-type, when the atrophic border remains on the lesser curvature of the stomach; 2 open-type, when the atrophic border extends along the anterior and posterior walls of the stomach and is not associated with the lesser curvature of the stomach. Close-type and open-type atrophy are further classified as none (C0), mild (C1, 2),moderate (C3, O1), and severe (O2, 3) atrophy. In this study, atrophy grade are also scored as C0: 0, C1: 1, C2: 2, C3:3, O1: 4, O2: 5, and O3: 6 respectively, with 0 representing an absence of atrophy and 6 indicating severe atrophy.</description>

    <description>Symptoms of dyspepsia, regurgitation and defecation are assessed for severity and frequency at enrollment in every interview during the study.For each symptom, the scores are calculated by multiplying frequency by severity.
All symptom scores are added to define the total symptom score.</description>
