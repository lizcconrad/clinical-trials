      This study is designed to validate the performance of the algorithms to be used in future
      commercial device.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Performance will be assessed by comparing the output of the algorithms, which were developed
      by correlating changes in brain electrical activity (EEG) and other measures of brain
      function to mTBI (e.g. concussion) in the sports environment.

      Injured athletes will be studied during the season at time of injury, and then longitudinally
      weeks after injury. Matched controls will be tested following the same schedule as the
      injured athletes.
