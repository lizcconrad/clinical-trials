  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Uptake, adherence, and completion of vaccination among drug users were low, and their immune
      function and immune response to hepatitis B vaccination were also suboptimal, indicating that
      the current practice of hepatitis B vaccination can't protect drug users from HBV infection.

      This is a randomized, open-label, blank-controlled trial, conducted among drug users with
      drug rehabilitation. This study will compare the immunogenicity and safety of three
      intramuscular 20µg and 60µg recombinant hepatitis B vaccines at months 0, 1, and 6 among drug
      users
