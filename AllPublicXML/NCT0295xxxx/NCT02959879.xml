  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In patients with resectable pancreatic duct adenocarcinoma (PDAC), curative surgery followed
      by adjuvant chemotherapy is currently the standard of care. However, the long-term results
      are still poor, with median disease-free and overall survival of 14 months and 23 months. The
      corresponding 5-year overall survival rate is 20%.

      Chemotherapy before surgery (neoadjuvant chemotherapy) allows identification of patients with
      rapidly progressive metastatic disease at time of preoperative restaging (surgery is then
      avoided in these patients), and may increase the rate of free margin resection (R0) and
      reduce the risk of local recurrence.

      Even though single-agent gemcitabine and 5-FU have been validated in adjuvant and metastatic
      settings, the objective response was low (at around 10%), whereas combination chemotherapy
      exceeds a response rate of 30% in advanced disease. In metastatic PDAC, palliative FOLFIRINOX
      chemotherapy has been demonstrated to be effective (in terms of response rates and
      progression-free survival) and well tolerated. Interestingly, the response rate is increased
      by using more than two chemotherapeutic agents in advanced pancreatic cancer, justifying the
      use of an alternative neoadjuvant FOLFOX-based chemotherapy arm.

      PANACHE-01 is an open, non-comparative, randomised, multicentre Phase II study designed to
      assess the safety and efficacy of two modes of neo-adjuvant chemotherapy (FOLFIRINOX &amp;
      FOLFOX) relative to the current reference treatment (surgery and then adjuvant chemotherapy)
      for resectable PDAC.

      Patients with immediately resectable PDAC (definition based on the NCCN's (American National
      Comprehensive Cancer Network 2014) latest guidelines) will be randomised to either
      pancreatectomy and adjuvant chemotherapy or 4 cycles of neoadjuvant chemotherapy with either
      FOLFOX or FOLFIRINOX. The patients in the neoadjuvant chemotherapy arms will receive
      postoperative chemotherapy for 4 months (8 cycles).
