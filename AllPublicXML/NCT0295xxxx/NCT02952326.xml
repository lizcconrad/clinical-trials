      patients are randomized into 2 groups after meeting the eligibility criteria,

        1. Each patient will be given pain scale chart in order to record his /her pain level
           before any intervention.

        2. The tooth is anesthetized, accessed and mechanical instrumentation to be made 3 A) For
           the experimental group: The canals will be thoroughly irrigated using 3ml syringe of
           2.5% Sodium hypochlorite between every subsequent instrument. XP Endo finisher is used
           after the last instrument in preparation

      B) For the control group :

      The canals will be thoroughly irrigated using 3ml syringe of 2.5% Sodium hypochlorite between
      every subsequent instrument.

      4) Obturation is done and postoperative instructions are given to the patient
