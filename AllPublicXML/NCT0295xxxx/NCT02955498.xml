      The purpose of this study is to assess the pharmacokinetic characteristics of olmesartan and
      S-amlodipine after single oral administration of Sevikar tab. 10/40mg, a combination
      formulation of olmesartan and amlodipine as reference drug and Lodivikar tab. 5/40mg, a
      combination formulation of olmesartan and S-amlodipine as test drug in healthy male adults.
      Additionally the safety and tolerability of two drugs will be evaluated.
