  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      RP3128 is a calcium release activated calcium (CRAC) channel modulator. The purpose of this
      study is to evaluate the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of single and multiple
      ascending dose(s) of RP3128 in healthy volunteers and to evaluate the effect on late phase
      asthmatic response to allergen challenge in patients with mild asthma.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study consists of three parts; Part 1: single ascending dose (SAD), Part 2: multiple
      ascending dose (MAD) in healthy volunteers and Part 3: proof of concept (POC) study in mild
      asthmatics. There will be 5 cohorts in SAD and 3 cohorts in MAD, the doses used in the MAD
      will be based on emerging safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics (PK) from Part 1 (SAD).
      POC is a randomized, placebo- controlled, double blind, two period cross-over, proof of
      concept study in male and female of non child bearing potential with history of mild asthma.
      the highest identified dose of RP3128 in Part 2 (MAD) will be considered for POC
