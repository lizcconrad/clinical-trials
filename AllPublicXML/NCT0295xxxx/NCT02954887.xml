          -  Participant has a QT interval, corrected for heart rate with Bazett's formula (QTcB),
             of 460 msec or greater on ECG.

          -  Participant's caregiver is currently giving or has given recreational or medicinal
             cannabis, or synthetic cannabinoid-based medications, within the 1 month prior to the

          -  Participant's caregiver is unwilling to abstain from giving the participant (including
             the participant's mother abstaining themselves, if breastfeeding)recreational or
             medicinal cannabis, or synthetic cannabinoid-based medications (other than the study
             drug) during the trial.

          -  Participant has any known or suspected hypersensitivity to cannabinoids or any of the
             excipients of the study drug, such as sesame oil.

          -  Participant has significantly impaired hepatic function at the screening visit.

          -  Participant has received an investigational medicinal product as part of a clinical
             trial within a minimum of 5 half-lives prior to the screening visit.
