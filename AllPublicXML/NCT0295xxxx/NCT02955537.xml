  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study seeks to evaluate a multicomponent mobile intervention to change multiple
      hypertension-related health behaviors in African Americans with uncontrolled hypertension.
      Half of the participants will receive a mobile intervention designed to improve physical
      activity, sodium intake, and medication adherence. The other half will receive usual care.
