  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Measurement of surface roughness of tow different material of denture base to find out which
      material is more hygienic by decreasing the amount of bacterial accumulation.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Using a denture base material as a standard value which is the rapid heat cured acrylic resin
      and compare it with a new material which is a conventional acrylic resin with addition of
      titanium dioxide nano particles in surface roughness and measuring it by a device called
      stylus profilometer this will be done on 20 patients this trial will take about 6 months.
