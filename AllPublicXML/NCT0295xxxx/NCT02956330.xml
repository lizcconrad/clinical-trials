  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this non interventional retrospective study is to continue to collect data
      from patients following their completion of Protocol CLS 1003-201: &quot;Safety and Efficacy of
      Suprachoroidal CLS-TA with Intravitreal Aflibercept in Subjects with Macular Edema Following
      Retinal Vein Occlusion&quot; (ie, the parent study).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a non-interventional, retrospective study of up to 6 months for subjects that
      completed the parent study CLS1003-201. This study is designed to collect data from patients
      following their parent study exit visit, through either the time of the next treatment for
      RVO or at least 6 months following the parent study exit visit, whichever occurs first.

      During this non-interventional retrospective study, the following data will be collected in
      an online questionnaire (or where required, on paper) provided by Clearside:

        -  Next RVO therapy administered (if applicable), including reason for treatment

        -  Continued documentation of current or changes in medical or ocular conditions following
           parent study

        -  Concomitant drug or therapy changes

        -  Visual acuity, including details on the method used in the assessment

        -  Central retinal thickness, including details on the equipment used in its determination

        -  Intraocular pressure, including details on the equipment used in its determination

      Subjects will be selected based on parent study primary investigator's access to their
      medical records access, following exit from CLS1003-201. Data will also be collected on the
      total number of patients included in this non interventional study as well as reasons
      patients were excluded. Data will be summarized from the randomization treatment assignment
      in the parent study.
