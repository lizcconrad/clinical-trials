  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To evaluate the effectiveness of Take Heart, a behavioral/educational program for adults age
      50+ with heart disease, or with at least two risk factors for heart disease, that helps them
      to better manage their health condition(s). Take Heart is a new version of an evidence-based
      program that has recently been adapted to be suitable for the needs of adults residing in
      Detroit.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this study, a heart disease self-management program will be tested in a low-income,
      predominantly African-American community via a partnership with the Detroit Area Agency on
      Aging (DAAA), the Detroit Medical Center (DMC), and University of Michigan School of Public
      Health's Center for Managing Chronic Disease (CMCD). The specific aims of the research are
      to: (1) adapt existing program materials to be appropriate for the new target population,
      getting feedback from various sources including focus group interviews; (2) conduct a pilot
      study of the adapted &quot;Take Heart&quot; program; (3) refine the intervention and conduct a
      randomized trial with 376 participants age 50 years and over, to assess health outcomes; (4)
      assess the translation and implementation of the intervention in the target setting and
      identify factors that help and hinder the process; (5) assess cost savings associated with
      the intervention; and (6) develop guidelines for &quot;scaling up&quot;, that is, for replicating the
      program in other low-income areas through the national network of Area Agencies on Aging.

    <time_frame>Baseline and 12-month follow up</time_frame>
    <description>This will be measured by asking participants to report the number of nights they have stayed overnight in the hospital during the past year, for something related to their own health. We will ask this at baseline and then at the 12 month mark after the completion of the baseline survey, so that we can compare the year prior to the intervention to the year they completed the intervention. In addition, when possible, we will verify self-reported hospitalizations with Electronic Medical Record (EMR) data from our partners at the Detroit Medical Center (DMC). We will only be able to look into the EMRs of those participants that are patients at the DMC. Change will be indicated by difference between count at baseline and count at follow-up.</description>

    <description>This will be measured by asking participants to report the number of times they went to the emergency department for something related to their own health, during the past year. We will ask this at baseline and then at the 12 month mark after the completion of the baseline survey, so that we can compare the year prior to the intervention to the year they completed the intervention. In addition, when possible, we will verify self-reported Emergency Department visits with Electronic Medical Record (EMR) data from our partners at the Detroit Medical Center (DMC).

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Health-related quality of life</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 12-month follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>Health-related quality of life (HRQOL) will be measured with the PROMIS-29 (Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System-29) profile measure, which assesses depression, anxiety, pain interference, physical function, fatigue, satisfaction with social role participation, and sleep disturbance (4 items each, 5 point Likert scales). One item (11 point scale) measures pain intensity. The T-score rescales the raw score into a standardized score with a mean of 50 and a standard deviation (SD) of 10. https://www.assessmentcenter.net/documents/PROMIS%20Profile%20Scoring%20Manual.pdf Change in HRQOL in each domain will be indicated by the difference in T-scores between baseline and follow-up, and, for pain intensity, difference in the raw score.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Cardiac symptom experience</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 12-month follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>This will be measured by the cardiac symptom subscale of the Symptom and Health Problem Profile, which was developed by investigators and used in previous work. Participants are asked about the presence (yes/no), frequency, and bothersomeness (the latter two measured on 5-point Likert scales) in the last seven days of five cardiac symptoms routinely assessed by clinicians (chest pain, shortness of breath, rapid or irregular heart beat, waking with chest pain, and waking with shortness of breath). Symptom frequency and bothersomeness scores range from 0-25, with higher scores indicating worse cardiac symptoms, with a zero assigned for symptoms that are not present. Change will be measured by the difference in mean frequency and bothersomeness scores from baseline to follow-up.</description>

    <description>Participants receive an evidence-based heart disease self management program consisting of a combination of five two and a half hour group sessions and telephone counseling offered by a trained facilitator employed by the Detroit Area Agency on Aging. The program is designed so that participants select an area to work on (e.g., diet, exercise, medication taking, communication with health care professionals) and receive support, information, and encouragement from group members and program facilitators, to help them reach their goals.</description>

    <ipd_description>Data sharing: We will have self-reported data (baseline and 12-month) on health, demographics, and psychosocial functioning from both intervention and control participants. An anonymized dataset will be created, which will be made available to other researchers who have appropriate approvals from all relevant Institutional Review Boards (IRBs) through a secure file transfer protocol (FTP) site, M+Box, whose encryption protocols allow secure uploading of files, with sharing limited to specified users (see: http://www.itcs.umich.edu/storage/box/faq.php#storage). Data dictionaries and data collection forms will also be made available. Researchers using the data will be instructed to delete their copy of the dataset once analyses are complete. An email address to reach University of Michigan investigators will be available for questions about the datasets.</ipd_description>
