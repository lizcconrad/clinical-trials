  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether a Twitter-based intervention with a
      private, online support group can significantly increase number of walking steps compared to
      self-monitoring of physical activity alone or a control group in sedentary women at a women's
      heart clinic.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Sedentary behavior is a risk factor for heart disease, independent of meeting physical
      activity guidelines. Tweet4Wellness is an innovative light physical activity, specifically
      walking, intervention which randomly assigns participants to a 25-person private, online
      support group that will receive daily, theory-based messages as peer-to-peer discussion
      prompts. Many text-based interventions do not base the intervention text messages in behavior
      change theory, but this study will base the daily messages in the behavior change theories
      such as implementation intentions, social support, mindfulness, and social learning theory.

      The trial will be conducted over two, 3-month periods. For the first 3 months, there will be
      3 groups: Group 1 will receive the Twitter intervention and a &quot;Fitbit&quot; triaxial pedometer to
      track their steps throughout the day; Group 2 will receive the Fitbit pedometer only; Group 3
      will be a waitlist control, and receive an online Center for Disease Control (CDC) website on
      physical activity and walking improvement.

      For the second 3 months: Group 1 will receive new daily Twitter discussion prompts and
      continue monitoring their physical activity with the Fitbit; Group 2 will receive the Twitter
      intervention and continue monitoring their physical activity with the Fitbit; Group 3 will
      receive both the Twitter intervention and a Fitbit pedometer.

    <description>A daily, behavior change theory-based intervention message is sent to a private, 25-person online Twitter-support group to prompt peer-to-peer discussion. Participants receive individual text messages to encourage group participation (e.g. 'thank you for participating' or 'please participate tomorrow'). Participants also receive weekly individual messages giving them daily step goals for the week based on their previous week's daily step average, recorded from Fitbit.</description>
