  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The increasing prevalence of Alzheimer's disease and other forms of dementia causes new
      challenges to ensure that healthcare decisions are informed by research evidence and reflect
      what is important for seniors and their caregivers. Primary care providers point to a need
      for more training on communication with families of seniors living with dementia, and on the
      non-pharmacological health options that are often recommended before use of
      medications.Therefore, the investigators will design and evaluate an intervention to train
      primary healthcare providers on how to empower seniors with dementia and their caregivers in
      making health-related decisions based on research evidence and on their preferences and
      priorities. A distance professional training program on shared decision making will initially
      be designed, comprising evidence summaries to be shared with patients living with dementia
      and their caregivers who face difficult decisions. Patients with dementia, their caregivers
      and healthcare providers, will then provide feedback on the training program, which will then
      be improved following their suggestions. In a last step, the investigators will evaluate
      whether this training program truly increases the participation of patients and their
      caregivers in decision making, their comfort with the decision that they have made, and their
      motivation and ability to control their life by taking care of their own health.

      Background: The increasing prevalence of Alzheimer's disease and other forms of dementia
      causes new challenges in primary care. Indeed, primary care providers point to a need for
      more training to care for this population, especially seniors presenting behavioural and
      psychological symptoms of dementia. They also find the inter-professional nature of care, and
      the need to communicate with community services and families, very challenging. Moreover,
      patients living with dementia and their caregivers consistently report their need for more
      information about dementia. Therefore, in a recent survey, the investigators sought five
      difficult decisions that patients living with dementia and their informal caregivers often
      face in primary care settings. In the current study, they propose to tailor and evaluate an
      e-learning professional training program on shared decision making, comprising evidence
      summaries on the health options to consider before making these five difficult decisions.
      This tailored training program is expected to improve shared decision making between
      clinicians and patients with dementia and their caregivers, and in turn improve patient and
      caregiver empowerment in relation to their own health care.

      Methods: In two phases, the aims of this study are to (1) design and tailor the intervention,
      and (2) implement and evaluate it. In the first phase, theory and user-centred design will be
      used to tailor a multifaceted intervention comprising a distance professional training
      program on shared decision making, and five shared decision-making tools dealing with
      difficult decisions often faced by seniors with dementia and their caregivers. Each tool will
      be designed in two versions, one for clinicians, and one for patients/caregivers. Forty-nine
      clinicians and 27 patients/caregivers will be invited to participate to three cycles of
      design-evaluation-feedback of each intervention components. Besides think-aloud and interview
      approaches, they will also complete questionnaires to identify the factors most likely to
      influence their adoption of shared decision making after exposure to the intervention.
      Thereafter, the intervention will be modified by adding/enhancing behaviour-change techniques
      targeting these factors. In the second phase, the effectiveness of this tailored intervention
      will be evaluated before/after implementation, in a two-armed, clustered randomized trial
      with a three-month follow-up. A convenience sample of 6 primary care clinics will be enrolled
      in the province of Quebec (Canada), and clinicians who practice there will be recruited
      (mostly family physicians, nurses, and social workers). These clinics will then be randomized
      to immediate exposure to the intervention, or usual care with delayed exposure to the
      intervention. Overall, 180 seniors with dementia, their caregivers, and their healthcare
      providers will be recruited. The investigators will evaluate impact of the intervention on
      patient involvement in the decision making process, decisional comfort, patient and caregiver
      personal empowerment in relation to their own health care, patient quality of life, caregiver
      burden, and decisional regret.

      Discussion: The intervention will empower patients and their caregivers in their health care,
      by fostering their participation as partners during the decision-making process, and by
      ensuring they make informed decisions congruent with their values and priorities.

    <description>The clinicians will have access to a distance training program on shared decision making (e-TUDE) during one month. They will also receive five Decision Boxes (DB) dealing with difficult decisions often faced by seniors with dementia and their caregivers in primary care. Each DB will be designed in two versions, one adapted to clinicians (C-DB), and a simplified version adapted to patients/caregivers (P-DB). They will receive the five C-DBs by email, at a rate of 1 per week for 5 weeks. Furthermore, they will also be invited to use the 5 P-DBs with their patients. To this end, they will receive a stack of printed copies of the P-DBs for use in home care consultations, and we will also leave some copies in a wall file in each consultation room of the clinic.</description>
