      The purpose of this study is to investigate the efficacy of lansoprazole combination with
      domperidone on intragastric acidity and intraesophageal acidity, GERD symptoms, impedance
      kinetics, gastric emptying in patients with gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD).

      Objectives of the trial to assess the efficacy of lansoprazole in combination with
      domperidone on gastric acidity, intraesophageal acidity, GERD symptoms, impedance kinetics
      and gastric emptying in patients with GERD.

      24 hour pH measurement and gastric emptying test will be done at screening visit and after 7
      days of drug treatment. Twelve patients will take one tablet for 7 days.
