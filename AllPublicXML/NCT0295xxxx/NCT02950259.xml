  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is assess the safety and tolerability of the IRX-2 regimen in patients
      with early stage breast cancer (ESBC) and to estimate the pathologic complete response rate
      to neoadjuvant anthracycline-based and non-platinum containing chemotherapy in patients with
      triple-negative breast cancer who have received the IRX-2 Regimen before chemotherapy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This will be a Phase Ib study conducted to determine the safety and tolerability of an IRX-2
      regimen in ESBC, to be administered pre-operatively before standard-of-care surgical
      resection and following standard-of-care diagnostic biopsy. This study will also include
      triple-negative breast cancer patients who will receive the IRX-2 regimen prior to
      chemotherapy.

      Eligible subjects will have early stage breast cancer of any receptor sub-type, for which
      standard-of-care surgical resection is planned. To be eligible, a minimum of 1 core of
      tumor-bearing biopsy material must be available for research analysis.

      Cohort B will enroll subjects triple negative breast cancer (defined by ER&lt;10%, PR&lt;10%, and
      HER2-negative by NCCN guidelines), T1c+ tumors for which neoadjuvant anthracycline-based and
      non-platinum containing chemotherapy is planned. The IRX-2 regimen will be administered and
      completed preceding chemotherapy. Cohort B subjects must undergo post-IRX-2 Regimen biopsy
      (2-3 cores), followed by commencement of chemotherapy preferably within one week after
      biopsy.

      The IRX-2 regimen will be administered in all enrolled subjects. IRX 2 will be administered
      by subcutaneous injection into the periareolar skin of the affected breast.
