  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of children, age 6 months to 3
      years, with a diagnosis of Otis media with effusion (OME) based on examination by a provider
      at a Duke- affiliated otolaryngology clinic.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of intranasal xylitol in young
      children with otitis media with effusion as measured by the resolution of middle ear effusion
      based on physical examination and tympanometry at 6-, 12-, and 18 and 24-weeks
      post-treatment. Eligible subjects will be randomly assigned to receive either intranasal
      xylitol spray or a nasal saline spray placebo and will be observed for 24-weeks following
      initiation of daily xylitol spray or placebo. The primary efficacy endpoint, the time to
      middle ear effusion resolution with and without the xylitol nasal spray, will be analyzed
      using either a two-sample t-test or non-parametric Wilcoxon test, depending on whether the
      time is normal or non-normal. Risks include epistaxis, diarrhea, and allergic reaction.
      Serious adverse events are not anticipated.
