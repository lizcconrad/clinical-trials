      The study will compare bacteria levels in cavities before and after silver diamine fluoride
      (SDF) treatment.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      To assess the effect of silver diamine fluoride (SDF) treatment on microorganisms present in
      root caries or cervical lesions by collecting microbial deposits before and 1 month after SDF
      application. Bacterial samples will be collected from 20 adult subjects at the initial visit
      before application of SDF and one month after. At the 1 month recall, examination for caries
      arrest will be performed. All 40 bacterial samples will be sent to the Forsyth Institute to
      verify bacterial composition using HOMINGS technology.

    <description>No caries removal will take place. Bacterial samples will be collected using Gracey curettes at the initial visit before application of SDF and one month after. The tooth will be dried and SDF will be placed on the carious dentin until saturated. Excess will be blotted dry with a cotton pellet</description>
