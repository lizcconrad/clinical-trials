    <textblock>
      Implementation of perineural catheters may lead to infection by catheter colonization.
      Catheters may be colonized by the bacteria present on the skin. This is most often commensal
      organisms as Staphylococcus or gram negative bacilli. In a large study of 1416 peripheral
      nerve catheters, 28.7% of catheters were cultured positive. This colonization is most often
      silent because in the same study only 3% of patients had signs of local inflammation and one
      psoas abscess was observed (0.07%). The germs are most often coagulase negative staphylococci
      (61%) and gram negative bacillus (21.6%).

      Potential interest of alcoholic Chlorhexidine 2% to reduce the colonization of implanted
      catheters More recently, it is the antiseptic solution that has been the subject of several
      studies, including the latest on laying intravascular central catheters, highlights the
      superiority of alcoholic chlorhexidine 2% compared to povidone iodine alcohol [ 5]. Indeed,
      it was observed a reduction in the risk of bacterial infection 6 (RR 0 • 15, 95% CI 0 • 05-0
      • 41) and of colonization by 5 (RR: 0.18 (95% Cl 0.13-0.24) through the use of alcoholic
      chlorhexidine with 2% applicator.

      Such a study comparing the efficacy of the antiseptic (chlorhexidine vs Povidone-iodine) on
      the establishment of perineural catheters does not exist what motivated the establishment of
      our study.

    <description>Assuming a frequency of the event without treatment 40%, to highlight a sub treatment relative reduction in frequency of 80% it is necessary to include 92 patients (for a 90% power and a alpha risk of 1%). According to the technique of Brun-Buisson, the catheter will be collected in a neutral tube containing 1 ml of sterile saline. In the laboratory, the tube will be vortexed for one minute and then 10μl of the sample will be seeded in oese calibrated on blood agar. Reading culture will be achieved after 48 hours at 35 ° C aerobically. The catheter will be considered settled if the count found most 1000 UFC / ml. Bacterial identification will be carried out by mass spectrometry and sensitivity by the diffusion method on Muller-Hinton agar. If there is more than one bacterial population, the number of PDUs for each bacterium was determined. In this case, we will consider only the bacterial types&gt; 1000 UFC / ml</description>
