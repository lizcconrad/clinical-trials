      This is a new Stage III community-based randomized clinical efficacy trial testing Mothering
      from the Inside Out (MIO), the first evidence-based parenting intervention designed to be
      delivered by addiction counselors in addiction treatment settings where parents of young
      children are enrolled in treatment. MIO is a weekly individual parenting therapy developed as
      an enhancement to standard addiction treatment that targets the addicted mother's capacity to
      recognize and regulate her own emotional distress during stressful parenting situations so
      that she can support her child's developing capacity for emotional and behavioral regulation.
      This capacity, called reflective functioning (RF), is a psychological skill that promotes
      abstinence and also helps parents foster their young children's secure attachment. Now that
      MIO has demonstrated efficacy in two randomized efficacy trials, the next step will be to
      conduct a new Stage III community-based efficacy trial where addiction counselors are trained
      to deliver MIO and PE with fidelity in an addiction treatment setting and to evaluate
      treatment outcomes and mechanisms of change in this community setting. At the end of this
      trial, if MIO demonstrates efficacy, all the necessary materials will be ready to train
      addiction counselors across a broad range of treatment settings in a Stage IV effectiveness
      trial. 120 mothers in addiction treatment and caring for children ages 11 - 60 months will be
      randomized to 12 sessions of MIO vs PE with a trained addiction counselor and fidelity will
      be monitored and maintained for treatment duration. It is expected that MIO-assigned mothers
      will demonstrate greater improvement in the primary targeted outcome - reflective functioning
      at week 12 (end of treatment) and week 33 (end of follow up). It is also predicted that
      MIO-assigned mothers will demonstrate greater improvement in secondary outcomes, including
      maternal sensitivity, caregiving behavior, psychiatric distress, depression and substance use
      at week 12 (end of treatment) and week 33 (end of follow up). Finally, it is predicted that
      children of MIO-assigned mothers will demonstrate greater improvement in the secondary
      outcome - attachment security - at week 12 (end of treatment) and week 33 (end of follow up).

    <measure>Maternal Reflective Functioning coded using the Parent Development Interview</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline in reflective functioning at 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>A one hour semi-structured interview that asks mothers to describe episodes with their child that typically require the capacity for reflective functioning. The interview is coded by a rater blind to all information about the mother and her treatment assignment. The protocol is assigned a score on a scale from -1 to 9 where higher scores indicate a better capacity for reflective functioning. A score of 5 indicates average reflective functioning and a score of 3 and lower represents absence of the capacity.</description>

    <description>Maternal behavior is observed during a 5 minute interaction with the target child during which they explore a set of novel toys together. Maternal Sensitivity Scale includes 12 items that are rated on a 5 point scale by a trained coder who is blind to treatment assignment and all other information about the mother-child dyad. The score range is 1 to 5 where a score of 2 and below indicates clinically significant problems and a score of 3 and higher is considered average to above average sensitivity.</description>

    <measure>Child Attachment coded during the Strange Situation Paradigm (SSP)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline in child attachment status at 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The SSP is an experimental paradigm designed to activate attachment-based stress in the child during a series of separations and reunions with mother. The assessment takes approximately 30 minutes to complete and is rated by a trained coder who is blind to treatment assignment and all other information about the mother-child dyad (except information about known disabilities in the child). The child receives a classification of Secure, Insecure-Avoidant, Insecure-Resistant or Disorganized. The ideal classification is Secure and the most clinically significant classification is Disorganized.</description>

    <time_frame>Change from baseline in risk for relapse at 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Addiction and Child Welfare Questionnaire is a 12 item scale that we developed to assess maternal risk for relapse. Nine items ask about recent substance use and cravings and 3 items ask about child custody status (a potential trigger for relapse). Items are rated on a binary scale and scores can range from 0 to 24 with higher scores representing higher risk for/incidence of relapse. There is no established clinical cut off for the scale.</description>
