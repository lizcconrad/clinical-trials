      A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled multicenter study evaluating the safety and
      efficacy of Rituximab (Mabthera®) in patients with new onset generalized myasthenia gravis
      (MG).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Myasthenia gravis (MG) is an autoimmune disease of the neuromuscular junction caused by
      auto-antibodies. MG is characterized by weakness in skeletal muscles and occurs in all ages,
      but mostly among young adult women and in people of both sexes over the age of 60 years. The
      disease has a wide variation in severity, where in milder cases only symptom-relieving
      choline esterase blockers may be sufficient. In many cases, however, immunomodulatory drugs
      are required. Traditionally MG has been treated with high doses of corticosteroids over
      longer time periods, which causes significant risks of side effects. Therefore, since several
      decades, oral immunosuppressive drugs have been used in order to reduce the need for
      steroids. This group includes azathioprine, cyclosporine and mycophenolate. However, none of
      these drugs has been approved for use in MG and the effect is usually delayed. There is thus
      a great need to develop newer treatment algorithms for MG, for example including more
      effective biological drugs. Several small observational studies have shown that rituximab, an
      anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody that eliminate B cells, can have good effects in treatment
      refractory MG. The aim of the present study is to study the effect of rituximab compared to
      placebo in the treatment of new onset MG of moderate to severe symptomatology.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients with oculobulbar, bulbar or generalized MG ≥ 18 years of age and with onset
             of generalized symptoms or neurophysiological detection of generalized disease not
             more than 12 months ago.

          2. The diagnosis of MG should be determined with the following:

             Clinical neurological status with motor symptoms consistent with MG and at least two
             of the following:

             a positive serologic test for anti-acetylcholine receptor antibody (AChR) and/or b.
             typical MG findings on neurophysiological testing of neuromuscular transmission with
             single fiber electromyography (SFEMG) and / or repetitive nerve stimulation (RNS), and
             / or c. Positive anti-choline esterase-test, e.g. edrophoniumchloride or improvement
             of MG symptoms with oral cholinesterase inhibitors as judged by the treating
             physician.

          3. MGFA Class II to IV at screening.

          4. Quantitative MG score ≥ 6 at screening

          5. Women of childbearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test.

          6. Patients must have provided written informed consent.

          7. Patients must be able and willing to comply with all study procedures.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Weakness only affecting ocular or periocular muscles (MGFA Class I).

          2. MG crisis at screening (MGFA Class V)

          3. Thymectomy already carried out. In order to avoid difficulties to evaluate the effect
             of the study drug, thymectomy, where it is indicated, should be scheduled to the
             follow-up period, ie after the first 24 weeks.

          4. Strong suspicion of thymoma, where thymectomy as judged by the treating physician
             should be done within 24 weeks.

          5. Active malignancy, if not adequately treated

          6. Pregnancy or breast-feeding.

          7. Ongoing acute or chronic viral or systemic bacterial infections including HIV, latent
             hepatitis B, which is clinically significant, according to the study doctor's opinion
             and not treated with appropriate antibiotic / antiviral drugs.

          8. Severe heart failure (New York Heart Association Class IV) or severe, uncontrolled
             cardiac disease

          9. Previous use of immunosuppressive drugs, including rituximab, except prednisolone at a
             dose of up to 40mg daily for less than 3 months. This does not apply to treatment with
             immunosuppressive drugs / corticosteroids (except rituximab) for other indications
             than MG, provided at least 12 months have passed since treatment was terminated.

         10. Suspected hypersensitivity to the study drug

         11. Participation in another trial of study drug within 30 days prior to screening.

         12. Any medical condition which, according to the study physician's opinion, may interfere
             with the patient's participation in the study, poses additional risks for the patient,
             or that complicate the assessment of patients.

         13. Vaccination within 4 weeks before inclusion.
