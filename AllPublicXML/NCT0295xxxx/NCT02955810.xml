  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a Phase Ib open label, single arm, adaptive multicentre trial. Patients with
      newly diagnosed Multiple Myeloma (MM) will be treated with
      Cyclophosphamide-Bortezomib-Dexamethasone (CyBorD) in combination with Daratumumab (DARA).

      The safety profile of daratumumab to date, which does not appear to overlap with those known
      for approved agents, combined with its distinct MoA, suggest that the therapeutic profile of
      daratumumab combined with various backbone regimens may improve the treatment effect of these
      regimens. Additionally, daratumumab as a single agent may prolong the progression free
      interval for these patients. Based on the potential for cyclophosphamide to enhance ADCP,
      there is a strong rationale to combine DARA with a cyclophosphamide, bortezomib containing
      regimen. This will be the first clinical trial to explore the feasibility of combining
      daratumumab with a cyclophosphamide containing backbone induction regimen and if successful
      will provide the rationale for larger studies exploring the efficacy of this combination in
      greater detail.

      The study will consist of 2 phases:

        -  The Screening Phase will extend up to 28 days prior to Cycle 1, Day 1.

        -  The Treatment Phase will be conducted in 2 parts and will extend from Cycle 1 Day 1
           until treatment discontinuation.

      Treatment Phase, Part 1: Induction/Transplantation/Consolidation Phase. The consolidation
      phase of treatment will begin approximately 30-60 days after Autologous Stem Cell
      Transplantation (ASCT), when the patient has recovered sufficiently and engraftment is
      complete.

      Treatment Phase, Part 2: Maintenance Phase treatment until a maximum duration of 2 years,
      documented disease progression, death, loss to follow-up, or withdrawal of consent, whichever
      occurs first.

          -  Patients who are women of child-bearing potential or male partners of women of
             childbearing potential must agree to use adequate contraception methods from signing
             of the informed consent form until at least 4 months after the last study drug
             administration.

          -  Childbearing potential is defined as any woman who has not undergone a hysterectomy or
             bilateral oophorectomy; or has not been naturally post-menopausal for at least 12
             consecutive months (i.e. has had menses at any time in the preceding 12 consecutive
             months). The investigator or a designated associate is required to advise the patient
             how to achieve adequate birth control. Highly effective contraception is defined in
             the study as methods that achieve a failure rate of less than 1% per year when used
             consistently and correctly. Such methods include: combined (oestrogen and progestogen
             containing) hormonal contraception associated with inhibition of ovulation (oral,
             intravaginal, transdermal) progestogen-only hormonal contraception associated with
             inhibition of ovulation (oral, injectable and implantable), intrauterine device (IUD),
             intrauterine hormone -releasing system (IUS), bilateral tubal occlusion, successfully
             vasectomised partner and sexual abstinence. In addition, the use of condoms by
             patients or their partners is required unless the woman has had a hysterectomy.
             Contraception will start 4 weeks before the start of therapy, will continue during
             therapy including dose interruptions and for 4 months after the last dose of any
             component of the treatment regimen.

          -  A woman of childbearing potential must have 2 negative serum or urine pregnancy tests
             at Screening, first within 10 to 14 days prior to first dose and the second within 24
             hours prior to first dose.

          -  Patient must be willing and able to adhere to the prohibitions and restrictions
             specified in this protocol.

             significance, or smoldering multiple myeloma. Monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined
             significance is defined by presence of serum M-protein &lt; 3g/dl; absence of criteria
             consistent with active/symptomatic multiple myeloma as per IMWG criteria. Smoldering
             multiple myeloma is defined as asymptomatic multiple myeloma with absence of related

             changes).

          -  Patient is known or suspected of not being able to comply with the study protocol
             (e.g. because of alcoholism, drug dependency, or psychological disorder). Patient has
