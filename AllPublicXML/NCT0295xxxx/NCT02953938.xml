  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase IV, randomized, open-label, active-controlled, 2-arm, multicenter study. The
      primary objective will be assessed by the difference in the mean number of ranibizumab
      injections applied up to Month 11 between the 2 treatment arms. Patients will be randomized
      in a 1:1 ratio to 1 of the 2 treatment arms; i.e. Arm 1 ranibizumab monotherapy, Arm 2
      ranibizumab with Grid&amp;Direct short pulse laser photocoagulation combination therapy. There
      will be 3 periods in this study: Screening Period (visit 1), Treatment Period (visit 2 to
      Visit 13) and Follow-up Period (visit 14). In addition to screening and Baseline (visit 2),
      there will be monthly visits from Month 1 to Month 12. This study will include male and
      female patients (≥20 years old) diagnosed with visual impairment due to ME secondary to BRVO.
      Assuming an approximate 20% drop out rate, approximately 70 patients will need to be screened
      to have at least 56 patients found eligible and commencing treatment in the trial.

    <description>Adverse events will be presented separately by site (non-ocular, study eye, fellow eye).
