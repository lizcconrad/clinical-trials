      Background.Although the life expectancy of patients with FL has recently increased, notably
      since the introduction of rituximab in combination with chemotherapy, little is known
      regarding the precise causes of patients death. Patients and methods'. This study describes
      the different causes of death in FL patients among followed since 2000 at Lyon University
      Hospital, centre Léon Bérard and Mayo Clinic. The causes of death will be classified as
      related to lymphoma progression, treatment-related toxicity (including TRM and secondary
      myelodysplastic syndrome/acute myeloid leukemia), secondary neoplasias, or other.

        This retrospective analysis was performed in 3 reference center where patients were treated
        and regularly followed for FL between January 2000 and December 2015. All patients were
        initially staged according to the conventional recommendations, including a clinical
        examination and blood tests, a bone marrow biopsy, and a computerized tomography body scan.
        The treatment modalities have evolved over time and were chosen according to the
        institutional guidelines.
