  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Iodinated contrast media are now frequently used in diagnostic imaging exams, including
      pediatrics.

      In adults, the acute renal failure (ARF) associated with contrast agents (CA-AKI) occur in
      3-33% of exposed patients, especially as the patient is fragile, has comorbidities or
      pre-existing renal aggression .

      In children, the prevalence of this little known disease is probably underestimated.

      The investigators intend to conduct a prospective epidemiological study, to estimate the
      impact of the acute renale failure to iodinated contrast agents in pediatrics.

      Patients will be included those of pediatric emergencies, Hospitalization Unit of Short
      Duration pediatric, pediatric intensive care and pediatric resuscitation. The acute renale
      failure will be estimated on the basis of criteria KDIGO (score of kidney disease) group in
      2012 to 48 hours a computed tomography (CT) scan with injection of contrast media, based on a
      change in creatinine clearance of the estimated according to the formula Schwartz revised in
      2009 and / or diuresis.

      Patient characteristics will be identified in order to establish risk factors.

    <description>Patients under 16 years old and must pass a CT scan with iodinated contrast agents.

    <description>Before the CT scan, the investigators with iodinated contrast agents, the following data will be collected in the medical record: creatinine prior to injection, comorbidities and child characteristics, associated treatments and risk factors of acute renal failure, as well as the injection pattern.
After the CT scan the investigators will collect the characteristics of the injection type, osmolarity and volume of contrast used and the appearance of a possible allergic reaction.
Then 24 and 48 hours and day 7 will collect serum creatinine, urine output and vital replacement therapies may be necessary.</description>
