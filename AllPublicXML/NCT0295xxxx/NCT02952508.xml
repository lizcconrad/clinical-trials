      This study evaluates CLR 131 in patients with select B-cell malignancies (multiple myeloma(
      MM), indolent chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL)/small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL),
      lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma (LPL), marginal zone lymphoma (MZL), mantle cell lymphoma (MCL),
      and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) who have been previously treated with standard
      therapy for their underlying malignancy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      B-cell malignancies represent a diverse collection of diseases and, taken together, make up
      the majority of hematologic malignancies. B-cell lymphomas represent the largest percentage
      of these neoplasms, and the relapsed and/or refractory B-cell lymphomas have proven very
      difficult to treat. Success rate, defined as complete or partial response, is as low as 2% to
      4% in many of these diseases, and they remain an area of a significant unmet medical need.

      CLR 131 is a radioiodinated therapeutic that exploits the selective uptake and retention of
      phospholipid ethers (PLEs) by malignant cells. Cellectar Biosciences' novel cancer-targeted
      small-molecule compound (CLR1404) is radiolabeled with the isotope iodine-131 (I-131).
      Radioiodinated CLR1404 has been evaluated in over 60 xenograft and spontaneous (transgenic)
      tumor models. In all but two cases of hepatocellular carcinoma, CLR1404 demonstrated
      selective cancer cell uptake and retention. In various rodent tumor models, CLR 131 has also
      demonstrated tumor growth delay and prolongation of survival.

      Based on the critical unmet medical need for effective agents with novel mechanisms of action
      in B-cell malignancies, the radiosensitivity of these cancers, and initial preclinical and
      clinical experience with radioiodinated CLR1404, Cellectar Biosciences has chosen to assess
      CLR 131 in a phase 2 trial.
