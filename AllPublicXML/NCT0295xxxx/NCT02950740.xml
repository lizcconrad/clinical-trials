  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Food intake pattern and lifestyle are associated with the nutritional status and intestinal
      microbiota composition, and such factors are important for the proper growth and development
      during early childhood, as well as for the health throughout life. This cross-sectional and
      multicenter study will include a total of 200 children aged between 1-3 years, enrolled in
      early childhood public schools from different regions of Brazil (Santo André, Uberaba, Porto
      Alegre and Natal). Data on birth and gestational history will be collected in a form.
      Nutritional status will be assessed by determining the weight and height, with subsequent
      calculations and classification of nutritional indices. A single blood sample will be
      collected to investigate the blood levels of vitamins A and D, iron, calcium, alkaline
      phosphatase and zinc, and feces will be collected for intestinal microbiota analysis. Food
      intake will be assessed by direct weighing of food in 2 non-consecutive days. Considering the
      importance of a well-balanced diet and its effects on the child's growth, development and
      intestinal colonization, this study purpose is to investigate potential associations among
      food intake, nutritional status and intestinal microbiota of early childhood infants from
      four regions of Brazil.

      It is a cross-sectional and multicenter study to examine two hundred children aged between
      1-3 years, duly enrolled under full-time regimen in public schools of the cities of Santo
      André (SP), Uberaba (MG), Porto Alegre (RS) and Natal (RN). The Principal Site of study will
      be Fundação de Medicina do ABC, located in the city of Santo André, while Universidade
      Federal do Triângulo Mineiro, Universidade Federal of Ciências da Saúde de Porto Alegre and
      Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Norte will be the other Sites. For such purpose, fifty
      children from each Early Childhood Public School will be screened according to the inclusion
      criteria and invited to participate in the study. Each State may include more than one
      Institution, if required to reach the total number of children established previously.

      After the authorization and signature of the Informed Consent Form - ICF - (Attachment I) are
      given by the mother or legal responsible, such person must go to the Institution on the
      scheduled date for the collection of a blood sample and to deliver of a stool sample,
      collected as per prior orientation. The interviewer shall complete a questionnaire to obtain
      information on the birth and gestational history and current information on the child. A
      single blood sample will be collected for analysis of vitamins A and D, calcium, iron,
      ferritin, hemoglobin, zinc, selenium, alkaline phosphatase and lipids (cholesterol - total
      and fractions - and triglycerides), and a stool sample will be collected for analysis of
      parasites and microbiota in the feces.
