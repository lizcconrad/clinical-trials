  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this investigation is to confirm the results obtained in a pilot study
      showing that certain radiological parameters based on computed tomography (CT) scans seem to
      reliably detect posterior ligament complex (PLC) injury without the need for Magnetic
      Resonance Imaging (MRI)

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Integrity of posterior ligament complex (PLC) has an important bearing on the treatment
      strategies for thoracolumbar (TL) fractures. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is the gold
      standard to confirm PLC injury. The routine use of MRI has its limitations especially since
      in most trauma centers MRI is not the primary assessment for TL fractures due to reduced
      availability, increased cost and its adverse applicability in trauma setting and in case of a
      polytrauma. In contrast computed tomography (CT) scans are an integral part of trauma
      evaluation protocols, are accurate in spine fracture diagnosis and are performed in less
      time, making them suitable to assess polytrauma scenarios. In a recent pilot study, a number
      of radiological parameters based on CT scans have shown to reliably detect PLC injury when
      compared to MRI. The aim of the study is to reconfirm and validate these CT based parameters
      to assess PLC injury compared to MRI.

    <measure>Sensitivity of Local kyphosis (LK) and/or Inter-spinous distanceI (SD)</measure>
    <time_frame>CT scans, MRI and x-rays were taken on admission into hospital after the patient got a thoracolumbar fracture. These images will be retrospectively analyzed (eligible images are from the date of the fracture up to 3 days after the event).</time_frame>
    <description>Sensitivity of LK and/or ISD Is defined as the proportion of patients with PLC injury correctly diagnosed by an increase in LK and/or ISD difference compared to MRI. The Specificity si defined as the proportion of patients with PLC injury correctly diagnosed by an increase in LK and/or ISD difference compared to MRI. The gold standard is a diagnostic test and it is the best accepted test that is assumed to be able to determine the true disease state. It is considered as the reference method or the best test available.</description>
