  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the effects of tDCS in combination with TUS for the
      treatment of pain and functional limitations in subjects with NSCLBP. The investigators
      hypothesize that there will be a decrease in pain levels with active stimulation, when
      compared to sham stimulation.

    <description>Changes in Mechanical Temporal Summation (TS) will be measured in order to determine whether anodal transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) in conjunction with transcranial ultrasound (TUS) (applied in a diagnostic mode) is effective in reducing pain of subjects with non-specific chronic low back pain.</description>

    <time_frame>Measured for approximately 2 months</time_frame>
    <description>The investigators will ask patients to stand unsupported on a force platform on one foot with eyes open while looking straight ahead with hands on hips for up to 30 seconds in order to measure if there are changes in balance from the beginning of the study to the end.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Trunk Mobility Test</measure>
    <time_frame>Measured for approximately 2 months</time_frame>
    <description>The investigators will ask patients to stand with their feet shoulder-width apart and flex and extend their trunk repeatedly as fast as they comfortably can in order to measure if there are any changes in range-of-motion, angular velocity of spine movements, correlation peak and lag between hips and spine movements from the beginning of the study to the end.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in Quality of Life</measure>
    <time_frame>Measured for approximately 2 months</time_frame>
    <description>The investigators will use the National Institute of Health Chronic Low Back Pain Recommended Minimum Dataset (NIH CLBP RMD), Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (29-PROMIS Short Form) instrument, and the Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) to assess changes in quality of life and functionality.</description>
