    <textblock>
      In this study,the eligible breast cancer patients will be randomized divided into two groups.
      the study group receive the accelerated hypo-fractioned whole breast irradiation with a
      concurrent boost to the tumor bed (WBI 2.5Gy x18 and SIB 2.88Gy x18) and the control group
      receive conventional fractioned whole breast irradiation with a concurrent boost to the tumor
      bed(WBI 1.8Gy x28 and SIB 2.15Gy x28). All radiotherapy will be delivered by external
      beam-intensity modulated radiotherapy. the purpose of this study is to assess whether the
      accelerated hypo-fractioned is non-inferior to the conventional fractionated radiotherapy.
      The outcomes evaluation will include acute toxicity , late toxicity including breast fibrosis
      and cardiac disease, cosmetic outcome ,local control and survival outcome.
