  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Encephalopathies are a group of central nervous system (CNS) affection with heterogeneous
      etiology. Several causes have been recognized including neurodegenerative, vascular,
      infectious, autoimmune, toxic or allergic affections or secondary to systemic disorders.
      While 30-50% of acute encephalitis remains without etiological definition, definitive
      criteria for neurodegenerative diseases are usually unavailable in vivo and possible or
      probable definitions are used. The Olfactory mucosa (OM) is the part of the nasal mucosa that
      carries the specialized sensory organ for the modality of smell; the olfactory epithelium is
      composed of five principal cell types including olfactory receptor neurons. A sample of OM
      may be collected through a rhinoscopy-guided brushing: it is well-accepted by patients,
      not-contraindicated in patients with raised intracranial pressure and associated with almost
      no side-effects. Nasal brushing has recently been proposed for the in vivo diagnosis of
      Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD).

      Aims of the project are:

        1. Training of ear throat and nose (ETN), Infectious disease (ID) and neurology (NEU)
           specialists in the technique of nasal brushing;

        2. Conducting a prospective study comparing the use of nasal brushing with gold-standard
           criteria in the diagnosis of Encephalopathies;

        3. Increasing the diagnostic and prognostic power in the diagnosis of encephalopathies.

      A prospective, case control, multicentric study enrolling 400 patients and 100 controls
      (patients with nasal stenosis undergoing rhinoscopy for clinical reasons). Patients will be
      diagnosed and followed according to international guidelines and local clinical practice.
      Cerebrospinal fluid and magnetic resonance imaging will be used, where indicated, for the
      diagnosis according to the clinical or radiological suspect.

    <description>Nasal brushing will be performed in non-sedated patients as follows. After administration of a local vasoconstrictor (1% epinephrine) with the use of a nasal tampon, inserted into the nasal cavity of the patient to locate the olfactory mucosa lining the nasal vault. A sterile, disposable brush (&quot;Copanflock&quot;, &quot;Copan&quot;, Brescia, Italy) will be inserted gently rolled on the mucosal surface, withdrawn,and immersed in 0.9% saline solution, UTM (Universal Transporter Medium) or 4% formaldehyde. Two swabs will be collected for each nostril.</description>
