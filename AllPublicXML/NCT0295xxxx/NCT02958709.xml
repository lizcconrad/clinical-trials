  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this open-labeled, randomized clinical trial, the Investigator will assess the safety and
      pharmacokinetics (PK) of model-optimized doses of rifampicin (RIF) with or without
      levofloxacin (LEVO) given to children as part of multidrug treatment for tuberculous
      meningitis (TBM) versus standard treatment. The Investigators will also assess functional and
      neurocognitive outcomes by treatment group, as measured by the Pediatric Modified Rankin
      Score (MRS) and the Mullen Scales of Early Learning (MSEL), respectively.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Open-label, randomized clinical trial in three treatment groups. Patients with probable or
      definite TB meningitis (TBM) will all receive isoniazid and pyrazinamide at standard doses
      for 8 weeks. Arm 1 participants will receive high-dose rifampicin plus ethambutol (EMB) at
      standard doses for 8 weeks. Arm 2 participants will receive high-dose rifampicin plus
      levofloxacin for 8 weeks. Arm 3 participants will receive rifampicin plus ethambutol at
      standard doses for 8 weeks (control arm). Patients will be screened to confirm TBM diagnosis,
      will receive 8 weeks of study treatment, and then will receive isoniazid (INH)/rifampicin for
      an additional 40 weeks, to complete 12 months of TBM treatment. All participants will receive
      oral steroids. PK sampling will be performed within first week and 6 (+/- 2) weeks following
      treatment initiation. Participants will have scheduled follow-up visits to assess safety and
      clinical status. In addition, functional and neurocognitive outcomes up to 18 months
      following treatment initiation will be assessed. Interim PK and safety analyses will be
      performed to ensure dosing is producing predefined PK targets and safety is acceptable. It is
      anticipated that a majority of children will be hospitalized for the initial 2-8 weeks of the
      study.

          -  Since participants will all be under legal age of independent consent, a parent or
             legal guardian must be willing and able to provide informed consent. If the subject is
             of appropriate age, she/he will also be asked to give assent if developmentally

          -  Participant can comply with the protocol requirements in the opinion of the site
             investigator.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  TB treatment for &gt; 7 days

          -  Exposure via close contact with someone with multi drug resistant TB (MDR-TB) (or
             rifampicin mono-resistant TB) or personal history of MDR-TB (or rifampicin
             mono-resistant TB)

          -  Known intolerance or allergy to any of the study drugs

          -  Death imminent and expected within 24 hours, as assessed by the site investigator

          -  Moderate to severe renal or liver dysfunction (Grade 2 or higher abnormalities of
             creatinine, alanine aminotransferase (ALT), or direct bilirubin)

          -  HIV infection with any of the following:

        Planned initiation of antiretroviral treatment (ART) during the experimental treatment
        phase (first 8 weeks), as initiation of ART is contraindicated in that time period with
        TBM.

        On ART with planned continued use of a protease inhibitor or nevirapine (children can be
        switched to an acceptable alternative regimen and then participate)

          -  Having participated in other clinical studies with investigational agents or
             treatments within 8 weeks prior to enrollment.

          -  A clinically significant active medical condition or the presence of any concomitant
             severe illness or rapidly deteriorating health condition (outside of TB), which, in
             the opinion of the site investigator, would prevent appropriate participation in the
             trial, or that would make implementation of the protocol or interpretation of the
             study results difficult, or otherwise make the subject a poor candidate for a clinical
             trial.
