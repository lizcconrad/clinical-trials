    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the clinical response to autologous bone marrow
      aspirate concentrate (BMAC) and platelet-rich plasma (PRP) injections for knee osteoarthritis
      with respect to pain, function, and quality of life at up to 1 year following the
      intervention. Specifically, the clinical response will be compared to baseline and a control
      group treated with a Gel-One® hyaluronate injection to the target knee.
