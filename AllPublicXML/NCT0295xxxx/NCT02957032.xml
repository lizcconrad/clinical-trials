      Phase I, open label, non-randomized, multicenter, prospective dose escalation study of F16IL2
      in combination with very low-dose cytarabine in subjects with acute myeloid leukemia relapse
      after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (alloHSCT).

      The aim of the study is to determine a recommended dose for F16IL2 in AML relapse after
      alloHSCT and investigating the toxicity of the combination regimen.

      Patients will be enrolled sequentially in cohorts and treated at different dose levels of
      F16IL2 and a fixed dose of cytarabine. All patients first receive an initial run-in dose of
      30 Mio IU of F16IL2 on day 1 and escalating doses of F16IL2 on day 1, 8, 15 and 22. Patients
      will be treated with cytarabine (5 mg twice daily s.c. for 10 days). The following F16IL2
      administration will be at the dose of the respective cohort (days 8, 15 and 22).

      The RD will be defined following a traditional 3+3 design. The dose escalation will continue
      until the MTD is found, that is until at least two patients among a cohort of three to six
      patients experience a dose limiting toxicity (DLT) (i.e., &gt;33 % of patients with a DLT). The
      RD is defined as the dose level just below the MTD level. If the MTD is not found at cohort 5
      the RD for this study will be considered equal to the cohort 5 dosage.

         17. Presence of active and uncontrolled infections or other severe concurrent disease,
             which, in the opinion of the investigator, would place the patient at undue risk or
             interfere with the study.

         18. Known active or latent tuberculosis (TB).

         19. Concurrent malignancies other than AML (except basal cell or squamous cell carcinoma
             of the skin or carcinoma in situ of the cervix or breast) unless the patient has been
