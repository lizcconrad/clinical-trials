  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Nearly 8 000 new cervical cancer cases are diagnosed in South Africa per year; many are still
      undiagnosed and about 50% of diagnosed cases succumb per year. Although the current
      prevalence of pre-cancer cervical disease is largely unknown, data from local studies suggest
      regional differences and an increase in the prevalence of cytological abnormalities when
      compared with historical data. Low frequency in cytology screening is the primary factor
      attributable to development of invasive cervical cancer and almost one-third of all cervical
      cancer patients had previous negative cytology. Due to the low sensitivity of cytology it can
      be assumed that the true prevalence of pre-cancer disease is underestimated by all available
      data. One round of optimal cervical cytology will detect around 50% of existing pre-cancer
      cervical disease as identified and proven using colposcopy and directed biopsy. It is now
      widely accepted that primary screening with a human papilloma virus (HPV) test can improve
      the sensitivity of screening and that even a single round of HPV screening can rapidly reduce
      the incidence of invasive cervical cancer and related mortality within a few years.

      South Africa has a high prevalence of HIV infection and a delay in or failure to initiate
      antiretroviral therapy (ART). These facts, together with the largely unscreened status of the
      female population and the high incidence of cervical cancer all suggest that HPV infection
      and precursors to cervical cancer are both unusually common among South African women.
      Accurate current knowledge of the performance of newer generation HPV based screening tests
      in HIV-infected and general female population are essential for cost-analysis and planning
      for national prevention and screening programs. This study will aim to demonstrate the
      feasibility and efficacy of new generation HPV deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) based screening
      assays in a South African setting.

      The investigators hypothesize that HPV testing followed by normal and special cytology tests
      will be a successful screening model for a South African population.

        This is a multicentric study carried out in South Africa. Women with unknown HIV status
        will be recruited from the general population, and HIV positive women from adult
        antiretroviral treatment (ART) clinics.
