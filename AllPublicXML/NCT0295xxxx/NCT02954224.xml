    <textblock>
      Delirium is a common complication in elderly patients following surgery. Patients who develop
      delirium after surgery are at increased risk for serious complications, and even death.This
      multi-centre randomized controlled trial will enroll elderly patients scheduled for elective
      hip/knee replacement surgery.The objective of this trial is to identify obstructive sleep
      apnea using ApneaLink Air and to determine whether auto-titrating CPAP treatment of
      obstructive sleep apnea will decrease the incidence of post-operative delirium in elderly
      patients undergoing elective hip and knee replacement surgery.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Delirium is an acute and fluctuating change in cognitive function, characterized by poor
      attention and disorganized thinking. Recent studies show that patients with obstructive sleep
      apnea (OSA) - a sleep disorder characterized by repeated episodes of complete or partial
      blockage of the upper airway - are at greater risk to develop delirium. It is estimated that
      43% of men and 27% of women aged 50-70 years old have OSA. Elderly individuals with this
      condition are often undiagnosed. Unrecognized OSA may be a treatable cause of postoperative
      delirium. However, timely access to polysomnography is usually not possible prior to surgery.
      This multi-centre randomized controlled trial will enroll elderly patients scheduled for
      elective hip/knee replacement surgery. All participants who have given the consent to
      participate will be assessed risks of OSA and comorbidity by 3 basic questionnaires-
      STOP-Bang, Epworth Sleepiness Scale and Charlson Comorbidity index, Cognitive level assess by
      Mini-Cog and baseline delirium assessment by CAM. STOP-Bang questionnaire is the validated
      questionnaire to screen the patients for OSA. Score of 3 or higher has sensitivity of
      detecting OSA of 93% and 100% for moderate and severe OSA respectively. If participant has
      STOP-Bang score 3 or higher will have a home sleep study with the ApneaLink Air and overnight
      oximetry. Patients identified to have OSA(AHI â‰¥10/h) will be randomized to 1) Auto-titrating
      continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) applied 1-3 nights before surgery (if possible)
      and during day/night sleep for 72 hrs after surgery or 2) Control group - routine care. All
      patients will be evaluated for delirium for 72h after surgery.
