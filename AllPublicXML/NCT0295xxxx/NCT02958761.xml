      Primary aim of this trial was to assess efficacy three intraarticular injections of platelet
      lysate when compared to hyaluronic acid. Additional objectives were to compare the treatment
      groups in terms of a number of functional scales and of number of adverse events.

      Intra-articular injections of hyaluronic acid are effective in improving symptoms and slow
      disease progression, but are not able to revert the damage mechanism and trigger cartilage
      healing.

      Growth factors included in PRP could stimulate cartilage repair, normalize synovial fluid
      viscoelasticity, induce a correction in tissue damage, improve articular function, control
      pain and ameliorate quality of life.

      Primary aim of this trial was to assess, among patients with grade II/III osteoarthrosis of
      the knee, efficacy (as determined by improvement at MRI 6 months after the first injection)
      of three intraarticular injections of platelet lysate when compared to hyaluronic acid.
      Additional objectives were to compare the treatment groups in terms of a number of functional
      scales (WOMAC, Lysholm, Tegner Knee, Scale, AKS, Lequesne, VAS) and of number of adverse
      events.

    <description>Patients in the intervention group will receive three autologous PRP plus calcium gluconate (as activator) intraarticular injections at 4-week intervals. Briefly, at the Immunohaematology and Transfusion Service, on each scheduled visit 20 ml of autologous whole blood will be sampled from each patient, 2 ml ACD-A will be added directly the syringe as anticoagulant; finally the vial will be gently centrifuged at 900rpm for 7 minutes. Platelet-rich plasma was collected. The PRP vials plus activator will be immediately shipped to the rehabilitation unit, where intraarticular injection will be performed by an experienced physiatrist.</description>
