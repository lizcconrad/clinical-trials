      This partially randomized phase I/II trial studies the best dose and side effects of
      recombinant human EGF-rP64K/montanide ISA 51 vaccine (CIMAvax) and nivolumab and to see how
      well they work in treating patients with stage III-IV non-small cell lung cancer. Vaccine
      therapy, such as CIMAvax vaccine may help slow down and stop tumor growth. Monoclonal
      antibodies, such as nivolumab, may block a protein needed by tumor cells to grow and spread.
      Giving CIMAvax vaccine together with nivolumab may work better in treating patients with
      stage IIIB-IV non-small cell lung cancer.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To identify the maximum dose of CIMAvax in combination with nivolumab based on dose
      limiting toxicities (DLTs) as assessed by Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events
      version 4.03 (CTCAE v4.03). (Phase I) II. To examine the effect of the dose and the dosing
      intervals (starting in the expansion phase of the maximum tolerated dose) on antibody titers
      when CIMAvax is combined with nivolumab in the second-line therapy of advanced non-small cell
      lung cancer (NSCLC). (Phase I) III. To evaluate the 12-month overall survival of CIMAvax
      combined with nivolumab in patients with advanced NSCLC. (Phase II)

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES I. To assess the toxicity of CIMAvax combined with nivolumab using the
      Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program (CTEP) National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology
      Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE version 4.03). (Phase I) II. Determine the preliminary
      efficacy of the study combination utilizing immune-related Response Evaluation Criteria in
      Solid Tumors (irRECIST) guidelines. (Phase I) III. To evaluate progression free survival
      (PFS) for the combination of CIMAvax and nivolumab in patients with advanced NSCLC. (Phase
      II) IV. To assess the toxicity of CIMAvax combined with nivolumab using the CTEP NCI Common
      Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE version 4.03). (Phase II)

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To conduct correlative studies comparing blood EGF levels, platelet levels, markers of
      immune response and functionality of antibody response. (Phase I) II. To examine the
      association of EGFR (total and activated), PD-1 and PD-L1 expression and mutations in tumor
      tissue with biomarkers of genetic and immune response. (Phase I and II) III. Comparison of
      response assessment criteria for a prospective analysis (irRECIST response assessment versus
      [vs.] immune-related Response Criteria [irRC] vs. RECIST 1.1). (Phase I and II) IV. To
      characterize the blood EGF levels and other blood-based biomarkers of patients censored from
      the trial because of low titer response. (Phase II)

      OUTLINE: This is a phase I dose escalation study of CIMAvax followed by a phase II study.

      PHASE I: Patients receive CIMAvax intramuscularly (IM) and nivolumab intravenously (IV) over
      60 minutes on day 1. Courses repeat every 2 weeks in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity. Within 4 weeks after the 4th dose, patients receive CIMAvax IM at the
      same time as the next nivolumab dose.

      MAINTENANCE PHASE I: Patients with antibody titer &lt; 1:4000 and who do not experience a DLT
      receive CIMAvax every 4 weeks and nivolumab every 2 weeks. Patients with antibody titer &gt;=
      1:4000 and who do not experience a DLT are randomized to 1 of 3 groups.

      GROUP A: Patients receive CIMAvax IM and nivolumab IV over 60 minutes. Courses repeat every 4
      weeks for CIMAvax and every 2 weeks for nivolumab in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      GROUP B: Patients receive CIMAvax IM and nivolumab IV over 60 minutes. Courses repeat every 8
      weeks for CIMAvax and every 2 weeks for nivolumab in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      GROUP C: Patients receive CIMAvax IM and nivolumab IV over 60 minutes. Courses repeat every
      12 weeks for CIMAvax and every 2 weeks for nivolumab in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 30 days for 120 days.
