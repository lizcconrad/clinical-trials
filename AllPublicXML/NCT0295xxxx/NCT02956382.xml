  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase I/II study in which patients will be enrolled in a standard 3+3 design. Once
      the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined amongst patients with relapsed or refractory
      grade 1-3a follicular lymphoma, there will be a 17-patient phase II study.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In vitro studies of ibrutinib and venetoclax have noted significant cytotoxicity and synergy
      in mantle cell lymphoma and chronic lymphocytic leukemia cell lines.Data have demonstrated
      synergy between the two agents in various other B-cell Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma (NHL) cell lines.
      The investigators theorize that the combination of ibrutinib and venetoclax will provide
      dual, yet unique, targeted inhibition for patients with follicular lymphoma, resulting in
      both significant efficacy and less nonspecific toxicity.
