      The objective of the PAIN-STOP trial is to assess the feasibility of a larger randomized
      controlled trial (RCT) evaluating NMDA antagonists and IV steroids, as compared to placebo,
      in decreasing the chances of clinically significant persistent post-surgical pain (PPSP)
      after video assisted thoracoscopic surgeries (VATS). This is a multi-centre randomized,
      controlled clinical trial with a 2 x 2 factorial design. The pilot phase of the trial will
      recruit 48 patients and follow them for 3 months. Patients will be randomized to one of four
      groups: 1) NMDA active + Steroid placebo; 2) Steroid active + NMDA placebo; 3) NMDA active +
      Steroid active; 4) NMDA placebo + Steroid placebo.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Persistent Post-Surgical Pain (PPSP) after Video Assisted Thoracic Surgery (VATS) lobectomy
      procedures is an important health problem for which there is no effective method of
      prevention. NMDA antagonists and steroids can modify pain signaling-sensitization pathways,
      and inflammatory-immune pathways, and hence can potentially prevent the development of PPSP.
      These agents have been safely used in thoracic surgeries to obtain many perioperative
      benefits, without increasing the harmful effects. Since these agents act by different
      biological mechanisms, it is appropriate to study their effects in a factorial design to
      increase the trial efficiency. Before conducting a large multicenter trial, we propose to
      establish the feasibility by carrying out this feasibility trial.

      hospital; day 8 and month 2 by a phone call; and in person follow-up visits at 30 days and 3
      months post-randomization; for patients who cannot attend in person, a telephone follow up
      will be done.
