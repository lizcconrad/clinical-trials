  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to assess the safety, tolerability and efficacy of cannabinoids mix
      [cannabidiol (CBD), Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) in a 20:1 ratio] for behavioral problems in
      children and youth with ASD.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Disruptive behaviors are very common in children and youth with autism spectrum disorder
      (ASD). Behavioral problems increase social impairment in children with ASD, make
      interventions more difficult and place considerable strain on families and caregivers.
      Current treatment is based on behavioral interventions combined with atypical antipsychotics
      which often have low tolerability and questionable efficacy.

      Cannabis exerts profound effects on human social behavior. Research using animal models of
      ASD indicate a possible dysregulation of the endocannabinoid system, and stress that it may
      be a novel target for pharmacological interventions. Anecdotal evidence suggest efficacy of
      various phytocannabinoids in resistant behavioral problems. However controlled human studies
      are lacking.

      Objective: To assess the safety, tolerability and efficacy of cannabinoids mix [cannabidiol
      (CBD), Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) in a 20:1 ratio] for behavioral problems in children and
      youth with ASD.

      Setting: A double blind randomized placebo-controlled trial with crossover. Methods: One
      hundred and fifty participants ages 5-21 years, with established ASD diagnosis and moderate
      to severe refractory behavioral problems will be treated with placebo and cannabinoids mix in
      a randomized cross-over trial. Each intervention period will be 12 weeks with additional 4
      weeks for gradual dose decrease and wash-out. Baseline evaluations will include: Autism
      diagnostic observation schedule (ADOS-2), Social Communication Questionnaire (SCQ), Vineland
      II (interview based), Childhood Autism Rating Scale (CARS-2, observation based). The primary
      outcome measure is Home Situations Questionnaire-Autism Spectrum Disorder (HSQ-ASD).
      Secondary outcome measures will include: Clinical Global Impression (CGI, improvement and
      efficacy index items, clinician-rated), Social Responsiveness Scale (SRS, parent and teacher
      rated) and Autism Parenting Stress Index (APSI). Adverse events will be taped every 4 weeks.

    <description>This is a 65 item, caregiver (pSRS) or teacher (tSRS) questionnaire, used to determine the severity of social deficit exhibited by participants with ASD. The SRS contains five subscales: Social Awareness, Social Cognition, Social Communication, Social Motivation, and Autistic Mannerisms, which respectively measure the ability to recognize social cues, the ability to interpret social cues, the ability to use expressive verbal and nonverbal language skills, the ability to engage in social-interpersonal behaviors, and the tendency to display stereotypical behaviors and restricted interests characteristic of autism</description>
