  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      With the development and application of biological agents, the treatment effect was
      considerable degree improvement on refractory corn's disease. However, there are quite a part
      of the CD patients lost response during treatment of using response. Moreover, due to various
      reasons, there still a lot limited on the using of biological agents in China, that make
      quite a part of the refractory CD patients lack of further medical treatment options. There
      has been a RCT study which prove that thalidomide effect and safety on treating refractory CD
      or who were lost response by using biological agents in Italy, but the object of study is
      only limited in children and adolescents. There are some small sample studies also confirmed
      the efficacy and safety on refractory corn's disease by using thalidomide, but need more RCT
      evidence.

      It will be divided two groups of patients by using randomized, double-blind. One group was
      treated by thalidomide, the other was placebo. It will be unlocked blind and analysis the
      effect and safety about thalidomide after 8 weeks. The second, patients still use thalidomide
      after unlock blind to prove its longtime treatment effect and safety.
