      The overall goal of this study is to compare how well motivational messages (text messages
      from the doctor's office), diabetes health coaches, and enhanced usual care with diabetes
      education materials (provided at the doctor's office) work to help African-American adults
      with uncontrolled diabetes improve their diabetes self-care decisions. Self-care is difficult
      when you have diabetes, especially when patients have other medical conditions, their
      diabetes is uncontrolled, and when they live in an area without many primary care doctors.
      Many studies have show that encouraging text messages from the doctor's office and health
      coaches can help people take better care of themselves. But before primary care clinics
      around the country start trying to send texts, hire health coaches, or provide additional
      educational materials it is critical for them to know which approach is more likely to help.

      This study will assign African-American diabetics to either text messages, health coaches, or
      enhanced care to find out which one works better. The investigators especially want to find
      out if one works better for people at highest risk. Lastly, the investigators want to find
      out if messages or coaches help people improve their blood sugar, quality of life, and their
      feelings about primary care.

      The study will test messages, coaches, and enhanced care side by side in primary care
      doctors' offices. The messaging and coaching programs will give patients pretty much the same
      information, but in different ways. The text messages will be written carefully based on each
      patient's needs and interests. The coaches will be trained in how to help people get
      motivated and work to reach their health goals.

      This study will include 1000 African-American adults, ages 35-75, with uncontrolled diabetes
      and one or more additional chronic condition, living in medically underserved communities.
      People will have to have a cell phone or smart phone with texting capability and be able to
      use it to participate. 400 participants will get messages, 400 will get coaches, and 200 will
      receive enhanced care.

      The investigators will be able to tell if messages and coaches work by seeing if people
      improve their diabetes self-care decisions, and if their blood sugar, quality of life, and
      feelings about primary care get better. The long-term study goal is to get primary care
      clinics all over the country to start using motivational messages or health coaches if they
      work well.

      Background and Significance: There is a critical need to determine the comparative
      effectiveness of text messaging (TM) and health coaching (HC) among African-Americans with
      uncontrolled diabetes and multiple chronic conditions living in medically underserved areas
      (MUA) and to identify which modality yields greater improvement in diabetes self-care at-risk
      urban and rural subpopulations. Although numerous recent studies demonstrate the
      effectiveness of either TM or HC in improving diabetes and other chronic disease self-care
      behaviors, and to the knowledge of the investigators no information is available regarding
      comparative effectiveness of these modalities in urban and rural subgroups. Prevalence of
      diabetes, related comorbidities, poverty, obesity, food insecurity, and tobacco use is higher
      in rural areas as compared with urban. Moreover, rural areas struggle to address these needs
      because of lower access to transportation, primary care, specialty care, diabetes education,
      and mental health resources. However, urban living has its own unique set of
      problems—including increased stress and fear for one's physical safety—that may impact the
      comparative effectiveness of HC and TM. Although there are HC studies that show effectiveness
      in interventions either in rural or urban areas, there are no HC studies of which the
      investigators are aware that specifically examine the differences in U.S. rural and urban
      participants in regards to engagement rates and clinical outcomes from a health coaching
      intervention. Similarly, telemedicine and mobile health approaches have been particularly
      advocated for rural populations yet little evidence supports their comparative benefit. The
      lack of comparative effectiveness of text messaging and health coaching for diabetes
      self-care in vulnerable urban and rural subgroups represents a critical gap in research that
      the study is designed to directly address. The study will compare both strategies with
      enhanced usual care (EC) with diabetes educational materials.

      Study Aims: As a result, this research will use a pragmatic randomized trial to determine the
      comparative effectiveness of patient-driven TM versus HC versus EC for African-American
      adults with uncontrolled diabetes and multiple chronic conditions in MUA with an emphasis on
      identifying and quantifying important interactions between key baseline characteristics and
      treatment arm. Specific aims include: Aim 1-Quantify the effectiveness of TM, HC, and EC in
      improving the primary outcome measures (diabetes self-care activities related to general
      diet, exercise and medication adherence); Aim 2-Determine the contributions of six key,
      baseline patient characteristics: 1) urban vs. rural residence, 2) health literacy, 3)
      medical complexity, 4) social complexity, 5) smart vs. cell phone ownership, and 6) age, to
      the comparative effectiveness of TM, HC, and EC; and Aim 3-Quantify the effectiveness of TM,
      HC, and EC in improving secondary outcomes of average blood sugar, quality of life, and
      primary care engagement. The long-term objectives are to disseminate and foster
      implementation of the results of this research in MUA nationwide to improve critical
      self-care supports in primary care for our most vulnerable populations.

      Overall study design: Pragmatic randomized clinical trial.

      Main components of the intervention and comparator(s): The study will test two critical
      strategies for patient engagement that may lead to substantive improvements in the quality of
      care and outcomes most important to vulnerable patients with diabetes: 1) patient-driven TM,
      and 2) patient-driven HC. The two parallel primary care-based and patient-driven study
      interventions (i.e. TM and HC) have been designed to provide approximately the same content,
      but with two alternative delivery mechanisms. TM will incorporate supportive cognitive
      behavioral strategies to encourage improved diabetes self-care decisions and will be tailored
      based on participant demographics, health literacy, preferences, treatment self-regulation,
      perceived competency and reported barriers to self-care. Motivational interviewing focused HC
      will aim to meet with participants for individual HC sessions bi-monthly the first 2 months
      (Intensive Phase-4 sessions following randomization) followed by monthly for remaining 8
      months (12 sessions total) to provide support regarding diet/weight loss, physical activity,
      and medication adherence tailored according to patient-identified health goals. Both
      strategies will be compared with EC with diabetes educational materials.

      Study population: For the main comparative effectiveness analysis (Aim 1) the total sample
      size (after dropouts) is N=800 with 40% randomized to the TM arm (N1=320), 40% to the HC arm
      (N2=320), and 20% to the EC arm (N3 = 160). Participants include African-American adults,
      ages 35-75, with uncontrolled diabetes and multiple chronic conditions, living in medically
      underserved communities in the MidSouth who have a cell phone or smart phone with texting
      capability and complete a two-week run-in period demonstrating responsiveness to TM.

      Primary/secondary outcomes: The primary outcome measures assessing effectiveness include:
      three (out of six total) subscales of the revised Summary of Diabetes Self-Care Activities
      questionnaire assessing general diet, exercise, and medication adherence. Secondary outcomes
      include: diabetes-specific quality of life using the Diabetes-39, primary care engagement
      using National Health Interview Survey questions regarding delayed needed care, and average
      blood sugar (A1c) obtained from medical records and reported in the DWPC-R.

      Analytic methods: For Aim 1, in the context of repeated measures ANOVA, using t-tests within
      arm to detect change from baseline to 12-months (Follow-up 3), power exceeds 0.99 for all
      primary outcomes. For Aim 2, six analyses will assess heterogeneity of treatment effects by
      evaluating the interaction of each key, dichotomized, baseline characteristic with treatment
      arm, estimating means and standard errors of six subclasses, and within each characteristic
      (e.g. low or high health literacy) testing for differences between TM and HC, TM and EC, and
      HC and TM. Analyses for Aim 3 will be conducted as described above for Aim 1. With the
      proposed sample sizes differences can be detected within either the rural or urban setting on
      two-sided tests at alpha of 0.05 with power of 0.953, 0.779 and 0.829, respectively. Thus,
      both the rural and urban subgroups will have adequate power to detect a meaningful difference
      in effectiveness between each active arm and the EC arm. If the arms are combined, ignoring
      rural and urban setting, the combined active arms will have &gt; .999, .972, and .985
      respectively.

    <ipd_description>Data may be exported from the database system that houses study data in a variety of formats for sharing and/or analysis. At study completion, the investigators anticipate extracting all data from the system for sharing with other sources once appropriate governance and sharing restrictions have been addressed. Data dictionaries and associated metadata will be provided as needed upon request. Data can be shipped or mailed in approved, encrypted format or collected via SFTP (secure file transfer protocol) from our servers. The cost of allowing prospective investigators access to the de-identified data from this project will include IRB costs to review the application, salary support to cover staff time to review the concept proposal, submit documents to the IRB, and to establish password-protected and secured transfer application of the data. This cost is per application per investigator who wishes access granted to the de-identified data.</ipd_description>
