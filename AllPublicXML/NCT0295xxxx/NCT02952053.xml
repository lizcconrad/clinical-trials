      The main objective of this study is to assess effects of Dry Needling into Myofascial Trigger
      Point compared Dry Needling into Taut Band point based on the outcomes of myotnometric
      measurement in healthy subjects.

      Hypothesis: Deep Dry Needling of the latent medial Myofascial Trigger Point (MTrP) of the
      soleus muscle will achieve changes in myotonometric measures compared to Deep Dry Needling of
      the Taut Band of the soleus muscle.

      Methods:

      It is a double-blinded randomized clinical trial where subjects are healthy volunteers from
      the city of Toledo older than 18 years.

      There will be a MTrP Group (dry needling into the medial MTrP of soleus muscle) and a TB
      Group (dry needling distal to the MTrP but into the taut muscle band of soleus muscle). The
      intervention will be a unique session.

      Intervention:

      Dry needling technique will be performed by locating the taut band and the Myofascial Trigger
      Point. Depending on the group, a thin needle (0,32x40mm) is introduced 10 times (fast in and
      fast out) directly within the Myofascial Trigger Point or within the Taut Band.

      Assessment:

      Myoton device is a simple and portable tool to obtain quantitative and objective assessments
      of mechanical properties of muscle tone. Myoton has been adopted to characterize the
      viscoelastic properties of skeletal muscle as tissue displacement when a mechanical
      perturbation is applied to the muscle.

      The device incorporates a probe and an acceleration sensor. The probe was kept perpendicular
      with its end touching the muscle belly. 10 mechanical impacts (with a duration of 15 ms, a
      force of 0.4 N and a local deformation in the order of a few millimetres) are delivered to
      MTrP and TB points.

      Outcome measures:

      Outcome measures will include myotonometric measurements (frecuency, stiffness and decrement)
      and they will be evaluated before, at 10 min and 1 week after the intervention.
