      The research study is designed to assess the technical feasibility and safety of a
      perivascular injection of vonapanitase delivered via micro-infusion catheter to the distal
      popliteal, tibial or peroneal arteries immediately following successful angioplasty.

        Screening: Initial study inclusion criteria

          1. Age of at least 18 years.

          2. Clinical diagnosis of PAD secondary to atherosclerosis affecting a lower limb.

          3. Rutherford category 3-5.

          4. De novo lesion, not previously treated by angioplasty, atherectomy or stenting.

          5. Scheduled to undergo angioplasty of the distal popliteal, tibial or peroneal arteries.

          6. If female and of childbearing potential (premenopausal and not surgically sterile)
             must have a negative pregnancy test at the screening visit and be willing to use
             contraception from the time of the screening visit to 1 week following study drug
             administration. Acceptable methods of birth control include abstinence, barrier
             methods with spermicide, implants, injectables, oral contraceptives, intra-uterine
             device, or a vasectomized partner.

          7. Ability to understand and comply with the requirements of the entire study and
             communicate with the study team.

          8. Ability to provide written informed consent using a document that has been approved by
             the required institutional review board.

             Procedure: Study inclusion criteria to be determined at the time of the angioplasty
             procedure

          9. Atherosclerotic lesion with &gt;50% stenosis in the popliteal (distal to the center of
             the knee joint space, the P3 segment), tibial or peroneal artery prior to angioplasty.

         10. Successful revascularization without the use of stenting of the target lesion; no flow
             limiting dissection and &lt;30% residual lumen stenosis as compared with an adjacent
             non-diseased lumen diameter.

        Exclusion Criteria Screening: Initial study exclusion criteria

          1. Patients in whom arterial insufficiency in the lower extremity is the result of an
             immunologic or inflammatory non-atherosclerotic disorder (e.g., Buerger's disease,
             vasculitis).

          2. Planned above ankle amputation on ipsilateral limb within 4 weeks of study drug
             administration.

          3. Prior or planned stenting of the target lesion.

          8. Renal failure with existing dependence on dialysis or an eGFR by MDRD calculation of &lt;
             20 mL/min/1.73 m2.

          9. Pregnancy, lactation or plans to become pregnant during the course of the study.

         10. Presence of any significant medical condition that might significantly confound the
             collection of safety and efficacy data in this study.

         11. Malignancy or treatment for malignancy within the previous 12 months with the
             exception of localized basal cell or squamous cell skin cancer, or any cancer in situ.

         12. Treatment with any investigational drug within the previous 30 days or investigational
             antibody therapy within 90 days prior to signing informed consent.

         13. Known allergy to radiocontrast agents.

             Procedure:

             Exclusion criteria to be determined at the time of the angioplasty procedure

         14. Reference vessel diameter &lt; 2 mm and &gt; 8 mm.

         15. Severe concentric medial calcification of the target lesion thought to interfere with
             study drug delivery to the adventitia based on fluoroscopic appearance.

         16. Aneurysm in the target vessel.

         17. Failure to cross the target lesion with a guide wire; however subintimal wire crossing
             is allowed.

         18. Stenting of the target lesion.
