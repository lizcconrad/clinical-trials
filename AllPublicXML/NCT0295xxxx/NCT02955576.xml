      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of microneedle patch on the psoriatic
      plaques.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      As a novel minimally invasive approach, microneedle-mediated transdermal drug delivery has
      received increased attention. Microneedle patch effectively penetrates the skin barrier of
      the stratum corneum and create efficient pathways for the delivery of drugs.

      A randomized controlled trial based on split-body was planned to evaluate the efficacy of
      enhanced transdermal delivery of topical agent by hyaluronic acid (HA)-fabricated microneedle
      patch in psoriatic plaques. Six psoriatic plaques in a patient will be randomized to either
      microneedle HA patch, patch, or control groups. Patch group is planned for rule out the
      occlusion effect of patches. All lesions will be treated with topical agent and patches daily
      for 2-week period. The severity of psoriasis will be grated with modified PASI score and the
      clinical improvement will be assessed as % from baseline every week. Overall 20 patients with
      120 psoriatic plaques will be enrolled.

    <description>The microneedle HA patch were made of hyaluronic acid with microneedles which can enhance the drug permeation. All lesions were treated with topical calcipotriol - betamethasone dipropionate ointment with microneedle HA patches.
Microneedle HA patch (Therapass速, RMD-6.5A) was prepared at Raphas Co., Ltd. (Cheonan, South Korea).
Daivobet速 containing the active ingredients calcipotriol - betamethasone dipropionate was applied.</description>
