    <textblock>
      60 ASA physical status I or II patients, aged 18-75 years old , scheduled for elective
      video-assisted thoracoscopic lobectomy surgery,will be randomized into 2 groups,with 30
      patients in each group: 1. control group and 2. treatment group. Patients in treatment group
      will receive transcutaneous electrical acupoint stimulation(TEAS) during the surgery and at
      6h and 24h after surgery. Patients in the control group received only TIVA general anesthesia
      and sham electrical stimulation. Serum from patients of both groups will be collected at
      before surgery, 1h and 25h after surgery, respectively. Serum levels of TNF-alpha, IL-1 beta,
      CXCL8, IFN gamma and IL-4 at different time points will be measured and compared between the
      two groups.

      60 ASA physical status I or II patients, aged 18-75 years old , scheduled for elective
      video-assisted thoracoscopic lobectomy surgery,will be randomized into 2 groups,with 30
      patients in each group: 1. control group, who will receive total intravenous anesthesia(TIVA)
      and sham stimulation; and 2. treatment group, who will receive (TIVA) and transcutaneous
      electrical acupoint stimulation(TEAS). Since 30 min before induction of anesthesia, patients
      in treatment group will be stimulated at the 4 acupoints , Houxi、Zhigou、Neiguan and Hegu on
      both sides by Han's Acupoint Nerve Stimulator(HANS) until the end of the operation. At 6h and
      24h after surgery, patients in treatment group will receive TEAS again, for 30 min each
      time.The frequency was 2/100Hz,the stimulate intensity was the maximum current that could be
      tolerated when the patients were awake.The control group received only TIVA general
      anesthesia and sham electrical stimulation.Serum from patients of both groups will be
      collected at before surgery, 1h and 25h after surgery, respectively and serum levels of
      TNF-alpha, IL-1 beta, CXCL8, IFN gamma and IL-4 at different time points will be measured.
      The primary outcome measures are serum TNF-alpha and IL-1 beta levels at 25h after surgery.
      The secondary outcome measures include serum levels of TNF-alpha, IL-1 beta, CXCL8, Th1/Th2
      ratio (by calculating IFN gamma/IL-4) at 1h post surgery and serum levels of CXCL8, Th1/Th2
      ratio at 25h post surgery.
