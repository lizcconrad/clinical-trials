  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It is important for people with stroke to exercise in order to improve their overall recovery
      and general health. However, these individuals are less physically active than people without
      stroke, and they often do not achieve the recommended frequency, intensity or duration of
      exercise. Low levels of physical activity leads to people with stroke becoming very unfit,
      which can result in functional decline and increased difficulty being active. It is important
      to determine how to encourage people with stroke to be more active in the long-term. The
      transition time between the end of rehabilitation and return to the community might be an
      ideal time to address barriers, and to develop positive habits, knowledge and abilities for
      long-term participation in exercise. We developed the PROPEL program that combines exercise
      with self-management strategies during rehabilitation to promote physical activity after
      rehabilitation. Preliminary pilot findings indicate that people who completed PROPEL were
      more physically active after discharge than those who did not. This study aims to evaluate
      the effect of PROPEL on long-term participation in exercise after discharge from stroke
      rehabilitation. This study will take place at 6 different hospitals. Participants will either
      complete a control intervention (group exercise only) or the PROPEL intervention (group
      exercise plus self-management). Participants' adherence to exercise for 6 months after the
      end of the interventions will be evaluated using activity and heart rate monitors and
      physical activity questionnaires. We expect this study will show that a simple intervention
      delivered during rehabilitation will increase participation in exercise after rehabilitation.
      Increased participation in exercise could then lead to improved stroke recovery and overall
      health, and reduced risk of having another stroke.

    <description>The primary outcome is proportion of participants per group who meet recommendations for intensity, frequency, and duration of daily physical activity; that is, at least 150 minutes per week of moderate-to-vigorous intensity exercise. Physical activity will be assessed using a step counter, heart rate monitor, and questionnaire for 7 continuous days.
Participants will be deemed to meet the recommendations within a given week if they meet at least two of three criteria at 6-months post-discharge: 1) record at least 150 'active minutes' (from the step activity monitor); 2) record at least 150 minutes of heart rate between 55-80% of age-predicted maximum; and/or 3) report at least 150 minutes of moderate and/or vigorous intensity activity on the physical activity questionnaire.</description>

    <description>Supervised group exercise up to 3-times/week for 6 weeks. A typical exercise session will involve a 3-5 minute 'warm-up', 20-30 minutes of aerobic exercise at a target heart rate determined from a sub-maximal test, and a 3-5 minute 'cool-down' of low-intensity exercise. The choice of exercise modality for the submaximal test and for training (e.g., recumbent stepper, cycle ergometer, or treadmill) will be individually prescribed based on patients' sensori-motor recovery, postural control, functional abilities, and safety. Heart rate, blood pressure, rate of perceived exertion, workload, and duration of training will be documented for each session. These data will be reviewed by the physiotherapist with appropriate progression of the intensity and/or duration of exercise as necessary.
Participants may receive general advice to keep physically active after discharge, and may receive an individualized home exercise program, as is currently routine care at all sites.</description>

    <arm_group_type>Experimental</arm_group_type>
    <description>The PROPEL program involves both group aerobic exercise (as described above) and group discussion aimed at enabling participation in exercise after discharge. Components of the PROPEL program were developed according to the Transtheoretical Model of health behaviour change and Social Cognitive Theory. In addition to group exercise participants will attend 1-hour small group discussion sessions once weekly to learn self-management skills for exercise in preparation for discharge from rehabilitation. These discussions include: identifying and solving problems around barriers to exercise; understanding personal and general benefits of exercise; exploring appropriate community resources for exercise; and finding individualized and realistic strategies for incorporating exercise in a regular routine. Participants will become comfortable with progressing their exercise and will set short- and long-term exercise goals.</description>
