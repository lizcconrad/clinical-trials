      Study B9991011 is a multi-center, international, randomized, open label, 2 component (Phase
      1b followed by Phase 3), parallel-arm study of avelumab in combination with various agents
      for the treatment of Relapsed/Refractory (R/R) Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma (DLBCL).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The target study population of this Phase 1b/3 registrational study is patients with R/R
      DLBCL who have completed at least 2 (but not more than 4) lines of prior rituximab-containing
      multi-agent chemotherapy, and/or in whom autologous stem cell transplant (ASCT) has failed,
      or who are not candidates for ASCT or who are not eligible for intensive chemotherapy.
      Patients who are ineligible for intensive second line chemotherapy must have received at
      least one prior rituximab-containing combination chemotherapy regimen. The study will assess
      the safety, efficacy, pharmacokinetics (PK), immunogenicity of the 3 avelumab-based
      combination regimens tested, and collect patient reported outcome (PRO) data.
