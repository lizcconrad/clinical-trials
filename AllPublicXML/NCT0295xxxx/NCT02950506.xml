    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate whether tDCS enhances the effect of cognitive
      remediation therapy on cognition and functional outcome in patients with epilepsy. There has
      been evidence that working memory performance is enhanced in healthy subjects. Acute tDCS
      studies have found improvements in working memory performance in subjects with other
      neurological diseases. To date, there have been no published studies examining whether can
      enhance learning during multi-session cognitive remediation over 2 weeks in subjects with
      epilepsy. This study could have potential application as a non-invasive clinical intervention
      for interictal dysfunction in epilepsy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Epilepsy is a chronic neurological disorder affecting 50 million people worldwide. Patients
      suffer not only from recurring seizures, but also from cognitive deficits despite adequate
      treatment control. Cognitive remediation therapy (CRT) is a therapeutic intervention that has
      recently shown promise in improving cognitive impairment in many neuropsychological
      disorders. Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is a non-invasive method that
      modulates cortical excitability. It works by applying weak electrical currents to the scalp
      that induce acute modifications of neuronal membrane potentials, producing long-lasting
      changes in the bioelectric activity of underlying brain tissue. It is postulated that tDCS
      enhances benefit gained through cognitive remediation therapy. These interventions have yet
      to be combined with each other for the treatment of interictal dysfunction in patients with
      epilepsy. The goal of the study is to investigate whether the introduction of tDCS in
      addition to CRT is effective in the treatment of cognitive impairment in patients suffering
      from epilepsy.

    <measure>Cogstate Brief Battery</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline to 5 days, 1 month, and 3 months after last intervention visit.</time_frame>
    <description>The Cogstate Battery is a computerized cognitive assessment program which measures a wide
range of cognitive functions (e.g. psychomotor speed, reaction time, working memory, divided
attention, learning), which can be repeated with little to none observed practice effects (Falleti
2006). All tasks within the battery were adaptations of standard neuro-psychological and
experimental psychological tests. Time to administer requires approximately 15-20 minutes
consists of 8 tasks in the form of card games that are presented in succession.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test (AVLT)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline to 5 days, 1 month, and 3 months after last intervention visit.</time_frame>
    <description>The Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test (AVLT) is a measure of immediate auditory and verbal
memory as well as delayed recall. Participants are given a list of 15 unrelated words repeated
over five different trials and are asked to repeat. Another list of 15 unrelated words are given and
the client must again repeat the original list of 15 words and then again after 30 minutes.
Approximately 45-50 minutes is required for the procedure. (Loring et al. 2008, Strauss 2006)</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Picture Sequence Memory Test</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline to 5 days, 1 month, and 3 months after last intervention visit.</time_frame>
    <description>The Picture Sequence Memory Test (PSMT) is a measure for use in the assessment of episodic
memory. Participants are asked to recall, in increasing length, a series of illustrated objects and
activities that are presented in a particular order on the computer screen. The participants are
asked to recall the sequence of pictures that is demonstrated over two learning trials. The number
of pictures may vary depending on the age. The test takes approximately 7 minutes to administer.
(Dikmen et al. 2014)</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Flanker Inhibitory Control and Attention Task</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline to 5 days, 1 month, and 3 months after last intervention visit.</time_frame>
    <description>This task measures both a participant's attention and inhibitory control. The test requires the
participant to focus on a given arrow while inhibiting attention to other arrows surrounding it.
(Heaton et al. 2014) Sometimes the middle stimulus is pointing in the same direction as the
&quot;flankers&quot; (congruent) and sometimes in the opposite direction (incongruent). Scoring is based
on a combination of accuracy and reaction time. The test takes approximately 3 minutes to
administer.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Dimensional Change Card Sort Test</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline to 5 days, 1 month, and 3 months after last intervention visit.</time_frame>
    <description>DCCS is an assessment to measure of cognitive flexibility. Two target pictures are presented that vary along two dimensions (e.g., shape and color). Participants are asked to match a series of bivalent test pictures (e.g., yellow balls and blue trucks) to the target pictures, first according to one dimension (e.g., color) and then, after a number of trials, according to the other dimension(e.g., shape). &quot;Switch&quot; trials are also employed, in which the participant must change the dimension being matched. For example, after 4 straight trials matching on shape,the participant may be asked to match on color on the next trial and then go back to shape, thus requiring the cognitive flexibility to quickly choose the correct stimulus. Scoring is based on a combination of accuracy and reaction time. This test takes approximately 4 minutes to administer.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Oral Symbol Digit Test</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline to 5 days, 1 month, and 3 months after last intervention visit.</time_frame>
    <description>This instrument is a measure of processing speed. (Denboer et al. 2014). The participant is presented with a set of nine symbols on the computer screen, each associated with a number 1-9, and is then presented with a series of symbols without numbers and is asked to orally say each number that should go with that symbol, without skipping any. The score is equal to the number of symbols correctly identified orally within two minutes. This takes approximately 3 minutes.</description>

The CRT software that will be used will be Cogmed working memory training program (Pearson Education, Inc.)Active tDCS will be applied at a ramp-like fashion from 0 to 2mA over 10 seconds, and will be ramped down for the last 10 seconds of stimulation. Active tDCS will last 20 minutes each session. The sham procedure involves only 30 seconds of stimulation at 2mA.</description>
