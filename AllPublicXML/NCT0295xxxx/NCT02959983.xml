  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the efficacy and safety of eluxadoline 100 milligrams (mg) twice a
      day (BID) versus placebo for the treatment of patients with Irritable Bowel Syndrome with
      Diarrhea (IBS-D) who report that the use of loperamide in the prior 12 months failed to
      provide control of their IBS-D symptoms.

    <description>Percentage of primary composite responders is defined as the percentage of participants who meet both of the following daily composite criteria for at least 50% of the days with diary entry:
Worst Abdominal Pain (WAP) score improved by ≥40% compared to Baseline. The participant records their WAP score in the past 24 hours each day in a daily patient diary where: 0=no pain to 10=worst imaginable pain.
Bristol Stool Score (BSS) &lt;5; or the absence of a bowel movement if accompanied by ≥40% improvement in WAP compared to Baseline. The participant records their stool consistency each day in a daily patient diary using the BSS on a scale from 1 (hard stool) to 7 (watery stool).</description>

    <description>Percentage of stool consistency responders is defined as the percentage of participants who meet the daily stool consistency response criteria: BSS &lt;5; or the absence of a bowel movement if accompanied by ≥40% improvement in WAP compared to Baseline for ≥50% of days with daily patient diary entries over a certain time period. The participant records their stool consistency each day in a daily patient diary using the BSS on a scale from 1 (hard stool) to 7 (watery stool).</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline, Weeks 1 to 4, 5 to 8, and 9 to 12</time_frame>
    <description>Percentage of monthly composite responders is defined as the percentage of participants who meet the daily composite response criteria for at least 50% of days with diary entry for a minimum of 20 days during each 4-week interval (weeks 1 to 4, 5 to 8, and 9 to 12).
Composite response includes both of the following criteria:
WAP score improved by ≥40% compared to Baseline. The participant records their WAP score in the past 24 hours each day in a daily patient diary where: 0=no pain to 10=worst imaginable pain.
BSS &lt;5; or the absence of a bowel movement if accompanied by ≥40% improvement in WAP compared to Baseline. The participant records their stool consistency each day in a daily patient diary using the BSS on a scale from 1 (hard stool) to 7 (watery stool).</description>
