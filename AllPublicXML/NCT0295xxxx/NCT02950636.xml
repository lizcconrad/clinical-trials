  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Neurological Disorders Depression Inventory for Epilepsy (NDDI-E)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Week 4 to Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The NDDI-E is a 6 item questionnaire. Scores for each question range from 1 (never) to 4 (all the time). There is a maximum score of 24. The higher the score the more severe the depression.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-item (GAD-7) scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Week 4 to Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The GAD-7 is a 7 item questionnaire. Scores for each question range from 0 (not at all) to 3 (nearly every day). There is a maximum score of 21. The higher the score the more severe the anxiety. A score over 15 represents severe anxiety. A score under 10 may indicate GAD and would prompt further examination.</description>
