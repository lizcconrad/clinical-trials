      Aims: To demonstrate the effect of a program based on video games as a means to improve
      abilities and basic skills affected by lymphedema, and its impact on quality of life.

      Design: longitudinal, pre-experimental, with pre / post-test and evaluation, assessor blinded
      study.

      Method: Data on shoulder pain and disability, health-related quality of life, strength and
      articulate activated by the OSS (Oxford Shoulder Score), SPADI (Shoulder Pain and Disability
      Index), FACT-B + 4 (Functional Assesment of Cancer Therapy Questionnaire for Breast Cancer),
      respectively goniometry and dynamometry amplitude scales will be collected.

      The intervention will be performed with the Wii ™ console and the Wii Balance BoardTM, during
      5 individual weekly sessions of 30 minutes.
