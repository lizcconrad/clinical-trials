    <textblock>
      This prospective clinical study will evaluate the effect of high pull headgear for molar
      intrusion, compared with the control group, in adolescent patients with open bite
      malocclusion.

      The study sample will consist of 24 patients with anterior open bite divided equally in two
      groups. The sample will be collected consecutively from patients attending the Orthodontic
      Department at Damascus university.

      A modified version of the OBA (Open Bite Appliance),introduced by Erverdi and Usumez, will be
      applied for all patients. High pull headgears will be used in the first group, while, in the
      second (control) group, Open Bite Appliances will be used only.

      The skeletal and dentoalveolar changes occurring after intrusion of posterior teeth will be
      assessed by using posteroanterior and lateral cephalometric radiographs; pre- and post-
      treatment changes for each group will be evaluated.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Open bite malocclusion is considered one of the most difficult malocclusion to correct in
      orthodontic treatment because it appears as a result of different etiological factors such as
      genetic, dental, skeletal, functional, soft tissue, and habits that play roles in its
      development. Different treatment modalities used for the treatment of an anterior open bite.
      Multiloop edgewise archwires, miniscrews, high-pull headgear, and bite blocks have been used
      for anterior open bite patients, most open bite patients characterized by increased facial
      height, class II skeletal pattern, and vertical excess in maxillary posterior teeth.

      Functional appliances, magnets, posterior bite blocks, and high pull headgear are used for
      posterior teeth intrusion. It is possible to generate intrusive force by using high pull
      headgear. Furthermore, direction of force can be changed according to the center of
      resistance of the dental units to achieve a better tooth movement control. The intrusion of
      posterior teeth will lead to decreased lower facial height by a counterclockwise rotation of
      the mandible; and improve class II skeletal relationship.

      This study was the first clinical trial, that compare the effect of high pull headgear for
      molar intrusion with the control group in adolescent patients.
