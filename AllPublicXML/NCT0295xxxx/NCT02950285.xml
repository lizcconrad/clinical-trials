  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall goal is to improve outcomes among patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) by
      preventing stroke. The investigators propose to implement an automated algorithm using
      electronic medical record (EMR) data to alert physicians in a large primary care practice
      network at the Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) of their patients with AF and elevated
      stroke risk that are not taking an anticoagulant for stroke prevention. The investigators
      hypothesize that interventions to notify physicians of such individuals may prompt
      reassessment for the need for anticoagulation, and thereby increase guideline-indicated
      anticoagulation rates. Additionally, in a survey component, physicians will characterize
      reasons for not pursuing anticoagulation in AF patients at elevated risk for stroke.

      The overall goal is to improve outcomes among patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) by
      preventing stroke. The investigators propose to implement an automated algorithm using
      electronic medical record (EMR) data to alert physicians in a large primary care practice
      network at the Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) of their patients with AF and elevated
      stroke risk that are not taking an anticoagulant for stroke prevention. Using a medical
      record algorithm, there are an estimated 2,000 to 3,000 such patients in the primary care
      practices at MGH. The investigators hypothesize that interventions to notify physicians of
      such individuals may prompt reassessment for the need for anticoagulation, and thereby
      increase guideline-indicated anticoagulation rates.

      The investigators define the following three Specific Aims to address the primary study
      hypothesis:

      Specific Aim 1: Implement an automated alerting system within the EMR to notify primary care
      physicians (PCPs) of patients with AF at elevated stroke risk that are not being treated with
      anticoagulants. To maximize efficiency of the effort, the alert will not require a concurrent
      clinic visit, but rather will occur with existing data aggregated from the medical record
      independent of any clinical encounter.

      Specific Aim 2: Test whether the alerting system increases the rate of anticoagulation at 3
      months after implementation.

      Specific Aim 3: Characterize the reasons for not pursuing anticoagulation in AF patients at
      elevated risk for stroke.

      Specific Aim 4: Assess how PCPs want to be alerted about anticoagulation status in the future
      and what types of support they find helpful
