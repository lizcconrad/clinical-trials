    <textblock>
      Synchronous colorectal cancer with liver metastases, defined as the diagnosis of a primary
      colorectal tumour and liver metastases within 12 months, is a common problem faced by
      colorectal and hepatobiliary surgeons.(Adam) The &quot;traditional approach&quot; is to perform staged
      resections unless the liver resection required is limited (i.e. small wedges of peripheral
      lesions). The downside of performing staged vs. simultaneous resections is that patients must
      undergo two major operations instead of one, which limits a patient's ability to return to
      their pre-surgical state of health in a timely fashion, increasing health care costs (Ejaz)
      and delaying the start of adjuvant chemotherapy. The disadvantages of a simultaneous approach
      include longer operating room times potentially increasing the major postoperative
      complication rate including blood transfusions, surgical site infections, anastomotic leaks
      and post-hepatectomy liver failure. Recent data from tertiary cancer centres suggest that
      simultaneous resection of the colon and rectum along with liver resection of any magnitude is
      feasible and safe.(Silberhumer) Although encouraging, this data comes from specific patients
      from a highly selected institution, results that are perhaps not generalizable.

      This proposal is a feasibility study consisting of a pilot single arm prospective study at
      two different large-volume Hepatobiliary Centres of patients with synchronous colorectal
      cancer with liver metastases undergoing simultaneous resection of the colon or rectum and
      liver to evaluate their complication rates (including the calculation of the comprehensive
      complication index), quality of life, cost evaluation, and proportion of eligible patients
      recruited over a 12-month period. The results of this pilot study will provide us with the
      information necessary to build a large multicentre randomized controlled trial comparing
      staged vs. simultaneous resection for synchronous colorectal cancer liver metastases.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Approximately 30% of patients with colorectal cancer and liver metastases present with
      synchronous disease.(Manfredi) Resection of colorectal cancer metastases confined to the
      liver has been shown to offer long-term survival.(Norlinger; Robertson; Nordlinger) However,
      the optimal timing of surgical resection of synchronous liver metastases in relation to the
      primary tumour is not well defined. Prior retrospective cohorts and meta-analyses suggest
      that the simultaneous approach carries similar postoperative complication and perioperative
      mortality rates.(Slesser; Yin; Martin; Chua; Feng; Reddy; Jarnagin; Capussotti) Most of these
      reports however, carry a significant selection bias, as surgeons tend to combine limited
      liver resections and &quot;straightforward&quot; colorectal resections as opposed to complex
      resections. Recent studies suggest that the postoperative complication risk is similar even
      in the case of complex liver resections as well as complex colon resections and rectal cancer
      resections.(Silberhumer; Vigano) Rectal resections when compared to colon resections are
      thought to be more complex, due to: a higher risk of anastomotic leakage,(Rullier) the use of
      specific surgical procedures, such as total mesorectal excision (Heald, MacFarlane) and
      laparoscopic surgery(Bonjer) and the involvement of a multidisciplinary team to determine the
      use and timing of neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy.(Jeong; Kapiteijn) The conclusion of these
      studies was that further data from prospective randomized studies is needed in order to
      determine whether simultaneous resection is efficient and safe. Improvements in anesthesia,
      critical care and surgical resection techniques for both liver and colorectal surgery have
      enabled innovative surgeons and institutions to perform simultaneous resections in complex
      liver and colorectal cases in a safe manner, and the simultaneous approach has been adopted
      by many surgeons despite the lack of studies with rigorous methodology to provide good
      quality data.

      Simultaneous colorectal and liver resection has the potential advantage to decrease the total
      number of complications following surgery, avoiding a second operation thereby improving
      patient's quality of life, decreasing overall health care costs and avoiding delays in the
      administration of postoperative chemotherapy. Although the total number of complications can
      be reduced by performing a single operation, the operating room time is higher which could
      lead to a higher proportion of major postoperative complications due to hypothermia,
      prolonged hypovolemia and higher blood loss.

      The decision to perform simultaneous resection varies greatly between surgeons and
      institutions, with some institutions mostly performing simultaneous resections, to others
      that only perform staged resection and others that perform a combination of staged and
      simultaneous resections depending on patients' and tumour characteristics, usually performing
      larger and more complex resections in a staged approach. There is certainly no standard
      approach to this problem and it continues to be a topic of debate amongst surgeons, medical
      oncologists and radiation oncologists.

      The investigators propose to undertake a feasibility study, including a prospective single
      arm trial of patients with synchronous colorectal cancer and liver metastases undergoing
      simultaneous resection to provide us with important information to prepare a large randomized
      controlled study of simultaneous vs. staged resection. This feasibility study will provide
      valuable data on the type and proportion of postoperative complications at 90 days following
      surgery as measured by the comprehensive complication index(Slankamenac 2013) which will help
      us better understand the postoperative complication rate of the simultaneous approach and
      also calculate a sample size for a randomized controlled trial based on this primary outcome.
      This study will also help define the population that should be included in such a trial (all
      liver resections vs. only major liver resections, etc.). Set criteria for success of this
      feasibility study will be clearly stated in this proposal in order to determine if it is
      possible and ethical to move forward with a larger trial. The results of this study could
      lead to changes in surgical practice by introducing an innovative approach to treat this
      disease, in a way that could improve patient's quality of life by decreasing postoperative
      complications and the number of surgical procedures and at the same time lead to cost savings
      to the health care system.
