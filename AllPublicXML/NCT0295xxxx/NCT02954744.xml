  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Uterine fibroids are common uterine benign neoplasm. They can cause abnormal menstrual
      bleeding, pelvic discomfort and urinary frequency. Although surgical intervention is the
      definitive treatment, some women prefer to have their uterus preserved. High-intensity
      focused ultrasound (HIFU) therapy is receiving increasing interest in the management of
      uterine fibroids by inducing focal thermocoagulation of the fibroids. Results obtained by
      various research groups have shown that HIFU treatment is safe, effective and is highly
      acceptable to patients. The main objective of this study is to evaluate the therapeutic
      efficacy of HIFU in the treatment of uterine fibroids.

      In this proposed study, 20 patients who have symptomatic uterine fibroids who meet the study
      inclusion criteria will be invited to participate in the study which involves the use of HIFU
      in the management of the fibroid. Background information of the patients such as age, body
      mass index, hormonal (pre- or postmenopausal) status and the presence of chronic medical
      disease will be collected. Subjects will also be asked to complete an eight-item section of a
      Uterine Fibroid Symptom and Quality Of Life Questionnaire (UFS-QOL) which evaluate the effect
      of the fibroid on the quality of life of women.
