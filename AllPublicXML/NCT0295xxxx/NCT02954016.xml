  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To evaluate the safety and efficacy of the endoscopically implanted ValenTx EndoPass™ System
      for treatment of adults with severe obesity.

      The EndoPass System is indicated for weight loss in adults with a body mass index (BMI) ≥35
      and ≤ 50 kg/m2 who have failed more conservative weight loss methods.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      -  Single-arm, multi-center study conducted in up to 50 subjects at up to 5 sites.

        -  Subjects will be implanted with the EndoPass device for up to 36 months.

        -  Body weight, adverse events and device function will be monitored at monthly visits for
           the first year after implant and quarterly visits thereafter.

        -  Additional follow-up data will include vital signs, hip and waist circumference, blood
           lab tests, endoscopic and esophagram assessments of the condition of the implanted
           device, quality of life and eating behavior questionnaires.

        -  All subjects will be followed for 12 months after device removal.

        -  A single device renewal may take place as needed after the initial implant.

        -  Subject study participation may last up to four years, but is expected to vary with
           implant duration, which will be determined on a case-by-case basis.
