  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Infants with congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH) usually have pulmonary hypoplasia and
      persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn (PPHN) leading to hypoxemic respiratory
      failure (HRF). Pulmonary hypertension associated with CDH is frequently resistant to
      conventional pulmonary vasodilator therapy including inhaled nitric oxide (iNO). Increased
      pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) can lead to right ventricular overload and dysfunction.
      In patients with CDH, left ventricular dysfunction, either caused by right ventricular
      overload or a relative underdevelopment of the left ventricle, is associated with poor
      prognosis. Milrinone is an intravenous inotrope and lusitrope (enhances cardiac systolic
      contraction and diastolic relaxation respectively) with pulmonary vasodilator properties and
      has been shown anecdotally to improve oxygenation in PPHN. Milrinone is commonly used during
      the management of CDH although no randomized trials have been performed to test its efficacy.
      Thirty percent of infants with CDH in the Children's Hospital Neonatal Database (CHND) and
      22% of late-preterm and term infants with CDH in the Pediatrix database received milrinone.
      In the recently published VICI trial, 84% of patients with CDH received a vasoactive
      medication. In the current pilot trial, neonates with an antenatal or postnatal diagnosis of
      CDH will be randomized to receive milrinone or placebo to establish safety of this medication
      in CDH and test its efficacy in improving oxygenation.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a pilot trial to determine if milrinone infusion in neonates ≥ 36 weeks'
      postmenstrual age (PMA) at birth with CDH would lead to an increase in PaO2 with a
      corresponding decrease in OI by itself or in conjunction with other pulmonary vasodilators
      such as iNO at 24 h post-infusion.

    <description>If subsequent to the study drug, any additional inotrope or pulmonary vasodilator is used (such as iNO), we will evaluate the oxygenation response to these agents. If inotropes or vasodilators were used prior to the initiation of study drug, similar values will be recorded. The OI and PaO2/ FiO2 ratio prior to at least 30 min after initiation of the inotrope / vasodilator are recorded.

          -  postnatal age ≤7 days (168 hours of age)

          -  invasive mechanical ventilation (defined as ventilation with an endotracheal tube) and

          -  one arterial blood gas with an OI ≥ 10 (after tracheal tube obstruction and other
             easily resolvable mechanical causes for increased OI are ruled out) on the most recent
             arterial blood gas within 12 hours prior to the time of randomization.

          -  if an arterial blood gas is not available at the time of randomization, a preductal
             OSI of ≥ 5 can be used as an inclusion criterion instead of OI ≥ 10; (the OSI should
             be based on the most recent preductal pulse oximetry recording and must be within 12
             hours of randomization)

          -  postnatal blood gas with PCO2 ≤ 80 mmHg (arterial, capillary or venous blood gas) on
             the most recent blood gas sample obtained within 12 hours prior to randomization Note:
             Criteria (iv) to (vi) must be met at the most recent analysis within 12 hours prior to
             randomization.

                  outflow tract on echocardiogram,

               -  Note 2: infants with other acyanotic congenital heart disease (CHD) and CDH may

          -  enrolled in conflicting clinical trials (such as a randomized controlled blinded trial
             of another pulmonary vasodilator therapy); Note: mothers enrolled in fetal tracheal
             occlusion studies such as FETO may be enrolled if permitted by investigators of the
             fetal tracheal occlusion study; [FETO refers to fetoscopic endoluminal tracheal
             occlusion and involves occlusion of fetal trachea with a balloon device at
             mid-gestation and subsequent removal in later gestation]

          -  infants with bilateral CDH

             o Note 3: infants with anterior and central defects are included in the study

          -  associated abnormalities of the trachea or esophagus (trachea-esophageal fistula,
             esophageal atresia, laryngeal web, tracheal agenesis)

          -  renal dysfunction (with serum creatinine &gt; 2 mg/dL not due to maternal factors) or
             severe oligohydramnios associated with renal dysfunction at randomization; renal
             dysfunction may be secondary to renal anomalies or medical conditions such as acute
             tubular necrosis

          -  severe systemic hypotension (mean blood pressure &lt; 35 mm Hg for at least 2 h with a
             vasoactive inotrope score of &gt; 30)

          -  persistent thrombocytopenia (platelet count &lt; 80,000/mm3) despite blood product
             administration on the most recent blood draw prior to randomization

          -  coagulopathy (PT INR &gt; 1.7) despite blood product administration on the most recent
             blood draw (if checked - there is no reason to check PT for the purpose of this study)

          -  aneuploidy associated with short life span (such as trisomy 13 or 18) will not be
             included in the study (infants with trisomy 21 can be included in the study)

          -  elevated arterial, venous or capillary PCO2 &gt; 80 mmHg in spite of maximal ventilator
             support (including high frequency ventilation) on the most recent blood gas obtained
             within 12 hours prior to randomization

          -  use of milrinone infusion prior to randomization (the use of other inhaled pulmonary
             vasodilators such as iNO, inhaled epoprosternol, inhaled PGE1 and oral such as
             endothelin receptor antagonists is permitted - Note: it is unlikely to be on oral
             pulmonary vasodilators early in the course of CDH)

          -  ongoing therapy with parenteral (intravenous or subcutaneous) pulmonary vasodilators
             such as IV/SQ prostacyclin analogs (Epoprostenol - Flolan or Treprostinil - Remodulin
             or PGE1 - Alprostadil) or IV phosphodiesterase 5 inhibitors (sildenafil - Revatio) at
             the time of randomization. In addition, initiation of therapy with these two classes
             of parenteral medications during the first 24 hours of study drug initiation is not
             permitted and will be considered a protocol deviation. The risk of systemic
             hypotension is high during the first 24 hours of study-drug (milrinone) infusion and
             hence parenteral administration of other pulmonary vasodilators is avoided to minimize
             risk of hypotension.

          -  Subjects already on ECMO or patients who are being actively considered for ECMO by the
             neonatal or surgical team

          -  attending (neonatal, critical care or surgical) refusal for participation in the trial
             (including concern about presence of hemodynamic instability)
