  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim for the study is to examined the effect of an individually tailored integrated
      behavioral medicine in physiotherapy intervention including functional exercise, for older
      adults, having chronic musculoskeletal pain, living alone and dependent on formal care.

      The study is a pragmatic randomized controlled trial with one intervention group and one
      control group. The intervention is a 12-weeks home-based program. The intervention consists
      of an individually tailored intervention and aims to enhance ability to perform everyday
      activities by improving physical function and reduce pain-related beliefs and pain-related
      disability. The comparison group achieves general advice about physical activity. All
      participants will be tested at baseline, a post-assessment at 12 week and a three month
      follow-up. Primary outcome is pain interference by the Brief Pain Inventory and physical
      function by Short Physical Performance Battery.

      Secondary outcomes measures if the goal setting is reached, self-efficacy in relation to the
      goal setting, pain catastrophizing, level of physical Activity, falls efficacy and Health
      related quality of life.

      Intervention group

      The base for the intervention is to identify a problematic everyday activity and identify
      factors, including physical, psychological and environmental factors, that can inhibit and/or
      promote the ability to perform the activity. The exercise that will improve the physical
      factors will be based on functional exercise such as Balance training and muscle strength
      training, e.g. fast walking in circle, marching on the spot with a high knee lift, leg lifts,
      power walking and stair walking, squats, lunge, turning trunk and head while standing, and
      walking over obstacles. Number of exercises and the dosage are based on how much the
      participant are able to do and want to do and will increase progressively considering the
      changes in function and health status of the participants. The content of the visits is as
      follow:

      Session: Identification of a problematic everyday activity and advice about physical
      activity.

      Session 2: Doing functional behavioural analyse including goal setting, discuss performance
      dosage of training.

      Session 3-5: Training in the basic physical and psychological skills relevant to goal
      setting.

      Session 6-9: Training to apply basic skills adequately for the goal setting, application of
      basic and applied skills to other behaviours, starting with subsequent activity goals.

      Discussion about how the participant can be able to maintain their new behaviour.

      Discussion of problem-solving strategies, how he/she can prevent and address new activity
      problems that may arise related to the goal setting and in relation to being physically
      active.

      During the intervention period will the participant receive visits by a physiotherapist
      during intervention weeks 1-8 and 12. Under week 10 will the participants receive one
      telephone call for support.

      Non-intervention Group

      The comparison group will receive standard care which means that the participants get one
      visit from physiotherapist which consist of written and oral information about general advice
      regarding physical Activity..Further will the comparison group receive telephone Calls to
      remind them of being physically active according to the advice during week 1-8 and week 10.

    <time_frame>six month</time_frame>
    <description>Pain-related disability will be measured with the pain interference score in Brief Pain Inventory (BPI). The BPI is a self-report pain assessment tool and the patient is instructed to report pain as intensity and as interference with seven different functions. The interference scale includes seven items which assess pain's interference with general activity, mood, walking ability, normal work, relations with other persons, sleep, and enjoyment of life. The BPI has shown to be The BPI is validated for use in older adults with non cancer pain.</description>

    <measure>Physical function measured by the Norwegian version of the Short Physical Performance Battery</measure>
    <time_frame>six month</time_frame>
    <description>Physical function will be measured by the Norwegian version of The short physical performance battery. The Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB) evaluates balance, mobility and muscle strength by examining an individual's ability to stand with feet together in side-by side, semi-tandem and tandem positions, time to walk 8 ft and time to rise from a chair and return to the seated position five times. Each of the three tests is scored, based on performance between 0 and 4, leaving a maximum score of 12 for those individuals performing at the highest levels. The SPPB is a reliable and valid measure of lower extremity performance. Meaningful changes in the SPPB have been defined. Thus, the SPPB can be used as a standard measure of physical performance both for research and in clinical practice.</description>
