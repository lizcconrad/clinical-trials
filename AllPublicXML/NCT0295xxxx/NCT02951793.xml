  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Investigators are seeking to determine the impact of recent alcohol, smoking or psychotropic
      drug use prior to intensive care unit (ICU) admission on incidence of delirium and sedation
      requirements.

      Study design: A prospective observational study, in a medical ICU of a tertiary university
      hospital.

      Methods: For all new ICU admissions, a 1-page questionnaire including Alcohol Use Disorders
      Identification Test (AUDIT-C), smoking history and prior medication use was given to the
      patient or closest family members.

      Delirium was assessed by trained ICU nurses using Intensive Care Delirium Screening Checklist
      and Richmond Agitation-Sedation Scale.
