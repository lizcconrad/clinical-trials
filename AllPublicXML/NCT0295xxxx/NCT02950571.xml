  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will be a randomized controlled trial that investigates the effectiveness of
      digital picture frames (DPF) installed in inpatient rooms on long stay inpatient wards
      servicing schizophrenia clients at CAMH. The effects on client experience will consider the
      domains of self-concept, interactions with healthcare staff, perception of space, and
      implications for the recovery process. The comparison of inpatient client experience with
      DPFs versus a control group (Treatment as Usual - TAU), offers the opportunity to examine the
      effectiveness of this type of environmental adaptation. This trial builds upon earlier work
      that demonstrated the feasibility of DPFs in this context.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Long term stays in mental health facilities have been shown to have unique challenges and
      implications. To a considerable extent these challenges grow out of the stigmatized nature of
      severe mental illnesses (SMI) such as schizophrenia. The social and self-stigma surrounding
      SMI can have major effects on those affected including decreased self-esteem,
      self-deprecation, and the development of a self-concept defined by the illness. When
      stigmatized interpretations of mental illness are internalized, those affected can find it
      very challenging to sustain non-illness identities and can ultimately result in the loss of
      non-illness related aspects of self-concept. Inpatient contexts are particularly challenging
      in this regard, with non-illness oriented identities very difficult to sustain given
      considerations of power differentials with providers, the reduction of autonomy and choice,
      and the removal of the individual from environments that are demonstrative of non-illness
      aspects of self.

      Accordingly, a randomized controlled trial design will be used to consider the question: Does
      having a DPF in psychiatric inpatient unit rooms lead to improvements in interactions with
      the clinical team, perceptions of enhanced quality of physical space, and an improvement in
      the sustaining of non-illness aspects of self-concept? While the promising feasibility study
      findings might suggest hypotheses of improvement in these domains, we will consider this
      study exploratory given the complex environments inpatient units represent in the study of
      care quality and outcomes and the modest scope of this intervention. Finally, we will
      continue to collect feasibility data qualitatively, to inform further refinement of metrics
      and otherwise consider enhancements in intervention and research design.

    <description>Setup: Over 1-2, approximately 30 minute meetings pictures will be uploaded onto the device from picture files provided by the participant and/or their family or an open online source (e.g., Google Images) that are relevant and of interest to the participant.
Installation: The picture frames are secured to a surface in the participant's room (most typically a table) by facilities staff. Participants are instructed in its use.
Check in: At midpoint (2 weeks) an RA will check in with the participant to informally discuss whether or not it continues to work, is being used, and if they want more pictures uploaded. If the latter is requested step 1 will be repeated.</description>
