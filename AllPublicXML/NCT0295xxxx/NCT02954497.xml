  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      PumpKIN is a randomized, multicenter, two-arm trial evaluating the investigational Jarvik
      2015 VAD versus the EXCOR® Pediatric VAD in pediatric patients with heart failure. This study
      will enroll 88 subjects, 44 receiving the Jarvik 2015 and 44 receiving the EXCOR®, at up to
      24 sites in the US and Canada.

      The primary objectives of this investigational device exemption (IDE) clinical investigation
      are to (1) assess the safety of the investigational Jarvik 2015 through the evaluation of
      reported serious adverse events (SAEs) while on ventricular assist device (VAD) support up to
      the first 180 days post-implant and (2) explore the probable benefit of the investigational
      Jarvik 2015 by evaluating overall survival in the absence of severe neurologic impairment.

        Inclusion Criteria

        All children with severe (Ross or New York Heart Association (NYHA) class IV) heart failure
        despite optimal medical therapy (INTERMACS profiles for pediatrics: Profiles 1 or 2) who
        require mechanical circulatory support and meet the following criteria:

          1. Males and females within weight range: 8.0 Kg ≤ weight ≤ 20.0 Kg

          2. Males and females within Body surface area (BSA) range: 0.4 m2 ≤ BSA ≤ 0.8 m2

          3. Two-ventricle circulation, including cardiomyopathy, repaired structural heart disease
             (e.g. ALCAPA, aortic stenosis) or acquired heart disease (e.g., myocarditis, Kawasaki
             disease)

          4. Documented evidence of

               -  Inability to wean from ECMO or other temporary mechanical support OR

               -  Inotrope-dependent, decompensated heart failure with inability to wean from
                  ventilator support OR

               -  Inotrope-dependent, decompensated heart failure AND a combination of two of the
                  following criteria within 48 hours prior to implant (unless otherwise noted)
                  which is attributed to decompensated heart failure despite optimal medical
                  therapy:

                    -  Urine output &lt; 0.5 cc/Kg/hr

                    -  Creatinine level &gt; 2 times the ULN for age

          1. Known contraindication for systemic anticoagulation

          2. Currently participating in an interventional trial whose protocol prevents effective
             application of one or both treatment arms, potentially has an independent effect on
             trial endpoints, or otherwise interferes with execution of the PumpKIN protocol

          3. Any complex cardiac diagnosis (including but not limited to single ventricle anatomy,
             restrictive cardiomyopathy) that, in the opinion of the investigator, could
             independently affect the likelihood of the subject meeting the primary endpoint

          4. Presence of a mechanical heart valve

          5. Unresolved malignancy

          6. CPR with duration &gt;30 consecutive minutes within 48 hours prior to device implant or

                  status
