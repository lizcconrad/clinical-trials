      Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a very severe disease in Taiwan caused 7,000 deaths per
      year, and majorly about 70% is caused by the chronic hepatitis B virus infection. A repeat,
      long-term, and severe chronic hepatitis would be more possible progressed into liver
      cirrhosis and HCC. As previous records, there might be 2% of chronic HBV patient would
      progress to liver cirrhosis, and 5% of the liver cirrhosis's patients would develop to HCC.
      In some cases, the HBV patient also might directly develop to HCC without liver cirrhosis
      phase.

      Spirulina platensis is a kind of ancient livings for a 3.5 billions years, and had been
      recognized as a kind of space food by National Aeronautics and Space Administration(USA)
      because of containing numerous nutrients, especially vitamin B and beta-carotene.
      Beta-carotene would convert into vitamin A and help keep health vision, skin, and mucosa.
      With a rich source of vitamins B, especial B12 which is almost only in meals (animal livers),
      1.2 grams of Spirulina platensis daily uptake would be sufficient for a human daily need, and
      also be a very good source for vegetarians. The investigators add the B12 test in this trial
      as a secondary endpoint to help monitor the absorption rates of the Spirulina platensis in
      human. Otherwise, the plant pigments in Spirulina platensis would also have many
      bioactivities on human healthy. Among these bio-activities of Spirulina platensis would
      contain anti-virus, anti-cancer, immune modulation, anti-inflammation, anti-oxidant, improve
      liver abnormality, and liver cirrhosis abilities. As previous small scale of clinical trial
      results in HBV patients provided by Far East Bio-Tec Company, lamivudine combined with oral
      Spirulina platensis would also improve the sero-conversion rates of HBeAg.

Hence, the investigators would like to see if the investigators could improve sero-conversion rates much faster by taking double dose of Spirulina platensis.</description>
