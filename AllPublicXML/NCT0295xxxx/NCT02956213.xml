      The investigators will conduct a randomized, controlled, double-blind, crossover trial to
      determine whether the presence of a portable high-efficiency indoor air filter in the bedroom
      reduces respiratory symptoms in former smokers compared with placebo. The primary outcomes
      will be change in St. George's Respiratory Questionnaire - COPD (SGRQ-C) score associated
      with using a portable high-efficiency indoor air filter during the study period. Secondary
      outcomes of COPD exacerbations and hospitalizations, daily step counts, medication changes,
      spirometry, and cardiovascular outcomes will also be assessed.

      Hypothesis/Research Questions:

      This study will determine whether the presence of a portable high-efficiency indoor air
      filter in the bedroom improves respiratory symptoms (based on St. George's Respiratory
      Questionnaire - COPD - SGRQ-C score) during a period of high air pollution compared with
      placebo in former smokers with respiratory symptoms.

      The primary outcome will be the change in SGRQ-C score associated with using a portable
      high-efficiency indoor air filter during the study period.

      Secondary outcomes will assess the effect of using a portable high-efficiency indoor air
      filter on healthcare utilization, other symptom scores, COPD exacerbation frequency,
      medication use, median daily step counts, inflammatory markers, oxygenation, indoor
      particulate counts and indoor-outdoor particulate count difference, and pulmonary function
      tests.

      Baseline descriptive statistics will report baseline air filter type, duration of use, and
      particulate weight prior to study enrollment.

      Evaluation of change in symptom scores and other secondary outcomes from baseline to study
      air filter (Visit 1 vs. Visit 2).

    <description>Whether median daily step counts are affected by air pollution levels, or correlate with other metrics of COPD outcomes remains unknown and thus, step counts will be tracked.</description>

    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>This is a common office test used to assess how well the lungs work by measuring how much air the patients inhale, how much they exhale, and how quickly they exhale.
We will also perform pulse oximetry and a blood draw to assess inflammatory markers and basic labs.
COPD sufferers experience inflammation due to their disease. Inflammatory markers will be documented during their clinic visits.</description>

    <description>Spirometry will be used to assess how well a subject's lungs work by measuring how much air is inhaled, how much is exhaled and how quickly you exhale. Spirometry is used to diagnose COPD and tracks it's progression or improve.</description>
