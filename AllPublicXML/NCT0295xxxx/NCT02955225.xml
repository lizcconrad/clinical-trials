      The purpose of this study is to determine whether use of a pressure-detecting shoe improve
      can enhance favorable loading conditions at the knee.

      This is a randomized longitudinal proof-of-concept study. After a telephone prescreening, an
      in-person visit will screen for inclusion and exclusion criteria, requiring a clinical and
      radiographic assessment. A total of 40 subjects with symptomatic and radiographic medial knee
      OA will be enrolled in the study after obtaining informed consent. A total of three study
      visits will occur at the following time points: baseline, 3 weeks, and 6 weeks. At all three
      visits, the following outcome variables will be acquired: (1) joint loads during gait using
      3D motion analysis and (2) knee symptoms, stiffness, pain, daily function, recreational
      function, and quality of life using the validated questionnaires. At the baseline visit,
      every participant will receive a standardized shoe and a pressure-detecting shoe insole.
      Randomly assigned to one of two groups, participants assigned to group A (n=25) will train
      for 3 weeks in the mobility shoe with active pressure-based feedback from the shoe insole,
      and group B (n=15) will train for three weeks in the mobility shoe with a passive shoe
      insole. All subjects will be encouraged to wear the study shoes containing the shoe insoles
      as their primary form of footwear and for a minimum of 6 hours/day, 6 days/week. They will be
      given a diary to record the daily time spent wearing the shoe/insole, daily analgesic
      history, and adverse events. These diaries will be reviewed at the 3 and 6 week study visits.
      After completing the third visit, subjects will have completed the study.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Able and willing to give informed consent and comply with the study protocol.

          -  Symptomatic OA of the knee greater than 3 months, as defined by the American College
             of Rheumatology's Clinical Criteria for Classification and Reporting of OA of the
             Knee. If symptoms are bilateral, then the knee identified as more symptomatic will
             serve as the index knee.

          -  Ambulatory knee pain, defined as the presence of greater than 30 mm of pain while
             walking on a flat surface (corresponding to question 1 of the visual analog format of
             the WOMAC).

          -  Radiographic OA of the study knee of grade 2 or 3, as defined by the modified Kellgren
             and Lawrence (K-L) grading scale.

          -  Medial compartment OA, defined as either qualitative joint space narrowing of â‰¥ 1or
             the presence of medial bone cyst, sclerosis, or osteophyte.

          -  Able to walk at least 10 minutes without a break.

          -  Age of 40 years or older

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Unwillingness to wear study shoes for at least 6 hours/day for 6 days of the week

          -  Knee flexion contracture of &gt; 15 degrees or inability to ambulate without assistance.

          -  Presence of clinical OA of the ankle or hip or ankle/hip pain&gt;10 mm (WOMAC).

          -  Predominant lateral compartment OA, defined as narrowing of the lateral joint space in
             excess of the narrowing of the medial joint space in either knee.

          -  Concurrent systemic inflammatory arthropathy

          -  Prior knee or hip arthroplasty, or surgical arthroscopy within the previous 3 months.

          -  Intrinsic foot disease: hallux rigidus, hallux abducto-valgus, metatarsalgia, plantar
             fasciitis, peripheral neuropathy, or any foot condition that may be exacerbated
             particular footwear.

          -  Intra-articular knee injection: steroids within 6 wks, hyaluronan derivatives within 4
             mos.
