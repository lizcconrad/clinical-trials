      This is a pilot trial to explore the cardiovascular of eight weeks of twice weekly high
      intensity interval training in people with progressive multiple sclerosis. A control group of
      people with progressive multiple sclerosis will undergo continuous moderate intensity
      exercise, twice weekly for 8 weeks.

      This is a pilot trial to explore the cardiovascular of eight weeks of twice weekly high
      intensity interval training in people with progressive multiple sclerosis. A control group of
      people with progressive multiple sclerosis will undergo continuous moderate intensity
      exercise, twice weekly for 8 weeks.

      The training program will entail 6x1.5 minute intervals working at 80-95% heart rate max on a
      cycle ergometer. Each interval will be interspersed with 1.5 minutes of working rest at a
      light resistance of the participant's choosing.

      The continuous moderate intensity exercise program will entail 20 minutes on a cycle
      ergometer working at 60-70% heart rate max.

          -  Weighing more than 110 kg (weight limit of ergometer)

          -  Any pathology or medical intervention that would preclude high intensity exercise,
             maximal exertion testing or could attenuate the cardiovascular effect of exercise
             including but not limited to: unstable angina; diabetes; peripheral vascular disease
             or intermittent claudication; having a pace maker or medicine pump; surgical clips;
             having another neurological condition other than MS; and pregnancy. To be established
             from patient's notes and at screening session.

          -  A serious cardiovascular event in the past year including but not limited to:
             transient ischaemic attack, cerebrovascular event and myocardial infarction.

          -  Taking any of the following medication: beta blockers; vasodilators; ACE inhibitors;
             diuretics or any other medication that could cause exercise induced hypotension;
             hypoglycaemic insulin; metformin or other oral insulin medicine.
