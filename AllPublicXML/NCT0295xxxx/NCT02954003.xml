  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to collect clinical data to support the use of the ValenTx Endo
      Bypass System to improve weight loss and the resolution of comorbidities in obese subjects.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      -  Single-arm, non-randomized, open-label, multi-center trial conducted in up to 70
           subjects to assess the safety and efficacy of the ValenTx Endo Bypass System over
           implant duration of up to 36 months.

        -  Body weight, adverse events and device function in implanted subjects will be monitored
           at monthly visits for the first year after implant, at quarterly visits during the
           second year, and biannually during the third year.

        -  Additional follow-up data will include vital signs, hip and waist circumference, blood
           lab tests, endoscopic assessments of the condition of the implanted device, and a
           quality of life questionnaire.

        -  All subjects will be followed for 12 months after device removal with scheduled visits
           at 1, 6 and 12 months after explant.

        -  Subject participation may last up to four years, but is expected to vary with implant
           duration, which will be determined on a case-by-case basis based on the condition of the
           implanted device.
