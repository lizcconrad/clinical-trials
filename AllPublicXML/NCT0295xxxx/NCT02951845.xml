  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to assess the oral bioavailability of the two tablet formulations
      of JNJ-54416076 relative to the suspension formulation and to investigate the effect of a
      high fat meal on the pharmacokinetics of the tablet formulation in healthy participants.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Before randomization, a woman must be: 1) Postmenopausal, defined as a) Greater than
             (&gt;) 45 years of age with amenorrhea for greater than or equal to (&gt;=)18 months, or b)
             &gt; 45 years of age with amenorrhea for at least 6 months and lesser than (&lt;)18 months
             and a serum follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) level &gt;40 International units per liter
             (IU/L), or 2) Surgically sterile due to a hysterectomy, or bilateral oophorectomy, or
             bilateral tubal occlusion/ligation procedures, and 3) All women must have a negative
             serum pregnancy test at Screening; and on Day -1 at each treatment period

          -  Men (including those who have had vasectomies) must agree to use condoms even if their
             partner is pregnant (this is to ensure that the fetus is not exposed to the study drug
             through vaginal absorption) and to not donate sperm during the study and for 3 months
             after receiving the last dose of study drug. Male participants should encourage their
             female partner to use an effective method (for example (eg), prescription oral
             contraceptives, contraceptive injections, intrauterine device, and contraceptive
             patch) of contraception in addition to the condom used by the male study participant

          -  Healthy on the basis of physical examination, medical history, vital signs, clinical
             laboratory tests, and 12-lead electrocardiograms (ECGs) performed. If any of the
             results are abnormal, the participant may be included only if the investigator judges
             that the abnormalities or deviations from normal are not clinically significant except
             for liver function and hematology tests. This determination must be recorded in the
             participant's source documents and initialed by the investigator

          -  Body Mass Index (BMI) between 18.5 and 29.9 kilogram per square meter
             (kg/m^2)(inclusive) and body weight &gt;= 50 kilograms

          -  Blood pressure (after the participant is sitting for 5 minutes) between 90 and 140
             millimeter of mercury (mmHg) systolic, inclusive, and between 50 and 90 mmHg
             diastolic, inclusive at Screening and on Days -2 and -1 of Period 1. If blood pressure
             is out of range, up to 2 repeated assessments are permitted

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  History of, or currently active, significant illness or medical disorders, including
             (but not limited to) cardiovascular disease (including cardiac arrhythmias, myocardial
             infarction, stroke, peripheral vascular disease), endocrine or metabolic disease (eg,
             hyper/hypo-thyroidism), hematological disease (eg, von Willebrand's disease or other
             bleeding disorders), respiratory disease, hepatic or gastrointestinal disease,
             neurological or psychiatric disease, ophthalmologic disorders (including retinal
             disorders or cataracts), neoplastic disease, skin disorder, renal disorder, or any
             other illness that the investigator considers should exclude the participant or that
             could interfere with the interpretation of the study results

          -  History of Gilbert's disease, Dubin-Johnson or Rotor syndrome, or any family history
             of liver or gallbladder disease that may suggest an underlying genetic disorder

          -  Aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT),
             gamma-glutamyltransferase (GGT), bilirubin levels (indirect, or direct), or alkaline
             phosphatase above the upper limit of normal (ULN) of the clinical laboratory's
             reference range at Screening or at Day -1 of Period 1

          -  Hemoglobin, hematocrit, or red blood cell count below the lower limit of normal of the
             clinical laboratory's reference range at Screening. On Day -1 of Period 1, if
             participants have hemoglobin, hematocrit, or red blood cell count below the lower
             limit of normal of the laboratory's reference range, the participants may be included
             if the investigator judges that the abnormalities or deviations from the reference are
             not clinically significant

          -  History of cholecystectomy or gallbladder disease

          -  Known allergies, hypersensitivity, or intolerance to any of the excipients of the
             formulation

          -  Any condition for which, in the opinion of the investigator, participation would not
             be in the best interest of the participant (for example, compromise the well-being) or
             that could prevent, limit, or confound the protocol-specified assessments
