    <textblock>
      This is a phase 1, Open-label, multicenter Dose Escalation study of BTP-114, a novel platinum
      product, in patients with advanced solid tumors and BRCA or other DNA repair mutation. This
      clinical study is comprised of 2 sequential parts: Part 1 (Dose Escalation) and Part 2
      (Expansion). The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety, pharmacokinetics and the
      anti-cancer activity of BTP-114.
