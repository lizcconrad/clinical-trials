  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess feasibility of using wearable sensors to capture
      objective assessments of patient's activity and sleep quality during the spinal cord
      stimulation (SCS) treatment continuum.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Eligible patients will undergo standard clinical care using BurstDR SCS and will be asked to
      wear a wrist worn accelerometer for a baseline period, during SCS trial and for 3 months
      after activation of the SCS stimulation.
