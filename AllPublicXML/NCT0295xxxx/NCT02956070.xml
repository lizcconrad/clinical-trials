      Clinical randomized, triple-blind, used to measure the level of tooth sensitivity on
      volunteers using a modified virtual analog scale (VAS). Sixty-six volunteers will be selected
      and recruited, following inclusion criteria and pre-established exclusion. All volunteers
      will be guided and sign a term of clarification and consent. Volunteers will be randomly
      divided into two groups: the control group to receive placebo capsules and application of
      desensitizing gel containing 6% potassium nitrate and 0.10% fluoro- (conventional treatment)
      and the experimental group will receive the anti-inflammatory corticosteroids (dexamethasone,
      capsule - 8mg) and application of a placebo gel. Patients will be treated in two clinical
      sessions with an interval of 7 days (one week) between them. The protocol for use of the
      product is as follows: The volunteers in the experimental group will receive six capsules of
      dexamethasone 8 mg each to be administered orally, initially two days before the first
      bleaching query as follows: 8 mg (1 capsule) 9 am in the morning two days before the first
      clinical session whitening; 8 mg (1 capsule) the 9 am to 1 day before the first practice
      session whitening, 8 mg (1 capsule) to 9 am on the day of the first practice session of
      whitening. After 7 days (one week), the same protocol will be held for the second and final
      practice session office bleaching.

      The experimental design will follow the consolidated standards for test reports (CONSORT).
      After approval by the Ethics Committee for Research duly registered, the trial will be
      conducted in the clinic of dental school at the Federal Fluminense University located in Nova
      Friburgo.Every Health Institute participants will be informed about the nature and objectives
      of the study.It will be one test study Clinical randomized, parallel, triple-blind, used to

      am to 1 day before the first practice session whitening, 8 mg (1 capsule) to 9 am on the day
      of the first practice session of whitening. After 7 days (one week), the same protocol will
