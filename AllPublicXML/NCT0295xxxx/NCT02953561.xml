  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This clinical research study has 2 parts: Part A and Part B.

      The goal of Part A is to find the highest tolerable dose of avelumab that can be given in
      combination with 5-azacytidine to patients with relapsed or refractory AML. The goal of Part
      B is to learn if the highest tolerable dose of this drug combination found in Part A can help
      to control the disease.

      The safety of this drug combination will also be studied in both parts of the study.

      This is an investigational study. Avelumab is not FDA approved or commercially available. It
      is currently being used for research purposes only. 5-azacytidine is FDA approved for the
      treatment of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). Its use in combination with avelumab is
      investigational. The study doctor can explain how the study drugs are designed to work.

      Up to 58 participants will be enrolled in this study. All will take part at MD Anderson.

      Study Groups:

      If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will be assigned to a study
      part and dose level of avelumab based on when you join this study.

      If you are in Part A (Phase 1B), you will be assigned a dose level of avelumab. Up to 4 dose
      levels of avelumab will be tested. Up to 18 participants will be enrolled at each dose level.
      If intolerable side effects are seen in the participants who received the highest dose level,
      the next group of participants will receive a lower dose than the group before it. This will
      continue until the highest tolerable dose of avelumab is found.

      If you are in Part B (Phase 2), you will receive the highest tolerable dose of avelumab that
      was found in Part A. Up to 40 participants will be enrolled in Part B.

      If you are a Phase 1B participant and are receiving a lower dose of avelumab when the Phase 2
      dose is found, your dose may be increased to the Phase 2 dose (but not higher).

      All participants will receive the same dose level of 5-azacytidine.

      Study Drug Administration:

      Each study cycle is 28 days.

      You will receive 5-azacytidine either by vein over about 10-40 minutes or as an injection
      under the skin on Days 1-7 or Days 1-5 and 8-9 of each cycle.

      You will receive avelumab by vein over 60 minutes on Days 1 and 14 of each cycle during
      Cycles 1-4, or until the disease is in complete remission (has completely disappeared),
      whichever comes first. When the disease is in complete remission, you will receive avelumab
      by vein only on Day 1 of each cycle. Your health will be checked for up to 2 hours after the
      infusion.

      You will be given standard drugs to help decrease the risk of side effects. You may ask the
      study staff for information about how the drugs are given and their risks.

      Length of Study:

      You may receive the study drugs for up to 24 cycles, or for as long as the doctor thinks it
      is in your best interest. You will no longer be able to take the study drugs if the disease
      gets worse, if intolerable side effects occur, or if you are unable to follow study
      directions.

      Your participation on the study will be over after the follow-up visits.

      Study Visits:

      On Day 1 of each cycle, you will have a physical exam, EKG, and blood/urine will be collected
      for routine tests.

      Twice weekly for Cycles 1-3, and then every 2-4 weeks after that, blood (about 1-2 teaspoons)
      will be drawn for routine tests.

      On Day 28 of Cycle 1 and then every 1-4 cycles after that, you will have a bone marrow
      aspirate for cytogenetic testing and to check the status of the disease. Your doctor will
      tell you when you will have this procedure.

      After the first cycle of treatment, you may be able to receive the 5-azacytidine injections
      or infusions at an outside clinic close to home.

      End-of-Study Visit:

      About 30 days after your last dose of study drugs:

        -  You will have a physical exam.

        -  Blood (about 1-2 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests.

        -  If the doctor thinks it is needed, you will have a bone marrow aspirate for cytogenetic
           testing and to check the status of the disease.

      Follow-Up:

      Every 3-6 months for up to 5 years after the last dose of study drugs:

        -  You will have a physical exam.

        -  Blood (about 1-2 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests.

      If the doctor thinks it is needed and the disease has not gotten worse, you may have a bone
      marrow aspirate every 6-12 months for 5 years after your last dose of the study drug.

      If you cannot come to the clinic for these follow-up visits, you may be called by a member of
      the study staff to ask how you are doing. These calls should last about 10 minutes each time.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients with AML who are refractory (up to salvage 2) or relapsed (up to 2nd
             relapse). For patients with prior MDS or chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) or MPN
             who transformed to AML, therapy received for MDS, CMML, or MPN is NOT considered as
             prior therapy for AML.

          2. Prior therapy with hydroxyurea, chemotherapy, biological or targeted therapy (e.g.
             FLT3 inhibitors, other kinase inhibitors), or hematopoietic growth factors is allowed.

          3. Age &gt;/=18 years.

          4. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance Status &lt;/=2.

          5. Adequate organ function: total bilirubin &lt;/= 1.5 times upper limit of normal (x ULN)
             (&lt;/= 3 x ULN if considered to be due to leukemic involvement or Gilbert's syndrome);
             aspartate aminotransferase or alanine aminotransferase &lt;/= 2.5 x ULN (&lt;/= 5.0 x ULN if
             considered to be due to leukemic involvement).

          6. Adequate renal function defined by an estimated creatinine clearance &gt;/= 30 mL/min
             according to the Cockcroft-Gault formula (or local institutional standard method).

          7. Patients must provide written informed consent.

          8. In the absence of rapidly progressing disease, the interval from prior treatment to
             time of initiation of 5-azacytidine and avelumab will be at least 14 days OR at least
             5 half-lives for cytotoxic/noncytotoxic agents, whichever is longer. The toxicity from
             prior therapy should have resolved to Grade &lt;/= 1, however alopecia and sensory
             neuropathy Grade &lt;/=2 is acceptable. The half-life for the therapy in question will be
             based on published pharmacokinetic literature (abstracts, manuscripts, investigator
             brochure's, or drug-administration manuals) and will be documented in the protocol
             eligibility document.

          9. Continued from 8) : Since the effect of both avelumab and 5-azacytidine may be
             delayed, use of one hydroxyurea for patients with rapidly proliferative disease is
             allowed before the start of study therapy and will not require a washout. Concurrent
             therapy for CNS prophylaxis or continuation of therapy for controlled CNS disease is
             permitted. Patients with CNS disease or leukemic brain metastasis must have been
             treated locally and be clinically stable for at least 2 weeks prior to enrollment and
             have no ongoing neurological symptoms that are related to the CNS disease (sequelae
             that are a consequence of the treatment of the CNS disease are acceptable).

         10. Females must be surgically or biologically sterile or postmenopausal (amenorrheic for
             at least 12 months) or if of childbearing potential, must have a negative serum or
             urine pregnancy test within 72 hours before the start of the treatment.

         11. Women of childbearing potential must agree to use an adequate method of contraception
             during the study and until 3 months after the last treatment. Males must be surgically
             or biologically sterile or agree to use an adequate method of contraception during the
             study until 3 months after the last treatment.

         12. Continued from 11) : Adequate methods of contraception include: 1)Total abstinence
             when this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of the patient. Periodic
             abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, post-ovulation methods) and
             withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception. 2) Female sterilization (have
             had surgical bilateral oophorectomy with or without hysterectomy) or tubal ligation at
             least six weeks before taking study treatment. In case of oophorectomy alone, only
             when the reproductive status of the woman has been confirmed by follow up hormone
             level assessment 3) Male sterilization (at least 6 months prior to screening). For
             female patients on the study, the vasectomized male partner should be the sole partner
             for that patient.

         13. Continued: 4) Combination of any of the two following (a+b or a+c or b+c) a. Use of
             oral, injected or implanted hormonal methods of contraception or other forms of
             hormonal contraception that have comparable efficacy (failure rate &lt;1%), for example
             hormone vaginal ring or transdermal hormone contraception b. Placement of an
             intrauterine device (IUD) or intrauterine system (IUS) c. Barrier methods of
             contraception: Condom or Occlusive cap (diaphragm or cervical/vault caps) with
             spermicidal foam/gel/film/cream/ vaginal suppository In case of use of oral
             contraception, women should have been stable on the same pill before taking study
             treatment. Note: Oral contraceptives are allowed but should be used in conjunction
             with a barrier method of contraception due to unknown effect of drug-drug interaction.

         14. Continued: Women are considered post-menopausal and not of child bearing potential if
             they have had 12 months of natural (spontaneous) amenorrhea with an appropriate
             clinical profile (e.g. age appropriate, history of vasomotor symptoms) or have had
             surgical bilateral oophorectomy (with or without hysterectomy) or tubal ligation at
             least six weeks ago. In the case of oophorectomy alone, only when the reproductive
             status of the woman has been confirmed by follow up hormone level assessment is she
             considered not of child bearing potential.

        Exclusion Criteria:
