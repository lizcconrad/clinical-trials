  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the long-term safety and tolerability of
      BIIB074 in participants with neuropathic Pain From Lumbosacral Radiculopathy (PLSR). A
      secondary objective is to investigate the maintenance of effect during long-term treatment
      with BIIB074 in participants with neuropathic PLSR. For all efficacy assessments, baseline
      will be prior to randomization into Study 1014802-203. Another secondary objective is to
      evaluate the impact of treatment with BIIB074 on quality of life (QoL).
