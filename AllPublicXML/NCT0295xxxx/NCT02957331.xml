  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is test the effect of beta-adrenergic blockade on mortality in
      patients with traumatic brain injury with the hypothesis being that the addition of beta
      blockade to the treatment regime of this patient population will lower mortality and supress
      the catecholamine surge that accompanies traumatic brain injury as compared to those who do
      not receive beta blockade.

      Half the patients will be randomized to receive propranolol and half will be randomized to
      receive no beta blocker.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The use of Beta-adrenergic blockade is not currently the standard of care of patients with
      traumatic brain injury. Traumatic brain injury is a common problem in our society with
      greater than 1.5 million cases occurring annually and over 50,000 deaths per year in the
      civilian population in the United States. Medical therapy has long consisted of monitoring
      intracranial pressure and supportive measures designed to limit intracranial pressure. Two
      retrospective observational studies completed at the University of Tennessee demonstrate that
      the addition of beta-adrenergic blockage to the treatment of the traumatic brain injury
      lessens mortality. The basis for conducting this study was established by retrospective data
      showing no harm to patients receiving Inderal and potential benefit. Available data,
      including data from the University of Tennessee, are retrospective and are limited to simple
      exposure to the drug. The proposed study will attempt to further quantify the effect by
      dosing with the drug to actual beta-blockade instead of simple exposure to the drug.

      The effect of propranolol at the dosing levels used in this research will be determined by
      measurement of urinary catecholamines in both study arms and comparison of the actual effect
      of the drug on the catecholamine surge that occurs following traumatic brain injury will be
      determined.

      Additionally, the effect of healthcare disparities on outcomes in patients with traumatic
      brain injury will be measured. Outcomes will be stratified by payer status and ethnicity to
      determine the effect each of these variables has on outcomes.

    <description>One half of qualifying and consenting subjects will be randomized to receive propranolol. This group will receive study drug 3 times daily (every 8 hours) starting at 20 mg. The dosage may be increased by up to 60 mg/day divided over three daily doses (or an additional 20 mg/dose) as necessary until the heart rate is less than 100. Study drug will be held for hypotension (systolic &lt;100) or bradycardia (heart rate &lt;60 beats per minute). The maximum daily dose for the treatment of hypertension of 640 mg will not be exceeded in this study.</description>

    <description>Non beta blockade arm will receive standard of care treatment and will not receive beta blockade. If a subject randomized to no Inderal develops hypertension and increased heart rate, he/she will be treated according to standard of care by the trauma team caring for the patient.</description>
