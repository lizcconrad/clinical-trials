    <textblock>
      This study is to verify the short-term efficacy and long-term prognosis of thulium laser
      resection compared with conventional transurethral resection of non-muscular invasive bladder
      cancer. Half of participants will receive thulium laser resection of bladder cancer, while
      the other half will receive electrical transurethral resection of bladder cancer.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Pathological or histological diagnosis of primary non-muscle invasive bladder
             urothelial carcinoma (TaTisT1);

          2. Imaging examinations showed the bladder muscle has not been affected, no lymph node
             metastasis or distant metastasis;

          3. Patients who agree to TURBT surgery, and will be effected to the postoperative
             follow-up treatment such as conventional infusion after the operation;

          4. Function of main organs (heart, liver, lung, kidney) should be normal, PS score 0-2;

          5. Bladder capacityâ‰¥ 200ml.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Find distant metastasis ,infiltration of the surrounding organs or relapse before
             operation.Metastatic bladder cancer or other cancers involve the bladder;

          2. Received chemotherapy or BCG perfusion therapy in the nearly 3 months;

          3. Patients who can not tolerate the serious side effects during the bladder perfusion
             treatment process (bladder irritation and other symptoms);

          4. Patients during pregnancy ,critical care patients and patients who have other cases of
             surgical contraindications.Such as serious cardiovascular disease,coagulation
             abnormalities,non-transitional epithelial tumors( such as adenocarcinoma and squamous
             cell carcinoma),acute cystitis,can not be supine because of spinal deformity,untreated
             urethral stricture.
