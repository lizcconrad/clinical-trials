  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is a 'pilot study' to assess the effect of a mindfulness-based stress reduction
      (MBSR) intervention on patients with autoimmune liver disease specifically autoimmune
      hepatitis type I. MBSR is a standardized intervention that has shown benefit in addiction
      disorders and other psychiatric disorders. There has been no study evaluating or showing the
      benefit of the use of MBSR in autoimmune liver disease. With published data showing the
      evidence of an association of stress and relapse in autoimmune hepatitis, it is hypothesized
      that such an intervention such as MBSR may have therapeutic effect in patients with
      autoimmune liver disease.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      With the understanding that autoimmune hepatitis has a relationship with psychological
      stress, the use of a strategy such as mindfulness stress based reduction (MBSR) may similarly
      have a substantial impact as seen in other disease conditions. The proposed hypothesis is
      that undergoing MBSR has potential to benefit patients with autoimmune hepatitis in relation
      to decreased relapse rate and ultimately improved quality of life.

      The focus of this study is surrounding the possibility of psychosocial stress for relapse in
      AIH. The investigators, however, would like to also understand the role of serological
      testing at the time of these relapses and during states of psychosocial stress to demonstrate
      if the association can be found. During active disease activity or relapses of autoimmune
      hepatitis, there is an expected rise in alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and immunoglobulin G
      (IgG) levels. Demonstrating the correlation of ALT and IgG with disease status and possible
      improvement with stress modifications is also key for this proposed study.

    <measure>Change in Subjective Stress: The Perceived Stress Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Subjective Stress: The Perceived Stress Scale, a 14-item self-report scale that assesses the degree to which individuals appraise situations in their lives as stressful, will be used to assess subjective interpretation of stress and assign subjects to the low stress or high stress condition. Scale It has excellent test-retest reliability and good construct validity and has been used with adults and adolescents.
Scale ranges from 0 to 40. A higher score indicates higher stress.</description>

    <measure>Change in Recent Life Stress: Life Experience Survey</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The LES is a widely used 57 item self-report measure. It shows convergent validity with personality measures (e.g., anxiety) and is not correlated with social desirability measures.
Scale ranges from -250 to +250. A higher score indicates higher stress.</description>

    <measure>Daily Hassles Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>This self-report item measures how stressful subjects perceived situations occurring in the past year of their life.
Scale ranges from 0 to 351. A higher score indicates higher stress.</description>

    <measure>The Brief Self-Control Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Brief Self-Control Scale will be used to measure self-reported self-control and impulsivity. The BSCS also shows good internal consistency (alphas = .83 - .84) and high retest reliability (.87).
Scale ranges from 13-65. A higher score indicates better self-control.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in ALT levels and IgG levels</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Abnormal AST and ALT will be defined as &gt;2x upper limits of normal
Normal Lab ranges that will be used are the following:
AST (0 - 34 U/L)
ALT (0 - 34 U/L)
IgG (355 - 1887 mg/dL)
These levels are used together for clinical significance and diagnosis.</description>

    <measure>Change in number of relapses</measure>

    <description>Relapse is defined in one of two ways once immunosuppression has been tapered off:
I. An increase in the AST or ALT ≥2 X ULN (upper limit of normal) II. An increase in AST and/or ALT ≥ 2 X the prior level of AST or ALT on routine labs checked at start of clinical study</description>
