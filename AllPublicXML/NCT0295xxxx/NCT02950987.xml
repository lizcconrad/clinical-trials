      This study is evaluating Whole Body MRI as a possible screening tool to diagnose cancer for
      people with LFS and other inherited cancer predisposition syndromes.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Individuals who carry the TP53 mutation have a higher risk of developing different types of
      cancer over their lifetimes. This gene has been associated with Li Fraumeni syndrome in some
      families, but not all families that have cancer histories consistent with Li Fraumeni
      syndrome will have the mutation. Currently, there is no standard method of monitoring LFS
      carriers, family members, or others individuals with cancer predisposition syndromes to
      detect cancers in the early stages, when they may be more easily treated.

      The main aim of the study is to test a relatively new medical technology called Whole Body
      Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), in patients with these syndromes, to see if cancers can be
      detected at an early stage which may, in turn, allow for more effective treatment. The
      investigators have chosen Whole Body MRI scanning because this scan allows doctors to look at
      the entire body in one examination. By using this technology, participants are not exposed to
      radiation, which is of particular importance for individuals who have a higher cancer risk
      due to a diagnosis of LFS.
