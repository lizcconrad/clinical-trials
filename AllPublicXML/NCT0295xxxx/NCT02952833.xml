    <textblock>
      This study is a study to evaluate the safety of ZPIV. Three dose levels may be evaluated. The
      entire duration of each subject's participation is approximately 14 months including
      recruitment and collection of data on the safety and reactogenicity of the study vaccine and
      samples for the assessment of immunogenicity. This study is expected to take approximately 30
      months to complete from initiation through availability of a final report on the primary
      outcomes of safety and the secondary outcomes of humoral immunity to ZIKV. The Primary
      objectives of this study are to 1. Assess the safety and reactogenicity of a homologous prime
      boost regimen of ZPIV given at three different dose levels and 2. Compare the safety and
      reactogenicity profile of ZPIV after each vaccination and between dosage groups.

      This study is a single-center, double-blinded, placebo-controlled, Phase 1 study to evaluate
      the safety, reactogenicity, and immunogenicity of ZPIV administered in a homologous
      prime-boost regimen to Flavivirus-naïve healthy male and non-pregnant female adult subjects.
      Three dose levels may be evaluated: 5.0 mcg, 2.5 mcg and 10mcg of ZPIV. Each subject will
      receive either placebo or ZPIV administered by intramuscular (IM) injection on Days 1 and 29.
      The study will consist of a screening period of up to 28 days, a vaccination period in which
      subjects will receive a prime dose of vaccine on Day 1 followed by a boost on Day 29, and a
      follow-up period of 12 months post boost vaccination. The entire duration of each subject's
      participation is approximately 14 months including recruitment and collection of data on the
      safety and reactogenicity of the study vaccine and samples for the assessment of
      immunogenicity. This study is expected to take approximately 30 months to complete from
      initiation through availability of a final report on the primary outcomes of safety and the
      secondary outcomes of humoral immunity to ZIKV. The Primary objectives of this study are to
      1. Assess the safety and reactogenicity of a homologous prime boost regimen of ZPIV given at
      three different dose levels, and 2. Compare the safety and reactogenicity profile of ZPIV
      after each vaccination and between dosage groups. The secondary objectives of this study are
      to 1. Assess the humoral immune response overall and by dosage group to a homologous
      prime-boost regimen of ZPIV as determined by kinetics of the immune responses, seroconversion
      rates, and peak Geometric Mean Titer (GMT) and to 2. Assess the durability of the humoral
      immune response overall and by dosage group to ZPIV at 6 and 12 months after the second
      vaccine administration.

               -  Note: If laboratory screening tests are out of acceptable range, repeat of
                  screening tests is permitted once, provided there is an alternative explanation
                  for the out of range value

        Note 1: Good health is defined by the absence of any medical condition described in the
        exclusion criteria in a subject with a normal abbreviated physical exam and vital signs. If
        the subject has a preexisting condition not listed in exclusion criteria, it cannot meet
        any of the following criteria: 1) first diagnosed in last 3 months , 2) worsening in terms
        of clinical outcome in last 6 months; or 3) involves need for medication that may pose a
        risk to subject's safety or impede assessment of adverse events or immunogenicity if they
        participate in study Note 2: An abbreviated physical exam differs from a complete exam in
        that it does not include a genitourinary and rectal exam.

        Note 3: Vital signs must be normal by protocol toxicity grading scale or determined to be
        normal-variant by investigator. In the event of an abnormal heart rate or blood pressure
        due to physiological variation or activity, the subject may rest for 10 minutes in a quiet
        room, and then blood pressure and/or heart rate may be re-measured. Repeated vital signs
        may be used to determine eligibility 8. Women of childbearing potential* must have a
        negative serum pregnancy test at screening and a negative urine pregnancy test immediately
        prior to each vaccination

          -  Note: All female subjects are considered of childbearing potential unless
             postmenopausal or surgically sterilized and &gt;/=3 months have passed since
             sterilization procedure. Postmenopausal is defined as amenorrhea for &gt;/=12 months
             without an alternative medical cause. Permanent female sterilization procedures
             include tubal ligation, bilateral salpingectomy, hysterectomy, bilateral oophorectomy,
             or successful Essure placement.

             9. Women of childbearing potential must use an acceptable method of contraception*
             from one month (30 days) prior to the first vaccination until at least 60 days after
             the last vaccination.

          -  Acceptable methods of contraception include the following:

               -  Use highly effective contraceptive methods, defined by &lt;1% failure rate per year
                  independent of user adherence, including long-acting reversible contraception
                  (LARC): progestin-releasing subdermal implants and intrauterine devices (IUD), OR

               -  Use effective contraceptive methods, defined by 5-9% failure rate with typical
                  use and &lt;1% failure rate with consistent and correct use, including:

        prescription oral contraceptives, contraceptive injections, combined pill, progestin-only
        pill, hormone-releasing transdermal patch or vaginal ring, and depot medroxyprogesterone
        acetate injection (Depo-Provera), OR

          -  Male sex partners must have had a vasectomy &gt;/=3 months prior to first vaccination, OR

          -  Practice abstinence defined as refraining from heterosexual intercourse from 30 days
             before first vaccination until at least 60 days after 2nd vaccination 10. Female
             subjects must agree to not donate eggs (ova, oocytes) from the start of screening
             period until at least 60 days after receiving the last vaccination 11. Subjects must
             provide concurrent consent at the time of enrollment and 1st vaccination to future use
             of stored blood samples to measure immunity to ZIKV
