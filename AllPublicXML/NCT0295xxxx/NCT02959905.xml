             enrollment on this study and for up to twelve months after treatment.

          9. Women of child-bearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test because of the
             potentially dangerous effects of the treatment on the fetus.

             vitiligo).Note: Patients may have undergone minor surgical procedures within the past
             3 weeks, as long as all toxicities have recovered to grade 1 or less.

             an anti cancer immune response, including anti-PD1 antibody and anti-CTLA4 antibody
             therapy, so at the time the patient receives the preparative regimen to allow antibody
             levels to decline.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Women of child-bearing potential who are pregnant or breastfeeding because of the

             Disease).

          3. Concurrent opportunistic infections (The experimental treatment being evaluated in
             this protocol depends on an intact immune system. Patients who have decreased immune
             competence may be less responsive to the experimental treatment and more susceptible
             to its toxicities).

          4. The medical history of autoimmune disease.

          5. Active systemic infections, coagulation disorders or other active major medical
             illnesses of the cardiovascular, respiratory or immune system.

          6. Concurrent systemic steroid therapy.

             this study.

          8. Patients who generate level 3-4 correlation adverse reactions after anti-PD1/PDL1
             antibody treatment.

          9. Patients with brain metastases.
