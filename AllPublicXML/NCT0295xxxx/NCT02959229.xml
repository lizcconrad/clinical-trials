    <textblock>
      The present study was designed to evaluate the effectiveness of oral lactoferrin in
      prevention of neonatal sepsis with comparison early (1st day) versus late (48-72 hours)
      Lactoferrin administration, Secondary aim was to study effect of Lactoferrin administration
      on serum Ferritin and follow up long term outcome (Bronchopulmonary dysplasia, retinopathy of
      prematurity and necrotizing enterocolitis.

      This study was carried out on 180 preterm neonates(&lt; 37 weeks of gestation counting from the
      first day of the Last Menstrual Period and confirmed by Ballard score) admitted to the
      Neonatal Intensive Care Units of Ain Shams University Hospitals in the period from August
      2014 to December 2015.

      Enrolled subjects were further randomly subdivided into three groups according to the dose
      regimen of Lactoferrin supplementation.

        -  Group A: (60 preterm neonates) who received oral Lactoferrin supplementation in a dose
           of 100 mg/day starting on day 1 and continue for 4-6 weeks.

        -  Group B: (60 preterm neonates) who received oral Lactoferrin supplementation in a dose
           of 100 mg/day starting on day 3 (48hrs-72hrs) of life and continue for 4-6 weeks.

        -  Group C: (60 preterm neonates) who match the subjected neonates, received placebo in
           form of distilled water.
