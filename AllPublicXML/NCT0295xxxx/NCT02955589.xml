    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 2b, open-label, non-randomized, single arm study to evaluate the safety, and
      efficacy of HBI-8000 40 mg BIW in patients with relapsed or refractory ATL (R/R ATL). HBI
      8000 will be administered orally approximately 30 minutes after any regular meal twice a
      week. There will be 3 to 4 days between dosing. A treatment cycle is defined as 28
      consecutive days. HBI-8000 administration will be continued until disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicities are observed despite appropriate dose reduction or treatment
      interruption.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Histopathological, or cytological diagnosis of ATL confirmed as seropositive for
             anti-Human T-lymphotrophic Virus type-I (HTLV-I) antibody

          2. Acute, lymphoma or unfavorable chronic types. The unfavorable chronic type is defined
             by the presence of at least 1 of the following: serum albumin &lt;3.5 g/dL, lactic
             dehydrogenase (LDH) &gt;300 U/L, or blood urea nitrogen (BUN) &gt;25 mg/dL. The patient must
             have at least 1 of measurable lesion, or evaluable lesion in either of peripheral
             blood or skin

          3. Relapsed or refractory disease after receiving prior systemic therapy with
             mogamulizumab, or ≥1 prior systemic therapy with cytotoxic chemotherapy in case of
             intolerance/contraindication for mogamulizumab. And there is no other available
             treatment which can be considered appropriate for patients

          4. Male or female, aged 20 years or older

          5. ECOG Performance Status of 0-2

          6. Life expectancy of greater than 3 months

          7. Meeting the following laboratory criteria for screening:

               -  Absolute Neutrophil Count &gt;1500/µL independent of growth factor support within 7
                  days of starting the study drug

               -  Platelets &gt;75,000/µL independent of transfusion within 14 days of starting the
                  study drug

               -  Hgb &gt;8 g/dL independent of transfusion within 14 days of starting the study drug

               -  Serum creatinine &lt; upper limit of normal (ULN)

               -  Serum aspartate aminotransferase/glutamyl oxaloacetic transaminase (AST/SGOT) and
                  alanine aminotransferase/glutamyl pyruvic transaminase (ALT/SGPT) less than or
                  equal to 3 X ULN

               -  Serum Bilirubin less than or equal to 1.5 X ULN

          8. Negative serum pregnancy test for females of childbearing (reproductive) potential.
             Female patients of child bearing potential must use an effective method of birth
             control (e.g., hormonal contraceptive, intrauterine device, diaphragm with spermicide
             or condom with spermicide) during treatment period and 1 month thereafter; Males must
             use an effective method of birth control (2 barrier methods) during treatment period
             and 3 months thereafter.

             Note: Female patients will be considered to be women of childbearing potential unless
             having undergone permanent contraception or postmenopausal. Postmenopausal is defined
             as at least 12 months without menses with no other medical reasons (e.g., chemical
             menopause because of treatment with anti-malignant tumor agents).

             measurement) should be performed and if positive, the patient should be excluded from
             study

         10. Any history of testing positive for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) or known
