  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is aimed to determine the maximum tolerated dose of ensartinib, an oral ALK
      inhibitor in Chinese patients with ALK-positive non-small cell lung cancer
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The initial purpose of the study is to determine the largest amount of ensartinib that can be
      safely given to humans. An expansion phase will be conducted to assess the preliminary
      anti-tumor activity in ALK-positive non-small cell lung cancer once the recommended Phase 2
      dose has been established.

          -  For the expanded cohort portion of the study, patients must have NSCLC with ALK
             genomic alterations positive by FISH or IHC

          -  Eastern Cooperative Group ECOG) Performance Status score of 0 or 1

          -  Adequate organ system function

          -  Male patients willing to use adequate contraceptive measures; female patients who are
             not of child-bearing potential, and female patients of child-bearing potential who
             agree to use adequate contraceptive measures

          -  Measurable disease per RECIST

          -  Willingness and ability to comply with the trial and follow-up procedures

          -  Written informed consents are required to indicate that the patients are aware of the
             investigational nature of the study

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Current use of anticancer therapy.

          -  Use of an investigational drug within 14 days or 5 half-lives (whichever is shorter)
             prior to the first dose of ensartinib

          -  Any major surgery, radiotherapy, or immunotherapy within the last 21 days.

          -  Chemotherapy regimens with delayed toxicity within the last 4 weeks.

          -  Chemotherapy regimens given continuously or on a weekly basis with limited potential
             for delayed toxicity within the last 2 weeks.

          -  Prior stem cell transplant

          -  Patients with a known allergy or delayed hypersensitivity reaction to drugs chemically
             related to ensartinib or to the active ingredient of ensartinib

          -  Prior use of ALK TKIs with the exception of crizotinib

          -  Primary CNS tumors or meningeal metastasis

             compliance with the protocol

          -  Concurrent condition evaluated by investigator would jeopardize compliance with the
             protocol or would impart excessive risk associated with study participation that would
             make it inappropriate for the patient to be enrolled

          -  Inability or unwillingness to comply with study and/or follow-up procedures outlined
             in the protocol
