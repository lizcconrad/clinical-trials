  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a nonrandomized, multi-site, open-label trial to evaluate a novel two-drug
      combination regimen (uprifosbuvir [MK-3682] 450 mg + ruzasvir [RZR; MK-8408] 180 mg once
      daily [q.d.] for 12 weeks) in male and female treatment-naïve (TN) or treatment-experienced
      (TE) participants with chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection genotype (GT) GT1, GT2, GT3,
      GT4, GT5, or GT6 who have not previously received HCV direct-acting antiviral (DAA) therapy.
      Cirrhotic (C) and non-cirrhotic (NC) participants with and without human immunodeficiency
      virus (HIV) co-infection will be enrolled.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Any GT that meets virologic futility criteria will be given the option of extending treatment
      with Uprifosbuvir + RZR to 16 weeks with ribavirin (RBV) added.
