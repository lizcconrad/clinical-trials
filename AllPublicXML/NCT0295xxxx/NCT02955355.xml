      The purpose of this study is to assess the long-term safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity
      of the subcutaneous (SC) treatment with Immune Globulin Subcutaneous (IGSC) facilitated with
      recombinant human hyaluronidase (rHuPH20) (HYQVIA/HyQvia) in participants with chronic
      inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy (CIDP) who have completed Baxalta Clinical
      Study Protocol 161403 Epoch 1 or Clinical Study Protocol 161601 without CIDP worsening.

             product (IP) or investigational device within 30 days prior to enrollment (with the
             exception of Study 161403 or Study 161601) or is scheduled to participate in another
             clinical study involving an IP or investigational device during the course of this
             study
