      Objectives - To evaluate the 4-year clinical outcomes of ceramic veneered Computer Aided
      Design/Computer Aided Manufacturing (CAD/CAM) Co-Cr single crowns supported by natural teeth
      in posterior regions.

      Material and methods - Eighty-nine patients were provided with 120 ceramic veneered CAD/CAM
      Co-Cr single crowns replacing either premolars and molars. Specific inclusion criteria were
      needed and tooth preparations were standardized and performed by 2 expert prosthodontists.
      CAD/CAM Co-Cr frameworks were fabricated and veneered with ceramics. The restorations were
      cemented using a eugenol-free zinc oxide luting agent. The patients were recalled after 1, 6,
      12, 24, 36 and 48 months. The survival and success of the restorations were evaluated. The
      technical and esthetic outcomes were examined using the United States Public Health Service
      criteria. The biologic outcomes were analyzed at abutment and contralateral teeth and
      descriptive statistics were performed.
