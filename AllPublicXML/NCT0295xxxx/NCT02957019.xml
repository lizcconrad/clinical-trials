      Phase I - Dose definition: A prospective, open-label, multi-center Phase I dose escalation
      study in which cohorts of 3-6 patients will receive escalating doses of L19-IL2 in
      combination with a fixed dose of Rituximab (375 mg/m2).

      Phase II - Activity Evaluation: Open-label, multi-center, prospective study during which 14
      enrolled patients will receive a fixed dose of Rituximab (375 mg/m2) in combination with
      L19-IL2 at the RD defined during the Phase I part of the study.

      The study is designed to establish whether L19-IL2, administered in combination with
      Rituximab is well tolerated and can achieve objective responses and clinical benefit to
      patients with relapsed or refractory DLBCL.

    <description>Phase I (Dose definition):
Cohorts of 3-6 patients will receive Rituximab on day 1 and 8 of the first 3-weeks cycle (C1D1 and C1D8, respectively) and on day 1 of the second 3-weeks cycle (C2D1). During two uninterrupted 3-weeks cycles, L19-IL2 will be administered on C1D1, C1D8, C1D15 and C2D1, C2D8, C2D15.
