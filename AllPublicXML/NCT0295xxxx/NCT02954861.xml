  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      'Post perfusion syndrome' was a term historically associated to cardiac surgery in view of
      the transient neuro-cognitive deficits attributed to cardio pulmonary bypass pump. During
      their recovery period, a significant number of patients experience delirium, a clinical
      syndrome of acute onset and fluctuant course.Though these deficits are often known to be
      transient without any permanent physical or neurological impairment, the experience can still
      psycho-socially affect these patients for a longer length of time even after discharge. The
      presence of delirium puts excessive, undesired strain on the patient, their families, health
      care providers and hospital resources.

      PTSS is an anxiety disorder caused by very stressful, frightening or distressing events. It
      is known to either develop immediately after the disturbing event or weeks and months later.
      The actual symptoms can be varied but are categorized in three sections: i.e.:
      re-experiencing, avoidance and emotional numbing and hyperarousal (feeling 'on edge').

      A problem that has such an impact on any patient is worth investigating and understood
      better. Being in such a unique professional position, as a Clinical nurse practitioner, the
      investigator is ideally placed to conduct this study. In this study, the researcher will be
      focusing on the pre-operative risk factors in developing delirium, actual incidence of
      delirium and follow the patients post operatively to evaluate the after effects of delirium
      in the form of PTSS.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Delirium is acute onset of fluctuant cognitive state. Post operative delirium is a
      historically known complication after cardiac surgery. In 2013, almost 900 heart operations
      were performed in a South East, Scottish Cardio Thoracic unit. and audit data shows that 45%
      of these patients developed post operative delirium.

      Multiple pre, post &amp; intra operative factors have been attributed to the development of
      delirium. Whatever the precipitating factors, delirium not only causes psychological distress
      to the patient but also their loved ones. In some cases this psychological upset continues to
      affect the patient even after discharge from the hospital referred to as post traumatic
      stress symptoms (PTSS). This study therefore aims to look at the extent and experience of
      post operative delirium in cardiac surgery patients.

      The study plans to recruit patients at a pre admission clinic where patient's baseline
      clinical data will be collected. They will also be provided with questionnaires to complete
      before the end of the clinic. This is to evaluate the participant's pre operative mood,
      cognitive status and social orientation. During their hospital stay following surgery the
      participants will be assessed routinely for delirium. If they are known to have suffered from
      delirium, they will be enrolled to phase 2 of the study.

      The consented patients will be seen at 6 week follow up clinic where they will be provided
      with a questionnaire to identify PTSS and also participate in a semi structured interview.
      Three months later the same will be repeated on telephone.

      Data analysis will help understand and explore this unfortunate patient experience.

        Following discussion with statisticians and viewing the sample sizes of previous related
        studies, it was suggested that minimum 200 patients will be required for phase I. This was
        based on the availability of data in a similar aspects of the study. But incidentally there
        has been no known study looking specifically at delirium and post traumatic stress symptoms
        in cardiac surgery patients. So the researcher aims to enrol at least 400 patients but may
        not be able to achieve this number by the end of data collection phase.

        Phase II will only have patients who develop delirium and convenient sampling will be
        applied for the interview section.
