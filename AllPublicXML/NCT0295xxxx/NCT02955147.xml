  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether ustekinumab is effective in the treatment
      of Giant Cell Arteritis (GCA)
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of ustekinumab, an
      interleukin (IL)-12/23 inhibitor, in patients with GCA

      Hypothesis IL-12/23 pathway blockade may maintain disease remission in patients with GCA

      Specific Aims

        -  To evaluate the safety and tolerability of ustekinumab administration in 20 patients
           with GCA

        -  To evaluate the efficacy of ustekinumab for remission maintenance and glucocorticoid
           sparing in 20 patients with GCA

    <description>Ustekinumab: 90 mg of ustekinumab will be administered subcutaneously at baseline, week 4, week 12, week 20, week 28, week 36 and week 44.
Prednisone: All patients will receive a prednisone course tapered according to predefined schedules starting at either 60 mg, 40 mg or 20 mg. The initial dose of prednisone will be chosen by the investigators according to disease severity and comorbid medical conditions. The duration of the prednisone taper will be 6 months in all cases.</description>
