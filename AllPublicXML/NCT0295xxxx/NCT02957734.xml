      LAVA Ultimate composite restorations will be used as restorative material to reconstruct
      severely worn dentitions.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Standard dental treatment will be provided to the patients with severely worn dentitions.
      Treatment is based on the principles of 'minimally invasive treatment techniques'.

      Main difference with the 'standard' treatment protocol and the standard procedure of placing
      composite restorations is the fully digital workflow. In the traditional workflow a silicon
      impression is made, after which the dental technician produces the (indirect) composite
      restorations in by hand. These restorations are then adhesively cemented on the teeth by the
      dentist. In the fully digital workflow, digital 3D-scans are made using the 3D LAVA scanner
      (3M ESPE). Based on these digital 3D-images a digital wax-up is made by the dental technician
      after which all composite restorations (uplays and backings) are designed digitally before
      being milled and finally adhesively cemented on the teeth by the dentists. An important
      benefit for the patients is the rehabilitation of their worn dentitions. Functionality (teeth
      are less sensitive, improved chewing ability, a better occlusal stability, etc) and
      aesthetics will be improved immediately after finishing the treatment. Moreover, the
      estimated treatment time will be less (estimated treatment time approx. 12hours) than the
      traditional methods when using the standard treatment protocol (estimated treatment time
      approx. 18hours).

      Another potential benefit is a better control and more predictable results by using 3D-images
      with the pre-designed computer simulation.

      A risk of these indirect composite resin restorations is the unknown survival rate compared
      to other indirect as well as to direct application technique

    <description>For rehabilitation of the severely worn teeth, teeth are prepared (based on Minimal Invasive procedures), scanned using an intra-oral 3D-scanner (TrueDef, 3M), a digital wax-up model is made and finally restorations are milled from a pre polymerized block of resin (LAVA Ultimate). These indirect restorations are then adhesively cemented on the teeth (Relyx Ultimate, 3M). Teeth on which no indirect restoration could be made/designed a direct composite restoration was made using Filtek Supreme XTE in combination with Scotchbond Universal. Furthermore, all anterior veneer restorations are made of direct composite restorations (Filtek Supreme XTE in combination with Scotchbond Universal).</description>
