    <textblock>
      To evaluate the effectiveness, safety, and cost-effectiveness of cytisine plus behavioural
      support compared to varenicline plus behavioural support for smoking cessation, in indigenous
      Māori (or family of Māori) who smoke and are motivated to quit.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cytisine, a natural product, found in plants such as the Golden Rain and New Zealand Kowhai,
      partially blocks the effects of nicotine on the brain. Cytisine has been used as a smoking
      cessation treatment in several Central and Eastern European countries since the 1960s, is
      inexpensive compared to other cessation medications and has few known side effects. New
      Zealand research has shown cytisine to be more effective than nicotine replacement therapy at
      helping people quit smoking. Using a clinical trial design (N=2140) the investigators plan to
      investigate whether cytisine is at least as good as varenicline (the most effective, but most
      expensive, smoking cessation medication currently available in New Zealand) for helping
      Māori/family of Māori who smoke, to quit.
