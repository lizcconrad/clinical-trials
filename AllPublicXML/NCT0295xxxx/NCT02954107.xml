      The aim is to study the cognitive and brain development of children with absence epilepsy. In
      addition, this study aims to identify prognostic factors for cognitive deterioration and/or
      poor seizure control.

      Objective:

        1. To study the development of cognition in children with absence epilepsy and the
           functional brain organization over time.

        2. To find prognostic factors in terms of clinical, 24h-video-EEG or/and MRI
           characteristics for cognitive deterioration and/or poor seizure control in patients with
           absence epilepsy.

      Study design:

      2 year prospective longitudinal, controlled, comparative, clinical, follow up.

      Study population:

      60 children with recently diagnosed (&lt;2 years) absence epilepsy, aged 6 to 12 years. In
      addition, this study includes a control group of 15 age and gender matched healthy
      volunteers.

      Main study parameters/endpoints:

      Endpoints are the development of clinical parameters (semiology, 24h-video-EEG and seizure
      control), neuropsychological/behavioural outcomes, structural/functional MRI parameters, and
      educational performance.

        1. Children aged 6-12 years of age primarily presenting with episodes of brief loss of
             consciousness (absences) in an otherwise normal child in the previous 2 years. With an
             EEG showing 3 Hz (2.5-4.5 Hz) generalized rhythmic spike-and-wave complexes with a
             discharge duration of at least 3 seconds on a present or former EEG.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Primarily presented with daily occurring episodes of brief loss of consciousness
             (absences) in an otherwise normal child in the previous 2 years.

          2. An EEG showing 3 Hz (2.5-4.5 Hz) generalized rhythmic spike-and-wave complexes with a
             discharge duration of at least 3 seconds on a present or former EEG(58).

          3. Early absence epilepsy , defined as a confirmed diagnosis or seizures within 2 years.

          4. Aged 6-12 years

          5. Permitted accompanying factors:

               -  A few generalized tonic-clonic seizures (assessed individually according to
                  International League Against Epilepsy [ILAE] statements;

               -  Mild myoclonic eye(lid) movements

               -  Co-morbidities: Attention deficiency/concentration disorders, autism, dyslexia
                  and anxiety. These do not form exclusion criteria as this is frequently seen in
                  children with absence seizures and it might be uncertain if the co-morbidity is a
                  manifestation of the absence epilepsy.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  A potential subject (both for the control and patient group) who meets any of the
             following criteria will be excluded from participation in this study:

               -  A diagnosis according to ILAE criteria of the following epilepsy syndromes:
                  Juvenile Absence Epilepsy; Eyelid myoclonia with absences; Dravet syndrome;
                  Epilepsy with myoclonic-atonic seizures; Epilepsy with Myoclonic Absences;
                  Lennox-Gastaut syndrome; Frontal Lobe Epilepsy or other focal epilepsy.

               -  A confirmed diagnosis of epilepsy/seizures for more than 2 years (59).

               -  Recent hospitalizations in the last months or a history which might limit
                  participation in or completion of the study protocol.

               -  Behavioural characteristics which might hamper the gathering of useful MRI data.

               -  Intellectual disability or other diseases/causes that may underlie cognitive
                  impairment (i.e. neurodegenerative diseases).

               -  History of major head trauma or head/brain surgery.

               -  MRI lesions on (previous) structural brain MRI- or CT-scans or symptomatic
                  epilepsies (e.g. epilepsy related to tumours, vascular abnormalities, congenital
                  dysgenesia).

               -  MRI contra-indications: claustrophobia, anxiety for an MRI scan, or presence of
                  metallic objects (e.g. prostheses, pacemakers, metal clips on blood vessels,
                  metal parts in the eye). Dental braces are no exclusion criterion for absence
                  patients.

               -  Regularly using drugs of abuse (asked during screening session).

               -  Parents or participants (aged≥12 years) not willing to provide informed consent.

               -  Parents or participants (aged≥12 years) who do not want to get informed whenever
                  structural abnormalities are found during imaging.
