  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A growing body of evidence demonstrates that increased adipose mass, especially visceral
      adipose tissue, contributes directly towards an increase in systemic inflammation,
      (micro-)vascular dysfunction and the burden of cardiovascular disease (CVD), insulin
      resistance and type 2 diabetes. Advanced glycation/lipoxidation endproducts (AGEs/ALEs) are a
      heterogeneous family of unavoidable by-products, which are formed by reactive metabolic
      intermediates derived from glucose and lipid oxidation. In addition to the overwhelming
      amount of data demonstrating the role of AGEs/ALEs in the development of (micro-)vascular
      dysfunction and disease, accumulation of AGEs/ALEs in the expanding adipose tissue
      contributes to the dysregulation of adipokines and the development of insulin resistance.

      The investigators want to examine, in a double-blind randomized placebo controlled parallel
      study, the physiological effect of a dietary intervention with pyridoxamine in abdominally
      obese persons.

             peripheral vascular disease, congestive heart failure, cardiac shunts, cardiac
             surgery, pulmonary hypertension, cardiac arrhythmias, family history of cardiac
             arrhythmias or sudden cardiac death)
