  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients receiving Novel Oral Anticoagulation (NOACs) undergo diagnostic and therapeutic
      procedures at a rate of 10% per year. Short half-lives and rapid onset of action allow for
      short periods of NOAC interruption without heparin bridging. There is only minimal
      information on the peri-procedural usage pattern of edoxaban and the related outcome data
      currently available. Therefore, further real-world clinical data on the peri-procedural usage
      pattern of edoxaban within any diagnostic or interventional procedure in patients with
      non-valvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF) or venous thromboembolism (VTE) will be collected in
      this registry.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients treated with edoxaban and with a planned or unplanned diagnostic or interventional
      procedure will be enrolled in this study in order to evaluate the peri-procedural dosing of
      edoxaban in patients with diagnostic or therapeutic procedures and collect details of the
      type diagnostic or therapeutic procedures. Patients from 7 different countries and care
      settings (primary care, secondary care, and different medical specialties) will be enrolled.
      The study will last until approximately 2000 procedures have been documented, e.g., until
      about 2000 participants are enrolled, which is expected to take approximately 2.5 years. Any
      relevant diagnostic or interventional procedure reported will be collected and documented in
      the electronic case report form (eCRF). Patients will be followed for 30 days after the
      procedure.
