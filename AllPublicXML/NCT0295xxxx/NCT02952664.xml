  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will employ two monitoring device prototypes. The devices are sensors containing
      accelerometers and gyroscope. The raw output data will be analyzed to determine when patients
      are moved or are repositioned in their beds. The data is captured within a modem which will
      correlate these movements with video recordings for interpretation by the research team. One
      sensor is wearable on the patient gown or sleepwear, and the other is placed underneath the
      frame of the hospital bed. The investigators propose a non-blinded trial with n=10 where all
      subjects will undergo the two devices. A video camera will be placed in each subject room for
      recording the repositioning events to correlate the monitor signals with the actual subject
      repositioning captured by the video. The goal of the trial is to validate the ability of each
      of the sensor prototypes to accurately detect when subjects are turned, in order to reduce
      stationary positioning which contributes to the incidence of pressure ulcers and to improve
      compliance with patient repositioning trials.

      positioning which contributes to the incidence of pressure ulcers and to improve compliance
      with patient repositioning trials. The repositioning events recorded by the sensor devices
      will be automatically uploaded and abstracted by the research team, along with the events
      captured by the simultaneous video recording of patient repositioning.
