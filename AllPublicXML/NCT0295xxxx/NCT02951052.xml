  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Antiretroviral Therapy as Long Acting Suppression (ATLAS) study is being conducted to
      establish if human immunodeficiency virus type-1 (HIV-1) infected adult participants with
      current viral suppression on a regimen with 2 nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors
      (NRTIs) plus a third agent, remain suppressed upon switching to a two-drug intramuscular (IM)
      long-acting (LA) regimen of cabotegravir (CAB) and rilpivirine (RPV). This is a Phase 3,
      multi-phase, randomized, open label, active-controlled, multicenter, parallel-group,
      non-inferiority study in HIV-1, antiretroviral therapy (ART)-adult participants who are
      stably suppressed on a current antiretroviral (ARV) regimen. This study is designed to
      demonstrate the non-inferior antiviral activity of switching to a two drug CAB LA 400 mg +
      RPV LA 600 mg regimen every 4 weeks (Q4W: monthly) compared with maintenance of current ARV
      regimen containing 2 NRTIs plus an INI, NNRTI, or a PI. Eligible participants will be
      randomized (1:1) into the Maintenance Phase at Day 1 to either continue current ART or switch
      to initiate oral therapy with CAB 30 mg + RPV 25 mg once daily for 4 Weeks followed by Q4
      weekly (monthly) CAB LA + RPV LA injections. Following the Maintenance phase at Week 52,
      participants who were randomized to continue their current ART regimen will be given an
      option to switch to CAB LA + RPV LA injections. Those participants would transition to LA
      dosing, beginning with 4 weeks oral CAB + RPV therapy at Week 52, and receive the first IM
      CAB LA + RPV LA injections at Week 56.

             compromise the safety of the participant.

          -  Participants determined by the Investigator to have a high risk of seizures, including
             participants with an unstable or poorly controlled seizure disorder. A participant
             with a prior history of seizure may be considered for enrolment if the Investigator
             believes the risk of seizure recurrence is low. All cases of prior seizure history
             should be discussed with the Medical Monitor prior to enrolment.

          -  All participants will be screened for syphilis (rapid plasma reagin [RPR]).
             Participants with untreated syphilis infection, defined as a positive RPR without

             positive for anti-HBc (negative HBsAg status) and positive for HBV DNA are excluded.
             Note: Participants positive for anti-HBc (negative HBsAg status) and positive for
             anti-HBs (past and/or current evidence) are immune to HBV and are not excluded.

          -  Asymptomatic individuals with chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection will not be
             excluded, however Investigators must carefully assess if therapy specific for HCV
             infection is required; participants who are anticipated to require HCV treatment
             within 12 months must be excluded (HCV treatment on study may be permitted post Week
             48, following consultation with the medical monitor).

          -  Participants with HCV co-infection will be allowed entry into phase 3 studies if:
             Liver enzymes meet entry criteria; HCV Disease has undergone appropriate work-up, and
             is not advanced,and will not require treatment prior to the Week 48 visit. Additional
             information (where available) on participants with HCV co-infection at screening
             should include results from any liver biopsy, Fibroscan, ultrasound, or other fibrosis
             evaluation, history of cirrhosis or other decompensated liver disease, prior
             treatment, and timing/plan for HCV treatment. In the event that recent biopsy or
             imaging data is not available or inconclusive, the Fib-4 score will be used to verify
             eligibility. Fib 4 score &gt;3.25 is exclusionary; Fib 4 scores 1.45-3.25 requires
             Medical Monitor consultation. Fibrosis 4 Score Formula: ( Age x AST )/(platelets x
             square root of ALT).

             the Study medical monitor for inclusion of the participant prior to randomization.

          -  Any condition which, in the opinion of the Investigator, may interfere with the

          -  History or presence of allergy or intolerance to the study drugs or their components

          -  Any verified Grade 4 laboratory abnormality. A single repeat test is allowed during
             the Screening phase to verify a result.

          -  Any acute laboratory abnormality at Screening, which, in the opinion of the
             investigator, would preclude the participant's participation in the study of an
             investigational compound.

          -  Participant has estimated creatine clearance &lt;50 mL/min per 1.73 square meter (m^2)
