  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to characterize the continued clinical benefit(s) regarding
      safety and efficacy of suprachoroidally administered CLS-TA, triamcinolone acetonide
      injectable suspension, for the treatment of macular edema associated with non-infectious
      uveitis. This study will be a non-interventional extension of the Parent study, CLS1001-301.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a non-interventional extension study of up to 6 months for subjects completing the
      Parent study. The Parent study is a Phase 3, multicenter study to assess the safety and
      efficacy of 4 mg of CLS-TA administered via suprachoroidal injection compared to a sham
      procedure in the treatment of subjects with macular edema associated with non-infectious
      uveitis.

      The study design of the Extension study includes 4 clinic visits over a maximum of 24 weeks.
      Subject eligibility will be established at Visit 1 during the crossover day from the Parent
      study to the extension study (Day 0). Follow-up visits will be conducted every 6 weeks up to
      24 weeks (Visit 4). At Visit 4, subjects will have a final evaluation conducted 24 weeks
      following study entry (48 weeks from Parent study randomization).
