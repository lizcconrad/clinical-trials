      The purpose of this study is to develop an immune-phenotype based prediction of postoperative
      SIRS in patients undergoing open heart surgery.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will have a pre-, intra and postoperative phase in which several demographic and
      clinical variables will be assessed. The samples for the immunophenotypic analysis will be
      drawn directly after induction of anesthesia and at various time points after end of surgery.
      The diagnosis of SIRS will be made during routine clinical visits on the first seven
      postoperative days using the Sepsis-related Organ Failure Assessment score (SOFA-score). The
      patients will be followed up for 30 days.

    <description>The study investigates the relationship between the intra-individual inflammatory patterns in patients with uncomplicated (no SIRS) and complicated postoperative courses (SIRS) after open heart surgery.
The diagnosis of SIRS will be made by using the Sepsis-related Organ Failure Assessment score (SOFA-score). Patients with an increase in SOFA-score &gt;3 are considered to have SIRS.</description>
