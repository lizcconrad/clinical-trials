  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Treatment with colloidal solutions has during long time been a cornerstone within intensive
      care. Lately, doubts have been raised about synthetic colloids, and the natural albumin has
      been used more and more.

      One of these solutions is the hyperoncotic &quot;Albumin 20%&quot;. However there are still many
      aspects of the physiological effects of hyperoncotic albumin, that are not known. In this
      study physiological effects will be studied in burn patients and healthy subjects. The
      colloid osmotic pressure and the increase of the plasma volume will be measured in 15 healthy
      subjects and in 15 burn patients. The effect on the plasma volume will be studied using
      hemoglobin as a marker of dilution. Colloids osmotic pressure and albumin concentration will
      be measured directly and urin production will also be measured. Blood samples will be
      collected during 4 to 5 hours to achieve a profile over the changes.

      Healthy individuals are asked to refrain from eating and drinking the night before the study.
      Two hours before study start, the subjects may take a sandwich and a glas to drink. Patients
      will also be asked to keep the same rules unless they receive parenteral nutrition. Shortly
      before the study, the subjects are asked to leave an urine sample.

      After 15 minutes of rest the first bood samples are taken. An infusion 3 ml/kg bodyweight
      Albumin 20% is given during 30 minutes. The first hour after study start (start of infusion)
      blood samples are taken every 10 minutes. The following 4 hours another 9 blood samples are
      collected. Hemoglobin, albumin and colloidosmotic pressure will be measured at every
      occasion.

      C-reactive protein, interleukin-6, Syndecan -1 as well as heparan sulfate, will be measured
      before, after 1 hour and 5 hours after study start.

      The total volume of blood collected will be 150 ml. If the study subjects have a low urin
      output, acetated Ringers will be given at the end of the study. Liberal fluid intake is
      recommended the same day and the next.
