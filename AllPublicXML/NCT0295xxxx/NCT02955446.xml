  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-center, open label, non randomized, compassionate use protocol in patients
      with advanced solid tumor malignancies who were previously enrolled in the phase I study
      (NCT00878189) of this agent.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an expanded access-physician sponsored trial of PF-03084014, a novel gamma-secretase
      inhibitor being developed for cancer therapy. This trial is designed for patients who have
      been on a previous Industry-sponsored phase I trial using PF-03084014 for&gt; 1 year. The study
      is designed to evaluate the safety of prolonged oral administration of single agent
      PF-03084014. There are two study subjects with desmoid tumor who have been on the trial for a
      prolonged period of time (54 and 77 months, respectively) with either stable disease or
      response, indicating significant clinical benefit for a patient population in which there are
      few options. The goal of this protocol is to allow these subjects, who are clearly benefiting
      from PF-03084014, to continue to receive it

    <description>Two patients enrolled in this study will continue receiving 80mg BID doses of PF-03084014, which was the same dose/schedule of their latest cycle on protocol A8641014. PF-03084014 will be administered twice a day in the morning and evening divided by approximately 12 hours. PF-03084014 should be administered in cycles of 21 days continuously.</description>
