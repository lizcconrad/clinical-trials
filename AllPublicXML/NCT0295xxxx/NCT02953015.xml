  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic migraine (CM) is a very disabling disorder with grave socioeconomic consequences.
      Pharmacological approaches can affect mechanisms of pain production, while rehabilitation
      such as Transcutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulation and Manual Therapy may reduce the
      neuromuscular contributing factors. The main aim of the study is to evaluate the effects of
      cervical and thoracic manipulative techniques combined with OnabotulinumtoxinA prophylaxis on
      headache frequency in patients with Chronic Migraine (CM). The second aim is to evaluate the
      training effects on the intensity of headache attacks, analgesic consumption, cervical range
      of motion, TrPs sensitivity and disability. The hypothesis is that the manipulative treatment
      would alleviate CM symptoms and, in turn, decrease the analgesic consumption.

      The present study is a single-blind randomized controlled trial conducted according to the
      Declaration of Helsinki, the guidelines for Good Clinical Practice, and the Consolidated
      Standards of reporting Trials (CONSORT) Statement guidelines. The examiner will be blinded to
      group assignment. If eligible, patients will be allocated to the experimental group (EG) or
      the control group (CG) using an automated randomization system (Allocation ratio 1:1). The
      group allocation will be kept concealed by means of sealed numbered envelopes. The
      randomization list was locked in a desk drawer accessible only to the main investigator. All
      the treatments and assessment will be performed in the Neurorehabilitation Unit of Azienda
      Ospedaliera Universitaria Integrata of Verona (Italy).

      Patients will be asked to complete a daily headache diary, which is routinely administered to
      all patients with CM admitted at our Unit for OnabotulinumtoxinA prophylaxis. In the context
      of this study, daily headache diaries during 1 month pre-treatment (T0), during the treatment
      (treatment phase) and 1 month post-treatment (T1) will be considered.

      Moreover, at T0 a questionnaire concerning clinical and demographic data as well as some
      habits like consumption of coffee and alcohol, and smoking will be administered. According to
      the nature of the study feasibility and efficacy outcomes will be defined. Feasibility
      outcomes were the patients' compliance during treatments, any adverse events (i.e. pain,
      discomfort) occurred during the treatment, and the number of training session performed.
      Primary and secondary outcome measures will be categorized as efficacy outcomes.

    <description>Trigger point sensitivity will be assessed by measuring the pressure pain threshold (PPT) with a Wagner algometer 162 (Wagner Instruments, Riverside, CT, USA). The PPT corresponds to the force needed to induce a difference between a feeling of simple pressure and a painful sensation. PPT assessment will be performed on the frontalis, temporalis and occipitalis, and upper trapezius muscles.

    <description>Three manipulative articulatory (ART) and myofascial techniques will be performed to improve cervical and thoracic spine joint mobility and reducing soft tissue stiffness in the cervico-thoracic spine. ART technique is a low velocity to high amplitude technique where each joint is carried through its full motion to increase range of movement. The activating force is either a repetitive springing motion or repetitive concentric movement of the joint through the restrictive barrier. Myofascial technique is directed at the muscle and fascia treatment. It engages continual palpatory feedback to achieve release of myofascial tissues. During each treatment session, each technique will be carried out for 10 minutes including 2 minutes of resting.</description>

    <description>Transcutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulation (TENS) of the upper trapezius muscle will be applied by a portable machine Master 932 (Elettronica Pagani SRL, Milan, Italy) that generates symmetric, bi-phasic rectangular pulses with 140Î¼ sec duration. The current frequency will be set at 150 Hz and intensity will be increased up to patient's perception of paresthesia. The negative electrode will be placed on the active TrPs of the upper trapezius muscle and the positive one was on acromial tendon insertional site. The total duration of each application will be 20 minutes. Treatment frequency and duration will be the same of the EG treatment (1 session/week for 4 weeks). Each session will consist of 20 min of TENS and 10 min of resting in sitting position with the head lean on a pillow.</description>
