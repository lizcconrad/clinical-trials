      Purpose: To evaluate adherence, tolerability, and total protein intake in bariatric surgery
      patients provided with ready-to-drink protein supplements, and to evaluate the effects of
      supplementation on body composition, metabolism, and health outcomes.

      Participants: Patients scheduled to under go bariatric surgery aged 18-70 years old.
      Participants will be included if they agree to comply with the study protocol, are free of
      medical conditions that may contraindicate participation, and do not plan to become pregnant
      during the study.

      Procedures (methods): Participants will complete five laboratory visits for the current study
      (pre-screening (visit 1), baseline testing (visit 2), and return visits at 3 weeks (visit 3),
      12 weeks (visit 4), and 24 weeks (visit 5) post-surgery). The treatment group will be given a
      12 week supply of a high protein, low-carbohydrate, low-fat supplement to be taken once daily
      during days 3-7 post-surgery, and twice daily weeks 2-12. The treatment group will follow
      standard of care recommendations put forth by the physician-nutritionist team, but using the
      provided protein supplement to meet recommendations. The control group will be asked to
      follow the standard of care recommendations from the physician-nutritionist team.

      The primary study endpoints will be adherence, tolerability, and total protein intake in
      bariatric surgery patients provided with a 12-week supply of ready-to-drink protein
      supplements. Secondary outcomes will evaluate the effect of a protein supplement on body
      composition (lean mass, fat mass, percent body fat, visceral fat, muscle thickness), resting
      metabolic rate, clinical and endocrine blood values, functional fitness, and responses to
      questionnaires evaluating mood, satiety, functional independence, and health related quality
      of life.
