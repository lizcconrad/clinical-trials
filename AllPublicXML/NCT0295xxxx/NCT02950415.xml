  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Children undergoing anesthesia are often very frightened by the experience. This can lead to
      bed wetting, nightmares and stranger anxiety that can last for weeks. Moreover, this can
      influence their future experiences with anesthesia and surgery. The investigators believe the
      presence of a parent via video might work better as parental fear is not transferred to the
      child. The investigators also believe that parents who are coached on how to assist their
      child during anesthesia will have a better impact. As such the investigators are carrying out
      this study to assess whether parents who are coached and are present in either video or
      physical form will be more effective in reducing anxiety at induction of anesthesia.

      The investigators' goal in this study is to investigate the effects of virtual parental
      presence and coaching of parents on anxiety in children at induction of anesthesia. The
      primary hypothesis is virtual parental presence during induction of anesthesia is superior to
      physical parental presence during induction of anesthesia in reducing anxiety in children at
      induction of anesthesia. The secondary hypothesis is that the coaching of parents modulates
      the effect of physical or video parental presence at induction anesthesia on children's
      anxiety.
