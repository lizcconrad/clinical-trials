  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This prospective pilot study will assess the feasibility of remote participant monitoring
      using digital technology in participants with MS and healthy controls. At the enrollment
      visit, the participants as well as the healthy controls will be provided with a remote
      patient monitoring solution which includes preconfigured smartphone and smartwatch. The
      configured smartphone and smartwatch pair will contain application software that prompts the
      user to perform various assessments, referred to as active tests and passive monitoring.
      Active tests will include Hand Motor Function Test (HMFT), gait test, static balance test,
      electronic version of the Symbol Digit Modalities Test (eSDMT), Mood Scale Question (MSQ), MS
      Impact Scale (29-item scale) (MSIS-29) questionnaire, MS Symptom Tracking (MSST). Passive
      monitoring will be done to collect metrics on gait and mobility throughout the daily life of
      participants in a continuous and unobtrusive manner.
