    <textblock>
      This is a study for patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer with changes to their
      cancer cells called EGFR mutations. Mutated EGFR is important in the growth of cancer cells.
      Medical studies have shown that patients with EGFR mutation-positive lung cancer gain more
      benefit from targeted therapy drugs such as EGFR inhibitors than with standard chemotherapy.
      However, a significant proportion of patients carrying these sensitizing mutations do not
      respond well to the first-generation EGFR-TKIs (erlotinib and gefitinib), indicating the
      existence of intrinsic resistance mechanisms. Moreover, despite initial response to
      EGFR-TKIs, acquired resistance is inevitable in all patients.

      The investigators have recently shown that Cripto-1 overexpression in EGFR mutant NSCLC
      contributes to the intrinsic resistance to EGFR-TKIs through activation of the SRC oncogene.
      They have also shown that a combination of an EGFR-TKI (both erlotinib and osimertinib) and a
      Src inhibitor are synergistic in Cripto-1 overexpressing tumors in the laboratory.

      This study will be testing a combination of two drugs, dasatinib and osimertinib, to overcome
      resistance to EGFR-TKIs. Osimertinib (AZD9291) is a third-generation EGFR-TKI, which
      selectively blocks the activity of EGFR mutants, but spares that of wild type. The advantage
      of using osimertinib is that it inhibits not only the sensitizing EGFR mutations, but also
      the T790M mutant, which is the most common mechanism of acquired resistance. Dasatinib is a
      potent, orally available ABL1/SRC TKI, approved for the treatment of chronic myeloid leukemia
      (CML) in first-line and in patients with imatinib-resistant disease or intolerant, and is
      being actively studied in patients with advanced solid tumors.

      The first part of the study will involve finding the highest dose of dasatinib that can be
      given with osimertinib without causing severe side effects, finding out the side effects seen
      by giving dasatinib at different dose levels with osimertinib, and measuring the levels of
      dasatinib and osimertinib in blood at different dose levels. The second part will determine
      the effects of the combination of dasatinib and osimertinib and determine if the amount of
      Cripto-1 protein in your tumor or blood makes you more likely to have a good response to the
      combination of dasatinib and osimertinib.

      The treatment of patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer is unsatisfactory. The
      median survival is approximately 12 months with standard chemotherapy. Epidermal growth
      factor receptor (EGFR) mutations are one of the most frequent genetic abnormalities observed
      in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), especially in adenocarcinoma subtype. The most
      predominant EGFR mutations are in-frame deletions in exon-19 and L858R missense mutation, and
      patients carrying these mutations are mostly sensitive to the EGFR-targeted tyrosine kinase
      inhibitors (TKIs). However, a significant proportion of patients carrying these sensitizing
      mutations do not respond well to the first generation EGFR-TKIs (erlotinib and gefitinib),
      indicating the existence of intrinsic resistance mechanisms. Moreover, despite initial
      response to EGFR-TKIs, acquired resistance is inevitable in all patients. Novel treatment
      strategies need to be developed to overcome resistance to EGFR-TKIs. The investigators have
      recently shown that Cripto-1 overexpression in EGFR mutant NSCLC contributes to the intrinsic
      resistance to EGFR-TKIs through SRC activation. They have also shown that a combination of an
      EGFR-TKI (both erlotinib and AZD9291) and a Src inhibitor are synergistic in vitro and in
      vivo in Cripto-1 overexpressing tumors. AZD9291 is a third-generation EGFR-TKI, which
      selectively blocks the activity of EGFR mutants but spares that of wild type. The advantage
      of using AZD9291 is that it inhibits not only the mutants of exon-19 deletion and L858R, but
      also the T790M mutant, which is the most common mechanism of acquired resistance. Dasatinib
      is a potent, orally available ABL1/SRC TKI, approved for the treatment of chronic myeloid
      leukemia (CML) in first-line and in patients with imatinib-resistant disease or intolerant,
      and is being actively studied in patients with advanced solid tumors.

      This is an open-label, non-randomized, prospective phase I/II trial. The phase I portion will
      follow a standard 3+3 design for the phase I portion and one-sample group sequential multiple
      testing procedure for the phase II portion.

    <description>Osimertinib (AZD9291) will be given at a 80mg/day dose taken orally across all levels of the dose escalation schedule.
Dasatinib is taken orally and will be given at up to 4 dose levels. Level -2 (50 mg once daily), Level -1 (70 mg once daily), Level 1 (the starting dose - 50 mg twice daily), Level 2 (70 mg twice daily).
Dose escalation will only include 2 dose levels (Levels 1 and 2); in addition there will be 2 dose levels below the starting dose level if dose reductions are necessary (Levels -1 and -2).
There is no limit to the number of cycles a patient can receive.
The phase II portion of the study will use the maximum tolerated dose of dasatinib determined in the phase I portion. Osimertinib (AZD9291) will be given at the same 80mg dose as the phase I portion.</description>
