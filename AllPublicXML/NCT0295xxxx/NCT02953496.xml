        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Age of at least 18 years.

          2. Clinical diagnosis of PAD secondary to atherosclerosis affecting a lower limb.

          3. ABI &lt;0.90 at rest or with exercise, or a toe-brachial index (TBI) &lt;0.70 if ABI value
             is &gt;1.30 (non-compressible), or radiographic evidence of PAD that correlates with
             clinical symptoms.

          4. Rutherford category 2-4.

          5. Screening duplex Doppler ultrasound with a SFA or PA lesion with a PSVR &gt;2.4.

          6. De novo lesion, not previously treated by angioplasty, atherectomy, or stent.

          7. If female and of childbearing potential (premenopausal and not surgically sterile)
             must have a negative pregnancy test at the screening visit and be willing to use
             contraception from the time of the screening visit to 1 week following study drug
             administration. Acceptable methods of birth control include abstinence, barrier
             methods with spermicide, implants, injectables, oral contraceptives, intra-uterine
             device, or a vasectomized partner.

          8. Ability to understand and comply with the requirements of the entire study and
             communicate with the study team.

          9. Ability to provide written informed consent using a document that has been approved by
             the required institutional review board.

        Exclusion Criteria

          1. Patients in whom arterial insufficiency in the lower extremity is the result of an
             immunologic or inflammatory non-atherosclerotic disorder (e.g., Buerger's disease,
             vasculitis).

          2. Total occlusion of the SFA or PA in the index leg.

          3. Planned surgical or endovascular procedures to the affected leg on the day of or
             within 28 days of study drug administration.

          4. Deep vein thrombosis within the past 3 months.

          5. Known bleeding disorder.

          6. Presence of any arterial aneurysm in the index leg.

          7. Known hypercoagulable state (e.g., protein C deficiency, factor V Leiden mutation,
             prothrombin G20210A mutation).

          8. Platelet count &lt;130K, hematocrit &lt;30%, bilirubin or ALT &gt;3.0 times the upper limit of
             normal.

          9. Arterial systolic BP &gt;200 mmHg or diastolic BP &gt;100 mmHg at screening or day of
             procedure.

         10. Pregnancy, lactation or plans to become pregnant during the course of the study.

         11. Presence of any significant medical condition that might significantly confound the
             collection of safety and efficacy data in this study.

         12. Malignancy or treatment for malignancy within the previous 12 months with the
             exception localized basal cell or squamous cell skin cancer, or any cancer in situ.

         13. Treatment with any investigational drug within the previous 30 days or investigational
             antibody therapy within 90 days prior to signing informed consent.

         14. Known allergy to contrast media, iodine, lidocaine, prilocaine, or EMLA Cream
             (lidocaine 2.5% and prilocaine 2.5%).
