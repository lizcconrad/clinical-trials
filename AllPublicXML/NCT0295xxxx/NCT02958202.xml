  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to provide continuing access to BMN 044 treatment for subjects
      previously treated with BMN 044. The information gained from this study is expected to
      further characterize the efficacy and safety of BMN 044 over a longer treatment period.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase 2 multi center, multi national, open label, long term extension study. Up to
      approximately 50 male subjects with Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD) who have previously
      been treated with BMN 044 will be enrolled. Subjects will receive either IV infusions or SC
      injections at pre-defined doses.

      Safety and tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK), pharmacodynamics (PD) and efficacy
      assessments will be conducted at regular intervals throughout the study.

      Subjects will be permitted to continue in this study until the subject meets any of the
      defined withdrawal criteria, BioMarin decides to halt the clinical development of BMN 044, or
      BMN 044 receives marketing authorization.

  <overall_status>Terminated</overall_status>
  <why_stopped>
    Regulatory approval was not obtained for drisapersen, hence BioMarin is stopping the
    development of all exon skipping oligonucleotides in DMD.

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects previously treated with BMN 044 or a comparator treatment in a BMN 044
             Sponsored Study or Investigator Initiated Trial and who are not eligible for another
             ongoing BMN 044 study.

          -  Continued use of glucocorticosteroids for a minimum of 60 days prior to study entry
             with a reasonable expectation that the subject will remain on glucocorticosteroids for
             the duration of this study.

          -  Willing and able to comply with all study requirements and procedures.

          -  Willing and able to provide written, signed informed consent, or in the case of
             subjects under the age of 18 years(or 16 years, depending on the region), provide
             written assent (if required) and written informed consent by a legally authorized
             representative after the nature of the study has been explained, and prior to the
             conduct of any research-related procedures.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects who have previously been treated with BMN 044 who had a serious adverse
             experience or met safety stopping criteria, that remains unresolved, which in the
             opinion of the Investigator could have been attributable to BMN 044.

          -  History of significant medical disorder which may confound the interpretation of
             safety data

          -  Acute illness within 4 weeks prior to the first dose of BMN 044 (Week 1) which may
             interfere with the measurements.

          -  Symptomatic cardiomyopathy.

          -  Baseline aPTT above the upper limit of normal (ULN).

          -  Baseline platelet count below the lower limit of normal (LLN).

          -  Use of anti coagulants, anti thrombotics or anti platelet agents within 28 days of the
             baseline visit.

          -  Prior use of any investigational product (other than BMN 044) or investigational
             medical device must be discussed with the Medical Monitor prior to screening.

          -  Current or history of drug and/or alcohol abuse.
