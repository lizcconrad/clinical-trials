    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the pharmacokinetics (PK) of GS-9876 in
      participants with impaired renal function relative to matched healthy controls. Participants
      in this study will be enrolled using an adaptive design that includes up to 3 enrolled
      cohorts. Based on safety and/or PK data in Cohort 1, participants will be enrolled in
      adaptive Cohorts 2 and/or 3.

             must be obtained prior to initiation of study procedures

          -  Be between 18 through 75 years of age, inclusive at screening

          -  Have a calculated body mass index (BMI) of ≥ 18 kg/m^2 and ≤ 36 kg/m^2 at screening

             clinic admission (Day -1).

          -  Individuals have not donated blood within 56 days of study entry or plasma within 7
             days of study entry and must refrain from blood donation from clinic admission,
             throughout the study period, and continuing for at least 30 days following the last
             dose of study drug.

             clinically insignificant by the investigator in consultation with the sponsor

          -  Must, in the opinion of the investigator, be in good health based upon medical history
             and physical examination, including vital signs

        For Individuals with Renal Impairment

          -  Must have diagnosis of chronic (&gt; 6 months), stable renal impairment with no

             hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), hepatitis B core antibody (HBcAb), or hepatitis C
             virus (HCV) antibody

          -  Have poor venous access that limits phlebotomy

        For Individuals with Renal Impairment

          -  Require or are anticipated to require dialysis within 90 days of study dosing

          -  Require during the study or have received moderate or strong inhibitors or inducers of
             CYP3A within 2 weeks prior to study drug administration.

        For Healthy Matched Controlled Individuals (Individuals with Normal Renal Function)

          -  Have taken any prescription medications or over-the-counter medications, including
             herbal products and antacids, within 28 days prior to start of study drug dosing, with
             the exception of vitamins and/or acetaminophen and/or ibuprofen and/or hormonal
             contraceptive medications and/or stable hormone replacement therapy in peri-
