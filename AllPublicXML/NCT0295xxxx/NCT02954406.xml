  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) or recommended
      Phase 2 dose (RP2D) of TAK-659 when administered in combination with bendamustine,
      bendamustine + rituximab, gemcitabine, lenalidomide, or ibrutinib.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The drug being tested in this study is called TAK-659. TAK-659 is being tested to treat
      people who have advanced non-Hodgkin lymphoma. This study will determine the MTD or RP2D for
      TAK-659 in combination with bendamustine, bendamustine + rituximab, gemcitabine,
      lenalidomide, and ibrutinib. The study will enroll approximately 100 participants.
      Participants will be assigned to one of the 5 treatment groups:

        -  TAK-659 + Bendamustine

        -  TAK-659 + Bendamustine + Rituximab

        -  TAK-659 + Gemcitabine

        -  TAK-659 + Lenalidomide

        -  TAK-659 + Ibrutinib

      This multi-center trial will be conducted in North America and Europe. The overall time to
      participate in this study is approximately 27 months. Participants will make multiple visits
      to the clinic and will be followed up for safety for 28 days after the last dose of study
      drug.

               -  If they are of childbearing potential, agree to practice 1 highly effective
                  method of contraception and 1 additional effective (barrier) method at the same

             as outlined in the Study Manual.

         10. Voluntary written consent must be given before performance of any study-related
             procedure not part of standard medical care, with the understanding that consent may

                  list of prohibited strong CYP3A reversible inhibitors and/or P-gp inhibitors
                  based on the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Draft Drug-Drug Interactions
                  (DDI) Guidance.

               -  Medications or supplements that are known to be strong CYP3A mechanism-based
                  inhibitors or strong CYP3A inducers and/or P-gp inducers within 7 days or within
                  5 times the inhibitor or inducer half-life (whichever is longer) before the first
                  dose of study drug. The use of these agents is not permitted during the study.
                  See a list of prohibited strong CYP3A mechanism-based inhibitors or strong CYP3A
                  inducers and/or P-gp inducers based on the US FDA Draft DDI Guidance.

               -  Grapefruit-containing food or beverages within 5 days before the first dose of
                  study drug. Note that grapefruit-containing food and beverages are not permitted
                  during the study.

         17. Additionally, for participants in the ibrutinib combination arm (Cohort E), use or
             consumption of any of the following substances:

               -  Medications or supplements that are known to be moderate reversible inhibitors of
                  CYP3A within 5 times the inhibitor half-life (if a reasonable half-life estimate
                  is known) or within 7 days (if a reasonable half-life estimate is unknown) before
                  the first dose of study drugs. In general, the use of these agents is not
                  permitted during the study for this combination except in cases in which an AE
                  must be managed. See a list of nonexhaustive moderate CYP3A reversible inhibitors
                  based on the US FDA Draft DDI Guidance.

               -  Medications or supplements that are known to be moderate mechanism-based
                  inhibitors or moderate inducers of CYP3A within 7 days or within 5 times the
                  inhibitor or inducer half-life (whichever is longer) before the first dose of
                  study drugs. In general, the use of these agents is not permitted during the
                  study for this combination except in cases in which an AE must be managed. See a
                  list of nonexhaustive moderate CYP3A mechanism-based inhibitors or moderate CYP3A
                  inducers based on the US FDA Draft DDI Guidance.

               -  Seville oranges within 5 days before the first dose of study drugs and during the
                  study.

         18. Major surgery within 14 days before the first dose of study drug and not recovered
             fully from any complications from surgery.

         19. Systemic infection requiring IV antibiotic therapy or other serious infection within
             14 days before the first dose of study drug.

         20. Participants with another malignancy within 2 years of study start. Participants with
             nonmelanoma skin cancer or carcinoma in situ of any type are not excluded if they have
             undergone complete resection and are considered disease-free at the time of study
             entry.

         21. Known gastrointestinal (GI) disease or GI procedure that could interfere with the oral
             absorption or tolerance of TAK-659 including difficulty swallowing tablets or diarrhea
             &gt;Grade 1 despite supportive therapy.

         22. Treatment with high-dose corticosteroids for anticancer purposes within 14 days before
             the first dose of TAK-659; daily dose equivalent to 10 mg oral prednisone or less is
             permitted. Corticosteroids for topical use or in nasal spray or inhalers are allowed.
