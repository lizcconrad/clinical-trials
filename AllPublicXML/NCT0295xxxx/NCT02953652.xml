      This is a Phase 2b, open-label, non-randomized, single arm study to evaluate the safety,
      efficacy, and pharmacokinetics of HBI-8000 40 mg BIW in patients with relapsed or refractory
      PTCL (R/R PTCL). HBI 8000 will be administered orally approximately 30 minutes after any
      regular meal twice a week. There will be 3-4 days between dosing. A cycle is defined as
      consecutive 28 days. HBI-8000 administration will be continued until disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicities are observed despite appropriate dose reduction or treatment
      interruption.

          3. Relapsed or refractory disease after receiving ≥1 prior systemic therapy with
             antitumor agent(s) and there is no other available treatment which can be considered

             immunotherapy administered systemically.

          4. Male or female, age 20 years or older

             having undergone permanent contraception or postmenopausal. Postmenopausal is defined
             as at least 12 months without menses with no other medical reasons (e.g., chemical
             menopause because of treatment with anti-malignant tumor agents)

          9. Signed informed consent

        Exclusion Criteria:

             hepatitis B core antibody and/or hepatitis B surface antibody is positive even if
             hepatitis B surface antigen-negative, a hepatitis B virus DNA test (real-time PCR
             measurement) should be performed and if positive, the patient should be excluded from
             study

         10. Any history of testing positive for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) or known
             acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS)
