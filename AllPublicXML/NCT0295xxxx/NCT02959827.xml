      This study will estimate the incidence of hypothyroidism in a pediatric population of
      children under age 4, based on data from the US-based Kaiser Permanente Northern California
      database, which were exposed to iodinated contrast agent through having a diagnostic
      procedure.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Children under age 4 in the Kaiser Permanente Northern California (KPNC) database, who

          -  Participants should be member of the KPNC for at least 3 months before the iodinated
             contrast exposure, except where the child is under 3 months of age at time of initial
             exposure, and 2 weeks after the exposure.
