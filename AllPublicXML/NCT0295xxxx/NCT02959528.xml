  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Previous studies indicated that children with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)
      often suffer from deficits in executive function, such as attentional control, inhibition,
      and working memory. One of these executive functions, working memory, plays a critical role
      in academic performance and classroom behavior. Working memory is essential for performing
      complex cognitive tasks such as comprehension, learning, and reasoning. Several studies have
      shown that training of working memory has positive effects for ADHD and other cognitive
      disorder in children. However, transfer effects across studies appear to be variable and
      inconsistent. Event-related potentials can be a useful tool to gain insights into such
      mechanism. Therefore, the aim of the present study is to investigate both near and far
      transfer effects of N-back training in children with ADHD. In addition, the recording and
      analysis of event-related potentials will be adopted while children with ADHD perform the
      complex visuo-spatial and phonological working memory tasks.
