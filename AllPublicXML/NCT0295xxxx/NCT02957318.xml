  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Results have indicated that some dietary fibers increase fecal fat excretion and particularly
      viscous fibers suppress appetite sensation and reduce energy intake. Both these effects may
      contribute to body weight management.

      Aim: The aim of the study is to investigate the potential of 3-weeks daily intake of potato
      pulp (FiberBind), rhamnogalacturonan I isolated potato fiber (RG-I) vs. a low-fiber control
      (placebo) on satiety and fecal fat excretion in healthy adults. Furthermore, a number of
      secondary endpoints are investigated.
