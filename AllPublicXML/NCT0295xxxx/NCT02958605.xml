  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Medication errors are common in children. Characteristics of errors during critical
      situations in the Emergency Department are ill-defined and might be more frequent than
      previously thought. However, optimal strategies to eliminate the risk of prescribing errors
      remain unknown.

      Many smartphone apps have been suggested over the last years with some of them designed to
      calculate medication dosage for children. The impact of these apps to decrease dosage error
      has never been evaluated in resuscitation setting.

      The aim of the study is to evaluate whether the use of a smartphone application designed to
      calculate medication doses decreases prescribing errors among residents during pediatric
      simulated resuscitations.

      This will be a crossover-randomized trial using high fidelity simulation among 40 residents
      rotating in the pediatric emergency department.

    <time_frame>during simulation</time_frame>
    <description>An error in perfusion medication will be defined as a drug dose varying by more than 20% from the recommended dose. This can be related to a preparation error or a flow error.</description>

He/she will be instructed to practice with a few time at home before doing the simulations.</description>
