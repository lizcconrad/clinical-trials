  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This Phase II, single-arm study is designed to evaluate the effect of atezolizumab treatment
      in participants with locally advanced or metastatic urothelial bladder cancer. Participants
      will be enrolled into 1 of 2 cohorts. Cohort 1 (reported here) will consist of participants
      who are treatment-naïve and ineligible for cisplatin-containing chemotherapy. Cohort 2 will
      contain participants who have progressed during or following a prior platinum-based
      chemotherapy regimen. The results of the second cohort are reported separately (NCT02108652).
      Participants in both cohorts will be given a 1200 milligrams (mg) intravenous (IV) dose of
      atezolizumab on Day 1 of 21-day cycles. Treatment of participants in Cohort 1 will continue
      until disease progression per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors Version 1.1
      (RECIST v1.1) or unmanageable toxicity. Treatment of participants in Cohort 2 will continue
      until loss of clinical benefit or unmanageable toxicity.

    <measure>Percentage of Participants With a Confirmed Objective Response of Complete Response (CR) or Partial Response (PR) as Assessed by the Independent Review Facility (IRF) According to RECIST v1.1</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline until confirmed disease progression or death, whichever occurred first (assessed at every 9 weeks for the first 12 months, thereafter every 12 weeks until data cutoff date 04 July 2016, up to maximum length of follow-up of 23.52 months)</time_frame>
    <description>Tumor response was assessed by the IRF according to RECIST v1.1. CR was defined as disappearance of all target and non-target lesions and (if applicable) normalization of tumor marker levels. Any pathological lymph nodes (whether target or non-target) must have reduction in short axis to less than (&lt;) 10 millimeters (mm). PR was defined as greater than or equal to (≥) 30 percent (%) decrease in sum of longest diameter (LD) of target lesions in reference to Baseline sum LD. Response was to be confirmed ≥4 weeks after the initial assessment of CR or PR. The percentage of participants with a confirmed objective response of CR or PR was reported. The exact 95% confidence interval (CI) was calculated using the Clopper-Pearson method.</description>

    <description>DOR was defined as the time from the initial occurrence of documented CR or PR (whichever occurred first) until documented disease progression or death due to any cause on study, whichever occurred first. Tumor response was assessed by the IRF according to RECIST v1.1. CR was defined as disappearance of all target and non-target lesions and (if applicable) normalization of tumor marker levels. Any pathological lymph nodes (whether target or non-target) must have reduction in short axis to &lt;10 mm. PR was defined as ≥30% decrease in sum of LD of target lesions in reference to Baseline sum LD. Response was to be confirmed ≥4 weeks after the initial assessment of CR or PR.</description>

        <description>Tumor response was assessed by the IRF according to RECIST v1.1. CR was defined as disappearance of all target and non-target lesions and (if applicable) normalization of tumor marker levels. Any pathological lymph nodes (whether target or non-target) must have reduction in short axis to less than (&lt;) 10 millimeters (mm). PR was defined as greater than or equal to (≥) 30 percent (%) decrease in sum of longest diameter (LD) of target lesions in reference to Baseline sum LD. Response was to be confirmed ≥4 weeks after the initial assessment of CR or PR. The percentage of participants with a confirmed objective response of CR or PR was reported. The exact 95% confidence interval (CI) was calculated using the Clopper-Pearson method.</description>

        <description>Tumor response was assessed by the investigator according to RECIST v1.1. CR was defined as disappearance of all target and non-target lesions and (if applicable) normalization of tumor marker levels. Any pathological lymph nodes (whether target or non-target) must have reduction in short axis to &lt;10 mm. PR was defined as ≥30% decrease in sum of LD of target lesions in reference to Baseline sum LD. Response was to be confirmed ≥4 weeks after the initial assessment of CR or PR. The percentage of participants with a confirmed objective response of CR or PR was reported. The exact 95% CI was calculated using the Clopper-Pearson method.</description>
