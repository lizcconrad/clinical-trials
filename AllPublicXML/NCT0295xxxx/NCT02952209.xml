    <textblock>
      This study is designed to assess the effects of Alveolar Ridge Preservation (ARP) after tooth
      extraction compared to extraction alone in the posterior maxilla. The results of this study
      will demonstrate if the use of ARP reduces alveolar ridge resorption at 6 months post
      extraction in the posterior maxilla region.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Fifteen subjects requiring extraction of one posterior tooth in the right maxilla and one
      posterior tooth in the left maxilla will be considered for enrollment. Subjects who meet the
      inclusion and exclusion criteria will be randomized to receive alveolar ridge preservation on
      one side of the maxilla and only an extraction on the other side of the maxilla.

      Extraction of the failing teeth will be performed atraumatically; a mucoperiosteal flap will
      not be employed. After removal of the tooth, the alveolus will be meticulously debrided and
      cleaned. In the test site, the socket will be filled with xenograft and a collagen membrane.
      In the control site, no graft material or collagen membrane will be used. Clinical
      measurements, standardized peri-apical radiographs and Cone Beam Computed Tomography scans
      will be performed immediately following tooth extractions (visit 2) and 6 months (visit 4)
      after extractions.

      Subjects will be examined over the course of 6 months. Investigators will be trained prior to
      participating in the study. Training will be undertaken during a site initiation visit and
      will include a detailed description of all study procedures including treatment methods, and
      measurement methods to obtain study endpoints.

          4. Presence of one posterior tooth in the right maxilla and one posterior tooth in the
             left maxilla that require extraction (ADA tooth positions 2-4 and 13-15). The same

             intravenous and oral bisphosphonate therapy, bone metabolic diseases, history of
             irradiation of the head and neck area, or any other immuno-suppressive therapy that
             would contraindicate oral surgical treatment.

          4. Subjects who report allergy or hypersensitivity to any of the products (collagen
             membrane and ABBM) used throughout the study.

          5. Presence of ≥3 mm of vertical loss of the buccal bone in relation to the palatal wall.

          6. Subjects with untreated periodontitis.

          7. Presence of acute dentoalveolar infections in the teeth slated for extraction.

             would prevent completion of study participation or interfere with analysis of study
             results, such as history of non- compliance or unreliability
