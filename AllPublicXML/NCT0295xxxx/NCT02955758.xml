  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well pembrolizumab works in treating patients with
      non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer which has spread to other places in the body.
      Monoclonal antibodies, such as pembrolizumab, may interfere with the ability of tumor cells
      to grow and spread.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To correlate circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) levels measured using cancer personalized
      profiling by deep sequencing (CAPP-Seq) with radiographic tumor assessments using Response
      Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version (v)1.1 criteria in patients with
      metastatic non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) treated with pembrolizumab.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To correlate PD-L1 assessment on pre-treatment tumor samples with objective response using
      RECIST v1.1 criteria in patients with metastatic non-squamous NSCLC treated with
      pembrolizumab.

      II. To determine the overall response rate (ORR) using RECIST v1.1 criteria in patients with
      metastatic non-squamous NSCLC treated with pembrolizumab.

      III. To determine the progression-free survival (PFS) using RECIST v1.1 in patients with
      metastatic non-squamous NSCLC treated with pembrolizumab.

      IV. To determine the overall survival (OS) in patients with metastatic non-squamous NSCLC
      treated with pembrolizumab.

      V. To determine the safety and tolerability of pembrolizumab in patients with metastatic
      non-squamous NSCLC.
