  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a prospective clinical trial designed to primarily test the impact of
      rideshare-based transportation services from a digital transportation network, Lyft, on
      reducing primary care clinic missed appointments--a composite outcome of no-shows and same
      day cancellations--for Medicaid patients. The study population consists of West Philadelphia
      residents who are established patients at two of the Penn Medicine Primary Care Practices
      within the University of Pennsylvania Health System. The study subjects are allocated into
      the intervention or control arm using a pseudorandomization approach - those receiving an
      appointment reminder on an even calendar day are in the intervention arm and odd calendar day
      calls are in the control arm.

      Secondary outcomes include the time of arrival to the clinics relative to actual appointment
      time (both arms), prospective utilization of acute care settings (both arms), prospective
      utilization of primary care (both arms), and description of programmatic metrics in the
      intervention arm (travel time, misuse, and costs). The investigators will assess the patient
      experience after each ride using a telephone-based survey and in-depth interviews. All adults
      with established primary care at the Penn Medicine Clinics, who have Medicaid, and do not
      require wheelchair accessible rides will be eligible for the rideshare service. The
      investigators hypothesize that individuals offered a rideshare-based transportation service
      will have a decreased proportion of missed appointments and same day cancellations as those
      not offered the service.
