      Patients who complete study SPM-007 will be enrolled in this study at the time of the last
      visit of the preceding study. The assessments at the last visit of the preceding study will
      also be used as baseline measures for the current study. If the patient has previously
      discontinued SPM-007 and greater than 30 days have elapsed since the final visit in SPM-007,
      baseline measures for the current study will be repeated, and an interim medical history will
      be taken to assess whether any new medical conditions were diagnosed in the time between
      studies.

      The study will continue until the last patient entered has completed 24 months in this study.

      Follow-up visits will occur at 3, 6, 12, 18 and 24 months. A final follow-up visit will occur
      for all remaining patients at study closure when the final enrolled subject has completed 24
      months on study.

      An Interim Visit must be performed a maximum of 1 month after any change in device settings.
      Interim visits may also be performed at any time at the principal investigator's discretion;
      either between scheduled visits, or after the patient has completed the Month 24 Visit, if
      the study is still ongoing.
