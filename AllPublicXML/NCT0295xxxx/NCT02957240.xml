  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Nearly 2 out of 10 women will sustain a distal forearm fracture throughout their
      lifespan.Recent longitudinal studies illustrate that as many as 1/3 of all persons who
      undergo closed reduction and casting for distal radius fractures (DRF) go on to develop type
      1 complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS). Graded motor imagery (i.e., motor imagery and mirror
      therapy), a movement representation technique, is strongly supported in the literature as a
      treatment of CRPS and has recently been suggested as a potential strategy to prevent its
      onset. Other complications include disability, wrist/forearm tightness and sensorimotor
      changes.

      The investigators propose that an early intervention protocol which includes graded motor
      imagery (GMI) will improve the pain, functional and upper limb sensorimotor outcomes of
      persons following closed reduction and casting of DRF relative to a standard of care
      intervention.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Distal radius fractures (DRF) account for nearly one-fifth of all fractures in older adults
      with women sustaining them at a rate of 5 to 1 relative to their male counterparts. The
      majority of DRF occur as a result of low impact injuries to the wrist with the hand being
      outstretched and are most often managed via closed treatment and cast immobilization The
      aftereffects of these injuries include pain, distal upper limb immobility, distal
      sensorimotor changes, hand weakness, edema, and type I complex CRPS development. Women, those
      sustaining low-force injuries, and those who undergo closed treatment and cast immobilization
      of the DRF, are at increased risk for developing type I CRPS. Given that alterations in the
      brain's somatosensory strip likely influence CRPS development, a newer intervention, graded
      motor imagery, is being used to restore the affected limbs cortical representation to its
      typical state. Beyond pain reduction, the implications of this type of approach also include
      restoring sensorimotor function to the affected limb. Evidence supports that these
      interventions can impact CRPS symptoms as well as motor function but only after they've
      developed. To date, there is no literature exploring how these techniques, specifically
      graded motor imagery, can be applied to prevent or mitigate the aforementioned aftereffects
      of DRF in women.

      To this end the investigators propose to pilot a 6-week randomized comparative effectiveness
      trial, where the modified graded motor imagery program + standard of care group is compared
      to a standard of care (SOC) control group. Immediately following cast immobilization, the
      intervention group and control group will each participate in one 1-hr and three 30-minute
      clinic-based sessions and 15 minute home programs three times daily. Blinded assessments will
      occur at baseline, 3 weeks, cast removal, and one and 3 months after cast removal and will
      include pain, sensorimotor, edema, and CRPS diagnostic outcomes.

      The project's aims are to: 1) determine the feasibility of recruiting, enrolling, treating,
      and following participants and 2) determine if those who participate in a GMI and SOC hand
      therapy program have differing pain, function, and counts of CRPS diagnoses when compared to
      those who receive only the SOC. The investigators hypothesize 1) that the project will be
      feasible to carry out on a larger scale and 2) that an early GMI will improve the pain,
      functional and upper limb sensorimotor outcomes of persons with closed treatment of DRF
      relative to a standard of care intervention.

    <description>This group will partake in 4 clinic-based intervention sessions (one 1-hr. and 3 subsequent 30-minute sessions) where the focus will be on home program competency/advancement. Session 1 will occur within 1 week of cast treatment, session 2 in week 2, session 3 in week 4, and session 4 in week 5.
Home program (3x daily, 15 minutes) to include 10 repetitions of active thumb opposition, active thumb radial abduction, intrinsic minus active stretches, flat fist and composite, finger extension, Elbow flexion and extension, Shoulder scapular rolls, and glenohumeral circumduction.
Edema will be addressed through strict elevation when at rest and every 10 minutes on the hour. When resting in a seated or supine position, clients will be instructed to use pillows to accomplish elevation and to keep elbows in an extended position. Instructions for elevation will be provided immediately following orthopaedic intervention. Strict elevation will be recommended for the first 72 hours of the injury.</description>

    <description>Those in this group will receive 4 clinic-based intervention session (one 1-hr. and three subsequent 30-minute sessions) where the focus will be on home program competency and advancement. Session 1 will occur within 1 week of cast treatment, session 2 in week 2, session 3 in week 4, and session 4 in week 5.
Home Program will be performed 3x daily for 15 minutes. A Motor Representation Technique (i.e., modified GMI) protocol described by Lagueux et al. will be employed. As originally designed the program was broken into three stages 1) Laterality, 2) Explicit Motor Imagery, 3) Mirror therapy with unaffected hand only and 4) Mirror Therapy with bilateral hands. For the purpose of this study, and given the restraint offered by cast immobilization, the 4th phase will not be used. Each phase will require 1-2 weeks and will be progressed at the discretion of the hand therapist interventionist.</description>
