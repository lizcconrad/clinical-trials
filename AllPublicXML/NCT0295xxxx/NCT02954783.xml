      Background and purpose: The purpose of this study is to investigate the effect of exercise on
      intratumoral natural killer (NK)-cell variability in patients with localized prostate cancer
      undergoing radical prostatectomy.

      The primary hypothesis is that exercise induces epinephrine-mediated intratumoral natural
      killer (NK)-cell infiltration in patients with localized prostate cancer, and that the
      infiltration is greater in patients performing High Intensity Interval Training compared to
      moderate intensity training.

      Currently there is a lack of randomized controlled trials examining different types of
      exercise in patients with localized prostate cancer. Moreover there is a need for studies
      including biological measurements to allow a full assessment of the effect of exercise on
      diverse biomarkers and mechanistic pathways, which may influence cancer survival.

      Subjects: Patients with histologically verified prostate adenocarcinoma scheduled for radical
      prostatectomy at Urologic Department, Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen, Denmark.

      Methods: In this randomized controlled pilot study 30 patients with localized prostate cancer
      undergoing radical prostatectomy will be included and randomized to either High Intensity
      Interval Training (HIIT) exercise intervention, Moderate-Intensity Aerobic Exercise and
      Resistance Training (MI-AT+RT) intervention (standard recommendations) or observational
      control receiving usual care for a total period of 8 weeks.

      All patients will undergo assessments at inclusion (baseline) and after 8 weeks (5-7 days
      prior to surgery,) respectively.

      Assessments include: anthropometrics; blood pressure; resting hearth rate; cardiorespiratory
      fitness by cardiopulmonary exercise test (VO2 peak.); body composition by DXA scan; quality
      of life by self-report questionnaires; oral glucose tolerance test; fasting blood sample
      measuring cholesterol, triglycerides, insulin, c-peptide, HbA1c, glucose, hormones and
      inflammatory markers.

      Also, the investigators will collect blood samples before, during and after an acute exercise
      bout in order to explore the acute systemic changes in exercise-regulated biomarkers.

      Biological tissue from tumor (primary prostate biopsies) will be retrieved from the
      respective local pathological departments and from the perioperative prostate specimen and
      sent to protocol analyses.

      The purpose of this study is to investigate the effect of exercise on the variability of
      intratumoral Natural Killer (NK)-cell infiltration in tumor biopsies taken before and after
      an exercise intervention in patients randomized to one of three study arms: I) High Intensity
      Interval Training (N=10) II) Moderate-Intensity Aerobic and Resistance Training (N=10) or
      III) usual care, prior to radical prostatectomy (N=10).

      In addition to this the investigators wish to investigate the effect of these different
      exercise regimens on tumor vessel morphology, modulation of tumor-metabolism, -biology and
      signaling. Furthermore the aim is to explore the acute response in immune cells, hormones and
      cytokines in blood samples taken before, during and after a single exercise session in
      patients in the two exercise intervention arms.

      Finally the aim is to explore the effect of different pre-operative exercise regimens on
      physiological (e.g. cardiovascular fitness, body composition, metabolic profile and metabolic
      inflammatory markers) and psycho-social (e.g. fatigue, emotional well-being, anxiety)
      endpoints relative to usual care.

    <description>Body weight and anthropometrics (height, waist and hip circumference) will be assessed using standard procedures. Resting heart rate and blood pressure (Microlife, BPA100) will be determined in a supine position. Body composition (fat mass, bone mass and fat-free mass) and bone mineral density are analyzed by whole-body dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) scan (Lunar, Lunar Corporation Madison, Wisconsin, USA). Transverse scans at 1 cm intervals are made from head to toe measuring the absorption of x-ray beams at two different energy levels as these are sent through the body. Since the different chemical compounds in the body absorb the intensity of the X-rays differently, the scan allows for a valid determination of bone mass, fat mass and fat-free/bone-free mass</description>

The test starts with a 5 min warm up at 70 watt (the watts may have to be adjusted to the individual fitness level). Warm up is immediately followed by a 20 watt increase every 1 min until exhaustion. Ventilation and expired gases will be measured during the test via an indirect calorimetric system, and heart rate will be assessed simultaneously.</description>

The procedure is repeated until the single repetition cannot be completed in good form, and the load of the last successful repetition on noted as the 1-RM score.</description>
