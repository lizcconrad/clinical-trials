      This is a pilot non-intervention study that aims to introduce PET/MRI, a state of the art new
      imaging technique, into the radiotherapy treatment pathway of patients with head and neck
      cancer. Ultimately the investigators aim to establish appropriate scanning and image
      registration protocols, to allow progression to a randomized trial of adaptive radiotherapy
      dose escalation. The latter is thought to potentially improve outcomes in this group.

      Ten patients with squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of the oropharynx, hypopharynx and larynx,
      planned for radical treatment with radiotherapy (+/-chemotherapy), will be recruited. Study
      participants will have two PET/MRI scans, with the radiotherapy immobilization devices in
      situ. The first will be done prior to the start of radiotherapy, the second half way through
      treatment.

      Image quality will be assessed by comparing to standard diagnostic scans and different
      registration methods will be compared to establish the best way of incorporating PET/MR image
      data into the radiotherapy planning system. Patient tolerability and workflow considerations
      will also be qualitatively assessed. Furthermore, a planning study will be conducted to
      establish relevant treatment protocols for a subsequent dose escalation trial.

      PET/MRI is an exciting new technology with a lot of potential in the context of adaptive
      radiotherapy dose escalation. Within this pilot study the investigators aim to address the
      technical challenges of using it in this context prior to proceeding to a randomized trial.
