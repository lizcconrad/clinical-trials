  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      One hundred Spanish postmenopausal women accepted to be investigated for cardiovascular risk
      actors including clinical features, serum biochemical parameters, single nucleotide
      polymorphisms for estrogen receptor, and imaging parameters, carotid intima-media thickness
      (92 women) and coronary computed tomography (32 women). MANOVA analysis confirmed that both
      age and estradiol level behaved as independent variables associated with IMT. Findings at the
      coronary arteries, either moderate or high calcium index (CAC) and/or significant lumen
      stenosis were sporadic and did not allow for establishing association with any of the
      variables assessed.

    <textblock>
      One hundred postmenopausal women living in the urban area of Valencia were invited to
      participate in a cross-sectional study in which a list of clinical and analytical risk
      factors for cardiovascular disease were assessed. Clinical factors included weight, waist
      circumference, body mass index and blood pressure. Analytical parameters included lipidogram,
      serum glucose and insulin, thyroid hormones (TSH and total T4), vitamin D, ultra-sensitive
      C-reactive protein, estradiol, and osteoprotegerin. Imaging studies were performed to
      identify the atherosclerotic burden at the carotid artery (intima-media thickness, measured
      by a high frequency ultrasound probe), and the coronaries (both coronary artery calcium(CAC)
      score and the degree of lumen stenosis). Genetic susceptibility was measured by studying
      single nucleotide polymorphisms of the estrogen receptor. The independent effect of each
      variable was analyzed with MANOVA.
