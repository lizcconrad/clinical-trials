  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Difficulty in managing the airway is the single most important cause of major
      anesthesia-related morbidity and mortality. The currently used clinical method of predicting
      airway difficulty used by anesthetists is limited and not very highly sensitive or specific.
      Any additional bedside method that increases its specificity and sensitivity would be
      valuable. This project is designed to study and measure the tongue thickness and oral cavity
      height by using an ultrasound scan and comparing them with the same measurements obtained by
      CT scan. These will also be compared to a more complicated measurements used in previous
      studies to investigate any correlation with the currently used clinical methods. This
      information will help us decide if ultrasound may help Anesthesiologists assess difficulties
      in airway management in a more accurate, precise and reliable simpler method.

    <description>Ultrasound scanning examinations will be performed twice (pre-CT scan and post CT-scan). Each examination will be performed by two observers who are blinded to each other's measured values.Patients will be asked to place a small sip of water (20 mL)in their mouth and keep the mouth open during the imaging. A second ultrasound examination of each patient by the two observers will be performed after the CT-scan.</description>
