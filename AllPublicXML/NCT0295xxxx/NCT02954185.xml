  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Preliminary evaluations have been completed and resulted in patients and therapist indicating
      positive outcomes through increased patient engagement, asynchronous communications (i.e.
      messaging) between therapists and patients, and objective assessment and monitoring of
      exercises performed by the patients. The investigator's hypothesis is that patients using the
      Wellclub device and application in addition to in-clinic physical therapy will be more
      compliant with their home exercise programs and have the same or better functional outcomes
      than patients with similar conditions who use in-clinic care only.

      Patients seeking an initial outpatient physical therapy evaluation for non-surgical shoulder
      impingement with pain, who own iPhones with iOS 8 or later. Patients will be randomized into
      the study group or the control group, and be seen at least once per week by their physical
      therapist for the duration of the therapy episode, or up to 12 weeks. The study group will be
      asked to strap to their wrist a small, measurement device and download a smartphone
      application. The App communicates with the wearable device and reminds them to complete their
      therapy and provides patients visual instruction, feedback on exercise quality, and exercise
      count for the prescribed physical therapy. The control group will only have traditional
      in-clinic therapy as deemed clinically necessary by the PT.
