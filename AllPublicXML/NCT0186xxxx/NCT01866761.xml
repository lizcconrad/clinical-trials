      Objective: We aimed at analyzing the relationship between periodontal disease and
      atherosclerosis in medical treatment and periodontal treatment under medical and dental care
      across borders in a local cooperation system of Japanese medical services.

      Materials and methods:

        -  A prospective multi-center case cohort study was conducted on 37 ambulatory medical
           patients (with lifestyle-related diseases under consultation in either of the medical
           clinics registered as collaborative investigation facilities) and 79 periodontal
           patients (who were seen by the dental clinics registered as collaborative investigation
           facilities).

        -  Medical treatment and clinical periodontal treatment were provided on the subjects under
           medical and dental care across borders by each internal medicine and dental clinics.

        -  Systemic examination of lifestyle-related disease and periodontal examination were
           performed before and after periodontal treatment, and the relationships between
           periodontal and atherosclerosis-related clinical markers were analyzed before and after
           periodontal treatment.

        This clinical study was performed by the local clinics which belonged to Tokyo Medical
        Practitioners Association, Tokyo Dental Practitioners Association, and Chiba Medical
        Practitioners Association. 37 patients (with lifestyle-related diseases under consultation
        in either of 16 medical clinics), and 79 periodontal patients (not undergoing treatment at
        a medical clinic,) were enrolled. The subjects constituted a broad cross-section of the
        local society. Medical treatment at an internal medicine clinic and clinical periodontal
        treatment including periodontal surgery at a dental clinic were performed on all the
        subjects. Twenty-six patients dropped out of the study and medical treatment and
        periodontal treatment were provided to the remaining 90 subjects (mean ages: 59.2 Â± 12.3
        yrs).

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Periodontal disease: inflamed gingiva with positive for bleeding on probing or teeth
             with probing pocket depth more than 4 mm Lifestyle-related disease: Plaques are
             included when maximum IMT is measured. Furthermore, hypertension was defined as
             systolic blood pressure of more than 140 mm Hg or diastolic pressure of more than 90
             mm Hg, or both, or patients already being treated by anti-hypertensive agents.
             Hypercholesterolemia was defined by serum concentration of LDL-C of more than 140
             mg/dL, or patients already being treated by lipid-lowering agents. Diabetes mellitus
             was defined by HbA1c of more than 6.9 % (NGSP value) or fasting blood sugar of more
             than 126 mg/dl or both, or patients already being treated by agents for diabetes.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  At initial consultation and examination (Baseline), patients with less than 6 months
             after the onset of acute myocardial infarction (AMI), and with a past history or
             complication of serious heart disease were excluded. Similarly, those with less than 6
             months after cardiovascular revascularization surgery, less than 6 months after the
             onset of cerebrovascular disorder, or serious liver disease or renal disease were also
             excluded.
