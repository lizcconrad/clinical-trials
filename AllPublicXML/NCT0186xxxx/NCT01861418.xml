  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purposes of this study are:

        1. To examine the within-day and between-day test-retest reliability of a testing protocol
           measuring the back and hip muscles fatigability using EMG median frequency

        2. To examine the immediate and the carry-over effects of the lumbopelvic manipulation on
           the EMG median frequency of the lumbar multifidus (MULT), gluteus medius (GMED) and
           gluteus maximus (GMAX) muscles in patients with chronic low back pain (CLBP)

        3. To compare the fatigability levels of the MULT, GMED and GMAX muscles by measuring the
           EMG median frequency between the participants who will receive lumbopelvic manipulation.

      The research hypotheses are:

        1. The testing protocol using EMG median frequency as a fatigue indicator for MULT,GMED and
           GMAX muscles will have good (ICC ≥ 0.80) within-day and between-day test-retest
           reliability.

        2. The fatigability level of the MULT, GMED and GMAX muscles will significantly decrease
           immediately after the lumbopelvic manipulation and will be maintained over two to four
           days following the manipulation.

        3. The fatigability of the MULT, GMED and GMAX muscles will significantly decrease after
           the intervention in the manipulation group while no change will occur in the placebo
           group.

    <description>Pain Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) will be used in this study. Participants will be asked to rate their pain level on a 10-cm horizontal line which is marked on the left end &quot;No pain&quot; and on the right end &quot;Extreme pain&quot;. Then, the pain level for a specific participant will be determined by measuring the line from the &quot;No pain&quot; end to the mark placed by the participant.</description>

    <description>Each participant will lie in a supine position. The treating investigator (TI) will stand on the opposite side of the low back pain. Then, the participant will be asked to clasp his/her hand behind the neck. The TI will side bend the participant's spine towards the non-painful side, reach through the participant's hands and perform a spinal rotation away from the painful side. The TIs other hand will be placed over the anterior superior iliac spine (ASIS) of the painful side. Lastly, the TI will take up the slack and maintain the pressure on the ASIS for 5-10 seconds and ask the participant whether he/she can tolerate the pressure. If the participant can tolerate the pressure for at least 5 seconds. Then, the subjects will be re-positioned to the starting position.</description>
