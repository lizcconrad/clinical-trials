      The primary objective of the phase II study is to assess the objective (CR+PR) response rate
      at a maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of Lomustine in combination with Temozolomide and
      Thalidomide after the first cycle (8 weeks) in patients with metastatic melanoma in the
      brain. Secondary objectives include the evaluation of objective response in the extracranial
      metastases, duration of response and overall survival.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The dosages of Temozolomide and Thalidomide will be fixed, and the dose of Lomustine will be
      the phase I MTD or the highest dose studied if the MTD was not attained.

      All 3 drugs will be taken by mouth at home. Each treatment cycle will last for 8 weeks.
      Temozolomide will be taken once a day for 6 weeks followed by two weeks off. You will take
      thalidomide every day for the entire 8-week cycle. Thalidomide should also be taken near
      bedtime, usually 30 to 45 minutes before the temozolomide dose. You will take 2 doses of
      lomustine every 8 weeks. You will take the first dose of lomustine on Day 1 of the 8-week
      cycle. You will take the second dose, which will be half as big as the first dose, on Day 29
      (the day after the first 4 weeks) of the 8-week cycle. The dose of lomustine is also based on
      your height and weight. Lomustine should be swallowed and not chewed.

      A maximum of 30 patients will be enrolled,

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Histologic Documentation: Histologic or cytologic diagnosis of distant metastatic
             melanoma and clinical evidence of brain metastasis.

          2. Pts must have brain lesions of =/&gt; 1.0cm longest dimension by magnetic resonance (MRI)
             or spiral computed tomography (CT), if MRI not feasible or &gt; 0.5cm by MRI with 3D
             images. Patients with/without extracranial disease are eligible. Measurable
             extracranial disease is not required. Lesions that are considered non-measurable
             include: &lt;1.0 cm by MRI or Spiral CT, Bone lesions, Leptomeningeal disease, Ascites,
             Pleural/pericardial effusion, Lymphangitis cutis/pulmonis, Abdominal masses that are
             not confirmed and followed by imaging techniques, Cystic lesions, lesions that are in
             a previously irradiated area, unless new growth can be documented.

          3. Age &gt;/= 18 years of age.

          4. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance Status: 0 or 1

          5. No more than 1 prior chemotherapy regimen and no prior chemotherapy for brain
             metastases. No prior treatment with continuous daily dose of temozolomide; prior
             immunotherapy and surgical resection are permitted. Patients with prior history of
             whole brain radiotherapy (WBRT) and stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) are permitted
             providing that there is measurable lesion with documented growth post radiation or new
             disease.

          6. (#5 continued) Progression of lesions treated with WBRT must be shown by 2 post
             treatment brain imaging at least 3 weeks apart. Progression of disease is also
             considered when the patient had increase of lesions as per MRI of brain obtained 4
             weeks or more after WBRT completed when compared to baseline MRI obtained less than 1
             week prior to start of radiation. Lesions treated with SRS must have responded and
             then progressed.

          7. The following time periods must have elapsed since prior therapy: 3 weeks since
             surgical resection or stereotactic radiosurgery; 4weeks since prior whole brain
             radiation therapy; 6 weeks since prior nitrosureas or mitomycin C. Biologic agents
             used as adjuvants and vaccines or cellular therapies will not require 4-week wash out
             period if the patient meets all eligibility criteria.

          8. No frequent vomiting and/or medical condition that could interfere with oral
             medication intake (e.g., partial bowel obstruction).

          9. No other concurrent chemotherapy/immunotherapy/radiotherapy.

         10. No history of active angina or myocardial infarction within 6 months. No history of
             significant ventricular arrythmia or uncontrolled arrythmia or bradycardia. The study
             participants must have resting heart rate of 48 or greater (.e.i - to receive
             Thalidomide).

         11. No prior history of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism (PE).

         12. No known HIV disease. Patients with a history of intravenous drug abuse or any other
             behavior associated with an increased risk of HIV infection should be tested for
             exposure to the HIV virus. Because peripheral neuropathies are a common toxicity of
             antiviral therapy and of viral infection in HIV patients, as well as a common
             significant toxicity with thalidomide, patients who test positive or who are known to
             be infected are not eligible. An HIV test is not required for entry on this protocol,
             but is required if the patient is perceived to be at risk.

         13. No pre-existing neuropathy that is &gt;/= grade 2, including uncontrolled seizures.

         14. No expected need for radiotherapy to brain or any extracranial metastatic site during
             the period of participation in the study.

         15. Patients may not be taking Coumadin, warfarin or heparin products or their
             derivatives.

         16. Patients who require anti-platelet therapy such as daily aspirin, Plavix or ibuprofen
             are not eligible to participate.

         17. Patients requiring the use of bisphosphonates (e.g., zolendronic acid) are not
             eligible to participate. Patients who receive thalidomide in combination with
             zolendronic acid are potentially at increased risk of renal dysfunction.

         18. Required Initial Laboratory Data: Granulocytes &gt;/= 1,500/ml; Platelet count &gt;/=
             100,000/ul; Creatinine &lt;/=2 mg/dl; Transaminases (ALT,AST) &lt;/= 3 * upper limits of
             normal; Alkaline phosphatase &lt;/= 3 * upper limits of normal; TSH Within normal limits
             Serum beta-HCG Negative (in female patients unless S/P hysterectomy or menopausal or
             no menses for 24 months). Assay must have a sensitivity of at least 50 mIU/ml. Serum
             anticonvulsant levels (for patients on a measurable anticonvulsant) must be within
             therapeutic range. Electrocardiography (EKG) must be without acute abnormalities or
             uncontrolled arrhythmia.

         19. Pregnant and nursing women are not eligible for treatment on this protocol. Women of
             childbearing potential must agree to abstain from all intercourse or use two methods
             of birth control for 28 days prior to treatment and while under treatment with
             thalidomide and for 4 weeks after completing therapy. One of the methods of birth
             control must be highly active (IUD, hormonal, tubal ligation or partner's vasectomy)
             and used concomitantly with one additional method(e.g., latex condom, diaphragm or
             cervical cap. Please see also eligibility criteria 19 and 20.

         20. In addition, women of childbearing potential must have morning urine b-HCG performed
             within 1 week prior to registration and within 24 hours before beginning study
             treatment. All the precautions for childbearing potential women are required even in
             patients with infertility unless due to hysterectomy or the patient has been post
             menopausal (has had no menses for at least 24 consecutive months). Men must agree to
             abstain from unprotected sexual intercourse. Male patients should request that female
             partners use a second method of birth control in addition to the male barrier method
             (condoms).

         21. All patients (men and women) must agree to use medically approved contraceptive
             measures simultaneously prior to starting thalidomide therapy, all during drug
             therapy, and for at least 1 month after therapy has stopped. Women of childbearing
             potential should start using medically approved contraceptive measures 4 weeks prior
             to starting thalidomide therapy.

         22. Patients must give written consent.

         23. Patients must be willing and able to comply with the FDA-mandated S.T.E.P.S version 3
             program.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Presence of any ongoing toxic effect from prior treatment.

          2. Serious infection requiring intravenous antibiotics, or nonmalignant medical illnesses
             that are uncontrolled or whose control may be jeopardized by the complications of this
             therapy.

          3. Concurrent active malignancy other than non-melanoma skin cancers or carcinoma-in-situ
             of the cervix. Patients with previous malignancies, but which have not required
             anti-tumor treatment within the preceding 24 months will be allowed to enter the
             trial. Patients with a history of a T1a or b prostate cancer (detected incidentally at
             Transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP) and comprising less than 5% of resected
             tissue) may participate if the Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) remained within normal
             limits since TURP.

          4. Any other medical condition or reason that, in the principal investigator's opinion,
             makes the patient unsuitable to participate in a clinical trial including but not
             limited to active bleeding, prior surgical procedures affecting absorption or
             gastrointestinal tract disease resulting in inability to take oral medication.

          5. Pregnant and lactating women.
