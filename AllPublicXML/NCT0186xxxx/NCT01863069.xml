  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective was to determine the tolerability of a new inhaled formulation of
      interferon beta-1a when given as a single dose, when given once per week for 4 weeks, and
      compared with standard intramuscular (IM) AVONEX® when given as a single dose.

      The additional objectives were:

      To determine the pharmacokinetic (PK) properties of a new inhaled formulation of interferon
      beta-1a, using an anti-viral cytopathic effect (CPE) assay for human interferon-beta, when
      given as a single dose, when given once per week for 4 weeks, and compared with standard IM
      AVONEX® when given as a single dose.

      To determine the pharmacodynamic (PD) properties of a new inhaled formulation of interferon
      beta-1a, as measured by serum neopterin and 2-microglobulin, when given as a single dose,
      when given once per week for 4 weeks, and compared with standard IM AVONEX® when given as a
      single dose.
