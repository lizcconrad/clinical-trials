  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic Heart Failure (CHF) is a growing public health issue in Canada. Hospital re-admission
      within 1-year after diagnosis is 25-40%, and the 5-year rate of CHF death is 50%. Counseling
      by multidisciplinary health care teams helps CHF patients to improve self-care behaviors (for
      medications, diet, exercise, smoking cessation and symptom monitoring), and this reduces the
      rate of death and CHF hospitalization. In the absence of intervention, patient adherence to
      these behaviors is below recommended standards and quality of life among CHF patients becomes
      progressively compromised. A major challenge is to make self-care counseling available
      without overtaxing health care resources.

      This 3.5 year multicenter clinical trial will establish and evaluate a Canadian e-platform
      that provides multidisciplinary e-counseling to help patients with CHF to initiate and
      maintain recommended self-care behaviors. The investigators will recruit 298 CHF patients in
      Toronto, Montreal and Vancouver. The investigators hypothesize that a 12-month program of
      e-Counseling + Usual Care versus general eInfo + Usual Care will improve quality of life,
      self-care behaviors and heart health. This proposal is based upon previous clinical trials in
      CHF, e-health and preventive lifestyle counseling by our team. It also builds upon our
      established collaboration with the consumer eHealth program of the Heart and Stroke
      Foundation of Ontario. The novel contribution of this research is that it will establish an
      infrastructure for a pan-Canadian e-platform in preventive e-counseling for CHF. A key
      feature of this proposal is that our multidisciplinary team will work with the Heart and
      Stroke Foundation to share our findings and e-health resources with the public and other
      health care professionals in Canada, which will help to galvanize research and clinical work
      in eCounseling. Our clinical trial will strengthen eCounseling services in order to improve
      the quality of life of patients with CHF.

    <description>This intervention will use film vignettes and interactive web pages. The e-counseling messages will promote: (i) validation of the subject's stage of &quot;readiness&quot; for behavior change, (ii) collaborative participation by means of subject-selected menus, (iii) reinforcement of &quot;change talk&quot; to resolve ambivalence, (iv) use of self-help information and e-tools for self-monitoring of targeted self-care behaviors, and (v) development of cognitive-behavioral skills to build and strengthen efficacy. Messages will be proactively sent to Controls according to the following schedule: weekly for months 1 to 4, bi-weekly for months 5 to 8, and monthly for months 9 to 12.</description>
