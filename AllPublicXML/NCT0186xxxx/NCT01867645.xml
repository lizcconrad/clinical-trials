    <textblock>
      Critical illness polyneuropathy and/or myopathy (CIPNM) is a severe complication of critical
      illness. Retrospective data suggest that early application of IgM-enriched intravenous
      immunoglobulin (IVIG) may prevent or mitigate CIPNM. Therefore, the primary objective was to
      assess the effect of early IgM-enriched IVIG versus placebo to mitigate CIPNM in a
      prospective setting.

      Background: Critical illness polyneuropathy and/or myopathy (CIPNM) is a severe complication
      of critical illness. Retrospective data suggest that early application of IgM-enriched
      intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) may prevent or mitigate CIPNM. Therefore, the primary
      objective will be to assess the effect of early IgM-enriched IVIG versus placebo to mitigate
      CIPNM in a prospective setting.

      Design: Prospective, randomized, double-blinded and placebo-controlled trial

      Setting: Eight-bed medical ICU of a university hospital.

      Participants: Critically ill patients will be screened for eligibility defined as multiple
      organ failure (MOF) and SIRS/sepsis. Patients fulfilling these criteria will be further
      assessed by a neurologist for clinical signs of CIPNM.

      Critically ill patients with multiple organ failure (MOF), SIRS/sepsis, and early clinical
      signs of CIPNM will be randomized.

    <description>The primary outcome was to assess the effect of early IVIG (IgM-enriched Intravenous immunoglobulins) versus placebo to mitigate CIPNM in critically ill patients as assessed by the CIPNM severity sum score on day 14. The CIPNM severity sum score is based on electrophysiological stimulation of the median, ulnar, and tibial nerves on days 0, 4, 7, 14 and on the histological evaluation of muscle biopsies on days 0 and 14 and ranged from 0 (no CIPNM) to 8 (very severe CIPNM).</description>

    <description>This secondary outcome aimed to assess the effect of early IVIG versus placebo on the length of the ICU stay. Length of ICU stay is defined as the time difference difference between admission of the patient to the ICU and discharge to a (non-ICU) ward or death. This outcome will be assessed an the day of ICU discharge.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Critically ill patients with failure of at least 2 organ systems diagnosed with SIRS or
        sepsis fulfilling the following inclusion criteria will be included in this study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        The inclusion criteria have to be met at the time of enrolment into the study, i.e. at the
        start of the baseline period. Patients with any of the following conditions will be
        excluded from the study:

          1. Age &lt; 18 years or &gt; 80 years

             motor function.

          8. Patients with relevant pulmonary edema secondary to severe heart failure will be
             excluded because of the relatively high infusion volume (5ml /kg body weight per day
             over 3 days) determined by the study medication
