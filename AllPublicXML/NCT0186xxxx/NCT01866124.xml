    <textblock>
      The MAM'Out research project aims at evaluating a seasonal and multi-annual cash transfer
      program in the framework of a safety net to prevent acute malnutrition by children under 24
      months, in terms of effectiveness and cost-effectiveness in the Tapoa province (East region
      of Burkina Faso, Africa). The program will be targeted to economically vulnerable households
      with children less than 1 year old at the time of inclusion and the cash distributed to
      mothers. The transfers will be assimilated to unconditional ones, leading to beneficiaries'
      self-determination on the use that will be made of cash. This study will be designed as a
      two-arm cluster randomized intervention trial, based on randomization of rural villages of
      the Tapoa province. One arm will receive the intervention and one will be a control arm. The
      main outcomes will be the cumulative incidence of acute malnutrition (or wasting) and the
      cost-effectiveness. Anthropometric measures (height, weight and MUAC) will be measured, as
      well as indicators of dietary diversity, food security, health center frequentation,
      families' expenses and morbidities. Questionnaires and 24-hour food recalls will also be
      analyzed. Finally, based on a model theory framework built a priori, the pathways used by the
      cash to have an effect on the prevention of under-nutrition will be assessed.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      At international level, the WHO formulated guidelines for the treatment of severe acute
      malnutrition (or wasting) (WHO 1999, and more recently ACF 2011), and guidelines for moderate
      acute malnutrition (or wasting) are in the process of formulation. In contrast, surprisingly
      little is known on preventive schemes for acute malnutrition. In Haiti, Ruel et al (2008)
      found that targeting nutrition interventions to prevent children from becoming malnourished
      might be more effective than curative treatment to reduce child wasting. In addition, recent
      preventive trials in humanitarian settings focused on the use of food-based strategies,
      especially ready-to-use food (Isanaka, 2009; Hendricks, 2010; Parikh, 2010; Imbad, 2011;
      Huybregts, 2012). However, it is well known that the causes of under-nutrition are numerous
      and also relate to inadequate health and care practices, lack of food diversification, food
      insecurityâ€¦ Therefore, the MAM'Out research project aims at assessing a context-adapted
      preventive approach, which is likely to influence several underlying causes of
      under-nutrition and not based primarily on food supplementation. The objective is to provide
      an evidence base for this alternative approach, in order that proven intervention be taken
      into account for scale-up at policy-making levels.

    <description>Mothers are the primary recipient of the CT. The proposed approach will be based on monthly seasonal CTs during 5 months, from May to September, for two years (2013 and 2014). A monthly 10 000 FCFA will be transferred to the selected households.
These CTs will be done via mobile phones, in collaboration with the mobile phone company Airtel.</description>
