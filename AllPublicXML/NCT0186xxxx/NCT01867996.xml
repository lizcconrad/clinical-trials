    <textblock>
      This will be a randomized single sequence open label study. This study is designed to
      determine if chronic dosing with efavirenz (EFZ) will have an effect on the pharmacokinetics
      (PK) of intravenously-administered retosiban in healthy volunteers. The study consists of
      screening (28 days), treatment (1 dosing session) and follow-up (7 to 14 days) period, and
      the total duration of study participation for each subject will be approximately 8 weeks.
      During the treatment period, subjects will be admitted to the clinical research unit the day
      before dosing (Day 1) and will remain until completion of the last assessment on Day 20. All
      subjects will receive on Day 1, a 6 milligrams (mg) bolus of retosiban for 5 minutes (min),
      followed by a 6 mg/hour (hr) infusion for 12 hrs. On Day 2, a washout day will occur. On Days
      3-17, subjects will receive EFZ 600 mg once daily in the evening. On Day 18, subjects will
      receive a 6 mg bolus of retosiban for 5 mins, followed by a 6 mg/hr infusion for 12 hrs plus
      a 600 mg dose of EFZ.

    <description>The following PK parameters will be determined after administration of GSK221149 with and without EFZ 600 mg: Area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC)- from time zero to time t [AUC(0-t)] and from time zero extrapolated to infinite time [AUC(0-infinity)], maximum observed plasma concentration (Cmax) and clearance (CL). CL will be calculated for parent only.</description>

    <time_frame>Up to 8 Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Clinical laboratory tests will include hematology, clinical chemistry and urinalysis parameters. Triplicate 12-lead ECGs will be obtained at the screening visit. Single 12-lead ECGs will be obtained at other time points during the study. Vital sign measurements will include systolic and diastolic blood pressure and pulse rate.</description>

    <description>The following PK parameters will be determined after administration of GSK221149 with and without EFZ 600 mg: time to Cmax (tmax), lag time (tlag), and terminal phase half-life (t1/2). The terminal half-life (t1/2) is defined as the time required for the plasma concentration of drug to reach half of its original concentration.</description>
