    <textblock>
      This trial is conducted in Asia. The aim of the trial is to compare the glycaemic control of
      Levemir® (insulin detemir) administered once daily according to two titration algorithms
      after 20 weeks in subjects with type 2 diabetes inadequately controlled on metformin
      treatment with or without other anti-diabetic drugs (OADs).

    <description>A hypoglycaemic episode was defined as treatment emergent if the onset of the episode occurred after the first administration of the investigational medicinal product (IMP), and no later than the last day on trial product. Hypoglycaemic episodes were defined as nocturnal if the time of onset was between 23:00 and 05:59 inclusive. All plasma glucose values: · equal or below 3.9 mmol/L (70 mg/dL) or · higher than 3.9 mmol/L (70 mg/dL) when they occur in conjunction with hypoglycaemic symptoms.</description>

    <description>A once daily dosage of Insulin detemir (Levemir®) 100 U/mL 3 mL FlexPen® for subcutaneous administration was selected for this trial.During the treatment period insulin detemir was adjusted by the subject themselves (self-titration). Self-titration was performed every 3 days based on the lowest of three previous consecutive pre-breakfast SMPG values.Based on this glucose value, self-adjustment of insulin detemir dose was done. Metformin and Sulfonlylurea were allowed as OADs. For SMPG values, the following insulin detemir dose adjustments were done : &gt;6.1 mmol/L (&gt;110 mg/dL) +3U insulin detemir, 4.4-6.1 mmol/L (80-100 mg/dL) No adjustment in insulin detemir, &lt; 4.4 mmol/L (&lt;80 mg/dL) -3U insulin detemir.</description>

        <title>Incidence of Hypoglycaemic Episodes : Nocturnal (23:00-05:59) and Over 24 Hours.</title>
        <description>A hypoglycaemic episode was defined as treatment emergent if the onset of the episode occurred after the first administration of the investigational medicinal product (IMP), and no later than the last day on trial product. Hypoglycaemic episodes were defined as nocturnal if the time of onset was between 23:00 and 05:59 inclusive. All plasma glucose values: · equal or below 3.9 mmol/L (70 mg/dL) or · higher than 3.9 mmol/L (70 mg/dL) when they occur in conjunction with hypoglycaemic symptoms.</description>
