  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Dry eye syndrome is a highly prevalent ocular disease with an increasing incidence in the
      elderly population. Topically administered lubricants are the basis for treatment of this
      disease. However, information about the corneal residence time of topical lubricants is still
      sparse, therefore no ideal treatment regimen has been found.

      Recently a new method for assessment of tear film thickness based on optical coherence
      tomography (OCT) has become available. The aim of the present study is to assess corneal
      residence time of three different formulations of topical lubricants, in particular Thealoz
      Duo® Eye Drops, Hyabak® Eye Drops and Hydrabak® Eye Drops in patients with moderate dry eye
      disease. In addition, standard tests for dry eye syndrome, such as the ocular surface disease
      index (OSDI©), Schirmer I test and determination of tear break up time (BUT) will be
      performed..
