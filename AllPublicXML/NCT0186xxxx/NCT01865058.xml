  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) is one of the more frequent cancers in the western world with
      approx. 800 new cases annually in Denmark. Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) in Denmark
      accounts for almost 40% of newly diagnosed NHL cases. Treatment with the combination of
      chemotherapy and monoclonal antibodies has significantly improved prognosis over the past
      decade, but a large proportion of patients with DLBCL will continue to relapse with our
      current treatment options. Therefore, there is a need for reliable methods for detection of
      treatment response as early as possible in the treatment course in order to identify patients
      who respond poorly to standard treatment and potentially would benefit from a change in
      treatment strategy. This has still not been established, but a valid early marker is required
      in order to allow randomized trials of treatment stratified by early response. One of the
      most promising applications of PET is the metabolic assessment of the early response of
      cancer treatment.

      This study is a national prospective multicenter study emanating from the Danish Lymphoma
      Group (DLG). Patients are scanned after each of the early 4 cycles of chemo therapy. The aim
      is to establish the correct timing of response evaluation. Additionally, the investigators
      wish to investigate the optimal qualitative and quantitative method of response assessment in
      order to predict post-therapeutic remission and long-term prognosis.This study will
      contribute to interim-PET being implemented in the most optimal way in daily clinical
      practice.
