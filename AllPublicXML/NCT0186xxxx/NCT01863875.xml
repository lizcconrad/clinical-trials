    <textblock>
      Treatment with cochlear implantation is now offered to proximately 95 % of children with
      deafness in Norway. More than 500 children have been operated at Oslo University Hospital.
      The study is a cross-sectional study aimed to investigate speech perception, language skills,
      quality of life in all childhood cochlear implant (CI) recipients in Norway from 1988-2012.
      Factors such as child characteristics, characteristics with the family, the cochlear implant,
      the rehabilitation situation, choice of communication mode, school and work situation are
      surveyed to see if these factors can be associated with variations in outcome. The study will
      include pre and post lingual deaf children and children with multiple disabilities.
      Participants are recruited and examined in conjunction with their annual CI control at the
      hospital. It will be conducted a series of tests determining listening, speech and language
      development, non-verbal intelligence. Questionnaires are used to collect background
      information and quality of life experience. The questionnaires include self-report forms for
      different age groups, and a parent report form. The patient will be tested for the most
      common genetic causes of deafness. Additional data will be collected from patient records and
      from local health register at Oslo University Hospital.
