  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Clinically isolated demyelinating syndromes (CIS) can evolve into multiple sclerosis (MS).
      Cognitive deficiencies could occur at this early stage and concern mainly information
      processing speed (IPS) and their mechanisms are not fully understood. Diffusion Tensor
      Imaging (DTI) can help in the understanding of these mechanisms.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective cohort, observational, longitudinal, monocentric study. This study will
      include 60 patients with CIS followed for 1 year and 60 healthy subjects.
