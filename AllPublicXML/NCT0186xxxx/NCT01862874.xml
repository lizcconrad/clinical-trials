    <textblock>
      A study to evaluate the efficacy, immunogenicity, and tolerability of V501 (quadrivalent
      Human Papilloma Virus [HPV] [Type 6, 11, 16 and 18] L1 Virus-Like Particle vaccine,
      GARDASIL™) in healthy, 16- to 26-year old Japanese males. The hypotheses tested are: 1) V501
      reduces the combined incidence of HPV 6-, 11-, 16-, or 18-related persistent infection
      compared with placebo, and 2) V501 reduces the combined incidence of HPV 6-, 11-, 16-, or
      18-related persistent infection, condyloma acuminata, penile/perianal/perineal
      intraepithelial neoplasia, or penile, perianal, or perineal cancer compared with placebo.
