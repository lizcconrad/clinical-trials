  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Lifestyle changes often fail due to loss of motivation. Telemedicine and personal coaching
      have the potential to support lifestyle change and weight loss. Therefore, the aim of our
      randomized controlled trial was to examine the effect of telemedicine with and without
      coaching in comparison to a control group on weight loss in overweight participants.

      In an occupational health care setting overweight employees were randomized into a three arm
      12-week trial. Participants in the telemedical (TM) and telemedical coaching (TMC) group got
      a weighing machine and a step counter, with automatic transfer into a personalized online
      portal, which could be monitored from both, the participant and the study centre. The TMC
      group weekly got care calls from the study centre aiming to discuss measured data and to fix
      target agreements. The control group remained in routine care. Wilcoxon signed rank test was
      used to determine if differences (baseline vs. after 12 weeks) were significantly different
      from 0 and ANOVA test for determination of inter group differences.
