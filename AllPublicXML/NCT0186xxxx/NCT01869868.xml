  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine functional and structural changes in brain
      following treatment of severe depression with electroconvulsive therapy with correlation to
      clinical outcome. Our hypothesis is that there are state-dependent changes in functional
      connectivity within specific neurocircuits systems, as well as structural plasticity changes
      in hippocampus, when recovering from depression.

      The study is a prospective, within-subject, observational follow-up study in individuals with
      depression who receive electroconvulsive therapy (ECT)at a psychiatric clinic. We will use a
      consecutive sampling method and patient referred for ECT by their psychiatrist will be
      screened for inclusion and asked for participation. Both in - and outpatients can be
      included. At three occasions (before treatment, after four week and after three months)
      patients will be assessed with clinical ratings, cognitive tests, functional and structural
      magnetic resonance imaging and biomarkers for cell proliferation.
