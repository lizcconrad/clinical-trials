      Comparative, randomized, placebo-controlled, single-centre, single-blind clinical trial to
      assess the effectiveness of providing additional DHA omega-3 fatty acids supplements to
      increase the levels of pro-resolving and anti-inflammatory lipid mediators and decrease the
      biological markers of chronic inflammation in obese patients following a weight-loss
      programme.

      Will include obese patients (BMI between 30 and 35) who are following a standardized,
      multidisciplinary weight-loss programme (PronoKal® Method), which consists of a
      very-low-calorie diet based on protein packets and vegetables with a low glycemic index, into
      which natural foods are gradually reintroduced, accompanied by physical exercise and
      emotional support.

      Patients who are being treated with acetylsalicylic acid (ASA), non-steroidal
      anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS), corticoids or thiazolidinedione antidiabetic drugs
      (glitazones); and patients with immune disorders (rheumatoid arthritis, Lupus, etc.) and/or
      inflammatory disease (ulcerative colitis, Crohn's disease, etc.) who may alter the biological
      markers of inflammation,will be excluded.

      Treatment: In addition to the vitamin and oligoelement supplements which are part of the
      standard weight-loss programme, the patients will receive an additional 500 mg/day supplement
      of DHA omega-3 fatty acids in capsule form (study group) or a placebo capsule (control
      group).

      The follow up will be 6 months and patients will be monitored over the course of 6 control
      visits: baseline, 7 days, 15 days, 30 days, 60 days and 180 days.

      The main objective is to assess the effectiveness of providing additional DHA supplements to
      increase the levels of pro-resolving and anti-inflammatory lipid mediators and decrease the
      biological markers of chronic inflammation in obese patients following a weight-loss
      programme.
