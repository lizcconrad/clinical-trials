  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This will be a randomized, controlled trial involving kidney and kidney pancreas transplant
      patients. There will be 2 groups and patients will be randomized to one of the two; one will
      receive standard of care IPC or TED stockings to help with circulation, the other group will
      use the geko device which is a newer device with Health Canada approval. Clinical outcomes
      will be compared for those in each group and clinical differences between patients who
      receive routine medical therapy with IPC/TEDS versus the Geko device will also be evaluated.

    <description>Participants will be fitted with the device to ensure that it functions according to the manufacturer's instructions by a trained technician. This device will be changed every 24 hours. The device is worn on both legs and is worn for 24 hours a day. The device will first be put on the first day following the day of surgery and will then be changed the following day at the same time for a total of 7 days after surgery.</description>
