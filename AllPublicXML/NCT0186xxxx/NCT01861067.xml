  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      During the last 2 decades, several studies have tried to define the best surgical approach to
      hysterectomy for benign uterine diseases1. Accumulating evidence demonstrates that abdominal
      hysterectomy has a higher incidence of complications, a longer hospital stay and a slower
      convalescence in comparison with laparoscopic hysterectomy (LH). The main advantage of LHs is
      the absence of a wide abdominal scar, which results in fewer wound-related complications and
      in a significant decrease of postoperative pain.

      Technologic advances in endoscopic instrumentation and optics have allowed the development of
      an even less invasive procedure than conventional LH using multiple ports: laparoendoscopic
      single-site (LESS) surgery, also known as single-port access (SPA) laparoscopy3. In the LESS
      approaches, total laparoscopic hysterectomy (TLH) and laparoscopically-assisted vaginal
      hysterectomy (LAVH) are all feasible, with comparable conventional LH. However, it is yet to
      be determined which of two alternative and less invasive approaches (LESS-TLH and LESS-LAVH)
      should be preferred. In particular, none has focused on postoperative pain as the primary
      outcome of the study. The investigators have therefore designed the randomized trial to
      investigate specifically differences in postoperative pain after LESS-TLH and LESS-LAVH.
