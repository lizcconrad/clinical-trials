  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to examine two implementation strategies (external facilitation and
      educational outreach visit) when introducing nutritional guidelines in the elderly care
      setting and to evaluate the results of the implementation by clinical outcome measures of the
      nursing home residents.

      The hypothesis is that the residents affected by the external facilitation strategy will stay
      stable in the measured clinical outcomes, while the residents influenced by the educational
      outreach visit will deteriorate during the implementation process.
