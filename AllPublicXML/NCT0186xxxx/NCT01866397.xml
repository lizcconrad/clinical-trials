  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cidofovir is an acyclic nucleotide analog with broad-spectrum antiviral activity against
      herpesviruses. Its potency in inhibiting HCMV has been shown in conventional in vitro
      studies. It is approved for the systemic treatment of human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) retinitis
      in patients with AIDS and as a second line therapy for HCMV infections not responding to
      ganciclovir or foscarnet.

      In intensive care patients continuous venovenous haemofiltration (CVVH) is a well-established
      extracorporal renal replacement therapy with a high clearance rate.

      Pharmacokinetic studies of antifungal agents in critically ill patients treated with CVVH are
      rare. Elimination of any given drug by renal replacement therapy is determined by several
      major factors which are membrane specific, due to physico-chemical properties of the drug and
      characteristics of the renal replacement technique used.

      Study objective The trial is conducted to investigate the pharmacokinetics of cidofovir
      during CVVH in critically ill patients. It is suspected that Hemofiltration will influence
      cidofovir plasma levels.
