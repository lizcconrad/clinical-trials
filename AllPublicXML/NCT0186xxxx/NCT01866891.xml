  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is associated with high level of peripheral arterial disease
      (PAD). This could lead wounds, infections then amputations or deaths by impairment of the
      peripheral cutaneous perfusion. Medical therapies are presently unable to cure, but only slow
      down these disorders. Impact of exercise and lower extremity PAD rehabilitation is decreased
      by the significant inactivity of the chronic hemodialysis patients. Recently, many studies
      have shown several various favorable effects of the perdialytic physical activity. There is
      currently no data about effects of the perdialytic activity on the lower extremity perfusion.
      The aim of this clinical study is to show the impact of three months perdialytic cycling on
      the microcirculation, in chronic hemodialysis patients. Primary outcome will be the increase
      of cutaneous perfusion, assessed by measuring transcutaneous oxygen pressure (tcPO2) on about
      twenty patients.
