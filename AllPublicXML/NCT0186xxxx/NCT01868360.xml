  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The cornea is the clear front part of the eye. Corneal neovascularization, the excessive
      growth of blood vessels into the cornea, is a sight-threatening condition. Corneal
      neovascularization is also a well recognized risk factor for corneal graft failure. The
      current standard of care to prevent graft rejection includes use of topical steroids and
      medicines that suppress the immune system. These medicines do not address corneal
      neovascularization. The purpose of the study is to establish the safety and potential
      efficacy of subconjunctival injections of aflibercept (EYLEA® , marketed by Regeneron)
      injection in inducing regression of blood vessels growing into the cornea and promoting graft
      survival.

      This study is being conducted by Dr. Balamurali Ambati at the Moran Eye Center.

    <textblock>
      Corneal neovascularization is a sight threatening condition and is also a well recognized
      risk factor for corneal graft failure. Current standard of care to prevent graft rejection
      includes use of topical steroids and immunosuppressants. These do not address corneal
      neovascularization. The cornea is kept in its avascular state by a complex interaction of
      signal proteins and host receptors, with a vital role played by the soluble VEGF-receptor 1.
      In any condition of chronic corneal inflammation or hypoxia, the balance may tip in favour of
      pro-angiogenic factors, and neovascularization will ensue. Early and limited studies have
      examined the effect of subconjunctival or intracorneal administration of monoclonal
      antibodies to VEGF (bevacizumab, ranibizumab) in combating corneal neovascularization. Most
      report subtotal or temporary regression. The development of aflibercept (also known as VEGF
      Trap-Eye) offers new hope of more effectively combating the problem. In this study, research
      will be conducted to investigate and assess safety of subconjunctival aflibercept injection
      in patients with corneal neovascularization undergoing corneal transplantation.

      This is a phase 1, prospective, randomized, open label clinical trial that will enroll 10
      corneal transplant patients with corneal neovascularization in one or more quadrants crossing
      more than 0.5 mm over the limbus at the time of corneal transplantation.

    <description>Patients will receive 2mg (0.05mL) subconjunctival aflibercept injection in addition to standard of care treatment (steroids and cyclosporine). Patients will receive one injection four weeks (+/- 1 week) prior to transplantation. They will receive a second injection at the conclusion of corneal transplantation.
Patients may receive as-needed repeat injections (minimum of 30 days in between treatments) for recurrence of corneal neovascularization (defined as &gt;1.0 mm crossing onto the cornea, past the limbus, or extension of vessels beyond previously documented extent) during the follow-up period.</description>
