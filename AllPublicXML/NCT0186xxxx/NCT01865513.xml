  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      International multicenter observational study of a random-sample cohort of patients
      undergoing any in-hospital surgical procedure under general or regional anaesthesia during a
      continued 14-day period of recruitment.

      Primary hypothesis of this study is that the use of muscle relaxants, their reversal agents,
      or neuromuscular monitoring increases the incidence of postoperative pulmonary complications.
      The secondary hypothesis is that the use of muscle relaxants increases in-hospital mortality.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Overall postoperative mortality for patients undergoing non-cardiac surgery in Europe is 4%
      (EUSOS study). Postoperative pulmonary complications are a major factor, which increase
      patient morbidity and mortality (PERISCOPE study). This study is designed to evaluate the
      effects of management of neuromuscular blockade on postoperative pulmonary complications in a
      general unrestricted anaesthetized population across Europe. The investigation will be a
      continuation of the European EUSOS and PERISCOPE studies. Based on a well-recognised body of
      surrogate data, it is hypothesized that incorrect approaches to the use, monitoring, and
      reversal of muscle relaxants will increase the incidence of in-hospital postoperative
      pulmonary complications and prolong hospital stay.

      The investigators will not modify a participating centre's customary management of patients.
      Patients with postoperative pulmonary complications will be identified by postoperative
      assessment and consulting medical records for events that fulfil the definition of
      postoperative pulmonary complications.

    <description>Post-operative pulmonary Complications (POPC) is a composite of in-hospital fatal or non-fatal postoperative pulmonary events. A patient is assumed to have POPC if at least one of the following complications is documented:
POPC is defined as a composite of in-hospital fatal or non-fatal postoperative pulmonary or respiratory events:
Respiratory failure Suspected pulmonary infection, i.e. Suspected pulmonary infiltrates Atelectasis Aspiration pneumonitis Bronchospasm Pulmonary Oedema</description>
