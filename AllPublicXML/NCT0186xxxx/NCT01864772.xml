      The aim of the trial is to evaluate the clinical benefit (efficacy, safety, preservation of
      autonomy) of cetuximab-carboplatin-5FU combination as first line treatment of recurrent or
      metastatic head and neck squamous cell carcinoma in patients over 70 years without frailty
      (after geriatric assessment).

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Age greater than or equal to 70 years

          -  patient enrolled in ELAN-ONVOCAL study and evaluated as fit (harmonious aging) by
             GERICO screening method for geriatric frailty

          -  life expectancy superior to 12 weeks

          -  creatinin clearance &gt; ou equal to 50ml/mn calculated using Modification of Diet in
             Renal Disease (MDRD) formula

          -  hematologic function : absolute neutrophil count &gt; 1.5 x 10^9/l, platelets &gt; 100 x
             10^9/l, hemoglobin &gt; 9,5 g/dl

          -  liver function : total bilirubin inferior to 1,25 x Upper limit of normal (ULN),

             extension (evidently authorized for lymph nodes) and unsuitable for radiotherapy for
             primitive tumor (or already performed) due to metastatic dissemination and the absence
             of indication for re-irradiation of primitive tumor.

          -  Presence of at least one measurable lesion (defined by RECIST criteria) by CT scan or
             IRM

             treatment for locally advanced cancer completed more than 6 months prior to study
             enrollment

          -  Patients considered as &quot;unfit &quot; (fragile) by GERICO screening method for geriatric
             frailty

          -  Irradiation within 4 weeks prior to study enrollment.

          -  Nasopharyngeal, rhinopharyngeal or maxillary sinus carcinoma.

          -  Presence of infection (infection requiring intravenous antibiotics), including
             tuberculosis and HIV infection (human immunodeficiency virus).

          -  Concomitant treatment with other antitumor immunotherapy or hormonal therapy.

          -  Other antitumor concomitant therapies.

          -  Prior treatment with EGFR-targeted therapy (epidermal growth factor receptor).

          -  Treatment with one of study drugs within 30 days prior to study enrollment.

          -  Presence of documented symptomatic brain or leptomeningeal metastases

          -  Clinically significant coronaropathy or antecedent myocardial infarction within 12

          -  Medically uncontrolled arterial hypertension

          -  Other prior or concomitant cancer, with exception for carcinoma in situ of the uterine
             cervix, or for cutaneous basal cell carcinoma within 5 years prior to study
             enrollment.

          -  Presence of medical or physiological factors susceptible to modify patient compliance
             with study protocol and follow-up or Informed Consent Form signing.

          -  Known allergy or hypersensibility to monoclonal antibodies (bevacizumab, cetuximab),
             or to other chemotherapies of the study or to their excipients
