  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a single-site trial assessing the specificity of CL Detect™ Rapid Test versus
      the gold standard for Leishmania diagnosis in the US which is microscopic identification of
      Leishmania amastigotes in a stained lesion sample. Subjects will be patients who present for
      dermatology consultation with a primarily ulcerated lesion. After informed consent is
      obtained and the subject is screened for eligibility, 2 diagnostic samples will be collected
      from the subject's lesion in the following order: 1) one sample will be obtained with a
      dental broach for use with the CL Detect™ Rapid Test and 2) a second sample will be obtained
      by scraping for use in the microscopic identification of amastigotes. Samples will be
      analyzed by microscopy and CL Detect™ Rapid Test. The CL Detect™ Rapid Test will be performed
      by different operators who are clinical staff members. These staff members, blinded to each
      other's results, will evaluate the samples from each method independently. Each of the 150
      study subjects will be followed administratively to the point where a diagnosis is
      established (if possible) for their tested lesion, even if that diagnosis is not cutaneous
      leishmaniasis (CL). If a specific diagnosis cannot be determined for a non-CL lesion, the
      investigator will assign a &quot;likely etiology&quot; (eg, infectious, oncological, immunological,
      vascular, or &quot;undetermined/other&quot; origin). Based on the diagnosis determined for each lesion,
      subjects will be referred for appropriate treatment.
