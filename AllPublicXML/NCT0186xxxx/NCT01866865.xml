  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:

      - Women who have a BRCA1/2 gene mutation have a very high risk of developing breast or
      ovarian cancer. They are also at increased risk of other developing other cancers. Male
      carriers are at increased risk for breast, prostate and other cancers. Testing for this
      mutation and living with this increased risk can be a source of stress for both people with
      the mutation and their partners. Researchers want to look at how well people adapt to living
      with this type of cancer risk over time.

      Objectives:

      - To see how women with the BRCA1/2 gene mutation and their partners adapt to the stress of
      long-term cancer risk.

      Eligibility:

      - Women at least 18 years of age who have a BRCA1/2 mutation, and their male or female
      partners.

      Design:

        -  This study involves a one-time self-administered questionnaire. Participants will be
           recruited from local and national hereditary cancer support groups and cancer centers.

        -  There are two versions of the survey. One is for the woman with the BRCA1/2 gene
           mutation. The other is for her partner.

        -  The survey will ask about risk perception, cancer worry, risk-related stress, and coping
           and adaptation methods.

        -  Treatment will not be provided as part of this study.

      The proposed study aims to describe adaptation and dyadic adjustment in unaffected BRCA1/2
      carriers and their partners. It is not fully understood how women and their partners adapt to
      highrisk status over time, nor how different aspects of living at risk relate to this
      process. Neither psychological adaptation nor dyadic adjustment has been systematically
      measured in this population. This study is informed by Lazarus &amp; Folkman s Transactional
      Model of Stress and Coping and modifications made to this model for use in studying dyadic
      relationships. A crosssectional research design will quantitatively explore the relationships
      between the appraisals and timing of risk-related stressors, dyadic coping, and the outcomes
      of adaptation and dyadic adjustment. Participants will be recruited from hereditary breast
      and ovarian cancer (HBOC) support groups, website postings, listservs, and clinic patient
      lists. They will have the option of completing either a paper or online version of the
      survey.

        -  INCLUSION AND EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

        Participants will be women aged 18 or older who have a BRCA1/2 mutation and their (male or
        female) partners. Carriers must have no personal history of cancer, but partners will not
        be excluded based on cancer history. Participants will be asked to disclose their mutation
        status (BRCA1 or BRCA2), but no screening evaluation will be required. If only one member
        of a couple completes the survey, their data will be included in the individual level
        analysis, but excluded from the dyadic level analysis.
