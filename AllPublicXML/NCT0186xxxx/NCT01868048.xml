    <description>At Visit 2 (i.e. prior to commencing any treatment) subjects were asked to write a brief description of their spasticity caused by multiple sclerosis and how it affected them emotionally, physically and their ability to function with day to day activities. If subjects were unable to write due to disability then the investigator staff could assist as necessary. Prior to answering the Subject global impression of change, subjects were given the description of their spasticity to aid their memory regarding their symptoms at the start of the study. They were then be asked to complete the global impression of change by answering the following question to be rated on a seven-point scale, &quot;Please assess the change in your spasticity due to multiple sclerosis since immediately before receiving the first course of study treatment (Visit 2) using the scale below&quot; with this anchors: Very much worse, Much worse, Minimally worse, No change, Minimally better, Much better, Very much better.</description>

          -  The subject is at least 18 years of age or older.

          -  Diagnosed with any disease sub-type of multiple sclerosis of at least six months
             duration.

          -  Spasticity due to multiple sclerosis of at least six months duration, which is not
             wholly relieved with current anti-spasticity therapy, and which is expected to remain
             stable for the duration of the study.

          -  Subject must be receiving at least one of the following anti-spasticity therapies to
             be eligible: Baclofen, Tizanidine, Clonazepam, Diazepam, Dantrolene.

          -  Subject is willing to maintain anti-spasticity medication at a stable dose for the
             duration of the study and should be stable for 30 days prior to screening.

          -  If the subject is currently taking disease-modifying medication, this must be at a
             stable dose for at least three months prior to the screening visit; the dose must also
             remain stable for the duration of the study.

          -  Has previously used Nabiximols or Sativex.

          -  The subject is currently using or has used cannabis or cannabinoid based medications

          -  Any other significant disease or disorder which, in the opinion of the investigator or
             sponsor, may either put the subject at risk because of participation in the study, or
