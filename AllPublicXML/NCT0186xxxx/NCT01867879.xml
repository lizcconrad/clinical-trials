      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the cardiac safety of TAS-102 in patients with
      advanced solid tumors.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1, nonrandomized study to evaluate the cardiac safety of TAS-102 in patients
      with advanced solid tumors. The study is conducted in 2 phases: the cardiac safety evaluation
      phase to investigate cardiac repolarization and the cardiac safety profile (Cycle 1) and the
      extension phase to assess the safety profile and antitumor activity (subsequent cycles).
