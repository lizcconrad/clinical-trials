  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Older adults are at increased risk of high blood pressure and cognitive decline. High blood
      pressure itself also increases risk of cognitive decline. A particular type of blood pressure
      lowering drug (a calcium channel blocker(CCB)) may lower risk of dementia in younger adults
      but there is no clear evidence of it's impact in those &gt;=80. It is important that we know
      whether CCB use impacts on cognitive function in this age group. This study will compare
      change in cognitive function in those taking CCBs to those not taking CCBs.

      This study is an observational cohort study examining cognitive change in those participants
      taking antihypertensives and aged 80 and over and comparing cognitive change in those taking
      calcium channel blockers with those taking other types of antihypertensive medication.
