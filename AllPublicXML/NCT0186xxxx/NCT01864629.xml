  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to examine the effectiveness of focused family planning
      counseling on the uptake and continuation of highly effective contraceptive methods (defined
      as the intrauterine device, implant, and both male and female sterilization methods including
      vasectomy, tubal ligation and Essure) during the postpartum period in women who have recently
      experienced a preterm delivery.

      The investigators hypothesize that women with a recent preterm birth (PTB) will be more
      likely to initiate and continue using a highly effective method of contraception when
      provided with focused family planning counseling.
