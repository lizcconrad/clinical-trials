      The primary objective is to determine the pharmacodynamic effect of ticagrelor dosing (180mg
      LD/ 90mg BID) at 2, 4 hours and 14 days in stable Coronary artery disease (CAD) patients who
      exhibit high-on prasugrel platelet reactivity defined as Vasodilator Stimulated
      Phosphoprotein-Phosphorylation (VASP-P) &gt;50%.
