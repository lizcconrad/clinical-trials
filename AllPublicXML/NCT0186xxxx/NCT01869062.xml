  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main objective of the SONR-ECHO trial is to demonstrate that optimization of CRT
      parameters by SonR technology is able to increase the rate of CRT-D responders, based on
      significant LV reverse remodeling, as compared to Standard of Care settings.

      This study will also evaluate the effectiveness of CRT-D SonR system as compared to Standard
      of care (SoC) programming methods in providing appropriate LV filling, as expected from the
      Ritter method.
