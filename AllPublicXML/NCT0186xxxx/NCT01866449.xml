    <textblock>
      The proposed study is an open-label, single-arm, Phase- II trial to assess the efficacy of
      cabazitaxel in GBM WHO grade IV patients with a progression during or within 6 months after
      last temozolomide treatment (Figure 1).

      Cabazitaxel will be given at a dose of 25mg/m² as 1h infusion every 3 weeks with standard
      concomitant medication (as outlined below):

        -  On Day 1 of each cycle, patients will receive cabazitaxel at a dose of 25mg/m²,
           administered by i.v. route in 1 hour.

        -  Cycle length for cabazitaxel is 3 weeks (21 days).

        -  New cycles of therapy may not begin until Absolute Neutrophil Count (ANC) ≥1500/mm3,
           platelet count ≥75 000/mm3, and non-hematological toxicities (except alopecia) have
           recovered to baseline.

        -  A maximum of 2 weeks (14 days) delay is allowed between 2 treatment cycles.

        -  Patients should come off treatment if treatment delay is more than 2 weeks.

      At least 30 minutes prior to each administration of cabazitaxel, patients will receive i.v.
      premedication including:

        -  An antihistamine (dexchlorpheniramine 5mg, diphenhydramine 25mg, or equivalent). In case
           of i.v. antihistamine other than promethazine is not being available, local practice
           should be followed.

        -  Corticosteroid (dexamethasone 8mg or equivalent)

        -  H2 antagonist (ranitidine or equivalent).

        -  Antiemetic prophylaxis is recommended and can be given orally or intravenously if
           necessary.

        -  Primary prophylaxis with Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor (G-CSF) should be given
           on day 4 of each treatment cycle as per ASCO and ESMO guidelines.
