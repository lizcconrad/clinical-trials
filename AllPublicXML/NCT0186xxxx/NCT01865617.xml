      This phase I/II trial studies the side effects and best dose of laboratory treated T cells to
      see how well they work in treating patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia, non-Hodgkin
      lymphoma, or acute lymphoblastic leukemia that have come back or have not responded to
      treatment. T cells that are treated in the laboratory before being given back to the patient
      may make the body build an immune response to kill cancer cells.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the feasibility and safety of adoptive T cell therapy using ex vivo expanded
      autologous CD8 positive (+) and CD4+ CD19 chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T cells for
      patients with advanced CD19+ B cell malignancies.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the duration of in vivo persistence of adoptively transferred T cells, and
      the phenotype of persisting T cells.

      II. To determine if adoptively transferred T cells traffic to the bone marrow and function in
      vivo.

      III. To determine if the adoptive transfer of CD19 CAR-T cells results in depletion of CD19+
      B cells in vivo as a surrogate for functional activity.

      IV. To determine if the adoptive transfer of CD19 CAR-T cells has antitumor activity in
      patients with measurable tumor burden prior to T cell transfer.

      V. To determine if the adoptive transfer of CD19 CAR-T cells is associated with tumor lysis
      syndrome.

      OUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose-escalation study of autologous CD19 CAR T-cells followed by
      a phase II study.

      Patients receive anti-CD19-CAR lentiviral vector-transduced autologous T cells intravenously
      (IV) over 20-30 minutes on day 0. Treatment may be repeated in no less than 21 days with or
      without additional lymphodepleting chemotherapy if there is persistent disease in the absence
      of unacceptable toxicity.

      DOSE DENSE EXPANSION COHORT: An additional cohort will receive a second anti-CD19-CAR
      lentiviral vector-transduced autologous T cell infusion without additional lymphodepleting
      chemotherapy 10-21 days after the first infusion if adequate CD19 CAR-T cells can be produced
      and appropriate criteria are met.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for at least 15 years.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        INCLUSIONS FOR SCREENING AND LEUKAPHERESIS

          -  Patients with CD19 expressing acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), chronic lymphocytic
             leukemia (CLL) or non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL)

          -  Ability to understand and provide informed consent

          -  Not human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infected

        INCLUSIONS FOR CAR-T CELL THERAPY

          -  Patients with:

               -  CLL who are beyond first remission and who have failed combination
                  chemoimmunotherapy with regimens containing a purine analogue and anti-CD20
                  antibody or who were not eligible for such therapy; patients with CLL for whom
                  ibrutinib is now standard first line therapy, must have progressed on ibrutinib;
                  patients with fludarabine refractory disease are eligible; patients may be
                  treated following allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT); for the
                  concurrent ibrutinib cohort, patients must agree to continue on or be restarted
                  on ibrutinib and must not have had prior intolerance to ibrutinib that would
                  prevent this; patients managed with prior dose reductions for toxicity will
                  continue at the reduced dose for the remainder of this study

               -  Indolent NHL or mantle cell NHL who are beyond first remission and previously
                  treated with chemoimmunotherapy or who were not eligible for such therapy;
                  patients who have relapsed following autologous or allogeneic HCT are eligible

               -  Aggressive NHL such as diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), who have relapsed
                  or have residual disease following treatment with curative intent; patients
                  should have relapsed following, or not be eligible for high-dose therapy and
                  autologous HCT; patients with chemotherapy refractory disease or marrow
                  involvement or comorbidities precluding successful autologous HCT are eligible;
                  patients may be treated following allogeneic HCT

               -  Patients with CD19 expressing, relapsed or refractory ALL

               -  Patients with one of the above diagnoses whose disease state does not qualify but
                  who have prognostic indicators that suggest a high risk of progression of disease
                  may be screened and undergo leukapheresis; enrollment for T cell therapy would
                  require meeting the full disease state eligibility

          -  Confirmation of diagnosis

          -  Evidence of CD19 expression by immunohistochemistry or flow cytometry on any prior or
             current tumor specimen or high likelihood of CD19 expression based on disease
