  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase I/II, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, safety, immunogenicity
      and dose-range finding study in HIV-uninfected, HIV-unexposed, BCG-primed infants. The study
      vaccine AERAS-404 or placebo will be administered without concomitant EPI vaccines (Cohorts 1
      to 5, N = 159 subjects) and with concomitant EPI vaccines (Cohort 6, N = 70 subjects). Study
      vaccine or placebo will be administered as a single dose (injection) at Study Day 0 ( ≥168 to
      ≤ 196 days of age, Cohorts 1 and 2), a 2-dose schedule at Study Day 0 (≥ 168 to ≤ 189 days of
      age) and Study Day 28 (Cohorts 3A and 3B) or a 3-dose schedule at Study Day 0 (≥ 84 to ≤ 98
      days of age), Study Day 42 and Study Day 98 (Cohorts 4 and 5). Subjects in Cohort 6 will
      receive the study vaccine or placebo at Study Day 0 (≥ 64 to ≤ 83 days of age), Study Day 28
      (≥ 91 to ≤ 105 days of age), and Study Day 210 (≥ 273 to ≤ 287 days of age). A cohort will
      enroll once safety in the previous cohort has been established. AERAS-404 is an
      investigational vaccine manufactured by Sanofi Pasteur (SP) and Statens Serum Institute
      (SSI).

    <measure>Investigate the safety of AERAS-404 in HIV-uninfected, HIV-unexposed, BCG-primed infants.</measure>
    <time_frame>Subjects will be followed for up to 1 year and 4 months.</time_frame>
    <description>Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events (SAE) will be collected on subjects throughout their participation in the study. Solicited adverse events are captured 28 days post each vaccination. Evaluation of the safety profile of AERAS-404 will be performed using data from all subjects who received at least one dose and has 7 days of safety data, and will be summarized by cohort and treatment group. The number (percentage) of subjects with any adverse event (including solicited, unsolicited, and serious adverse events) will be summarized by Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) system organ class and Preferred Term. Additional summaries will present the number (percentage) of subjects with any adverse events by severity and by relationship to study vaccine; parameters evaluable by the Aeras 404 Pediatric Toxicity Table provided in the protocol, will be summarized by severity corresponding to Toxicity Grade, as appropriate.</description>

    <description>The number and percentage of subjects who are enrolled into the three-dose regimen (Cohorts 4-6) with solicited and unsolicited AEs (including serious adverse events [SAEs], local and systemic reactions, and clinical laboratory values or vital sign values recorded as newly abnormal following study vaccination) recorded post-vaccination will be summarized to address the secondary safety objective of the study. Subjects in Cohorts 4 and 5 will be followed for : 1 year and 3 months, Cohort 6: 1 year 4 months and Solicited adverse events are captured 28 days post each vaccination.</description>
