  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this randomized controlled study is to compare the postoperative analgesic
      effect of a continuous wound infusion of local anesthetics and a sole transverse abdominal
      plan (TAP) regional block in the surgery of Abdominoplasty Combined With Flank Liposuction.
      Local anesthetics products used are ropivacaine combined with clonidine. Similar amount of
      local anesthetics and clonidine are used.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In a first group, patients receive, after induction of anaesthesia and before surgery, a TAP
      block (transverse abdominal plan block) with 3mg/kg Ropivacaine 0.5% (maximum 200 mg) and 150
      microg Clonidine.

      In a second group, before skin closure, a multiholes catheter was inserted beyond the skin.
      20 mg Ropivacaine 0.2% added with 150 microg Clonidine was injected as bolus dose through
      this catheter followed by a continuous infusion of Ropivacaine 0.2% 10ml per hour during the
      following 9 hours (total dose of 200 mgr).
