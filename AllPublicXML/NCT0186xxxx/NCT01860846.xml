    <textblock>
      This multicenter, prospective, post marketing observational study (PMOS) was designed to
      demonstrate long-term effects of anti-Tumor Necrosis Factor therapies on Work Productivity
      and Impairment scales in participants with moderate to severe Crohn's Disease (CD) under
      routine conditions. Secondary objectives of this study were long-term improvement of Quality
      of Life (QoL), evaluation of improvement of extraintestinal symptoms and comorbidities, and
      evaluation of safety.

    <textblock>
      Male or female participants between 18 - 65 years of age with moderate to severe CD for whom
      the treating physician had recently initiated an anti-TNF treatment were included in this
      study. Anti-TNF treatments were administered according to the treating physician's decision
      and applicable product label in Turkey. No interventions were made to the treatment and the
      participant discontinuance or to the follow-up decisions of the treating physician. Enrolled
      participants were observed for one year.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Work Productivity and Activity Index (WPAI): Absenteeism</measure>
    <time_frame>At baseline and 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Work Productivity and Activity Impairment: General Health (WPAI:GH) questionnaire was used to assess impairments in both paid work and unpaid work due to symptoms of Crohn's Disease. The self-administered questionnaire consisted of 6 questions. Question 2 asked participants to indicate the number of hours missed due to health problems in the past 7 days. Question 4 asked participants to indicate the number of hours that they worked in the past 7 days. Absenteeism (work time missed) was defined as the percentage of time absent from work due to health problems in the past week and was calculated by the formula Q2/(Q2 + Q4) × 100%. WPAI outcomes are expressed as impairment percentages, with higher numbers indicating greater impairment and less productivity.</description>

    <measure>Work Productivity and Activity Index (WPAI): Presenteeism</measure>
    <time_frame>At baseline and 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Work Productivity and Activity Impairment: General Health (WPAI:GH) questionnaire was used to assess impairments in both paid work and unpaid work due to symptoms of Crohn's Disease. The self-administered questionnaire consisted of 6 questions. Question 5 asked participants the degree to which their health affected productivity while working in the past 7 days, on a scale ranging from 0 to 10, with 0 indicating that health problems had no effect on their work and 10 indicating that health problems completely prevented the participant from working. Presenteeism (impairment at work) was calculated by the formula (Q5/10) × 100%. WPAI outcomes are expressed as impairment percentages, with higher numbers indicating greater impairment and less productivity.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Total Work Productivity Impairment (TWPI)</measure>
    <time_frame>At baseline and 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Work Productivity and Activity Impairment: General Health (WPAI:GH) self-administered questionnaire was used to assess impairments in work due to symptoms of Crohn's Disease. Q2 asked participants the number of hours missed due to health problems in the past 7 days. Q4 asked participants the number of hours that they worked in the past 7 days. Q5 asked participants the degree to which their health affected productivity while working in the past 7 days, on a scale ranging from 0 (health problems had no effect) to 10 (health problems completely prevented them from working). Total work productivity impairment (TWPI) is the combined absenteeism and presenteeism for employed participants, the percentage of overall work productivity lost due to health problems. TWPI was calculated using the formula Q2/(Q2+Q4)+[(1-(Q2/(Q2+Q4)))×(Q5/10)] × 100%. WPAI outcomes are expressed as impairment percentages, with higher numbers indicating greater impairment and less productivity.</description>

    <measure>Total Activity Impairment (TAI)</measure>
    <time_frame>At baseline and 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Work Productivity and Activity Impairment: General Health (WPAI:GH) questionnaire was used to assess impairments in both paid work and unpaid work due to symptoms of Crohn's Disease. The self-administered questionnaire consisted of 6 questions. Question 6 asked participants to indicate the degree to which their health affected their regular activities in the past 7 days. Total activity impairment is the percent impairment of non-work related activities due to health problems and was calculated with the formula (Q6/10) × 100%. WPAI outcomes are expressed as impairment percentages, with higher numbers indicating greater impairment and less productivity.</description>

    <measure>Change in Short Form 36 (SF-36) Health Survey Scores</measure>
    <time_frame>At baseline and 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Short Form 36 (SF-36) Health Survey was used to determine participants' overall quality of life by assessing 1) limitations in physical functioning due to health problems; 2) limitations in usual role because of physical health problems; 3) bodily pain; 4) general health perceptions; 5) vitality; 6) limitations in social functioning because of physical or emotional problems; 7) limitations in usual role due to emotional problems; and 8) general mental health. Scores on each item were summed and averaged (range = 0 &quot;worst&quot; to 100 &quot;best&quot;). Increases from baseline indicate improvement.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Inflammatory Bowel Disease Questionnaire (IBDQ) Scores</measure>
    <time_frame>At baseline and 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Inflammatory Bowel Disease Questionnaire (IBDQ) is a 32-item self-administered questionnaire to measure health-related quality of life in adults with Crohn's Disease. The 32 items are grouped into subscales: bowel-related symptoms (10 items), systemic symptoms (5 items), social function (5 items), and emotional function (12 items). Responses to each item within each subscale range from 1 (significant impairment) to 7 (no impairment), and mean scores ranging from 1 to 7 are calculated for each subscale. Higher scores indicate a better quality of life.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Extra-intestinal Symptoms</measure>
    <time_frame>At baseline and 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Extra-intestinal manifestations of Crohn's Disease (skeletal system [bones and muscle], dermatological [skin], hepatobiliary system [liver, gall bladder, and bile ducts], ocular [eyes] and oral [mouth]) were documented by the study investigators at each visit.</description>

        <title>Work Productivity and Activity Index (WPAI): Absenteeism</title>
        <description>The Work Productivity and Activity Impairment: General Health (WPAI:GH) questionnaire was used to assess impairments in both paid work and unpaid work due to symptoms of Crohn’s Disease. The self-administered questionnaire consisted of 6 questions. Question 2 asked participants to indicate the number of hours missed due to health problems in the past 7 days. Question 4 asked participants to indicate the number of hours that they worked in the past 7 days. Absenteeism (work time missed) was defined as the percentage of time absent from work due to health problems in the past week and was calculated by the formula Q2/(Q2 + Q4) × 100%. WPAI outcomes are expressed as impairment percentages, with higher numbers indicating greater impairment and less productivity.</description>

The self-administered questionnaire consisted of 6 questions. Question 5 asked participants the degree to which their health affected productivity while working in the past 7 days, on a scale ranging from 0 to 10, with 0 indicating that health problems had no effect on their work and 10 indicating that health problems completely prevented the participant from working. Presenteeism (impairment at work) was calculated by the formula (Q5/10) × 100%. WPAI outcomes are expressed as impairment percentages, with higher numbers indicating greater impairment and less productivity.</description>

Q2 asked participants the number of hours missed due to health problems in the past 7 days. Q4 asked participants the number of hours that they worked in the past 7 days. Q5 asked participants the degree to which their health affected productivity while working in the past 7 days, on a scale ranging from 0 (health problems had no effect) to 10 (health problems completely prevented them from working). Total work productivity impairment (TWPI) is the combined absenteeism and presenteeism for employed participants, the percentage of overall work productivity lost due to health problems. TWPI was calculated using the formula Q2/(Q2+Q4)+[(1-(Q2/(Q2+Q4)))×(Q5/10)] × 100%. WPAI outcomes are expressed as impairment percentages, with higher numbers indicating greater impairment and less productivity.</description>

        <description>The Short Form 36 (SF-36) Health Survey was used to determine participants' overall quality of life by assessing 1) limitations in physical functioning due to health problems; 2) limitations in usual role because of physical health problems; 3) bodily pain; 4) general health perceptions; 5) vitality; 6) limitations in social functioning because of physical or emotional problems; 7) limitations in usual role due to emotional problems; and 8) general mental health. Scores on each item were summed and averaged (range = 0 &quot;worst&quot; to 100 &quot;best&quot;). Increases from baseline indicate improvement.</description>

        <title>Change in Inflammatory Bowel Disease Questionnaire (IBDQ) Scores</title>
        <description>The Inflammatory Bowel Disease Questionnaire (IBDQ) is a 32-item self-administered questionnaire to measure health-related quality of life in adults with Crohn’s Disease. The 32 items are grouped into subscales: bowel-related symptoms (10 items), systemic symptoms (5 items), social function (5 items), and emotional function (12 items). Responses to each item within each subscale range from 1 (significant impairment) to 7 (no impairment), and mean scores ranging from 1 to 7 are calculated for each subscale. Higher scores indicate a better quality of life.</description>
