  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This cross-sectional, non-interventional, retrospective chart review will compare the
      efficacy and safety of biologic monotherapy and biologic and methotrexate combination therapy
      in patients with rheumatoid arthritis who have had an inadequate response to prior treatment
      with disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs including methotrexate. Data will be collected
      from patients who have been on first-line biologic treatment for at least 6 months.

    <description>The DAS28 score is a measure of the participant's disease activity calculated using the tender joint count (TJC) [28 joints], swollen joint count (SJC) [28 joints], participant's global assessment of disease activity [visual analog scale: 0=no disease activity to 100=maximum disease activity] and the erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) for a total possible score of 0 to approximately 10. DAS28 equals (=) (0.56 multiplied by [*] the square root [√] of TJC) plus (+) (0.28 * √ of SJC) + (0.70 * the natural logarithm [ln] ESR in millimeters per hour [mm/h]) + (0.014 * participant's global assessment of disease activity).

        <description>The DAS28 score is a measure of the participant's disease activity calculated using the tender joint count (TJC) [28 joints], swollen joint count (SJC) [28 joints], participant's global assessment of disease activity [visual analog scale: 0=no disease activity to 100=maximum disease activity] and the erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) for a total possible score of 0 to approximately 10. DAS28 equals (=) (0.56 multiplied by [*] the square root [√] of TJC) plus (+) (0.28 * √ of SJC) + (0.70 * the natural logarithm [ln] ESR in millimeters per hour [mm/h]) + (0.014 * participant's global assessment of disease activity).

          <description>The DAS28 score is a measure of the participant's disease activity calculated using the tender joint count (TJC) [28 joints], swollen joint count (SJC) [28 joints], participant's global assessment of disease activity [visual analog scale: 0=no disease activity to 100=maximum disease activity] and the erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) for a total possible score of 0 to approximately 10. DAS28 equals (=) (0.56 multiplied by [*] the square root [√] of TJC) plus (+) (0.28 * √ of SJC) + (0.70 * the natural logarithm [ln] ESR in millimeters per hour [mm/h]) + (0.014 * participant's global assessment of disease activity).

          <description>The DAS28 score is a measure of the participant's disease activity calculated using the TJC [28 joints], SJC [28 joints], participant's global assessment of disease activity [visual analog scale: 0=no disease activity to 100=maximum disease activity] and either ESR or C Reactive Protein (CRP) for a total possible score of 0 to approximately 10. Scores below 2.6 indicate best disease control and scores above 5.1 indicate worse disease control. DAS28 Remission is defined as a DAS28 score &lt;2.6.</description>
