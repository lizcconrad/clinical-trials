  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Venous thromboembolism (VTE), which includes deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary
      embolism (PE, is one of the common and preventable complications of hospital stay. VTE
      prophylaxis through the use of evidence-based anticoagulant medication options or mechanical
      prophylaxis have been shown to reduce this risk and improve patient safety. Despite an
      abundance of evidence, use of VTE prophylaxis remains low.

      This study assesses the effectiveness of quality improvement strategies (use of pre-printed
      orders, audit and feedback, involvement of the pharmacist as project need and as a reminder
      to the physician, and education of staff) on use of appropriate VTE prophylaxis. The study
      aims to measure if the use of these strategies improves the use of VTE prophylaxis and
      therefore, improves patient safety and patient care by reducing the risk of developing DVT or
      PE.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study includes 8 Toronto area hospitals consisting of 7 community hospital and one
      academic health sciences centre.

      Three patient groups at each site are included in the study: patients admitted for: Acute
      Medical Illness (AMI), Major General Surgery (MGS) and Hip Fracture Surgery (HFS). Patients
      had to be at least 18 years old and be considered at risk for VTE according to the American
      College of Chest Physicians (CHEST) guidelines.

      The study design is a cluster randomized trial where each patient group at each site is a
      cluster.

      A baseline chart audit of approximately 50 patients in each group at each site was conducted
      to determine an intraclass coefficient and proportion of adherence.

      The main outcome measure was the rate of prescribing appropriate prophylaxis in patients at
      risk. This was calculated as the number of at risk patients receiving appropriate prophylaxis
      / the number of at risk patients for whom prophylaxis is indicated.

      Based on the baseline results, it was estimated that a sample size of 432 would be needed for
      the intervention phases. A sample of 720 patients (15 in each cluster at each site) was
      included.

      The study is broken down into three phases: baseline, phase 1 and phase 2. At baseline, all
      groups received usual care. At phase 1, one cluster at each site was randomized to
      intervention while the other two served as control. In phase 2, 2 groups received
      intervention while one continued to serve as control. Each of the phases, phase 1 and 2 had
      360 unique patients. Patients in baseline were not included in phase 1 or 2 and patients in
      phase 1 were not included in phase 2.

      The main outcome measure was prescribing of appropriate VTE prophylaxis. A chart audit was
      used to collect data at baseline, end of phase 1 and end of phase 2.

      Each phase is approximately 1 year in length. Analysis involves descriptive statistics using
      counts and proportions to capture rates of appropriate VTE prophylaxis and rates of
      non-adherence. A logistic regression model will be used to compare rates of appropriate VTE
      prophylaxis over time within groups adjusted for clustering.

    <description>Rates of appropriate VTE prophylaxis were determined as the number of patients who received VTE prophylaxis as a proportion of the number of patient at risk.
Rates reported are for the active phases (phase 1 and phase 2) and compare intervention to control.
Appropriate VTE prophylaxis was defined as:
in &quot;Hip Fracture Surgery&quot; - evidence-based VTE prophylaxis ordered within 24 of admission, restarted within 24 hours after surgery and continued for at least 10 days post-discharge in &quot;Major General Surgery&quot; - evidence-based VTE prophylaxis ordered within 24 hours post-surgery and continued for the duration of hospital stay in &quot;Acute Medical Illness&quot; - evidence-based VTE prophylaxis ordered within 24 hours of admission and continued for the duration of hospital stay.
Evidence-based VTE prophylaxis was determined to be according to the American College of Chest Physicians (ACCP) guidelines. The 9th version was the most current version at the time of the study.</description>

        <title>Percentage of Patients Prescribed Appropriate VTE Prophylaxis</title>
        <description>Rates of appropriate VTE prophylaxis were determined as the number of patients who received VTE prophylaxis as a proportion of the number of patient at risk.
Rates reported are for the active phases (phase 1 and phase 2) and compare intervention to control.
Appropriate VTE prophylaxis was defined as:
in &quot;Hip Fracture Surgery&quot; - evidence-based VTE prophylaxis ordered within 24 of admission, restarted within 24 hours after surgery and continued for at least 10 days post-discharge in &quot;Major General Surgery&quot; - evidence-based VTE prophylaxis ordered within 24 hours post-surgery and continued for the duration of hospital stay in &quot;Acute Medical Illness&quot; - evidence-based VTE prophylaxis ordered within 24 hours of admission and continued for the duration of hospital stay.
Evidence-based VTE prophylaxis was determined to be according to the American College of Chest Physicians (ACCP) guidelines. The 9th version was the most current version at the time of the study.</description>
