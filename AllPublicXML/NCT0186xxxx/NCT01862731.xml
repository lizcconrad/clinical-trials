      Background:

      - Researchers are interested in how the muscles affect the movement of the knee cap. These
      muscles may be related to different kinds of knee pain that are not caused by an injury or a
      disease. Imaging studies such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can be used to look at
      these muscles. To study these muscles and how they move, researchers will use MRI to look at
      healthy individuals and individuals with knee cap pain.

      Objectives:

      - To study how changes to the muscles around the knee can influence knee pain.

      Eligibility:

        -  Individuals between 18 to 55 years of age who have knee cap pain that cannot be
           explained by a specific injury or disease.

        -  Healthy volunteers between 18 and 55 years of age.

      Design:

        -  Participants will be screened with a physical exam and medical history.

        -  This study requires two visits. Each visit will use standard MRI sequences to take
           images of the knee in motion and at rest.

        -  On the first visit, the MRI scan will look at the knee in its natural state.
           Participants will move the knee up and down for 1 to 3 minutes at a time during the
           scan.

        -  On the second visit, a local anesthetic agent will be injected into the muscle of the
           thigh. The anesthetic will block this muscle from generating force for 2 or 3 hours.
           Participants will move the knee up and down for 1 to 3 minutes at a time during the MRI
           scan.

    <textblock>
      Chronic idiopathic patellofemoral pain, a potential precursor to osteoarthritis, is one of
      the most common problems of the knee. It is characterized by anterior knee pain that is
      aggravated by deep knee flexion, prolonged sitting, and repetitive flexion/extension. The
      most widely accepted theory in regards to the source of this pain is that a force imbalance
      around the knee leads to static patellofemoral malalignment and dynamic patellofemoral
      maltracking. In turn, this malalignment and maltracking leads to elevated joint contact
      stresses, which ultimately leads to patellofemoral pain. Current understanding of
      patellofemoral maltracking is typically focused on static 2D alignment (lateral tilt and
      displacement). Yet, patellofemoral pain is most often exacerbated during dynamic events and
      the patella has complete six degrees of freedom in its movement. More recent studies have
      been able to quantify patellofemoral kinematics during volitional dynamic tasks and
      demonstrate that patellofemoral pain, altered kinematics are not limited to excessive
      patellar lateral translation and tilt, but include excessive patellar superior translation
      along with excessive flexion and valgus rotations. Flexion and valgus are sagittal and
      coronal plane rotations that cause the superior pole of the patella to shift anteriorly and
      medially, respectively. Recent work has shown that altered force balance around the knee can
      indeed lead to maltracking. However, the question remains whether correcting an existing
      force imbalance around the knee can normalize patellar kinematics and/or reduce pain. The
      purpose of this study is to determine how temporary iatrogenic loss of force in the vastus
      lateralis muscle alters the aberrant patellar kinematics in subjects with chronic idiopathic
      patellofemoral pain.

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:

               1. Male and female volunteers between the ages of 18 and 55

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

        All Volunteers

          1. Any relevant medical problems, including 933 those preventing ambulation

          2. Any serious injury to the joint being studied, previous surgery on the joint being
             studiedor extreme pain at the joint being studied or other condition that may explain
             the presence of PF_pain (e.g., meniscal tear, arthritis)

          3. Allergy/hypersensitivity to any local anesthetic agent (e.g., novacaine, lidocaine,
             bupivacaine, ropivacaine)

          4. Liver disease

          5. Open angle glaucoma

          6. Cardiac arrhythmias, congenital heart disease

          7. Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency

          8. Any female who is pregnant

        A volunteer will be excluded if they have a contraindication to MR imaging. Examples are:

          1. Metal within their body, which might be expected to concentrate radiofrequency fields
             or cause tissue damage from twisting in a magnetic field (e.g., aneurysm clip,
             implanted neural stimulator, implanted cardiac pacemaker or autodefibrillator,
             cochlear implant, other foreign body (e.g. metal shavings, insulin pump).

          2. A condition, which would preclude them from participating in an MR imaging study
             (e.g., paralyzed hemidiaphragm, morbid obesity, severe claustrophobia)

          3. A condition that presents an unnecessary risk to them or their unborn child (e.g., 953
             pregnancy, previous surgery of uncertain type, symptoms of pheochromocytoma or
             insulinoma)
