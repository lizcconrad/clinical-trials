    <textblock>
      This study is aimed to determine the feasibility of obtaining and molecularly characterizing
      pre-treatment tumor biopsies, to determine the feasibility of obtaining and molecularly
      characterizing archival and post-treatment tumor biopsies, to assess molecular expression
      changes between archival and baseline tumor samples, and to assess molecular expression
      changes between tumor samples obtained at baseline and at the time of disease progression.

      This study will be a companion study to existing phase I clinical trial treatment studies. It
      is being done to determine the feasibility of obtaining tumor tissue for genomic analysis.
      Patient will be offered enrollment into this trial at the time that they are being considered
      for participation in a phase I treatment trial. After consenting for this study, patients
      will undergo a fresh tumor biopsy and collection of research blood samples. Archived tumor
      specimens will also be obtained and analyzed. At the time of disease progression, fresh tumor
      biopsies and blood samples will be collected in patients who have evaluable pre-biopsy
      specimens and who are eligible to be screened for another study. This will be informative to
      evaluate the mechanisms of resistance to that agent.

        -  Patients with advanced solid or hematological malignancy that is resistant to standard
             therapy or for which no standard therapy is available.

          -  Patients who are considered for early phase clinical trials in which an
             investigational agent is used either alone or in combination with chemotherapy or
             radiation.

          -  Patients with a primary or metastatic tumor lesion that is amenable to biopsy or
             resection

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Have an advanced solid or hematological malignancy that is resistant to standard
             therapy or for which no standard therapy is available.

          -  Being considered for early phase clinical trials in which an investigational agent is
             used either alone or in combination with chemotherapy or radiation. Patients who
             decline to enroll in this companion study will not be denied participation in the
             primary treatment protocols. Patients who are participating in phase I-III clinical
             treatment trials in which a tissue biopsy is already required, or patients who have
             standard of care tumor biopsies or procedures planned, e.g. to confirm metastatic
             recurrence or palliative resection of tumor, would also be eligible for participation
             in this trial.

          -  Have a primary or metastatic tumor lesion that is amenable to biopsy or resection.
             Patients whose tumors cannot be safely biopsied by fine needle aspiration or core
             needle biopsy are still eligible to participate in the aspects of the trial involving
             collection of archival tumor and blood.

          -  Age ≥ 18 years old.

          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status ≤ 2.

          -  Life expectancy &gt; 2 months.

          -  Creatinine clearance ≥ 50 mL/min (applicable only if undergoing CT-guided biopsy that
             requires IV contrast enhancement).

          -  For patients with advanced solid malignancies, adequate hematologic function as
             defined by an absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥1,000/mm^3, platelet count ≥
             50,000/mm^3, white blood cell count (WBC) ≥ 3,000/ mm^3, and hemoglobin ≥ 8 g/dL.

          -  International normalized ratio (INR) ≤ 1.5. Patients on warfarin therapy must be able
             to safely withhold warfarin or be bridged with low-molecular weight therapy and
             demonstrate an INR ≤ 1.5 prior to the biopsy.

          -  Able to understand and willingness to sign a written informed consent document,
             agreeing to baseline and/or post-treatment tumor biopsies and/or blood collection.

          -  Patients who do not qualify for tumor biopsy due to laboratory abnormalities are still
             eligible to participate in the aspects of the trial involving collection of blood.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Have a known or suspected bleeding disorder that in the investigator's opinion would
             increase the risk of bleeding from a biopsy procedure. Patients who do not qualify for
             tumor biopsy due to a known or suspected bleeding disorder are still eligible to
             participate in the aspects of the trial involving collection of archival tumor and
             blood.

          -  Patients will be excluded if their participation in this study for pre-treatment
             biopsy, in the investigator's opinion, will significantly delay enrollment and
             treatment on clinical trial. Patients who are waiting for slot availability or who are
             undergoing a required washout from prior therapy are eligible to enroll.

          -  Patients with active uncontrolled bacterial, fungal or viral infection.

          -  Other severe acute or chronic medical or psychiatric condition or laboratory
             abnormality that may increase the risk associated with study participation or study
             drug administration, or may interfere with the interpretation of study results, or in
             the judgment of the investigator would make the patient inappropriate for entry into
             the study.

          -  Pregnant or breast feeding.
