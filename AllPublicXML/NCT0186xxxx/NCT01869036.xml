  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to test an efficacy and safety of supplemented by Morphine caudal
      anesthesia in children who undergo renal surgery in our department.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The kidney surgery is a significant part of surgical armamentarium in pediatric urology. The
      common operations are open and laparoscopic pyeloplasty, partial nephrectomy open and
      laparoscopic and laparoscopic nephrectomy.

      One of the main goals in the postoperative period is to provide a painless recovery following
      by early mobilization of the child and early discharge home. Caudal anesthesia has become a
      gold standard in the renal surgery providing painless postoperative period, allowing earlier
      child feeding and speedy recovery. However some researchers have pointed out that caudal
      anesthesia with supplemented with Marcaine may provide painless postoperative period only for
      a very limited period of time and required additional painkiller therapy during postoperative
      period. Caudal anesthesia supplemented with Morphine has demonstrated their benefits in
      children who undergo infraumbilical surgery.
