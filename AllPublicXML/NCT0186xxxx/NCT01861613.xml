  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      At present, children less than 15 y of age have been regarded as a key group for hepatitis B
      immunization in China. However, there is not yet special immunization strategy for population
      above 15 y of age. In this study, we investigated the seroprevalence of hepatitis B and
      immune response to HB vaccine among Chinese college students to uncover the need on universal
      mass vaccination or booster immunization only for students with HBV vaccination history
      against hepatitis B in Chinese college students to inform decision making.
