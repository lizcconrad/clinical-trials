  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Despite abundant evident supporting the use of acute reperfusion therapy in the setting of
      acute ischemic stroke (AIS), adoption of this practice in routine clinical care is poor. We
      hypothesize that a significant barrier is the difficulty in weighing the benefits and risks
      of rt-PA treatment in the care of an individual patient, a problem compounded by the time
      urgency of decision-making and clinical fears that weigh risks of treatment more heavily than
      benefits.

      The goal of this Quality Improvement (QI) study is to leverage an IT solution that we have
      developed, ePRISM, that executes multivariable risk models with patient-specific data so that
      a personalized estimate of an individual's outcomes (both risks and benefits) with and
      without rt-PA, can be generated so support safer, more effective clinical care. Through an
      earlier project, we will have programmed ePRISM with the best available risk-stratification
      models and developed a clinically useful format for presenting the data to support clinical
      decision-making in AIS.

      Through QI, we propose to identify the optimal mechanism for integrating the tool within the
      routine flow of patient care in preparation for more definitive studies, or dissemination
      strategies, to improve the treatment of patients with AIS.

      Specific Aim 1: Implement ePRISM and the RESOLVE Decision Aid (DA) at 2 sites (Saint Luke's
      Hospital in Kansas City and Saint Luke's North) for Emergency Department (ED) access and
      decision support.

      1. Procedures and Evaluation

        1. Map process flow and define the optimal points of care for both the informed consent and
           decision aid.

        2. Pre-implementation registry or data retrieval of patient/family satisfaction with
           information during consent process pre-PRISM, as well as time from presentation to
           treatment.

        3. Implementation of ePRISM software and the RESOLVE DA.

        4. Monitor proportion of patients in whom the RESOLVE DA is used.

        5. Post-implementation registry or data retrieval of patient/family satisfaction and
           knowledge, as well as time from presentation to treatment.

        6. Interviews of providers on confidence in making treatment decisions.

        7. Monitor patient outcomes through 90 day follow up phone call as per the standard of
           care.

      Specific Aim 2: Implement ePRISM and the RESOLVE DA onsite at the the Barnes Jewish Hospital
      Emergency Department. After optimizing the integration of ePRISM and the RESOLVE DA at Saint
      Luke's Hospital and Saint Luke's North, we will evaluate strategies for implementation at
      Barnes Jewish Hospital's Emergency Department Telestroke Program.

    <description>Successful implementation of ePRISM and the RESOLVE DA in 3 ED's and a telestroke program. Successful implementation is defined as: 1) the activation of ePRISM and generation the RESOLVE DA by ePRISM; 2) the staff and clinician's reported value of the new RESOLVE DA for use during the rt-PA decision making process.</description>
