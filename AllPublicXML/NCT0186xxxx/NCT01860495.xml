  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      One of the most important elements suggested to be provided through membrane perforations to
      augment regeneration are cell released growth factors from the overlying periosteal and
      gingival cells. A direct correlation could exist between the number of such cells and their
      available released growth factors. To test this assumption, this study was designed to
      evaluate levels of bone morphogenetic protein-2 in gingival crevicular fluid (GCF) during the
      early stages of healing for sites treated by MPM compared to that of the occlusive barrier
      membranes.

      The subjects were recruited consecutively from the list of patients seeking care for
      periodontal problems at the Department of Periodontology of the Faculty of Dental Medicine,
      Al Azhar University, Cairo, Egypt, between March 2012 to December 2012. The criteria
      implemented for patient inclusion were: 1) no systemic diseases which could influence the
      outcome of the therapy; 2) good compliance with the plaque control instructions following
      initial therapy; 3) teeth involved were all vital with score 0 mobility ; 4) each subject
      contributed matched pairs of two or three walled intrabony interproximal defects in premolar
      or molar teeth 5) the selected 2- or 3-wall intrabony defect depth ranged from 3-5 mm as
      detected in diagnostic periapical radiographs; 6) selected pocket depth (PD) ≥ 6 mm and
      clinical attachment level (CAL) ≥ 5 mm at the site of endosseous defect four weeks following
      initial cause-related therapy 7) endosseous radiographic defect angle ≤55 and ≥15 8)
      availability for the follow-up and maintenance program; 9) absence of periodontal treatment
      for the previous year; 10) absence of systemic medication or antibiotic treatment for the
      previous 6 months; 11) absence of a smoking habit and 12) absence of occlusal interferences.
      Pregnant females were excluded from participating in the study. Patients were also excluded
      from the study if they presented with opened interproximal contact, or inadequate compliance
      with the oral hygiene maintenance schedule. The experimental protocol was approved by the
      Ethical Committee of El Azhar University (OMD - 45 - 2012, clinical trial registration
      number: Al Azhar University 22-31). Research procedures were explained to all patients and
      they agreed to participate in the study and signed the appropriate informed consent form of
      Al Azhar University.

    <description>Using capillary tube (5 µl), gingival cervicular fluid (GCF) samples were collected (Sueda et al, 1969) by a single examiner (MA) who was masked to the attribution of the sites to MPM or OM. Following the isolation and drying of the selected site with cotton rolls, a fisher brand disposable micropipettes €, placed intrasulculary at the mesiofacial line angle of the selected site to a maximum depth of 2 mm below the gingival margin. Micropipettes were left in place until 5ul of fluid was collected. Gingival cervicular fluid (GCF) samples were collected one day, 3, 7, 14, 21, and 30 days after therapy and diluted in saline solution (50 µl) for bone morphogenetic protein-2 level evaluation. Samples were labeled, carried in a dark container and kept at -80 C until used.</description>
