  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The SEARCH study aims to test evidenced-based innovative community based interventions that
      lead to the elimination of HIV in rural communities in East Africa using a multi-disease
      approach. The first phase of the study will quantify the health, economic and educational
      impact of early HIV diagnosis using a streamlined and immediate ART (antiretroviral therapy).
      This first phase will be completed in July 2017. The second phase of the study, will quantify
      the health, economic and educational impact of targeted Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis (PrEP),
      targeted HIV testing and targeted care interventions in the context of universal treatment
      and streamlined care. This second phase will be completed in July 2020. The study
      intervention is designed to improve the entire continuum of care, to reduce structural
      barriers for all populations including those most &quot;at risk&quot;.
