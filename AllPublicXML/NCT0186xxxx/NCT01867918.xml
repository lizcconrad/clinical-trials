    <textblock>
      In this study the investigators will include colo-rectal cancer (CRC) patients starting last
      line of standard palliative chemotherapy. Eligible patients include patients with KRAS
      mutation starting line or KRAS wild type starting line treatment. Standard treatment today
      for these patients is chemotherapy only and median overall survival (OS) is about 10 months.
      The hypothesis is that local treatment in addition to systemic treatment will increase time
      to progression, progression free survival and overall survival compared to patients who
      receive systemic chemotherapy only. The investigators experience with local treatment of
      liver metastases in CRC patients is that side-effects of treatment in general are minor,
      although gastric bleeding have been observed after stereotactic body radiation therapy.
