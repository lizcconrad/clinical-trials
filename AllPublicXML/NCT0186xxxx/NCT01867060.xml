  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This propsective study aims to compare the diagnostic yield of a Personal Heart Rhythm
      Monitor (PHRM) with an automated cardiac event recorder (ACER) to detect paroxysmal Atrial
      Fibrillation PAF). The investigators hypothesise that the PHRM, used intermittently for 3
      months, will detect significantly more cases of PAF than the ACER, used continuously for one
      week.

      A case-control sub-study will identify individuals with confirmed PAF, and matched
      individuals with no evidence of PAF, to identify potential serum biomarkers for PAF.

      A further case-control study will assess markers of left atrial function in patients with PAF
      and their matched controls.

      Another case-control sub-study will determine the significance of frequent Atrial Premature
      Beats (APBs) in the development of AF over a one year period.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with suspected AF will be initially referred to a community-based, nurse-led
      Arrhythmia clinic by their General Practitioners over a 15-month period.

      All patients will be issued with a one week ACER (the 'R. Test 4 Evolution'), seen as the
      'best-practice' investigation for this population group. Participants will also be issued
      with a PHRM for three months. They will be instructed to take regular twice-daily, 30 second
      recordings with additional recordings in the event of relevant symptoms. They will return the
      ACER after one week and the PHRM after 3 months.

      A subgroup of participants (target recruitment number = 100) will undergo transthoracic
      echocardiography. A 40ml venous blood sample will also be taken. Another small subgroup
      (target recruitment = 20) will be asked to continue twice-daily recordings using the PHRM for
      a further nine months and will be issued with a repeat one week ACER at study completion.
