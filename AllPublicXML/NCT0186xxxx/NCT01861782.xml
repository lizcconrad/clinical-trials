    <textblock>
      Prospective open label crossover self controlled study. The study population will randomly be
      divided into two groups.

      The study will take place in Lot Spa Hotel at the Dead Sea in two cycles (one of 16
      participants and one of 14 participants) and will be comprised of 3 main stages:

        1. Initial exposure to treatment for 14 days excluding Friday and Saturday (each of the two
           groups will have its own treatment protocol)

        2. 12-month washout period

        3. Crossover of the two groups and second exposure to treatment for 14 days excluding
           Friday and Saturday (each of the two groups will have its own treatment protocol).

      The population in the study will be composed of patients diagnosed and treated for rheumatoid
      arthritis at the Soroka University Medical Center who are 18 and above of age.

      The patients will be selected by the PI and his team and addressed regarding their
      willingness to participate in the study.
