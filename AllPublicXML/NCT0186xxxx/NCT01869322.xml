    <textblock>
      When people break their arm and arrive at Oregon Health and Science University's Emergency
      Department (OHSU ED), they are treated with a short-term means of immobilizing their broken
      arm. The two most common ways of stabilizing the broken parts of the arm are 1) with a
      plaster-based coaptation splint, or 2) with a soft cloth sling and swathe. These hold the arm
      steady until the patient can schedule an appointment with the OHSU Orthopaedic Trauma clinic
      where they will receive definitive evaluation and stabilization/fixation. In much of the
      orthopaedic literature coaptation splints are the default immobilization method. The
      investigators hypothesize however, that sling and swathe immobilization may be equally
      effective for short term stabilization, while being faster to apply, and more comfortable for
      the patient. This randomized, unblinded prospective study will follow the satisfaction,
      quality of life and limited functional outcomes of all enrolled participants during the first
      week following their injury.
