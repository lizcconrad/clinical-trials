  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Opioids are the mainstay of analgesia in hospitalized children but opioid therapy is
      associated with life-threatening respiratory depression requiring antagonism with naloxone.
      Hence, it is hypothesized that naloxone requirement can be used as a quality measure of
      opioid safety. A retrospective medical chart review of 95 patients, who received naloxone for
      life threatening events, from June 2006-2012, is planned, to identify significant factors
      associated with risk for opioid induced respiratory depression and formulation of preventive
      strategies.
