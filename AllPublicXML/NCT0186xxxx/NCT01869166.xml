      RATIONALE: Placing a tumor antigen chimeric receptor that has been created in the laboratory
      into patient autologous T cells may make the body build immune response to kill cancer cells.

      PURPOSE: This clinical trial is to study genetically engineered lymphocyte therapy in
      treating patients with EGFR positive advanced/unresectable operation solid tumors, such as
      lung cancer, colorectal cancer，ovary cancer，cholangiocarcinoma，pancreatic cancer，renal
      carcinoma and other relapsed/metastatic tumors.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the safety and feasibility of the chimeric antigen receptor T cells transduced
      with the anti-EGFR Lentivirus vector (referred to as CART-EGFR cells).

      II. Determine duration of in vivo survival of CART-EGFR cells. RT-PCR (reverse transcription
      polymerase chain reaction) analysis of whole blood will be used to detect and quantify
      survival of CART-EGFR CD3zeta:CD137 over time.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. For patients with advanced， relapsed/metastatic cancers, measure anti-tumor response due
      to CART-EGFR cell infusions.

      II. Estimate relative trafficking of CART-EGFR cells in tumor bed.

      III. Determine if cellular or humoral host immunity develops against the murine anti-EGFR,
      and assess correlation with loss of detectable CART-EGFR (loss of engraftment).

      IV. Determine the relative subsets of CART-EGFR T cells (Tcm, Tem, and Treg).

      OUTLINE: Patients are assigned to 1 group according to order of enrollment.

      Patients receive anti-EGFR-CAR (coupled with CD137 and CD3 zeta signalling domains)Lentivirus
      vector-transduced autologous T cells for 3-5 days in the absence of unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed intensively for 6 months, every 3
      months for 2 years, and annually thereafter for 13 years.

      Estimate relative trafficking of CART-EGFR cells in peripheral blood.
