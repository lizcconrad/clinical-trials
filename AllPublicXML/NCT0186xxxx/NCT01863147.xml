  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cardiovascular complications account for the highest mortality in type 2 diabetic patients,
      mainly due to coronary artery disease (CAD).Left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) is widespread
      in type 2 diabetic patients with CAD, even in the absence of hypertension .It is a strong
      predictor of cardiovascular events and all-cause mortality .

      Sitagliptin, an inhibitor of dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4), may regress left ventricular
      mass (LVM) in newly diagnosed type 2 diabetic patients with CAD .

    <description>Endothelial function was assessed on three visits (baseline, month 6, and month 12) by measuring flow-mediated dilation (FMD) of the brachial artery in response to hyperemia according to our previous reports.
Pulse wave analysis and pulse wave velocity (PWV) were measured at baseline, 6 months visit, and 12 months visit.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:Patients had to have the levels of hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) &gt; 7.0 %. They
        also had to have either angiographically documented coronary artery disease or a previous
        history of myocardial infarction. In addition, they were also required to have an office BP
        &lt; 135/85 mm Hg and the presence of LVH on echocardiography (American Society of
        Echocardiography criteria LVM index [LVMI] &gt; 115 g/m2 for men and &gt; 95 g/m2 for women) . -

        Exclusion Criteria:Patients were excluded if they were currently prescribed glucagon-like
        peptide (GLP) -1 analogues or DPP-4 inhibitors or glucosidase inhibitor or
        anti-hypertensive drugs (including b-blockers), diabetes medications, estrogen supplements,
        thyroxine, diuretics, hypolipidemic drugs. They were also excluded if they had renal and
        liver dysfunction, heart failure, or malignancy, or were unable to give informed consent.
        Patients with contraindications to cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) (pacemakers,
        claustrophobia) were also excluded, as were pregnant or lactating women. -
