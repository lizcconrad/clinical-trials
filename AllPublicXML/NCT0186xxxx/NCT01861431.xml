  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The proposed study aims to test the feasibility and preliminary efficacy of a combined
      4-session HIV sexual risk reduction (HIVSRR) and microfinance intervention (including 34
      training session and matched savings) to reduce unprotected sex and to increase proportion of
      income from sex work among women engaged in high risk sexual activity in Ulaanbaatar,
      Mongolia. Feasibility and preliminary efficacy will be tested using a randomized clinical
      trial (RCT) with 134 women sex workers meeting eligibility criteria. Following eligibility
      screening, eligible women will complete informed consent, a baseline assessment, and be
      randomized to one of 2 study conditions: 1) the combination HIV sexual risk reduction plus
      microfinance (HIVSRR+MF); or 2) a 4-session HIVSRR alone control condition.

      The study design will permit us to:

        1. Examine and enhance the feasibility (i.e. recruitment, engagement, attendance, retention
           data collection) of a combination HIV sexual risk reduction and MF intervention with
           high risk women in Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia;

        2. Examine the preliminary outcomes of the interventions on decreasing unprotected acts of
           vaginal and anal intercourse; increasing the proportion of protected vaginal and/or anal
           acts using barrier protection and decreasing number of sexual partners with repeated
           measures at baseline, immediately post-intervention, and 3 and 6 month follow-up
           assessments.

        3. Use the results of the pilot study to inform the design of a future R01 application.
