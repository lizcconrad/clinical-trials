  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Rationale: Pregabalin is effective on radiotherapy-related neuropathic pain. Purpose: This
      randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial aims to investigate the effect and safety
      of pregabalin in treating radiotherapy-related neuropathic pain.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Radiotherapy for cancer is associated with peripheral neuropathies, especially with brachial
      plexus neuropathy and trigeminal neuralgia, which included painful sensation that are
      described as burning, aching, spasm, or tingling. Though there is some recommendation about
      neuropathic pain, there is no definite drug which is recommended for radiotherapy-related
      neuropathic pain.

      Pregabalin, a central nervous system(CNS)-active compound, is an analog of the
      neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid. It has been proved an effective treatment for
      diabetic peripheral neuropathy and postherpetic neuralgia in previous clinical trials. This
      study plans to evaluate the efficacy of pregabalin versus placebo for relieving
      radiotherapy-related peripheral neuropathic pain, and assessed its safety.
