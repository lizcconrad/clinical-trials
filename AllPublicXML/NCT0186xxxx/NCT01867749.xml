  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to conduct a randomized pilot trial in a sample of 60 women who
      meet criteria for Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) 1-18 months after a perinatal loss to
      demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed recruitment methods and research design, of the
      therapist training methods, and of delivering the adapted Interpersonal Psychotherapy group
      treatment.

      The investigators would like to examine preliminary evidence for the following hypotheses:

        -  Perinatal-loss specific IPT-G will be more acceptable to women who experience MDD
           following perinatal loss than will Coping with Depression (CWD).

        -  Perinatal-loss specific IPT-G will result in reduced time to remission from MDD and
           reduced depressive symptoms relative to CWD.

        -  Perinatal-loss specific IPT-G will result in increased social support and social
           functioning, reduced couple distress, and reduced grief relative to CWD.

    <time_frame>Survival analysis</time_frame>
    <description>We will calculate the effect size and confidence intervals for time to remission from depressive episode. Remission will be defined as number of weeks until Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression score of 7 or less. Recovery from major depression is an exploratory aim; it will be defined as 8+ consecutive weeks on the Longitudinal Interval Follow-up Evaluation PSR scores of 1 or 2. Exploratory tests for differences between conditions will use Cox regression, with initial HRSD scores as a covariate.</description>

    <time_frame>Slopes over time</time_frame>
    <description>We will calculate the effect sizes and confidence intervals for reduction in depressive symptoms using HRSD and BDI-II scores. Exploratory tests for differences between conditions will use HLM with baseline scores as covariates.</description>

    <description>We will calculate effect sizes and confidence intervals for improvement in social support and social functioning using the Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support and the Social Adjustment Scale. Exploratory tests for differences between conditions will use HLM with baseline scores as covariates.</description>

    <measure>Couple Distress</measure>
    <time_frame>Slope over time: Baseline, 4 Weeks, 8 Weeks, 12 Weeks, 3 Months, 6 Months</time_frame>
    <description>Social adjustment as measured by the Dyadic Adjustment Scale (DAS). We will calculate effect sizes and confidence intervals for reduction in couple distress using the DAS. Exploratory tests for differences between conditions will use HLM with baseline DAS scores as a covariate.</description>

    <measure>Grief</measure>
    <time_frame>Slope over time: Baseline, 4 Weeks, 8 Weeks, 12 Weeks, 3 Months, 6 Months</time_frame>
    <description>Grief as measured by the Perinatal Bereavement Grief Scale and the Inventory of Complicated Grief. We will calculate effect sizes and confidence intervals for reduction in grief using the PBGS and ICG. Exploratory tests for differences between conditions will use HLM with baseline scores as covariates. Although not the primary focus of this study, we will also calculate the NNT for prevention of complicated grief diagnosis.</description>

    <description>Participants in the IPT-G condition will receive 12 group therapy sessions over 2 weeks as well as 2 individual (pre-group and 1-month booster sessions). In addition, 3 of the 12 group sessions will invite women to include their partners or other support people to bolster the woman's social support system and to reduce conflicts over how to react to the loss. This study adapted IPT for treatment of depression after perinatal loss.</description>

    <arm_group_type>Active Comparator</arm_group_type>
    <description>The Coping with Depression (CWD) course is a highly structured, manualized psycho-educational group treatment for MDD. The course content is cognitive-behavioral in nature and is designed to train skills that can be used in the alleviation of depression. The skill modules focus on relaxation, cognitive skills, and behavioral activation. CWD will consist of an individual pre-group interview, 12 group therapy sessions over 12 weeks and a 1-month individual booster session to provide an identical treatment dose as the experimental condition.</description>
