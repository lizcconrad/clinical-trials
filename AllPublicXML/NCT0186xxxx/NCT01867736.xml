        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Subject has provided written informed consent.

          2. Subject is willing and able to comply with follow-up evaluations.

          3. Subject is ≥ 18 years old.

          4. Single or sequential de novo or restenotic lesions (stenosis ≥ 70% diameter reduction
             or occlusion) in the infrapopliteal arteries ≥ 30 mm. Lesions should not extend beyond
             the ankle joint.

          5. A maximum of 2 different vessels can be treated: successful wire crossing is required
             for the first target vessel before randomization occurs.

          6. Subject with PAD or critical limb ischemia according to the current guidelines in need
             for urgent revascularization to relieve symptoms and improve walking capacity.

          7. Reference Vessel Diameter (RVD) 2 - 4 mm, based on visual estimation.

          8. Inflow free from flow-limiting lesion confirmed by angiography. Patients with
             flow-limiting inflow lesions (&gt; 50% stenosis) can be included if lesion(s) have been
             treated successfully before the index procedure, with a maximum residual stenosis of
             30% per visual assessment.

          9. At least one non-occluded crural vessel with angiographically documented run-off to
             the foot.

         10. Successful wire crossing of the lesion.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Flow-limiting (&gt; 50% DS) inflow lesion proximal to target lesion, left untreated.

          2. Failure to obtain &lt;30% residual stenosis in a pre-existing haemodynamically
             significant (&gt;50% DS) inflow lesion (DEB or DES not allowed for the treatment of
             inflow lesions).

          3. Infrapopliteal lesions extending beyond the ankle joint and involving crural vessels.

          4. Acute thrombus in the target vessel (eg complication of inflow lesion treatment)
             documented by angiogram, if not treated successfully prior to enrolment).

          5. Planned major amputation above the ankle of target limb, or any other planned major
             surgery within 30 days post-procedure.

          6. Previous bypass surgery of target vessel.

          7. Previously implanted stent in target lesion.

          8. Haemorrhagic diathesis or coagulopathy or other disorders such as gastrointestinal
             ulcerations or cerebral disorders that would restrict prescription of dual
             anti-platelet therapy.

          9. Subject with hepatic failure, deep vein thrombosis, thrombophlebitis, systemic lupus
             erythematous or subject is on immunosuppressant therapy.

         10. Subject with acute MI ≤ 3 months.

         11. Renal failure with a creatinine of ≥ 2,5 mg/dl, except patients currently on regular
             dialysis.

         12. Phenprocoumon intake, except for patients who are treated for Arterial Fibrillation.
             For these patients Phenprocoumon treatment can be interrupted and re-started after
             treatment with Dual Antiplatelet Therapy for 4 weeks post procedure.

         13. Known allergy to contrast media used for angiography that cannot be controlled by
             pre-medication with steroids and/or antihistaminica.

         14. Allergy, intolerance or hypersensitivity to Paclitaxel or related compounds and/or to
             the delivery matrix n-Butyryl tri-n-hexyl citrate(BTHC).

         15. Co- morbid conditions limiting life expectancy ≤ 1 year.

         16. Patients that are under active treatment for cancer; Patients, who have been
             successfully treated for cancer in the past, can be included.

         17. Subject is participating in another clinical device trial where the primary endpoint
             has not yet been reached.

         18. Pregnant and/or breast-feeding females or females who intend to become pregnant during
