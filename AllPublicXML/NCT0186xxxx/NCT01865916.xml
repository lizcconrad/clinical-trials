  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a randomized, controlled, single centre, endoscopist-blinded non-inferiority
      trial. The purpose of our study is to determine if using a 2-litre mixture in combination
      with vitamin C is better than using 2 litres of mixture with bisacodyl tablets. Two-litre
      PegLyte based preparations with an added laxative agent are commonly used for colonoscopies
      in outpatient settings. If the investigators discover that a 2-litre mixture with either the
      tablets or the ascorbic acid work better, future patients undergoing colonoscopy will be able
      to experience fewer side effects and be less troubled by the preparation while still allowing
      a good view of the colon.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All adults (≥ 19 yrs of age) who are referred to St. Paul's Hospital for outpatient
      colonoscopy will be included in our study. Exclusion criteria included those with
      constipation, suspected or known small bowel obstruction, severe inflammatory bowel disease,
      and any history of colonic resection. 278 consecutive eligible patients will be randomized to
      one of two bowel preparations through the use of concealed allocation by a scheduling
      assistant (blinded) in a one-to-one allocation ratio. Bowel preparations included: (i) 2 L of
      MoviPrep (2 L PEG 3350 electrolyte solution + ascorbic acid) or (ii) Bi-Peglyte (2 L PEG 3350
      electrolyte solution and 15mg bisacodyl). Patients in both arms will be instructed to adhere
      to a clear liquid diet commensing 24 hours prior to scheduled colonoscopy in addition to
      their remaining bowel preparation.

      The investigators will not have access to the randomization envelopes and the randomized
      bowel preparation will be stored within the medical record that will not be accessible by the
      endoscopist. The endoscopists can break blinding and access the bowel prep given when
      medically necessary.

      At the time of their procedure check-in, written consent will be confirmed and patients will
      respond to a brief survey assessing patient tolerance. All colonoscopies will be performed
      under conscious sedation by an experienced endoscopist. Endoscopists will be blinded to the
      bowel preparation until the completion of the study. We will use the Boston Bowel Preparation
      Scale (BBPS) and Ottawa Bowel Preparation Scale (OBPS) to assess efficacy in bowel
      preparation.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Bowel cleansing efficacy as rated by a Boston Bowel Preparation Scale score of greater than 8</measure>
    <time_frame>20 hours</time_frame>
    <description>The BBPS is a relatively new, validated scoring system assessing cleanliness of three segments of the colon (left colon, transverse, and right colon). The total is a 10 point scale (0-9) that grades each segment of the colon from 0-3. A segment score of 0 describes: 'unprepared colon segment with mucosa not well seen due to solid stool that cannot be cleared'. Segment score 1: 'portion of mucosa of the colon segment seen, but other areas of the colon are not well seen due to staining, residual stool and/or opaque liquid'. Segment score 2: 'minor amount of residual staining, small fragments of stool and/or opaque liquid, but mucosa of colon segment seen well'. Segment score 3: 'entire mucosa of the colon segment seen well with no residual staining, small fragments of stool and/or opaque liquid'. In this study, we define an excellent equivalent BBPS score as 8 or 9. Scores of 7 or above are generally felt to provide a good visualization of the colon.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Patient tolerability to each 2L product</measure>
    <time_frame>20 hours</time_frame>
    <description>Our secondary outcome is patient tolerability to each 2L product based on a ten-question survey. The questionnaire basically asks about patient experience in terms of charateristic taste of bowel prep, volume intake, any distressing signs and symptoms, compliance to bowel preparation solution assigned to subjects using a Likert scale. The number of participants in each level will subsequently be quantified (n,%) and compared between the two groups</description>
