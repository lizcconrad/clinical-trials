      To provide children dependent on total parenteral nutrition with Omegaven®, a fish oil-based
      intravenous lipid emulsion that may be less hepatotoxic than conventional, vegetable
      oil-based intravenous lipid emulsions, and that may therefore reduce the need for liver
      transplantation.

    <description>Patients with a sustained TPN requirement due to short bowel syndrome and TPN-associated liver disease that threatens progression to liver failure and death, for which the only available means of prevention at present is timely liver and/or intestinal transplant.
Omegaven 10%, 1 gram/kg, IV, every 12 hours until transplantation, or stopping TPN</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  The targeted population for enrollment is the cohort of patients with TPN-dependent
             short bowel syndrome, defined as any pediatric patient who, following abdominal
             surgery, has a residual small bowel length less than 25% of that predicted for
             gestational age or requires postoperative TPN for more than 42 days because of
             gastrointestinal intolerance and who has developed TPN-associated liver disease
             sufficient to pose a significant risk for progression to liver failure based on the
             following criteria:

               -  Total serum bilirubin concentration greater than 3 mg/dL after a total duration
                  of TPN greater than 2 months in the absence of a proven episode of bacteremia
                  within the preceding 3 weeks.

        PLUS EITHER:

        • Platelet count less than 200,000/μL after a total duration of TPN greater than 2 months
        in the absence of a proven episode of bacteremia within the preceding 3 weeks.

        OR

        • Serum albumin concentration less than 3.2 mg/dL after a total duration of TPN greater
        than 2 months in the absence of a proven episode of bacteremia within the preceding 3
        weeks.

        Patients with coagulopathy due to parenteral nutrition-associated liver disease (INR &gt; 1.2)
        will be potential candidates for enrollment, because patients with an elevated INR
        exceeding 2 have demonstrated resolution of coagulopathy after treatment with Omegaven®.
        Similarly, patients with hyperlipidemia will be potential candidates for enrollment.

        Alternatively, patients currently receiving Omegaven that was initiated at another center
        because of intestinal failure with liver disease that do not need to meet the lab criteria
        listed above. The subject may continue Omegaven under this protocol at the discretion of
        the Principle Investigator.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Patients with a history of the following will be excluded from enrollment in this protocol:

          -  Allergy to fish or egg protein.

          -  Liver disease proven or suspected to be caused by a process other than TPN-dependent
             short bowel syndrome, including but not limited to hepatitis C, hepatitis B, cystic
             fibrosis, biliary atresia, Alagille syndrome, familial intrahepatic cholestasis, and
             alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency.

          -  Refusal of third party providers to reimburse hospital for the cost of Omegaven®.
