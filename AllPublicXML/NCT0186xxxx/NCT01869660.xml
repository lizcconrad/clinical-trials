    <description>The present SDM intervention is based on principles derived from previous randomized controlled trials of SDMs. SDM meetings comprise at least 4 weekly 20 minutes sessions. Meetings have at least three professionals: a case manager (psychiatrists or nurses), a primary doctor, and a nurse/social worker. The focus of the meeting is to empower patients to discuss their attitudes and preferences toward treatments.</description>
