  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic kidney disease is associated with the accumulation of various metabolites, i.e.,
      uremic retention solutes. Evidence is mounting that the colonic microbiome contributes
      substantially to these uremic retention solutes. Indoxyl sulfate and p-cresyl sulfate are
      among the most extensively studied gut microbial metabolites, and are associated with
      cardiovascular disease, chronic kidney disease progression and overall mortality. Colonic
      transit time is an important determinant of intestinal generation and uptake of bacterial
      metabolites. However, it is unknown if accelerating the colonic transit time reduces the
      intestinal generation and uptake of indoxyl sulfate and p-cresyl sulfate. Prucalopride is a
      selective, high-affinity 5-HT4 receptor agonist with a stimulating effect on colonic motility
      and transit. It is currently used in treating chronic slow-transit constipation. An
      observational study will be initiated in non-chronic kidney disease patients with chronic
      slow-transit constipation necessitating treatment with prucalopride to observe its effect on
      serum concentrations and intestinal generation of indoxyl sulfate and p-cresyl sulfate.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Age ≥ 18 and ≤ 85 years

          -  Chronic slow-transit constipation as defined be 4 criteria:

               1. having two or fewer spontaneous complete bowel movements week for a minimum of 6
                  months

               2. having one or more of the following symptoms for at least one-quarter of the
                  time: lumpy/hard stools, a sensation of incomplete evacuation, or straining
                  during defecation.

               3. slow transit time as determined by Rx colon transit study (&quot;pellet&quot;)

               4. without evidence of secondary constipation or primary defecation disorder

          -  Need of therapy with prucalopride (i.e., inefficacy of dietary changes and laxatives)

          -  Follow-up visit possible after 4 weeks of treatment

          -  Written informed consent

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  History or new diagnosis of organic intestinal disease (e.g., inflammatory bowel
             disease, malignancy)

          -  Secondary constipation (drug-induced, endocrine, metabolic or neurological disorders,
             surgery, known or suspected organic disorders of the large intestine, or megacolon) or
             primary defecation disorder

          -  Use of laxatives two days before start of treatment and during treatment period. If
             there is no spontaneous bowel movement during 3 consecutive days, rescue treatment
             with bisacodyl and/or enema is allowed if necessary
