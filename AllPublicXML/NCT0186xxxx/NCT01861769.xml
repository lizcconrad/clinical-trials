  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Approximately 9% of Canadians will have Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) in their
      lifetime. In the military veteran population, the lifetime prevalence of PTSD has been
      estimated to be as high as 20%. Numerous research studies have demonstrated that short-term,
      cognitive-behavioral psychotherapies, such as Cognitive Processing Therapy (CPT), lead to
      substantial improvements in PTSD symptoms. However, research suggests that a minority of
      clinicians provide these therapies in clinical settings. The transfer of this research
      knowledge into clinical settings remains one of the largest hurdles to improving the health
      of Canadians with PTSD.

      It is well established that attending a 2-day workshop on these therapies alone is
      insufficient to promote adequate knowledge transfer and sustained skillful use. The current
      study aims to contrast whether two forms of post-workshop support (6-month duration), with
      different levels of expert oversight, will result in superior levels of clinician skill and
      patient outcomes versus no formal post-workshop support. The three forms of post-workshop
      support are 1) technology-enhanced group tele-consultation 2) standard group
      tele-consultation 3) no tele consultation. The primary and secondary outcomes will be the
      assessment of the clinicians' competence in CPT and patient symptoms,respectively. This study
      will inform how best to transfer evidence based therapy outcomes to the clinical milieu to
      attain comparable outcomes as those observed in research.

      The investigators' hypotheses are as follows: Hypothesis 1:The technology enhanced group
      tele-consultation condition will evidence the highest levels of fidelity, the standard group
      tele-consultation condition will evidence intermediate levels of fidelity, and the
      no-consultation/fidelity monitoring only condition will evidence the lowest fidelity.
      Hypothesis 2: Fidelity to the CPT protocol, irrespective of consultation condition, will be
      positively associated with improved client outcomes. Hypothesis 3: Organizational context
      variables, such as the organizational climate and readiness for change, will influence the
      uptake of CPT skills, as well as the extent to which these skills are utilized in practice.

    <description>Technology-enhanced Group Tele-consultation. This consultation method requires that participants be prepared to review and receive feedback on audiorecorded CPT sessions in a group format. The CPT expert randomly selects two clinician sessions each week that have been audiorecorded to use for feedback and discussion in group teleconference based on procedures used in previous training initiatives (Stirman, Bhar, et al., 2010). Five- to twenty-minute segments of the two sessions will be shared within the group consultation. The CPT expert will provide feedback on the sessions with an emphasis on review of key learning points. These consultation group sessions will be facilitated with collaborative meeting software that includes audio file uploading.</description>

    <description>Standard Tele-consultation Group. The CPT expert will randomly select clinicians for case presentation each week. Each clinician will be responsible for verbally presenting on their CPT cases throughout the 6-month period of consultation course. No audiorecorded content will be reviewed within the calls. All other procedures used in the above condition will be used here.</description>

    <description>No Consultation/Fidelity Monitoring Only. Participants assigned to this condition will receive no post-workshop expert consultation, but will be subject to the same audiorecorded session-uploading and client-outcome reporting as the other conditions. This condition allows us to assess the effect of clinicians knowing that their sessions are subject to fidelity assessment.</description>
