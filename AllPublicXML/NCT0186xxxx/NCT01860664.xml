    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the safety and effectiveness of hydrocortisone
      ophthalmic ointment compared to placebo in the treatment of Allergic Conjunctivitis.

      Compare the safety and efficacy of Hydrocortisone Ophthalmic Ointment 0.5% vs. Placebo for
      the reduction of signs and symptoms associated with allergic conjunctivitis. Demonstration of
      efficacy is a statistically significant improvement in itching on a 0 to 4 patient subjective
      assessment itch score compared to the vehicle arm and at least a 25% (or 1 full unit or more)
      improvement in itch scores. Efficacy for bulbar redness scores would be indicated by a
      statistically significant improvement in redness on a zero to 4 based on the investigators
      objective assessment compared to the vehicle group. Differences of at least 25% on the four
      point scale would be considered clinically significant when attained at the majority of time
      points.

    <description>At each visit, the principal investigator or designated personnel determined to be medically qualified by the principal investigator will begin by querying for adverse events by asking each patient a general, non-directed question such as 'How have you been feeling since the last visit?' Directed questioning and examination will then be done as appropriate. All reported adverse events will be documented on the appropriate case report form.</description>
