    <textblock>
      Order randomized crossover non-inferiority study evaluating the acute efficacy of High Flow
      Therapy (HFT) as compared to nasal Continuous Positive Airway Pressure therapy (CPAP) in the
      management of apnea / hypopnea index (AHI).

    <textblock>
      Study to evaluate the acute efficacy of a single night of High Flow Therapy (HFT) to treat
      mild-moderate predominantly obstructive Sleep Disordered Breathing, as compared to nasal
      Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP) therapy. Subjects will be order-randomized to
      receive HFT or CPAP in the laboratory, undergo a washout period, and return for the
      alternative therapy in the laboratory. The hypothesis is that HFT will be non-inferior to
      CPAP in controlling Apnea/Hypopnea events in this subject set during this study.

      Primary outcome will be Apnea / Hypopnea Index (AHI) change on therapy as compared to
      baseline diagnostic polysomnography.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  At least 18 years of age

          -  Previous diagnosis of primarily obstructive mild-moderate Sleep Disordered Breathing
             during in-laboratory polysomnography

          -  Ability to read and understand English Language

          -  Ability to provide informed consent

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Unstable medical illness within the last month (30 days)

          -  Acute / recent upper airway infection

          -  Prior use of non-continuous positive airway pressure medical technology therapies
             prescribed by a physician for the management of obstructive sleep disordered breathing
             (e.g., Provent®, Winx™, mandibular advancement oral appliances, etc.)

          -  Prior use or exposure to CPAP / Bi-Level / or other non-invasive ventilatory
             modalities

          -  Craniofacial or other anatomical anomalies that may predispose patients to upper
             airway obstruction, or obvious blockage to nasal air flow

          -  Patients using opioids or amphetamines will be excluded from the study.

          -  Enhanced oxygen requirement (i.e., FiO2&gt;0.21)

          -  Patients requiring Bi-Level therapy upon CPAP titration attempt

          -  Surgery since the diagnostic PSG

          -  Significant recent sedative/hypnotic use likely, in the opinion of the principle
             investigator, to impair ventilatory control or impact the subsequent titration of
             either CPAP therapy or Flowrest therapy (including benzodiazepines, antihistamines,
             imidazopyridines)

          -  Significant use of stimulant medications likely, in the opinion of the principle
             investigator, likely to alter ventilatory or upper airway control and impact the
             subsequent titration of either CPAP therapy or Flowrest therapy (including
             amphetamines, high dose caffeine, etc.)

          -  Significant neurologic or cardiac pathology likely to seriously impact respiratory
             effort or ventilatory control (e.g., post CVA with ventilatory impairment)

          -  Presence of significant sleep disorders likely to induce hypersomnolence or interfere
             with the ability to titrate CPAP therapy or Flowrest therapy (including narcolepsy,
             PLMS/RLS, severe chronic insomnia, non-OSA obesity hypoventilation syndrome, etc.)

          -  Unsuitable for inclusion in the opinion of the investigators
