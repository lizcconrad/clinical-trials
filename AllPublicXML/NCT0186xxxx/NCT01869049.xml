      This project was undertaken by Qilu Hospital of Shandong University and other well-known
      hospitals in China. In order to report the alteration on the macrophage function in the
      spleen tissue of primary immune thrombocytopenia (ITP).

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  adult ITP patients whose platelet counts remain less than 10 x 10^9/L

          -  patients whose platelet counts remain less than 30 x 10^9/L and who continue to
             experience excessive bleeding after 4 to 6 weeks of appropriate medical treatment

          -  patients who have experienced a transient response to primary treatment and have
             platelet counts less than 30 x 10^9/L after 3 months

          -  require continuous glucocorticoid therapy to maintain safe platelet counts

          -  Willing and able to sign written informed consent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Received chemotherapy or anticoagulants or other drugs affecting the platelet counts
             within 3 months before the screening visit.

          -  Current HIV infection or hepatitis B virus or hepatitis C virus infections.

          -  Severe medical condition (lung, hepatic or renal disorder) other than chronic ITP.
             Unstable or uncontrolled disease or condition related to or impacting cardiac function
             (e.g., unstable angina, congestive heart failure, uncontrolled hypertension or cardiac
             arrhythmia)

          -  Female patients who are pregnant.

          -  Have a known diagnosis of other autoimmune diseases, established in the medical
             history and laboratory findings with positive results for the determination of
             antinuclear antibodies, anti-cardiolipin antibodies, lupus anticoagulant or direct
             Coombs test.

          -  Patients who are deemed unsuitable for the study by the investigator.
