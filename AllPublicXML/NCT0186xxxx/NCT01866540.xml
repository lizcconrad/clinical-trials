  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research during the last decade has focused on the kinetics of the systemic and local
      immune response to parenteral influenza vaccine in humans. The investigators have shown that
      normally high numbers of influenza specific antibody secreting cells (ASC) are present in the
      nasal mucosa of healthy adults but upon parenteral vaccination the numbers remain stable.
      However, a rapid transient increase in specific ASC is observed in the tonsils and peripheral
      blood after parenteral vaccination. In the tonsils, this is associated with a significant
      decrease in both naïve/effector (CD45RA+) and memory (CD45RO+) CD4+ cells upon vaccination.
      In this study the investigators will extend our work to investigate the characteristics of
      influenza-specific T- and B-cells induced locally and systemically after intranasal
      vaccination in man.

      The clinical trial will be an open study. All subjects eligible for tonsillectomy at
      Haukeland University Hospital within the specified age range (children: 2 to less than 18
      years old and adults &gt;18-59 years old) will receive an invitation to join the study. The
      primary endpoints of the trial are the evaluation of the systemic and local immune response
      after live attenuated influenza vaccine. The vaccine specific immune response will be
      assessed through the induction of specific local and systemic antibody and cellular immune
      responses, and analyses of the epitopes to which the response is directed. Furthermore the
      capacity of the vaccine to elicit cross reactive and long lasting immunity will be evaluated.
