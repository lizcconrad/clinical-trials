      Purpose: The aim of this study was to analyze the clinical and radiographic outcomes of 23
      edentulous jaws treated with 3D software planning, guided surgery, immediate loading and
      restored with Cad-Cam Zirconia and titanium full arch frameworks.

      Material &amp; methods: This study was designed as a prospective clinical trial. Twenty patients
      have been consecutively rehabilitated with an immediately loaded implant supported fixed full
      prosthesis. A total of 120 fixtures supporting 23 bridges (8 mandible, 15 maxilla) were
      placed , 22 of which in fresh post extraction sockets. All the implants were inserted with an
      insertion torque of 35/45 Ncm. 117 out of 120 implants were immediately loaded the other 3
      were delayed loaded.

      Outcome measures were implants survival, radiographic marginal bone-levels and bone
      remodeling, soft tissue parameters and complications.

    <description>This work was designed as a prospective case series clinical study. Twenty patients have been consecutively rehabilitated with an immediately loaded oral implant supported fixed full prosthesis. A total of 120 oral implants (Nobel Replace Tapered Groovy; Nobel Biocare AB, Goteborg, Sweden) supporting 23 bridges (8 mandible, 15 maxilla) were placed , 22 of which in fresh post extraction sockets. 117 out of 120 oral implants were immediately loaded.</description>
