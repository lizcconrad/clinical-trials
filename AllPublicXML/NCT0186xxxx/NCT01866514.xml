  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This will be a prospective, non-controlled study using healthy adult volunteers as subjects
      receiving bilateral proximal humerus intraosseous (IO) vascular access to evaluate the
      insertion technique and IO infusion flow rates.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      When using IO access in the perioperative and OR settings, abduction of the arms to the
      shoulder level prevents use of the traditional proximal humerus insertion site due to the
      rotation of the humeral head under the acromion process. An alternate proximal humerus IO
      insertion technique has been developed to meet the needs of anesthesia patient positioning
      that uses a slightly more distal insertion site and a superior angle of insertion. However
      infusion flow rate in the proximal humerus using the anesthesia technique has not been
      measured. This study is needed to evaluate the anesthesia proximal humerus IO insertion
      technique to determine if the IO infusion flow rates remain unchanged by the alternate
      method.

    <description>The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the infusion flow rates attainable when using the anesthesia approach to establish proximal humerus IO vascular access.
The primary endpoints will be the infusion flow rate obtained at each tested infusion pressure, including gravity, 100 mmHg, 200 mmHg, and 300 mmHg.</description>

    <intervention_name>proximal humerus intraosseous vascular access</intervention_name>
    <description>The arm receiving the IO needle is positioned with the arm abducted to shoulder level (in position required for surgery), with the arm rotated inward, into the optimal position, with the palms faced down. Deeply palpate the humerus until the junction of the humeral shaft and the humeral head, the surgical neck is identified; the insertion site is in the surgical neck. With the 45mm IO needle placed perpendicular to the plane of the skin, the IO needle is inserted into the surgical neck using a slightly superior angle of insertion and the needle is inserted to the hub. The stylet will be removed and an EZ-Connect primed with 2% preservative-free lidocaine will be attached to the catheter hub. Aspirate return will be attempted to confirm needle placement within the medullary cavity.</description>
