    <textblock>
      Record the renal resistive index and hemodynamic parameters ( record the cardiac output and
      stroke volume if the patient's next to kin agree to undertake a PiCCO monitoring ) before and
      after resuscitation for severe sepsis or septic shock patients, to determine whether the
      changes of resistive index or hemodynamic parameters, especially the cardiac output can be a
      better parameter to predict AKI

      -  Purpose: To examine whether the resuscitation-induced changes of renal resistive index
           or hemodynamic parameters has the superiority as a valid tool to evaluate the renal
           perfusion improvement and whether the changes can better predict AKI occurrence in
           severe sepsis or septic shock patients.

        -  Methods: Measure the renal resistive index and take record of hemodynamic parameters
           (use a PiCCO monitoring to measure cardiac output if the patient's next to kin agree to
           undertake such a catheter ) before and after successful resuscitation for severe sepsis
           or septic shock patients, followup to determine the occurrence of AKI and mortality.

        -  Hypothesis: The changes of resistive index or cardiac output during shock resuscitation
           may be a better parameter to evaluate renal perfusion and predict AKI, and may have a
           better value to guide renal protective therapy in septic shock.

    <description>eGFR when enrolled and 6 hours after enrollment.The 2012 SSC guideline for severe sepsis and septic shock recommend to achieve some six-hour resuscitation goals.So we collect 5ml blood and 2 hrs urine when enrolled(at this time, initiate large amount of fluid resuscitation,which is so called &quot;before resuscitation&quot;). At 6hrs after enrolled,collect another 5ml blood and 2 hrs urine.Glomerular filtration rate (GFR) describes the flow rate of filtered fluid through the kidney. eGFR is Creatinine-based approximations of GFR. We project to use the &quot;Urine Creatinine concentration×Urine Flow Rate/Plasma Creatinine Concentration&quot; formula to calculate the eGFR (collected two hours urine, and examine the plasma and urine creatinine in the middle of the two hours). The lowest plasma creatinine value in the 3 months preceding inclusion was taken as the baseline value, therefore use the value to calculate baseline eGFR by CKD-EPI formula.</description>
