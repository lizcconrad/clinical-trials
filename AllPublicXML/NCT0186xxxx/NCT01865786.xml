    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, observational study to describe pregnancy outcomes among HIV-1
      uninfected pregnant women who are taking emtricitabine (FTC)/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate
      (TDF) (TruvadaÂ®) for a pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) indication nested in the
      Antiretroviral Pregnancy Registry (APR).

      Information on subjects is provided to the APR prospectively (prior to the outcome of the
      pregnancy being known) through their healthcare provider, with follow-up obtained from the
      healthcare provider following determination of the pregnancy outcome.

    <description>The study has one target prospective cohort defined as HIV-1 negative women who had been prescribed FTC/TDF for pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP); with two strata: a) those who continue to take FTC/TDF for PrEP during their pregnancy, and b) those who decide to stop FTC/TDF for PrEP during pregnancy.</description>

    <description>The study has one comparison cohort defined as HIV-positive women who were on any antiretroviral (ARV) medication at the time the pregnancy was detected. This is a propensity score matched retrospective cohort selected from the prospective arm of the APR. This cohort is assembled retrospectively in order to appropriately match the subjects by calendar time and the correlates of exposure, with exposure being defined as being on FTC/TDF for PrEP vs being exposed to other ARVs.</description>

        Number of Subjects and Subject Selection: 400 HIV-1 uninfected women who are exposed to
        FTC/TDF for PrEP during pregnancy stratified into 200 who decide to continue and 200 who
        choose to discontinue FTC/TDF for PrEP. A propensity score-matched comparison group of
        equal size (400 women) of HIV-positive pregnant women taking antiretrovirals.

        All evaluable subjects enrolled into the APR who fulfill the inclusion criteria for the
        target cohort will be selected. Every year at the time of building the annual report for
        this study, a propensity score matched comparison group will be selected on a 1:1 ratio
        among all pregnant women on antiretrovirals.
