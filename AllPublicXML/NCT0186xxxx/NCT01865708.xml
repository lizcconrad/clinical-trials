      Hypothesis 1: Blood alcohol concentration will be &lt;25 mg/100ml (equivalent to a blood alcohol
      concentration of &lt;0.025%) after a 1 hour urinary catheter ethanol lock.

      Hypothesis 2: Daily urinary catheter ethanol locks will not result in increased hematuria or
      increased urinary white cells.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study involves a confirmatory/refuting approach to the above stated hypothesis. The
      investigators will test this hypothesis by addressing the following aims/objectives:

      Specific Aim 1:

      Quantify blood alcohol levels after a 1 hour 74% ethanol lock in urinary catheters utilized
      in the Pediatric Intensive Care Unit.

      Specific Aim 2:

      Compare cellular components in urinalyses after the introduction of the ethanol locks.

      Potential study subjects will be recruited from the Children's Healthcare of Atlanta -
      Egleston Pediatric Intensive Care Unit. Children that are anticipated to have an indwelling
      urinary catheter for &gt;48 hours will be included. For this pilot study, the investigators will
      enroll 10 patients. Subject ages will range from 6 months to 17 years. Children who are on a
      service other than Critical Care Medicine will have clearance from the primary team prior to
      approaching for enrollment. The consent process will take place prior to or during the
      initial 24 hours of urinary catheter placement.

    <description>Ethanol lock, utilizing 74% ethanol, will begin within 24 hours of urinary catheter placement. The lock will be done every 24 hours for 1 hour. The volume that will be instilled depends upon the fill volume of the catheter, which is imprinted by the manufacturer on each catheter. Once the alcohol is in the catheter, the proximal end of the catheter will be clamped for 1 hour. After the 1 hour dwell time, the clamp will be removed and the alcohol in the lumen of the catheter will be flushed out by the patient's own urine output.</description>

          <title>Ethanol Lock</title>
          <description>74% Ethanol lock will begin within 24 hours of urinary catheter placement. Lock will be done every 24 hours for 1 hour. The volume that will be instilled depends upon the fill volume of the catheter, which is imprinted by the manufacturer on each catheter. Once the alcohol is in the catheter, the proximal end of the catheter will be clamped for 1 hour. After 1 hour dwell time, the clamp will be removed and catheter will be flushed out by the patient's own urine output.</description>
