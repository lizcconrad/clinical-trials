  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Since 2009, Kaohsiung Medical University Hospital organized a medical team to provide the
      medical service for people in Solomon Islands thru Taiwan Health Center at the local. In
      addition to Malaria and pulmonary tuberculosis, the investigators also found dengue virus,
      Japanese Encephalitis virus, Chikungunya virus infections and intestinal parasitic infections
      might be the existing but overlooked and neglected medical issues in Solomon Islands. These
      infections show similarity in clinical manifestations and usually difficulty in clinical
      diagnosis, instead these infections rely on the laboratory identification with good
      laboratory quality and facility.

      In this study, the investigators plan to investigate the local people, either from the
      community or the hospitals, to identify the prevalence and incidence of dengue fever,
      including laboratory identification of related infections for differential diagnosis,
      including Japanese Encephalitis virus, Chikungunya virus and intestinal parasitic infections.
      Intestinal parasite survey has been the routine long-term service offered by the Kaohsiung
      Medical University Hospital in Solomon Islands. At the same time, the subjects enrolled in
      this study will also be asked the common medical illness in Solomon Islands (i.e. malaria,
      pulmonary tuberculosis and metabolic syndrome etc.) in order to delineate the association of
      dengue fever and these acute and chronic illness.
