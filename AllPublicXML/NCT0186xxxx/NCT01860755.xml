    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the effects of a combined physiotherapy treatment
      (including vestibular rehabilitation and treatment for the cervical spine) in youth and young
      adults with ongoing symptoms of dizziness, neck pain and headaches following a sport-related
      concussion.

    <description>Clinical test using a laser pointer affixed to a head piece on top of the head that is projected onto a bull's eye target. Subject rotates head to left, right (rotation) or up (extension) to the maximum comfortable range and relocates to the perceived point of neutral head position with eyes closed. A measures from the centre of the bull's eye is recorded. A mean of three trials is recorded for each direction.</description>
