      This is a study to determine whether testing for HIV together as a couple, as opposed to
      testing separately, in acceptable to men in male couples, and is a safe prevention service.
      Testing of couples together has been provided for decades in Africa, but has never been
      tested in the United States. In this study, male couples will be enrolled and randomly
      assigned to be tested together in the same room, or separately. At the time of testing,
      investigators will ask questions about how they felt about the service they received. Three
      months later, investigators will survey the men again, and determine whether they had any
      problems after the testing, like violence in the relationship or the relationship breaking
      up. The main outcomes are being satisfied with the testing service, and safety (lack of
      intimate partner violence or relationship termination). Although the study is not designed to
      determine if the service reduces risk behaviors for HIV transmission, investigators will
      examine data on risks just to explore that topic. The main hypotheses are: (1) men will be at
      least as satisfied with couples testing as they are with individual testing; and (2) men
      tested as couples will not experience higher rates of intimate partner violence or
      relationship dissolution, relative to men tested separately.
