      Primary Objective:

      To measure the effect of Teriflunomide on lymphocytes subsets in patients with relapsing
      forms of multiple sclerosis as compared with baseline values and those of a reference
      population of untreated healthy subjects.

      Secondary Objectives:

      To assess if Teriflunomide treatment results in biased T cell clonal diversity. To assess the
      effect of Teriflunomide on the function of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (proliferation
      and cytokine production in situ).

      To assess the circulating cytokines profile in the serum of Relapsing Multiple Sclerosis
      (RMS) patients during a 24-week treatment versus baseline and healthy controls.

      To assess the reversibility of all parameter changes in patients who discontinue treatment
      after accelerated elimination procedure with cholestyramine or activated charcoal.

      The duration of the study for patients is 32 weeks which includes 4 weeks for screening, 24
      weeks for treatment and 4 weeks for follow-up. An extension of the study is proposed until
      Teriflunomide is commercially available in the country where patient lives.

      The duration of the study for healthy volunteers is 25 weeks which includes only one week for
      screening.

        Inclusion criteria:

        Patients (male and female) with relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis meeting McDonald
        criteria for MS at the screening visit and having either one of the following treatment
        status:

          -  Naïve to disease modifying (DM) treatment or no DM treatment for more than 2 years

          -  Or currently (not more than 3 months interruption) on MS therapy with IFN β-1 or
             Glatiramer acetate and a period of at least 2 weeks without IFN β-1 or Glatiramer
             acetate before switching to teriflunomide.

        Male and female patients, between 18 and 56 years of age, exclusive.
