  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Neck pain is a prevalent musculoskeletal dysfunction. Studies point that individuals with
      chronic pain have metabolic, vascular and electromyographic changes in trapezius muscle.
      Moreover, a common clinical sign in this muscle in subjects with neck pain is the presence of
      myofascial trigger points. These are related to the sensory, motor and autonomic changes,
      being defined as palpable nodules located in the taut band of skeletal muscle. In this
      context, the focus on treatment modalities stands out in the literature, however, other
      resources commonly used in clinical practice still lack scientific evidence. Therefore, the
      aim of this project is to evaluate the effectiveness of physiotherapy resources in the
      treatment of myofascial trigger points in the trapezius muscle of patients with neck pain.
      For such, volunteers with neck pain for more than 90 days, of both genders, aged between 18
      and 59 years and bilateral myofascial trigger points in the upper trapezius will be
      randomized into the following groups: group 1 (kinesiotherapy, n = 20), group 2
      (kinesiotherapy + static ultrasound, n = 20), group 3 (kinesiotherapy + diadynamic currents,
      n = 20) and group 4 (untreated control, n = 20). Volunteers will undergo ten sessions of
      treatment, being realized the following evaluations: surface electromyography, infrared
      thermography, numerical scale of pain assessment, algometry, Neck Disability Index and skin
      impedance. For data analysis, normality test will used to verify the data distribution and
      consistent statistical test for the appropriate comparisons within and between groups, and
      thus considered two factors in the comparisons, time and group. Will adopt a significance
      level of 5%.

    <description>The volunteer will be subjected to the following protocol: cervical traction, 3 sets of 1 minute, 30-second rest between sets; mobilization grade III postero-anterior on the spines processes of vertebrae C2 to C7, 10 oscillations for each vertebrae; myofascial release of the upper trapezius muscle, 3 sets of 1 minute for each side; static stretching of the upper trapezius muscle, 3 sets of 30 seconds, with an interval of 10 seconds between sets.</description>

    <description>Same protocol group kinesiotherapy + diadynamic currents, with negative electrode (7.0 x 7.0 cm) placed on the myofascial trigger point, while the positive electrode (7.0 x 7.0 cm) is placed between the shoulder blades. Will apply 4 minutes from the biphasic mode (DF) and 6-minute short period (CP), the first of which intesidade the sensory threshold and the second threshold motor, both bearable for the patient.</description>
