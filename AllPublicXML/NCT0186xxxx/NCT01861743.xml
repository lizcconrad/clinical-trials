  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Most patients undergoing surgery experience significant post-operative pain. Inadequate
      peri-operative pain management may decrease post-operative mobilization and increase length
      of hospitalization. Additionally, poorly managed acute post-operative pain analgesia is
      associated with an increased risk of developing chronic pain and delayed wound healing.

      Lumbar spine surgery is particularly painful, often requiring a multi-day hospitalization.
      The most common post-operative analgesia used in spine surgery is narcotic medication
      delivered via an intravenous patient controlled analgesia (IV PCA).

      A multimodal peri-operative pain management protocol for spine surgery has the potential to
      not only decrease pain but also to improve recovery, decrease narcotic consumption, decrease
      length of stay in the hospital and reduce both direct and indirect hospital costs.

      The purpose of this study is to determine if post-operative pain and rate of recovery are
      improved in patients undergoing spine surgery using MMA compared to usual analgesic care.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      We hypothesize patients undergoing spinal fusion who receive peri-operative MMA will have:

        1. decreased post-operative pain compared to patients receiving usual care for pain
           management.

        2. shorter hospital LOS compared to patients receiving usual care pain management.

        3. fewer analgesic-related post-operative complications (urinary retention, ileus, etc)
           compared to patients receiving usual care pain management.

        4. improved physical functioning at the time of hospital discharge compared to patients
           receiving usual care pain management.

        5. better short and long term outcomes. Subjects will be randomized to MMA (Group 1) or
           usual care (Group 2). The unit of randomization will be a week (Monday through Sunday).
           Each week will randomly be assigned to MMA or usual care. Subjects who are hospitalized
           into a consecutive week will continue with the pain regimen they were assigned upon
           hospitalization.

    <description>(a) While in the hospital, patients' pain is assessed by a nurse-driven protocol. Assessments are every four to six hours, within 60 minutes after receiving an intravenous pain medication and within 90 minutes of receiving an oral pain medication. This assessment includes rating subjective rating of ones pain on a verbal numeric rating scale (NRS) of 0-10. The maximum pain score for each post-operative day will be compared.</description>
