  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The World Health Organization (WHO) defines palliative care as an approach to improve the
      quality of life of patients and their families facing life-threatening illness, through
      prevention and relief of pain and of physical, psychosocial and spiritual problems. The WHO
      stresses that palliative care is applicable early in the course of the illness together with
      other therapies that are intended to cure or prolong life, such as chemotherapy or radiation
      therapy. For the benefit of the patient, palliative care is however often given (too) late in
      the course of the disease of incurably ill patients.

      The aim of our study is to measure the effect of interventional palliative care on quality of
      life, mood and end-of-life care of patients with advanced cancer and their families. These
      patients have a limited life expectancy and a high symptom burden, this leads us to suggest
      that these patients may be benefited with palliative care soon after diagnosis of metastatic
      disease (interventional palliative care).

      The research design of this study is a randomized controlled trial with, on the one hand, an
      intervention group in which patients and their families receive interventional palliative
      care in combination with standard cancer care and on the other hand a control group in which
      patients and their families receive only standard oncologic care. Participants in the
      intervention group will meet the palliative support team shortly after diagnosis. Afterwards,
      the palliative support will meet them at least once a month. This intervention focuses on
      topics such illness understanding, symptom management, decision making and coping with the
      disease. Participants in the control group will only meet with the palliative support team at
      the patient's own request or after referral by the oncologist or the nursing staff.
