  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators would like to determine if there are patients with PPI responsive
      Eosinophilic Esophagitis Infiltration that have significant loss of esophageal distensibility
      suggestive of esophageal fibrosis typical of classic Eosniophilic Esophagitis.

      If this group of patients exists, the investigators would like to determine if they have the
      typical endoscopic features of EoE rather than those of GERD.

    <measure>Abnormal esophageal distensibility in patients with PPI responsive Eosinophilic Infiltrates to patients with Eosionophilic esophagitis and Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease.</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>We will evaluate endoscopic features of Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease(GERD) by reviewing endoscopic reports and images. The presence of esophageal narrowing, furrows, rings, fragility, and white spots will be noted form the endoscopic reports prior to the initiation of the Provation report system. We will review the endoscopic reports and the endoscopic photographs on those patients evaluated after the Provation report system was initiated. All images will be reviewed by one investigator unaware of the subjects clinical data and name</description>

    <measure>The relationship of abnormal esophageal distensibility to other endoscopic findings of EoE (furrows, rings, fragility, stricture)</measure>

The presence of esophageal narrowing, furrows, rings, fragility, and white spots will be noted form the endoscopic reports prior to the initiation of the Provation report system.

  <arm_group>

    <description>We will recruit 20 patients with GERD without dysphagia for an esophageal barium xray for esophageal diameter measurements.
The 20 Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease (GERD) patients will complete the Mayo Dysphagia Questionnaire 30-day and the Eosinophilic Esophagitis Actitivy Index (EEsAI) questionnaires</description>

    <description>â€¢Fast for 4 hours prior to the Esophagram (upper GI x-ray). You will drink a liquid that has barium or another contrast agent in it. The radiologist will use the X-ray machine to look at your upper GI tract while you drink the contrast liquid. The x-ray exam should take between 10-15 minutes.
We will have patients complete the Mayo Dysphasia Questionnaire-30 day.</description>
