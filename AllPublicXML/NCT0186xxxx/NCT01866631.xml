      The investigators hypothesise that the research data will enable them to elucidate local

        To retropsectively review the NCIS registry of females diagnosed with breast cancer in
        years 2002 to 2008 with regards to clinical quality indicators as published by the European
        Sociaty of Breast Cancer Oncologists (Eur J Can 2010; 46:2344-2356). We will extract data
        from a pre-existing breast cancer registry which belongs to NCIS, looking at data which
        includes the following:(1) Completeness of clinical and imaging diagnostic work-up(2)
        Completeness of prognostic and predictive characterization(3) Multidisciplinary
        discussion(4) Appropriate surgical approach(5) Appropriate post-operative radiation(6)
        Avoidance of over-treatment(7) Appropraiet hormonal therapy(8) Appropriate chemotherapy and
        other medical therapy(9) Staging, counselling, follow-up and rehabilitative procedures
