  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A randomized control trial investigating if an early intervention program of modified
      Constraint Induced Movement Therapy for babies, Baby-CIMT, performed before 12 months of age
      will improve hand function in children with risk for developing cerebral palsy.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators hypothesis is that Baby-CIMT including intensive specific task oriented
      training is more preferable than general stimulation which is the assumption for baby massage
      used in the control group. The intervention protocol is developed at Astrid Lindgren Children
      hospital, Stockholm Sweden.

    <description>Baby-CIMT is a very much modified model of constraint induced movement therapy for infants. It is developed to suit small children and their needs of stimulation. The infant should wear a comfortable glove on the less affected hand, while stimulating the use of the affected hand 30 minutes per day during 2 periods of 6-weeks training before 12 month. The hand training provides the baby with amusing and easily handled toys.</description>
