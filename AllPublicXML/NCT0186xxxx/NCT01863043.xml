  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this study is to determine nutrition outcomes and risks to
      gastrointestinal integrity and function of aspirating for routine gastric contents prior to
      each feeding in very low birth weight premature infants.

      The participants in the study will be randomly assigned (like the flip of a coin) to either
      have the leftover food in their stomach removed before each feeding, or not have the leftover
      food removed before each feeding. In addition, when a blood drawn is performed as regular
      care an extra amount with be taken. A test to determine how much of the hormones gastrin and
      motilin are contained in the blood will be performed. Stool samples will be collected.
      Participation could last up to approximately 6 to 8 weeks of age.
