  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) complicates 5 to 30 % of pregnancies. GDM is defined as
      hyperglycemia with onset or first recognition during pregnancy. Because it is a forerunner of
      type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), professional associations recommend T2DM postpartum
      screening (T2DM-pPS) at 6 weeks/6 months post delivery, using a 75g oral glucose tolerance
      test (OGTT).

      However, less than a quarter of these women are screened. This recommendation has failed for
      multiple reasons; the most important being that busy new mothers must deal with the major
      inconveniences of returning to a sampling center for a 2h testing session, bringing baby
      along or paying for a sitter, transportation, parking… A mother-friendly solution is direly
      needed.

      The investigators hypothesize that, in these women, results of an OGTT performed after
      delivery on the last day of their hospital stay (OGTT-1) will predict results of the
      recommended OGTT (OGTT-2) at 6 weeks/6 months postpartum.

      The main aim of our project is to determine the optimal cut-off value for the 2h glucose
      result during OGTT-1 in order to predict abnormal glucose tolerance status at OGTT-2 (the
      gold standard), in the same woman.
