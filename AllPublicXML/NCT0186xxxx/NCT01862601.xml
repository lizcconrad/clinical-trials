      This research study is being done to see how well the JetTouch Needle-Free Endoscopic
      Injection System is able to deliver a solution safely into the bladder wall. The JetTouch
      Needle-Free Endoscopic Injection System is a jet injector that allows fluids to be injected
      into the bladder without using a needle. It is hoped that this method will provide a reliable
      and consistent method to deliver drugs into the bladder wall.
