    <textblock>
      Injectable anesthesics previous to subgingival scaling and root planing (SRP) presents some
      disadvantages like fear of the needle insertion, long-lasting effect and prolonged dampening
      of adjacent tissues. This study will compare the intrapocket anesthetic effectiveness of a
      skin topical anesthesic EMLA with intrapocket 2% benzocaine, intrapocket placebo and
      injectable anaesthesia for SRP in a Split-mouth, double-blind, clinical trial study.

      Objective: The aim of this study was to compare the effect of a eutectic mixture containing
      25 mg/g of lidocaine and 25 mg/g of prilocaine (EMLA®) with injectable 2% lidocaine, topical
      benzocaine, and 2% placebo for reducing pain during subgingival scaling and root planing
      (SRP) procedures.

      Methods: Thirty-two patients were enrolled in this split-mouth, double-blind randomized
      clinical trial. Patients were randomized to a sequence of four anesthetics: 25 mg/g lidocaine
      and 25 mg/g of 5% prilocaine (EMLA®), injectable 2% lidocaine, topical 2% benzocaine, or
      placebo. Pain and discomfort were measured using a Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) and Verbal
      Scale (VS). Patient satisfaction with anesthesia was also determined at the end of each
      treatment session.

    <time_frame>For each tooth was evaluated intraoperative pain using the Visual Analog Scale (5 minutes after the start of the instrumentation) and postoperative immediately after instrumentation. At the end of the procedure, was asked Verbal Scale, for 4 weeks.</time_frame>
    <description>For each experimental tooth, the patient was asked to indicate the intensity of pain and discomfort experienced intraoperatively using the VAS (VAStrans) (5 minutes after the start of the instrumentation in each tooth) and postoperatively (VASpost) immediately after the end of instrumentation of the respective tooth. At the end of the procedure, the patient was asked to also describe the pain sensation of the tooth using VS as: no pain (0), mild pain (1), moderate pain (2), severe pain (3), or extremely severe pain (4).</description>

    <description>Percentage of subjects injectable anesthesia requirements in different anesthetic groups. In case of occurrence of pain during the subgingival SRP, an additional dose of the same anesthesic was repeated.
