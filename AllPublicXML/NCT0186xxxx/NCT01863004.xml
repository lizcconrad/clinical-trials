    <textblock>
      Dysferlin is a protein with an important role in the repair of muscle surface membranes.
      Mutations in dysferlin cause different forms of muscular dystrophies. Dysferlinopathies are
      inherited in an autosomal recessive manner, and many patients with this disease harbor
      mis-sense mutations in at least one of their two pathogenic DYSF alleles. These patients have
      significantly reduced or absent dysferlin levels in skeletal muscle, suggesting that
      dysferlin encoded by mis-sense alleles is rapidly degraded by the cell's quality-control
      system. In a series of in-vitro experiments we showed that mis-sense mutated dysferlin can be
      salvaged from degradation by proteasomal inhibition. This resulted in an increase of
      functional dysferlin protein and a subsequent repair of plasma membranes of cultured
      patient-derived muscle cells. In this proof-of-concept study we would like to test wether
      proteasomal inhibition can salvage mis-sense mutated dysferlin in patients harboring certain
      dysferlin mis-sense mutations.

    <description>This study tests whether salvage of mis-sense mutated dysferlin through proteasomal inhibition seen in cultured muscle cells can be translated into patients harboring dysferlin mis-sense mutations. The proteasomal inhibitor Bortezomib (Velcade®) is already approved as a medication for the treatment of multiple myeloma in Switzerland and in other countries.
Following an administration of a single dose of Bortezomib repeated needle muscle biopsies and blood draws will be performed to assess dysferlin levels in skeletal muscle and blood monocytes over a five day period.</description>
