  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether multiple ports improve the analgesic
      efficacy of flexible catheters used for the provision of epidural analgesia during the entire
      continuum of labor and delivery
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Multiport catheters, when compared to uniport catheters, have been associated with better
      analgesic quality during labor epidural analgesia because the presence of more than one port
      may enhance the distribution of epidural medication

      Flexible catheters, when compared to rigid catheters, have been associated with better
      analgesic quality during labor epidural analgesia because greater flexibility may minimize
      catheter deviation in the epidural space, facilitate more optimal catheter placement in the
      epidural space, and result in better distribution of epidural medication

      It is unknown whether multiple ports, which promote better distribution of epidural
      medication, provide added analgesic benefit to flexible catheters, which also facilitate
      better distribution of epidural medication, when used for the provision of epidural analgesia
      during labor and delivery
