      To evaluate the tolerability, acceptability and potential effect size of the efficacy of 4
      months of atomoxetine treatment for patients with co-occurring ATS and heroin dependence
      (COATS) receiving buprenorphine maintenance treatment (BMT) and educational drug and HIV risk
      reduction counseling (EDRC).

      The Specific Aims of the proposed study are:

        1. To evaluate the tolerability, acceptability and potential effect size of the efficacy of
           4 months of atomoxetine treatment for patients with co-occurring ATS and heroin
           dependence (COATS) receiving buprenorphine maintenance treatment (BMT) and educational
           drug and HIV risk reduction counseling (EDRC).

        2. To better characterize patients with co-occurring ATS and heroin dependence (with regard
           to disturbances of mood, impulse control, executive functioning and patterns of drug use
           during MMT) and to evaluate the effects of atomoxetine on mood, impulsivity, and
           executive functioning (including attention, concentration, memory, and decision-making
           characteristics).

        3. To provide training in drug abuse treatment, HIV prevention and treatment, and drug
           abuse clinical research to drug abuse clinical researchers and clinicians in Kota Bharu,
           Malaysia.

             medical tests (CBC, chemistries, liver enzymes, HIV and Hepatitis B and C, EKG, chest
             x-ray), takes a medical history, and performs a physical examination in order to
             confirm the patient's eligibility for the study.
