  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test whether or not the 4 Pillars Toolkit increases adult
      Influenza, pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (PPSV), tetanus, adult diphtheria and
      acellular pertussis vaccine (Tdap/Td) vaccination rates. The vaccines are all FDA licensed
      vaccines and to be used according to national guidelines. The investigators will conduct a
      randomized cluster trial of this toolkit in diverse primary care practice with electronic
      medical records (EMRs).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This intervention is a two-region, two-year, stratified randomized cluster trial in 24
      primary care practices with EMRs. These practices will be randomly assigned to be
      intervention or control sites to test this 4 Pillars Toolkit intervention package of
      evidence-based techniques tailored to their practice structure and culture; one set of
      practices randomized to intervention in year 1 and the other to control. In year 2, the other
      set of practices will receive the intervention and community controls may be sought.

      These diverse practices consist of: 18 diverse practices from UPMC in western Pennsylvania
      and 6 diverse practices from large community health centers in a PBRN in Texas.

Baseline period was 6/1/2012 to 5/31/2013 (Tdap, PCV) and 8/1/2012 to 1/31/2013 (influenza), Year 1 period (which was the randomized controlled cluster trial) was 6/1/2013 to 5/31/2014 and Year 2 (a pre-post study) was 6/1/2014 to 1/31/2015.
Year 1 RCCT Study: Intervention sites were Pittsburgh practices who actively utilized the 4 Pillars Practice Transformation Program during Year 1 to promote increases in adult vaccination rates (N=10).
Year 2 Pre-post study: Year 2 Pittsburgh practices were control sites from Year 1 (N=8) who now were actively engaged in the intervention and Year 1 sites who continued active use of the intervention during year 2 (N=4) to increase adult vaccination rates.</description>
