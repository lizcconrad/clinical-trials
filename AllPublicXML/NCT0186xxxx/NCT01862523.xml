  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Capsaicin nasal spray is used in daily practice against IR without knowledge about the exact
      mechanisms involved in this treatment. Therefore, this study aims to address this issue by
      studying the functional (electrophysiologic) changes after specific stimulations in IR
      patients and healthy controls before and after capsaicin/placebo treatment.

    <textblock>
      As an essential step towards the improvement of the treatment of IR we will investigate the
      neural mechanisms underlying the therapeutic action of capsaicin. In particular, we plan to
      evaluate the effects of capsaicin on the functional properties of the innervation of nasal
      mucosa by monitoring the trigeminal nerve activity using measurements of negative mucosa
      potentials (NMP). NMPs, will be evoked by chemical and thermal stimuli in IR patients and
      healthy controls. Considering the evidence suggesting a role of sensory C-fibers in the
      pathophysiology of IR, we will employ low concentrations of irritants that specifically
      activate receptors expressed in those fibers, i.e., capsaicin for TRPV1 and cinnamaldehyde
      and allyl-isothiocyanate (mustard oil) for TRPA1. The same stimulations will be performed
      immediately after capsaicin treatment, and after 4 weeks, 3 months and 6 months. This will
      allow for an objective assessment of the functionality of the C-fiber innervation before the
      treatment, during the phase of therapeutic response and during the period of recurrence of
      the IR symptoms. The results of the NMP measurements will be contrasted with the therapeutic
      response and with evaluations of nasal congestion, nasal sensitivity and the presence of
      neuro-mediators found in nasal biopsies. Importantly, the independent assessment of the NMP
      responses mediated by either TRPV1 or TRPA1 will allow determining the specific role of these
      nociceptors in the pathophysiology of IR, which, in turn, may help to design more specific
      and effective therapies.
