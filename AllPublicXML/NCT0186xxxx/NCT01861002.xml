  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase I study with a conditional cohort expansion phase to evaluate the feasibility
      of, and to obtain preliminary efficacy data about, pretreatment with Azacytidine (AZA) for 5
      days followed by fludarabine/cytarabine chemotherapy regimen in pediatric acute myeloid
      leukemia (AML) and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) patients who are refractory to primary
      treatment or who relapsed.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Growing evidence indicates that aberrant DNA hypermethylation is associated with leukemia
      development, drug resistance, and relapse. It has been shown that pretreating leukemia cells
      with AZA or decitabine could partially reverse the aberrant DNA methylation, restore the
      expression of tumor suppressor gene important for apoptosis, and sensitize cells to
      subsequent killing by cytotoxic agent. Since cytarabine and decitabine share the same
      mechanisms of resistance, we use AZA to test the novel epigenetic &quot;priming&quot; approach. This is
      a phase I clinical study with expansion phase, using hypomethylating agent, 5-azacytidine
      (AZA), in sequential with chemotherapy to evaluate whether epigenetic &quot;priming&quot; can reverse
      aberrant DNA methylation, overcome drug resistance, and increase response in
      relapsed/refractory AML.

      The chemotherapy regimen to be used in this study is fludarabine and cytarabine. This regimen
      has substantial activity in leukemia and has been widely used in treating pediatric patients
      with relapsed/refractory AML and ALL in the past several decades47. In BFM relapsed AML
      2001/01 study, FLAG (fludarabine, cytarabine and G-CSF) chemotherapy regimen showed
      significant activity in AML with 4 year OS around 36%.47 Since the use of G-CSF in
      conjunction with fludarabine/cytarabine didn't improve the overall survival of patient in a
      randomized trial48, only fludarabine and cytarabine will be used in this study to decrease
      the incidence of leukocytosis related complications. This regimen is very similar to the
      chemotherapy regimen proposed for the next relapsed AML trial within the Children's Oncology
      Group (COG). If this trial proves to be safe and active, it will provide the foundation and
      smooth transition to larger statistically powered nationwide phase II clinical trials by COG.

        Patients will be excluded if there is a plan to administer non-protocol chemotherapy,
        radiation therapy, or immunotherapy during the study period.

        Patients will be excluded if they have significant concurrent disease, illness, psychiatric
        disorder or social issue that would compromise patient safety or compliance with the
        protocol treatment or procedures, interfere with consent, study participation, follow up,
        or interpretation of study results.

        Patients with Down syndrome and DNA fragility syndromes (such as Fanconi anemia, Bloom
        syndrome) are excluded.
