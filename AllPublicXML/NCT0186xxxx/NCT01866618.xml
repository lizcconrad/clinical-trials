  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Natural IVF study patients will undergo an IVF cycle with trigger shots of Lupron &amp; hCG.
      Patients will not be given any other stimulating medications during the cycle. They will have
      2 uterine aspirations and an endometrial biopsy at designated times. The first uterine
      aspiration will be randomized to one of four days (day before retrieval, day of retrieval,
      day after retrieval or 2 days after retrieval). The second uterine aspiration and endometrial
      biopsy will be performed 6 days after retrieval. Any embryo(s) obtained will be biopsied for
      Comprehensive Chromosome Screening (CCS) and frozen for use in a subsequent thaw cycle.

    <description>To examine the endometrium within the natural cycle in order to accurately characterize the differences in multiple aspects of endocrine and paracrine hormonal activity, the transcriptome of cells influencing oocyte maturation and changes in the endometrium.</description>

    <measure>Temporal Embryonic Development</measure>
    <time_frame>1 Year</time_frame>
    <description>To examine the parameters of temporal embryonic development and the transcriptome of granulosa cells and follicular fluid. The embryos will be graded at standard time points to determine whether there are differences in in vitro development. Granulosa cells and follicular fluid will undergo gene expression analysis and compared to the gene expression profiles found in those specimens in stimulated cycles.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Ovulatory cycles every 39 days or less (natural cycle IVF cannot be performed in
             someone who does not have cycles)

          -  Must be RMANJ patient and have completed all diagnostic screening at one of our RMANJ
             locations. All diagnostic screening is NOT covered under the study and must be
             completed prior to being allowed to start the study cycle.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Prior enrollment/attempt in this study

          -  Requirement for surgical sperm extraction

          -  Inability to assess ovaries via transvaginal ultrasound

          -  Inability to tolerate vaginal examination
