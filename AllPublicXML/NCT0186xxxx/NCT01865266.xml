  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) is an important cause of morbidity and mortality in
      ventilated critically ill patients specially in intensive care unit (ICU). It is associated
      with an increased duration of mechanical ventilation, high death rates and increased
      healthcare costs in the development country.

      Although VAP is preventable and many practices have been demonstrated to reduce the incidence
      of this disease, the morbidity is still so high. VAP is hard to cure and the mortality is
      about to 40% which was reported in China in 2004. If the bacteria of
      multidrug-resistance(MDR) is isolated, the mortality can increase to 70%. So much more
      methods should be needed in treating VAP in addition to using antibiotics.

      Ulinastatin is a serine protease inhibitor with a molecular weight of 67,000 found in healthy
      human urine. It is used worldwide for patients with inflammatory disorders, including
      disseminated intravascular coagulation(DIC),shock, and pancreatitis . Furthermore,
      ulinastatin administration can help reduce sepsis, prevent multiple organ dysfunction, and
      modulate immune functions.

      Actually, three studies have showed that ulinastatin treatment is associated with reduced the
      levels of inflammatory factors in blood serum in patients with acute respiratory distress
      syndrome(ARDS).Though analyses of serum inflammatory factors such as tumor necrosis factor
      (TNF)-α and interleukin (IL)-6 have been used to determine the degree of systemic
      inflammation under various clinical conditions, they can not reflect the degrees of lung
      infection directly.

      Basing on the results of previous studies, meta analyses and system reviews, the
      investigators hypothesized that the anti-inflammatory function of ulinaststin may also
      decrease the levels of inflammatory factors in bronchoalveolar lavage(BAL) fluid in Patients
      with VAP.

      In addition there is no prospective study to investigate the role of ulinastatin in BAL. The
      investigator hopes that this study can approve the relationship between ulinastatin and
      inflammatory factors in BAL. And it can improve the processes,outcomes and costs of critical
      care as well.

      This is a one-center, three-arm, randomized, single-blinded, controlled trial. When a patient
      was diagnosed VAP during mechanic ventilation in ICU,a sealed envelop will be opened which
      decide whether the patient is assigned to the normal dose ulinastatin group,the high dose
      ulinastatin group or the compare group.

      VAP diagnosis and treatment accord with the &quot;Comprehensive evidence-based clinical practice
      guidelines for ventilator-associated pneumonia:Diagnosis and treatment&quot; which was published
      in 2008 by Canadian critical care trials group.

      The aim of the present study is to determine the efficacy of ulinastatin for the treatment of
      ventilator-associated Pneumonia(VAP) and to investigate the effect to inflammatory factors in
      bronchoalveolar lavage fluid .
