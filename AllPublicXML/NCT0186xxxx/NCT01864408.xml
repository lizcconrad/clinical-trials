  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary aim is to assess whether an interactive patient/provider counseling process using
      a web-based tool (iPadTM) will improve patient satisfaction regarding understanding of her
      bulge symptoms.

      The secondary aims are to assess whether an interactive patient/provider counseling process
      using web-based tool (iPadTM) will:

        1. Decrease patient anxiety with counseling

        2. Improve patient satisfaction with counseling

        3. Improve provider knowledge, anxiety, and satisfaction with counseling

        4. Be easy to use in clinic

        5. Be actually used in clinic

      This will be a randomized controlled trial comparing conventional counseling regarding pelvic
      organ prolapse versus an interactive patient/provider counseling process using a pelvic organ
      prolapse web-based tool (iPad).

      All women agreeing to enroll will:

        1. Complete a pre-visit questionnaire querying

             1. Baseline satisfaction with knowledge of their presenting bulge symptoms (&quot;pelvic
                anatomy&quot;)

             2. Anxiety related to their presenting symptoms

        2. Undergo a new patient history and physical exam, including a pelvic organ prolapse
           quantification (POPQ) exam as per practice standard.

        3. Patients will then be randomized and will either receive:

             1. Group 1: &quot;usual practice&quot; counseling regarding pelvic organ prolapse

             2. Group 2: &quot;usual practice&quot; counseling in addition to interactive patient/provider
                counseling using the pelvic organ prolapse web-based tool (iPad)

        4. Complete a post-visit questionnaire before leaving the office querying:

             1. Post-visit satisfaction with knowledge of their presenting bulge symptoms (&quot;pelvic
                anatomy&quot;)

             2. Anxiety related to their presenting symptoms

             3. Satisfaction with counseling received regarding their presenting bulging symptoms.

      Provider assessment:

      The providers participating in this study will:

        1. Complete a pre-trial questionnaire assessing satisfaction with knowledge and anxiety
           regarding counseling, and satisfaction with ability to counsel women regarding pelvic
           organ prolapse.

        2. Watch a 2 minute video tutorial educating them on the use of the web-based interactive
           tool

        3. Complete a post-trial questionnaire assessing satisfaction with knowledge and anxiety
           regarding counseling, and satisfaction with ability to counsel women regarding pelvic
           organ prolapse.

      Powering the Study:

      Assuming a 30% difference in satisfaction with knowledge of presenting bulge symptoms/
      &quot;pelvic anatomy&quot;, this study will enroll 45 pts in each arm (total of 90 pts) to achieve a
      power of 80% and an alpha of 0.05.

      Analytic Plan: Statistical analysis will be performed with SPSS v 19.0 (Chicago, IL) and will
      include, where appropriate, categorical data analysis (Pearson chi-square, Fisher's
      Exact),continuous data analysis (Student's t-test, Mann-Whitney-U), and Pearson correlation,
      and logistic regression analyses where appropriate.

      DATA COLLECTION:

      Data will be collected by the project personnel. Patient demographic and physical exam data
      will be collected by physician members of the project personnel team during the single
      patient-visit of this trial. The physician members of the project personnel team will perform
      either the &quot;usual practice&quot; or &quot;usual practice&quot; plus &quot;interactive, web-based
      tool-facilitated&quot; patient counseling. Patient and provider questionnaire data will also be
      collected by the project personnel team.

      Number and duration of subject contact: All data will be collected over the course of a
      patient's single &quot;New Patient&quot; visit. There will be no patient follow-up after this single
      visit.

    <description>Immediately before a history, physical, and counseling session subjects will fill out a Likert scale questionnaire (1=Very Dissatisfied, 2=Dissatisfied, 3=Neutral, 4=Satisfied, 5=Extremely Satisfied) to evaluate pre-visit satisfaction with understanding of bulge symptoms. After the history and physical exam subjects are randomized to group 1 or 2 for their counseling session. After the counseling session, they will fill out a similar Likert scale questionnaire to assess their satisfaction with understanding of their bulge symptoms. We will then compare the pre-visit and post-visit satisfaction with understanding of bulge symptoms for each group.</description>
