      The primary efficacy objective was to determine and compare stool composition (stool soap and
      non-soap fatty acids, total fatty acids, minerals, and other stool constituents) among the
      feeding groups.

      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effects of term infant formula containing high
      2-palmitic vegetable oil on stool composition and characteristics and to investigate the
      effect of both high 2-palmitic vegetable oil and oligofructose in infant formula on stool
      softness and bacteria. Because some studies demonstrate the benefit of high concentrations of
      a non-digestible carbohydrate in the formula, we will study 2 concentrations of added
      oligofructose.
