  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Total hip arthroplasty (THA) is a procedure associated with perioperative blood loss,
      requiring blood transfusions in some patients. The major cause of this blood loss is due to
      surgical trauma that induces the clotting cascade and fibrinolysis. Several previous studies
      and meta-analyses have shown that tranexamic acid is an effective antifibrinolytic agent that
      reduces blood loss in a variety of situations. Tranexamic acid given in an intravenous form
      has been extensively studied and shown to be efficacious in cardiothoracic, spine surgical
      procedures as well as total knee arthroplasty (TKA) and THA. Similarly, topical tranexamic
      acid has been associated with decreased blood loss in cardiac surgeries as well. Recently,
      results from a prospective randomized study on the topical use of tranexamic acid in total
      knee arthroplasty found it to be effective for reducing postoperative blood loss. Taking all
      of the above into consideration we have proposed a study to evaluate effects of topical
      application of tranexamic acid on postoperative blood loss and blood transfusion on patients
      undergoing total hip arthroplasty. The aim of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of the
      topical application of tranexamic acid on blood loss in patients undergoing a primary
      unilateral total hip arthroplasty.
