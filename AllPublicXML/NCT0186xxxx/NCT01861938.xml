  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is based on the hypothesis that stimulation of the immune response against the
      tumor can help destroy residual tumor in melanoma patients with very high risk for disease
      recurrence and in patients with relatively low tumor burden who already got first line
      treatment for their disease.

      Ongoing clinical trials in the Hadassah Hospital have shown that vaccination of patients with
      a cell line of tumor cells from the patient himself, or with a combination of three cell
      lines that partially match the patient's cell characteristics, could improve the immune
      response against the tumor, was associated with improved disease-free and overall survival.

      In this study, the investigators will evaluate the efficacy of a modified tumor cell vaccine,
      in terms of immune response,improved disease-free and overall survival. The vaccine consists
      of a cell line that has a high expression level of melanoma molecules, and has been
      genetically modified to induce a strong immune response.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients included in this protocol must carry one or more of the following tissue
             typing alleles: HLA-A2, -A24, -A33, -B35, -B49, -CW04/12(04/08). We estimate that 50%
             of melanoma patients will be eligible.

          2. Cutaneous malignant melanoma AJCC stage IIb (over 4 mm) or IIc (ulcerated melanoma
             over 4mm).

          3. Metastatic melanoma AJCC stage III (nodal involvement, N1-3a,b) post surgical removal
             of lymph nodes.

          4. Metastatic melanoma AJCC stage IV, completely resected.

          5. Non cutaneous malignant melanoma of respective stages including uveal and mucosal
             melanoma.

          6. Melanoma can be of either mutant or wild-type B-RAF.

          7. Karnofsky performance status over 80 (Normal activity with effort).

          8. No active cardio-respiratory disease.

          9. Hematocrit over 25% and WBC over 3000.

         10. Informed consent of the patient.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Administration of cytotoxic drugs or extensive radiotherapy less than 28 days prior to
             protocol administration.

          2. Active brain metastases requiring cortico-steroids.

          3. Concurrent malignancy (other than skin cancer, carcinoma in situ of cervix and early
             stage prostate cancer).

          4. Active serious infection.

          5. Allergy to penicillin.

          6. Patient's wish to withdraw from the study at any stage.
