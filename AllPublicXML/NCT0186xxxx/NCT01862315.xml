  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to use both, liver pump treatment and systemic chemotherapy, to
      assess the effects this type of treatment has on the patient and the tumor. Liver pump
      treatment uses a metal pump that is surgically placed in the abdomen and gives chemotherapy
      directly to the liver. Systemic chemotherapy gives chemotherapy through a vein [intravenously
      (IV)] and treats the whole body. This type of treatment has been done before and had shown
      that people with both pump and systemic chemotherapy had improved results. The investigators
      hope that this combination of treatments improves the response to chemotherapy and reduces
      the spread of the disease.

      Another purpose of this study is to learn the clinical importance of a specific type of MRI
      scan. The investigators would like to see if this type of MRI will help predict the response
      to the treatment and see if they could help the physician with their treatment plan. These
      scans will be done at specific time points.

      The last purpose of this study is to learn more about how the tumor interacts with the
      chemotherapy. This will be done through a biopsy taken during surgery and blood draws at
      specific time points.

      Permission from patients entering the study will be obtained to take normal and tumor liver
      biopsies at the time of surgery. These samples are voluntary and optional.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Age ≥ 21 years

          -  Histologically confirmed intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (also variously reported as
             peripheral cholangiocarcinoma, cholangiolar carcinoma or cholangiocellular carcinoma)

             diagnostic studies may be modified at the discretion of the MSKCC Principal
             Investigator. Clinical or radiographic evidence of metastatic disease to regional
             lymph nodes will be allowed, provided it is amenable to resection.

          -  Prior treatment with FUDR

          -  Prior external beam radiation therapy to the liver

          -  Diagnosis of sclerosing cholangitis

             vein thrombosis) surgically related ascites does not exclude the patient)

          -  Active infection

          -  Pregnant or lactating women

          -  History of other malignancy within the past 3 years (except non-melanoma skin cancer)
