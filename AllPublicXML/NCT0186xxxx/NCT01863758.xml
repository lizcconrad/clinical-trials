      To compare the number of breakthrough bleeds under tailored prophylaxis with Human cell line
      recombinant factor FVIII (Human-cl rhFVIII) with the historical bleeding rate from patients
      who received Human-cl rhFVIII as on demand treatment.

      There were 3 phases in this study: (1) An initial pharmacokinetic (PK) assessment in which
      participants received a single infusion of 60±5 IU/kg of Human-cl rhFVIII; blood samples were
      collected for 72 hours following the infusion. (2) Prophylactic Treatment-Phase I during
      which participants received infusions of 30-40 IU/kg of human-cl rhFVIII every other day or
      3x/week for 1-3 months. (3) Prophylactic Treatment-Phase II during which the dose and dosing
      interval were determined individually from data gathered in the initial PK assessment. The
      maximum dosing interval with a dose of ≤ 60-80 IU/kg that maintains a trough level of ≥ 0.01
      IU/mL was determined. Participants were treated for 6 months.

    <measure>Annualized Number of Bleeding Episodes (BE) in Phase II</measure>

    <description>The annualized number of total BEs was calculated for each participant as follows: d*y/t, where y = the number of BEs documented in Phase II, t = the number of treatment periods in days, and d = 365.25, the number of days per year. A bleeding episode (BE) was defined as any BE whether treated or not during Phase II of the study; BEs related to surgery were not included. This study was considered as showing efficacy if the annualized number of BEs was reduced by 50% compared to the number of BEs observed in study GENA-01 where patient where severe Hemophilia A patients were treated on-demand (NCT00989196).</description>

          <title>Hemophilia Joint Health Score (HJHS)</title>
          <description>The HJHS is determined through a physical examination of the 6 joints most affected by hemophilia; the elbows, knees, and ankles. Knees and ankles are assessed on 11 items: Swelling, duration of swelling, muscle atrophy, axial alignment, crepitus on motion, flexion loss, extension loss, instability, joint pain, strength, and gait. Elbows are assessed on 9 of the 11 items (axial alignment and gait are not assessed). Each item is assessed on a scale that ranges from 0-1 to 0-4. The total score can range from 0 to 148, with a higher score indicating a bigger effect of hemophilia.</description>

A bleeding episode (BE) was defined as any BE whether treated or not during Phase II of the study; BEs related to surgery were not included. This study was considered as showing efficacy if the annualized number of BEs was reduced by 50% compared to the number of BEs observed in study GENA-01 where patient where severe Hemophilia A patients were treated on-demand (NCT00989196).</description>
