  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Early treatment is considered essential for developmental dysplasia of the hip (DDH), but the
      choice of screening strategy is debated. The investigators evaluated the effect of a
      selective ultrasound (US) screening programme.

      All infants born in a defined region during 1991-2006 with increased risk of DDH, i.e.
      clinical hip instability, breech presentation, congenital foot deformities or a family
      history of DDH, were subjected to US screening at age one to three days. Severe sonographic
      dysplasia and/or dislocatable/dislocated hips were treated with abduction splints. Mild
      dysplasia and/or pathological instability, i.e. not dislocatable/dislocated hips were
      followed clinically and sonographically until spontaneous resolution, or until treatment
      became necessary. The minimum observation period was 5,5 years.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Of 81564 newborns, 11539 (14,1%) were identified as at risk, of which 11190 (58% girls) were
      included for further analyses. Of the 81564 infants, 2433 (3â€¢0%) received early treatment;
      1882 (2,3%) from birth and 551 (0,7%) after six weeks or more of clinical and sonographic
      surveillance. Another 2700 (3,3%) normalised spontaneously after watchful waiting from birth.
      Twenty-six infants (0,32 per 1000, 92% girls, two from the risk group) presented with late
      subluxated/dislocated hips (after one month of age). Another 126 (1,5 per 1000, 83% girls,
      one from the risk group) were treated after isolated late residual dysplasia. Thirty-one
      children (0,38 per 1000) had surgical treatment before age five years. Avascular necrosis was
      diagnosed in seven of all children treated (0.27%), four after early and three after late
      treatment.

      Interpretation The first 16 years of a standardised selective US screening programme for DDH
      resulted in acceptable rates of early treatment and US follow-ups, and low rates of late
      subluxated/dislocated hips compared to similar studies.

        All infants born at the maternity unit at Haukeland University Hospital from January 1991
        through December 2006 were included. The hospital provides the only delivery unit for the
        city and suburbs of Bergen and a large rural area within the Hordaland County. It serves a
        population of approximately 400 000 inhabitants, predominantly ethnic Norwegians. The
        annual birth rates varied from 4723 to 6010.

        Minimum observation time was 5,5 years.
