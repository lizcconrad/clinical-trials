      The objective of this study was to confirm if two formulations of isotretionin (capsules) are
      bioequivalent.

      Test product was Oratane® 20 mg (Laboratorios Dermatológicos Darier) and reference product
      Roaccutan® 20 mg (Productos Roche). Two capsules administered together were the single
      dosage.

      The study was prospective, open-label, randomized, crossover, single dose, with 02
      treatments, 02 sequences and 02 periods, under fed conditions.

      The population was composed of 36 healthy volunteers, male adults between 18-45 years.

      The comparative bioavailability of the two formulations was evaluated based in statistical
      comparisons of relevant pharmacokinetic parameters, obtained from data of drug concentrations
      in blood.

        for which any previously mentioned test is exceeded regarding considered valid maximum and
        minimum accepted normal values, as long as it involves an isolated value and there are no
        other manifestations which could allow assuming that a given value is related to a disease
        or is remnant of another. These cases must be approved by clinical area and declared as
        &quot;Non-clinically significant&quot;.

        results regarding RPR; VIH and AgsHB tests. Personal or family history of allergy to
        medication in question. Having any kind of allergy, since these persons are in higher risk
        of suffering from medicamentous allergy.

        Tobacco use. Recreational drug use. Persons undergoing any medical treatment. Existence of
        concurrent or intercurrent disease. Existence of justified doubt regarding questionnaire
        answers truthfulness. Having participated in bioequivalence or bioavailability studies or
        having donated blood 2 months before the study.

        Presence of clinically important gastrointestinal diseases or malabsorption history during
        the last year.

        Presence of a medical condition requiring regular medication (with prescription or
        over-the- counter medication) with systemic absorption.

        Narcotics or alcohol addiction history requiring treatment. Finally, excluded will be all
        those volunteers not meeting that established in Mexican Official Standard
