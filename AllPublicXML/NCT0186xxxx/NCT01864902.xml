      RATIONALE: Placing a tumor antigen chimeric receptor that has been created in the laboratory
      into patient autologous or donor-derived T cells may make the body build immune response to
      kill cancer cells.

      PURPOSE: This clinical trial is to study genetically engineered lymphocyte therapy in
      treating patients with CD33 positive acute myeloid leukemias that is relapsed (after stem
      cell transplantation or intensive chemotherapy) or refractory to further chemotherapy.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the safety and feasibility of the chimeric antigen receptor T cells transduced
      with the anti-CD33 vector (referred to as CART-33 cells).

      II. Determine duration of in vivo survival of CART-33 cells. RT-PCR (reverse transcription
      polymerase chain reaction) analysis of whole blood will be used to detect and quantify
      survival of CART-33 TCR zeta:CD137 and TCR (T-cell receptor) zeta cells over time.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. For patients with detectable disease, measure anti-leukemia response due to CART-33 cell
      infusions.

      II. To determine if the CD137 transgene is superior to the TCR zeta only transgene as
      measured by the relative engraftment levels of CART-33 TCR zeta:CD137 and TCR zeta cells over
      time.

      III. Estimate relative trafficking of CART-33 cells in bone marrow.

      IV. For patients with stored or accessible leukemia blasts, determine leukemia cell killing
      by CART-33 cells in vitro.

      V. Determine if cellular or humoral host immunity develops against the murine anti-CD33, and
      assess correlation with loss of detectable CART-33 (loss of engraftment).

      VI. Determine the relative subsets of CART-33 T cells (Tcm, Tem, and Treg).

      OUTLINE: Patients are assigned to 1 group according to order of enrollment.

      Patients receive anti-CD33-CAR (coupled with CD137 and CD3 zeta signalling
      domains)vector-transduced autologous T cells on days 0,1, and 2 in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed intensively for 6 months, every 3
      months for 2 years, and annually thereafter for 13 years.
