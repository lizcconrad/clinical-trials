      Crossover randomized controlled double-blinded trial. Twenty women with obesity and
      pre-hypertension, aged 28-59 years, with stable body weight were randomized to receive a
      daily supplement of 3 capsules that contained either 500mg of green tea extract (GTE) or a
      matching placebo for 4 weeks, with a washout period of 2 weeks between the treatments.
      Endothelial function was evaluated by peripheral arterial tonometry method, using Endo-PAT
      2000®.
