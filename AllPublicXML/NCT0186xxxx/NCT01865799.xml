  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, 3-year observational study to describe drug utilization in uninfected
      individuals (UIs) who initiate emtricitabine (FTC)/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF)
      (Truvada®) for a pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) indication.

      An electronic source of pharmacy/medical encounter information will be used to assess the
      demographics and other characteristics of the subjects prescribed FTC/TDF or its components
      in a prospective fashion. The data provider will supply all the de-identified information
      regarding each visit/interaction that the subject has had with the health system and all the
      diagnoses and medications that the UI has had prospectively and retrospectively for the
      length of time captured by the source selected.

      200 physicians who prescribe FTC/TDF for a PrEP indication will be sampled from the same
      source.
