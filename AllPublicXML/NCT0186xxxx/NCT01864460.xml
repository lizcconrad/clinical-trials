  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Type 2 diabetes (DM2) affects nearly 20 million people in the United States while impaired
      glucose regulation (IGR), which includes impaired glucose tolerance (IGT), impaired fasting
      glucose (IFG), and early diabetes affects a considerably larger but unknown population group.
      At the current time there is no effective therapy to completely prevent, or reverse
      neuropathy associated with IGR and this represents a considerable challenge in
      rehabilitation. There is a particularly strong incentive to prevent IGT and related
      complications from advancing to DM2. IGR is a growing problem among all older adults and its
      strong association with many functional limitations, particularly mobility limitations, is
      not always recognized, even though diabetes-related disability occurs in up to 2/3 of older
      adults with diabetes and is associated with dependency, poor quality of life, and increased
      acute and long-term care utilization.

      Autonomic dysfunction is a significant problem in subjects with IGT. The Preliminary Data
      shows that over 90% of subjects with IGT have an abnormal score on questionnaires about
      autonomic symptoms such as lightheadedness, dry mouth or dry eyes, pale or blue feet, feet
      that are colder than the rest of the body, decreased sweating in the feet or increased
      sweating in the hands, nausea or bloating after eating, persistent diarrhea or constipation,
      or leaking of urine. In addition, patients with IGR have impaired balance control. These
      factors can increase the risk of falls in affected subjects. A non-randomized and
      non-controlled study showed that a diet and exercise intervention in patients with diabetes
      led to an overall improvement in autonomic function. Furthermore, it was shown that standing
      balance can be improved with a balance intervention program.

      However, there are no published studies that assess the effect of an intense physical
      activity intervention on autonomic function in IGR related neuropathy. This study will test
      an aerobic exercise and balance intervention in participants with IGR. The investigators will
      examine if an individually tailored, carefully monitored, Diet, Physical Activity, and
      Balance Enhancement Program (DPAEP) can improve autonomic function and balance control when
      compared to patients who receive standard care. Improving balance control and autonomic
      function can decrease the risk of falls and have a significant effect on the health of
      participants.

      The research is also significant because it will test subjects either before they become
      diabetic, or at an early stage in their diabetes, thus enhancing the chance of reversing the
      autonomic neuropathy or balance impairment. Furthermore, the study is designed to test
      whether improvement in autonomic function and balance is associated with improvement in
      clinical outcomes, quality of life, and the metabolic state of participants. Thus, the
      proposed interventions are likely to have a real life impact on participants and their
      health.

      In this proposed study, investigators will determine if an intense, individually tailored,
      carefully monitored, Diet, Physical Activity and Balance Enhancement Program (DPAEP) can
      improve autonomic function and balance and other measures of autonomic and balance control.
      In contrast, the primary and secondary and other efficacy measures will be compared in
      standard care controls (SC) who will receive general diet and physical activity information.
      The &quot;Improving Autonomic Function and Balance in Diabetic Neuropathy&quot; study is a single
      blinded, randomized study to determine if an intensive diet and exercise program improves
      autonomic function and balance. Following baseline testing, participants are randomized to
      either DPAEP or SC groups. DPAEP participants will receive an intensive physical activity
      enhancement program with a focus on aerobic activity and a balance program.

    <description>Subjects in the DPAEP group will undergo a structured weight loss for approximately 6 months, followed by approximately 6 months of weight maintenance, as well as 12 months of aerobic exercise. This intervention stresses a personalized program emphasizing activities that are meaningful to and are tailored to individual participants; provides consistent contact between the participants and research staff; and allows monitoring of activity levels using questionnaires, actigraphy, monitoring of heart rate, direct and telephone contact. Participants dietary and physical activity goals as assessed by the dietician and trainer will be discussed at face-to face meetings to re-establish these goals. These programs will be tailored to meet the realistic goals of the individual participant. The program stresses aerobic exercise, rather than other types of exercise interventions, as aerobic exercise appears to correlate best with improved autonomic function.</description>

          -  Impaired glucose regulation at the time of screening or within three months of
             screening. This definition includes patients with IFG, IGT, and early or mild DM2.
             Patients can be included if they have an increased risk for diabetes with a HBA1C
             greater than or equal to 5.7% (using a method certified by the National

             2010/11 consensus criteria. Subjects with be entered into the study if they have (1)
             increased symptoms of autonomic neuropathy based on an increase in the number of
             symptoms (&gt;3) OR impact score (&gt;7) in the validated SAS OR (2) at least two
             abnormalities on autonomic testing. The autonomic testing includes: (a) heart rate
             variability (E:I ratio and heart rate range-HRR), (b) Valsalva ratio, (c) Valsalva
             beat to beat blood pressure variation, (d) 30:15 ratio, (e) tilt table testing, and
             (f) QSART values.

          -  Women of childbearing potential must be using an acceptable method of contraception to
             prevent pregnancy when they are enrolled in the study and must agree to continue to
             practice an acceptable method of contraception for the duration of their participation
             in the study.

          -  Patient must agree to take an alternative medication to coumadin when undergoing a
             skin biopsy.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Pregnant women, prisoners, institutionalized subjects and other at risk subjects will
             not be included in this study.
