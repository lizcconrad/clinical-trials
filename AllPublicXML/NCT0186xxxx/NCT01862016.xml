  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The care of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) has been significantly improved by
      learning from experimental and physiological research works and by a series of randomized
      controlled trials. The mortality of this syndrome remains however high. Numerous experimental
      and clinical works demonstrated that a ventilatory mode authorizing the patient to make, from
      the acute phase, spontaneous breathing cycles superimposed on assistance delivered by the
      ventilator (BIPAP-APRV mode) allowed to improve gas exchanges and hemodynamic tolerance of
      the ventilation while reducing the need for sedative drugs. This ventilatory mode could also
      reduce the risk of diaphragmatic dysfunction induced by ventilation. Consequently, our
      hypothesis is that this ventilatory mode could allow a reduction of mortality in ARDS
      patients.

      The aim of this multicenter, prospective, randomized, controlled, open study is to compare
      the effects of two ventilatory strategies on the mortality of ARDS patients and placed under
      mechanical ventilation.
