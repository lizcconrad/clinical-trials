      Impact of melatonin on organ donor pretreatment and liver transplant recipient: prospective,
      randomized, double-blind trial.

      OBJECTIVES. To establish the efficacy of the melatonin administered to encephalic death
      donors (EDD) in liver transplantation. The aim is to improve the functional quality of the
      retrieved organs, attenuate lesions and ischemia-reperfusion mediators, and provide grafts
      with greater resistance to post-transplant aggression.

      METHODOLOGY. Prospective, randomized, double-blind, pilot trial to evaluate preconditioning
      with melatonin versus placebo in EDDs. Two groups, melatonin and control-placebo, n=30 per
      group. Administration to donor via NG tube of 30mg of melatonin or placebo (lactose) upon
      inclusion in the trial, 60 minutes prior to commencement of surgery and following laparotomy
      during extraction. Evaluation of response to treatment: A) Conventional clinical,
      hemodynamic, analytical and histopathological parameters in donor and recipient. B) Plasma
      determinations for: oxidative/nitrosative stress; acute phase proteins; cellular and humoral
      immunity; NT-proBNP and cystatin C; endocrine profile; melatonin levels. C) Determinations in
      liver tissue: quantification of malonyldialdehyde-4hydroxyalkenals and protein carbonyl
      content; cellular and mitochondrial membrane fluidity; markers of tissue-vascular damage and
      proliferation: transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β); hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) and
      vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). Data will be analyzed following a prospectively
      define plan and by intention-to-treat analysis.
