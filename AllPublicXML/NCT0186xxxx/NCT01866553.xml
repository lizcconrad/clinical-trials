      The purpose of this trial is to assess the effect of switching CML patients, who have been
      treated with imatinib ≥ 2 years and who have stable detectable molecular residual disease
      between 0.01-1.0% (IS), to the combination of Nilotinib and PegIFN, in terms of the
      proportion of patients who achieve confirmed MR4.0.

      Study phase: Phase II.

      Patient population:

      Patients with suboptimal molecular response or stable detectable molecular residual disease
      after ≥ 2 years of treatment with imatinib (i.e. BCR ABL level between 0.01% and 1% IS).

      Study objective:

      To assess the effect of switching CML patients, who have been treated with imatinib ≥ 2 years
      and who have stable detectable molecular residual disease between 0.01-1.0% (IS), to the
      combination of Nilotinib and PegIFN, in terms of the proportion of patients who achieve
      confirmed MR4.0.

      Study design:

      Single arm, open label, multicenter study to assess the efficacy, safety and tolerability of
      nilotinib 300 mg BID, alone and in combination with PegIFN 25 - 40 μg/week in patients not in
      CMR. Patients will be treated with nilotinib 300 mg BID at the beginning of the study to
      establish the tolerability before adding PegIFN. Combination treatment will be continued
      until Month 12, which is followed by monotherapy phase of nilotinib 300 mg BID. Overall study
      duration for the individual patient is 24 months.

    <description>An interim efficacy analysis will be prepared after 40 patients have completed 12 months study treatment.If already a sufficient number of patients have achieved the efficacy endpoint i.e. a 25% increase in MR4.0 rate (from 48% in ENEStcmr to 73% in this study). Using Fleming's method, we have indication of superior efficacy of the combination if 29 or more patients achieve MR4.0, and thereafter may stop inclusion in the study.</description>

The study should be stopped if 4 out of 5, 6 out of 10 or 8 out of 15 patients experience grade 4 hematological toxicity, or grade 3 non hematological toxicity after 3 months of PegIFN treatment.</description>

    <description>Patients will be treated with nilotinib 300 mg BID during the first 3 months. Then the &quot;combination phase&quot; ensues with continued daily nilotinib 300 mg BID combined with PegIFN 25 ug/week for 3 months up to the Month 6 time point. If the patient has no more than grade 1 non-hematological toxicity or grade 2 hematological toxicity, the dose will be increased to 40 μg/w until Month 12. The &quot;follow-up phase&quot; with daily nilotinib 300 mg BID covers the next 12 months period (Month 12 to 24). until Month 12, which is followed by monotherapy phase of nilotinib 300 mg BID.
