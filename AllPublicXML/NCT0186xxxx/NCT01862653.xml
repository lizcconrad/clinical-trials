  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) has emerged as a significant problem among troops
      returning from combat zones. A majority of these veterans will report difficulty maintaining
      or initiating sleep. The purpose of this research will be to conduct a prospective,
      randomized, wait list controlled, small scale feasibility study to examine if the use of an
      auricular acupuncture regimen improves quality of sleep for Operation Iraqi Freedom/Operation
      Enduring Freedom (OIF/OEF)veterans with PTSD receiving standard PTSD treatment. Hypothesis:
      Objective and subjective sleep disturbances and sleep quality will be improved in OIF/OEF
      veterans who receive auricular acupuncture in conjunction with standard PTSD therapy or
      standard therapy alone.

    <description>Subjects receiving the auricular acupuncture intervention will be treated in a quiet private room sitting in a comfortable chair. The external ear cartilage of both ears will be cleaned with isopropyl alcohol swabs.
