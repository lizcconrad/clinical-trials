    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether metformin in combination with gefitinib are
      effective in patients with previously untreated advanced or metastatic Non-Small-Cell Lung
      cancer with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutations
    </textblock>

      Primary Objectives: To determine the 1 year progression-free survival (PFS) of the
      combination of metformin and gefitinib in patients who harbors EGFR-mutant with previously
      untreated advanced or metastatic pulmonary adenocarcinoma.

      Secondary Objectives:

      A. To evaluate the response to therapy and overall survival of the combination of metformin
      with gefitinib in patients who harbors EGFR-mutant with previously untreated advanced or
      metastatic pulmonary adenocarcinoma.

      B. To acquire preliminary data regarding the effects of metformin on interleukin-6 (IL-6)
      levels in tumor and serum.

      Treatment will be administered on an outpatient basis. Metformin starting at a dose of 500 mg
      twice a day, orally with meals. After one week, increase the dose of metformin to 1000 mg as
      the first dose of the day and 500 mg as the second dose. After another week, increase to 1000
      mg of metformin two times a day. Metformin treatment will be initiated one week before
      beginning gefitinib, if possible, but gefitinib administration will not be delayed for
      metformin loading.

      Gefitinib will be administered 250mg QD continuously. Metformin will be administered
      continuously, beginning one week before beginning gefitinib, if possible, but tyrosine kinase
      inhibitors (TKI) will not be delayed for metformin loading.

      Maintenance Therapy Patients responding to this therapy will be maintained with metformin
      (1000 mg twice daily) and gefitinib.

      Duration of Therapy

      In the absence of treatment delays due to adverse events, treatment may continue until one of
      the following criteria applies:

        1. Disease progression,

        2. Intercurrent illness that prevents further administration of treatment,

        3. Unacceptable adverse events(s),

        4. Patient decides to withdraw from the study, or

        5. General or specific changes in the patient's condition render the patient unacceptable
           for further treatment in the judgment of the investigator.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients must have Histologically or cytologically confirmed non small cell carcinoma

             disease) (according to the 7th edition of the tumor node metastasis (TNM)
             classification system). However, patients with T4NX disease (stage III B) with
             nodule(s) in ipsilateral lung lobe are not eligible, because such patients were not
             included in historical controls.

          -  Patients be age &gt;18 years and &lt; 75 years.

          -  Patients must have a Life Expectancy of greater than 12 weeks.

          -  Patients must have an electrocorticography (ECOG) performance status 0 or 1 (Karnofsky
             &gt; 70%).

          -  Patients must have normal organ and marrow function as defined below, within one week
             prior to randomization:

        absolute neutrophil count &gt;1,500/mL platelets &gt; 100,000/mL total bilirubin: within normal
        institutional limits AST(SGOT)/ALT(SGPT) &lt; 2.5 X institutional upper limit of normal
        creatinine â‰¤ 1.5 X institutional upper limit of normal urine dipstick for proteinuria of &lt;
        less than 1+. If urine dipstick is &gt; 1+ then a 24 hour urine for protein must demonstrate &lt;
        500 mg of protein in 24 hours to allow participation in the study.

          -  Women of child-bearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception
             (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry and for
             the duration of study participation. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is
             pregnant while participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician
             immediately.

          -  Patients must have an international normalized ratio (INR) &lt; 1.5 and a partial
             thromboplastin time (PTT) no greater than upper limits of normal within 1 week prior
             to randomization.

          -  Patients with a history of hypertension must be well-controlled (&lt;150 systolic/&lt;100
             diastolic) on a stable regimen of anti-hypertensive therapy.

          -  Patients must have the ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written
             informed consent document.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing
             or active infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris,
             cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situation that would limit
             compliance with study requirements.

          -  Patients receiving chronic daily treatment with aspirin (&gt; 325 mg/day) or nonsteroidal
             anti-inflammatory agents known to inhibit platelet function. Treatment with
             dipyridamole (Persantine), ticlopidine (Ticlid), clopidogrel (Plavix) and/or
             cilostazol (Pletal)is also not allowed.

          -  Patients receiving therapeutic anticoagulation. Prophylactic anticoagulation of venous
             access devices is allowed provided Section 3.10 is met. Caution should be taken on
             treating patients with low dose heparin or low molecular weight heparin for DVT
             prophylaxis during treatment with bevacizumab as there may be an increased risk of
             bleeding.

          -  Prior use of chemotherapy.

          -  Patients receiving immunotherapy, hormonal-therapy and or radiotherapy within 2 weeks
             prior to entering the study. Note: Those who have not recovered from adverse events
             due to these agents administered will be considered ineligible.

          -  Patients receiving any other investigational agents.

          -  Patients with uncontrolled brain metastasis. Note: Patients with brain metastases must
             have stable neurologic status following local therapy (surgery or radiation) for at
             least 2 weeks, and must be without neurologic dysfunction that would confound the
             evaluation of neurologic and other adverse events.

          -  Patients with a history of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar
             chemical or biologic composition to metformin and paclitaxel or other agents used in
             the study are excluded.

          -  Women that are pregnant or breastfeeding Note: Pregnant women are excluded from this
             study because the agents used in this study may be teratogenic to a fetus. Because
             there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary
             to treatment of the mother with paclitaxel, breastfeeding women are also excluded from
             this study.

          -  Patients that are HIV-positive on combination antiretroviral therapy due to the
             potential for lethal infections when treated with marrow-suppressive therapy.
