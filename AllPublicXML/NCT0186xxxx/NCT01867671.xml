  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multi-center study comparing peanut
      oral immunotherapy (OIT) to placebo in the induction of tolerance and desensitization in
      peanut-allergic children. Eligible participants with peanut allergy will be randomly assigned
      to receive either peanut OIT or placebo for 134 weeks followed by peanut avoidance for 26
      weeks.

      An initial oral food challenge (OFC) to 1 g of peanut flour (500 mg peanut protein) will be
      conducted. Participants must have a clinical reaction during this OFC to initiate study
      dosing. After the initial OFC, the study design includes four phases:

        -  Initial dose escalation (1 day): Peanut or placebo dosing will be given incrementally
           and increase every 20 minutes until a dose of 12 mg peanut flour (6 mg peanut protein)
           or placebo flour is given.

        -  Build-up (30 weeks): Initial observed dose administration of highest tolerated dose,
           followed by daily OIT at home with return visit every 2 weeks for dose escalation.

        -  Maintenance (104 weeks):The participant will continue on daily OIT with return visits
           every 13 weeks. At the end of this phase the participant will undergo a blinded OFC to
           10 g peanut flour (5 g peanut protein).

        -  Avoidance (26 weeks): In this final phase participants will be seen every 13 weeks. At
           the completion of this phase participants will have a final blinded OFC to 10g peanut
           flour (5 g peanut protein).

    <description>Participants who pass an oral food challenge (OFC) to 10 g of peanut flour (5 g of peanut protein) at this time without significant symptoms will be considered desensitized to peanut. Failure will be defined as either unable to undergo the final food challenge or inability to tolerate the maximum dose because of significant symptoms such as hives, wheezing, vomiting, or laryngeal edema.</description>
