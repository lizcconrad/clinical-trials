  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It is a phase I randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled, dose-escalating study to assess
      safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics (PK) data of 0.1% and 1.0% ZEP-3 cream,
      administered topically up to 5 consecutive treatment days in healthy volunteers.

      This is a single center trial. It is anticipated that the study will be conducted at the
      Department of Dermatology, at the Sheba Medical Center, Ramat Gan, Israel.

      The screening/enrollment visit includes a PK study for 24h following a single IP topical
      application. After a 24h washout time break, the subject will enter the treatment period for
      5 consecutive treatment days followed by a follow up visit 1 and 5 days after end of
      treatment.

      The primary endpoints of this study are:

        -  Safety evaluation - To demonstrate ZEP-3 cream safety in terms of skin irritation score.

        -  Safety evaluation - To demonstrate ZEP-3 cream safety in terms of type and severity of
           reported adverse events.

        -  Tolerability evaluation - To demonstrate ZEP-3 cream tolerability in terms of treatment
           compliance by the treated volunteers.

      The secondary endpoints of this study are:

        -  Systemic absorption PK profile.

        -  Dermal absorption PK profile (Optional).

      Subject safety will be assessed following treatment by ZEP-3 cream, using measurements of the
      following variables:

        -  Dermal reaction parameters

        -  Physical examination

        -  Vital Signs (HR, BP, RR, Body temperature)

        -  12 lead ECG data

        -  Laboratory tests (CBC, blood chemistry, coagulation functions, urinalysis)

        -  Adverse events recording

        -  Change in concomitant medications
