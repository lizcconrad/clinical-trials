  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This trial is conducted in Europe. The aim of this trial is to investigate the safety,
      tolerability, pharmacokinetics (the exposure of the trial drug in the body) and
      pharmacodynamics (the effect of the investigated drug on the body) of insulin degludec
      (insulin 454), an explorative formulation, not similar to the proposed commerical
      formulation.
