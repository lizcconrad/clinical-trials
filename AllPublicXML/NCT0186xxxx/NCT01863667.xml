  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This trial will assess the safety and efficacy of omarigliptin (MK-3102) compared with the
      sulfonylurea, glimepiride, in type 2 diabetes mellitus participants who are metformin
      intolerant or who have a contraindication to the use of metformin. The primary hypothesis is
      that after 54 weeks, the mean change from baseline in hemoglobin A1c (A1C) in participants
      treated with omarigliptin is non-inferior compared with that in participants treated with
      glimepiride.

    <measure>Percentage of Participants With an Adverse Event of Symptomatic Hypoglycemia</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 54 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>An adverse event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence in a participant administered study drug which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with the treatment. AEs may include the onset of new illness and the exacerbation of pre-existing conditions. Per protocol, an adverse event was defined as symptomatic hypoglycemia if hypoglycemia was an adverse event collected on the AE form AND the symptoms associated with it were collected on the hypoglycemia assessment (HA) form. Due to the early termination of the study, the HA form information was not assessed; therefore, this endpoint cannot be reported.</description>
