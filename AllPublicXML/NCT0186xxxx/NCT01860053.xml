  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to reduce problematic vomiting and associated gastrointestinal
      symptoms in post-operative LAGB patients. We hypothesize that our behavioral intervention
      will yield greater reductions in vomiting and associated symptoms compared to our control
      condition.
