    <textblock>
      VIP-E is a one-arm, open-label, 40-52 week extension study to continue or cross over subjects
      of the VIP study (# 814278) to active drug (adalimumab) to determine if there is sustained
      improvement in vascular inflammation, lipid metabolism, and inflammatory markers. VIP-E
      extends VIP study procedures for 40-52 weeks including questionnaires, physical exams, blood
      and urine samples, lab tests, one additional FDG-PET/CT scan, and adalimumab injections
      following FDA-approved psoriasis treatment regimen.

    <measure>Change in Cardiometabolic Biomarker - Cholesterol Efflux</measure>
    <time_frame>52 weeks (continuation group) or 64 weeks (crossover group)</time_frame>
    <description>The ability to promote cholesterol efflux from macrophages is a classic function of HDL that is thought to be an important mechanism by which HDL protects against atherosclerosis. HDL cholesterol efflux capacity assays are performed based on published methods using J774 cells derived from a murine macrophage cell line (Mehta NN Atherosclerosis 2012). Efflux is calculated as a unitless measure by using the following formula: [(µCi of 3H-cholesterol in media containing apoB-depleted subject plasma - µCi of 3H-cholesterol in plasma-free media) / (µCi of 3H-cholesterol in media containing apoB-depleted pooled control plasma-µCi of 3H-cholesterol in pooled control plasma-free media)].
If subjects were randomized to adalimumab in the VIP Trial, the time frame is a total of 52 weeks (continuation group). If subjects were randomized to placebo or phototherapy in the VIP Trial, additional 12 weeks added to the time frame for a total of 64 weeks (crossover group).</description>

    <measure>Psoriasis Activity (PASI and PGA)</measure>
    <time_frame>52 weeks (continuation group) or 64 weeks (crossover group)</time_frame>
    <description>Change in psoriasis activity will be assessed using the following standardized measurement tools for psoriasis: Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) and Physician's Global Assessment (PGA). PASI combines the assessment of the severity of lesions and the area affected into a single score with range 0 (no disease) to 72 maximal disease. The PGA is an average assessment of all psoriatic lesions based on erythema, scale, and induration with score range 0 (no disease/clear) to 5 (maximal disease).

    <measure>Change in Patient-Reported Quality of Life Outcomes-EuroQol EQ-5D</measure>
    <time_frame>52 weeks (continuation group) or 64 weeks (crossover group)</time_frame>
    <description>EQ-5D is a standardized instrument developed by the EuroQol Group as a measure of health-related quality of life that can be used in a wide range of health conditions and treatments. The EQ-5D consists of a descriptive system and the EQ VAS. The descriptive system comprises five dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression on a scale ranging from 1 (no health state problem) to 3 (extreme health state problems). The EQ VAS records the patient's self-rated health on a vertical visual analogue scale ranging from 0, worst health state, to 100, best health state. A scoring function is used to assign a value (i.e., EQ-5D™ index score) to self-reported health states from a set of population-based preference weights. For the U.S. general population, the possible EQ-5D index scores range from -0.11 to 1.0 where 0.0 = death and 1.0 = perfect health.</description>

    <measure>Change in Patient-Reported Quality of Life Outcomes - Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI)</measure>
    <time_frame>52 weeks (continuation group) or 64 weeks (crossover group)</time_frame>
    <description>The DLQI is calculated by summing the score of 10 questions regarding impact of skin condition on daily life resulting in a maximum of 30 and a minimum of 0. The higher the score, the more quality of life is impaired.
If subjects were randomized to adalimumab in the VIP Trial, the time frame is a total of 52 weeks (continuation group). If subjects were randomized to placebo or phototherapy in the VIP Trial, additional 12 weeks added to the time frame for a total of 64 weeks (crossover group).</description>

    <measure>Change in Patient-Reported Quality of Life Outcomes - MEDFICTS Dietary Assessment</measure>
    <time_frame>52 weeks (continuation group) or 64 weeks (crossover group)</time_frame>
    <description>Patient reported dietary outcomes will be assessed using MEDFICTS (Meats, Eggs, Dairy, Fried foods, fat In baked goods, Convenience foods, fats added at the Table, and Snacks), a brief dietary assessment instrument. This assessment looks at eight different categories of foods and assigns points by type of food and serving size ranging from 0 points (do not consume that food group) to 21 points (consume food group, largest serving size). Your final score is the total of all points for all food categories.
If subjects were randomized to adalimumab in the VIP Trial, the time frame is a total of 52 weeks (continuation group). If subjects were randomized to placebo or phototherapy in the VIP Trial, additional 12 weeks added to the time frame for a total of 64 weeks (crossover group).</description>

    <measure>Change in Patient-Reported Quality of Life Outcomes - International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ)</measure>
    <time_frame>52 weeks (continuation group) or 64 weeks (crossover group)</time_frame>
    <description>IPAQ is an instrument designed primarily for population surveillance of physical activity among adults with activity measured in metabolic equivalent (MET)-minutes per week.
Per Office of Disease Prevention and Health Promotion's Physical Activity Guidelines:
A range of 500 to 1,000 MET-minutes of activity per week provides substantial [health] benefit, and amounts of activity above this range have even more benefit. Amounts of activity below this range also have some benefit. The dose-response relationship continues even within the range of 500 to 1,000 MET-minutes, in that the health benefits of 1,000 MET-minutes per week are greater than those of 500 MET-minutes per week.
If subjects were randomized to adalimumab in the VIP Trial, the time frame is a total of 52 weeks (continuation group). If subjects were randomized to placebo or phototherapy in the VIP Trial, additional 12 weeks added to the time frame for a total of 64 weeks (crossover group).</description>

        <title>Change in Vascular Inflammation</title>
        <description>Change in total vascular inflammation of five aortic segments as assessed on FDG-PET/CT between week 52 of the adalimumab treatment period and baseline scans (prior to randomization in the VIP Trial). The arterial uptake of FDG is measured by the standardized uptake value (SUV) max divided by the venous SUIV mean yielding a target to background ration (TBR). If subjects were randomized to adalimumab in the VIP Trial, the time frame is a total of 52 weeks (continuation group). If subjects were randomized to placebo or phototherapy in the VIP Trial, additional 12 weeks added to the time frame for a total of 64 weeks (crossover group).</description>

        <title>Change in Cardiometabolic Biomarker - Cholesterol Efflux</title>
        <description>The ability to promote cholesterol efflux from macrophages is a classic function of HDL that is thought to be an important mechanism by which HDL protects against atherosclerosis. HDL cholesterol efflux capacity assays are performed based on published methods using J774 cells derived from a murine macrophage cell line (Mehta NN Atherosclerosis 2012). Efflux is calculated as a unitless measure by using the following formula: [(µCi of 3H-cholesterol in media containing apoB-depleted subject plasma - µCi of 3H-cholesterol in plasma-free media) / (µCi of 3H-cholesterol in media containing apoB-depleted pooled control plasma-µCi of 3H-cholesterol in pooled control plasma-free media)].
If subjects were randomized to adalimumab in the VIP Trial, the time frame is a total of 52 weeks (continuation group). If subjects were randomized to placebo or phototherapy in the VIP Trial, additional 12 weeks added to the time frame for a total of 64 weeks (crossover group).</description>

        <title>Psoriasis Activity (PASI and PGA)</title>
        <description>Change in psoriasis activity will be assessed using the following standardized measurement tools for psoriasis: Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) and Physician's Global Assessment (PGA). PASI combines the assessment of the severity of lesions and the area affected into a single score with range 0 (no disease) to 72 maximal disease. The PGA is an average assessment of all psoriatic lesions based on erythema, scale, and induration with score range 0 (no disease/clear) to 5 (maximal disease).
If subjects were randomized to adalimumab in the VIP Trial, the time frame is a total of 52 weeks (continuation group). If subjects were randomized to placebo or phototherapy in the VIP Trial, additional 12 weeks added to the time frame for a total of 64 weeks (crossover group).</description>

        <title>Change in Patient-Reported Quality of Life Outcomes-EuroQol EQ-5D</title>
        <description>EQ-5D is a standardized instrument developed by the EuroQol Group as a measure of health-related quality of life that can be used in a wide range of health conditions and treatments. The EQ-5D consists of a descriptive system and the EQ VAS. The descriptive system comprises five dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression on a scale ranging from 1 (no health state problem) to 3 (extreme health state problems). The EQ VAS records the patient’s self-rated health on a vertical visual analogue scale ranging from 0, worst health state, to 100, best health state. A scoring function is used to assign a value (i.e., EQ-5D™ index score) to self-reported health states from a set of population-based preference weights. For the U.S. general population, the possible EQ-5D index scores range from -0.11 to 1.0 where 0.0 = death and 1.0 = perfect health.</description>

        <description>IPAQ is an instrument designed primarily for population surveillance of physical activity among adults with activity measured in metabolic equivalent (MET)-minutes per week.
Per Office of Disease Prevention and Health Promotion's Physical Activity Guidelines:
A range of 500 to 1,000 MET-minutes of activity per week provides substantial [health] benefit, and amounts of activity above this range have even more benefit. Amounts of activity below this range also have some benefit. The dose-response relationship continues even within the range of 500 to 1,000 MET-minutes, in that the health benefits of 1,000 MET-minutes per week are greater than those of 500 MET-minutes per week.
If subjects were randomized to adalimumab in the VIP Trial, the time frame is a total of 52 weeks (continuation group). If subjects were randomized to placebo or phototherapy in the VIP Trial, additional 12 weeks added to the time frame for a total of 64 weeks (crossover group).</description>
