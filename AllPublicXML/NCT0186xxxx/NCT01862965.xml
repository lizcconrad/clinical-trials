    <textblock>
      In this study patients with moderate to severe chronic graft-versus-host disease will be
      treated with a combination of prednisone and everolimus. Patients will be treated on the
      study for a maximum of 12 months and followed up for another 12 months.

      The primary hypothesis of this study is that the addition of everolimus to prednisone
      increases response rates without increasing treatment related mortality or mortality due to
      relapse of underlying disease.

      Background

      2.1 Chronic graft-versus-host disease

      Chronic graft-versus-host disease (cGvHD) is the most common long-term complication of
      allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT), with an incidence of up to
      70% in recipients of peripheral blood stem cells. Chronic GvHD is associated with impaired
      immunity, compromised functional status and quality of life and is besides relapse of
      underlying malignancy still the leading cause of morbidity and mortality beyond day 100 after
      allo-HSCT. The pathophysiology of cGvHD is still not well understood, however efforts made in
      the last years indicate a role of persistent allo-reactive T cells, B cells that produce
      auto- or allo-antibodies against the host antigens as well as donor antigen presenting cells
      (APC) that replace host APCs thus leading to indirect antigen presentation of allo-antigens.
      Persistent alloreactivity may be due to defective peripheral and central tolerance mechanisms
      as a result of failure of control by regulatory T cells (Tregs) and/or impaired negative
      selection of T cells in the thymus.

      Corticosteroids have constituted the backbone of treatment of cGvHD over the past 4 decades.
      Addition of calcineurin inhibitors (CNI) to steroids in first-line therapy did not lead to
      significant improvement of response or patient outcome. The expanding therapeutic arsenal of
      cGvHD also includes many other agents which have been evaluated in second-line therapy such
      as mTOR inhibitors, extracorporeal photopheresis, mycophenolate mofetil, rituximab,
      alemtuzumab, thalidomide, imatinib, pentostatin, low dose methotrexate amongst others. The
      median duration of immunosuppression of 23 months and the high 3 year non-relapse mortality
      of up to 40% emphasize the urgent need for new first line treatment strategies.

      3 Study rationale

      The outcome of patients with chronic GvHDcGvHD treated with corticosteroids alone or in
      combination with CNI like CSA or tacrolimus is still very unsatisfactory with an increased
      relative risk of non-relapse mortality of up to 7 times compared to patients without or only
      mild cGvHD. While corticosteroids are generally accepted to be the backbone of systemic
      therapy, the role of CNI remains questionable. There is thus urgent need for improvement of
      first-line treatment of these patients. mTOR inhibitors like sirolimus (rapamycin) or
      everolimus have been shown to be effective in second-line treatment of cGvHD. In the light of
      these data and given the unmet medical need in the treatment of cGvHD, there is a rationale
      to examine the efficacy of an mTOR inhibitor in first line treatment of these patients with
      cGvHD.

      4 Hypothesis and study objectives

      The primary hypothesis of this study is that the addition of everolimus to prednisone
      increases response rates without increase ofincreasing non-relapse and relapse mortality. In
      contrast to CNI, everolimus may also facilitate the development of tolerance and thereby
      improve the durability of response, thus increasing the time to treatment failure.

      4.1 General objectives

      The main objective of this study is to investigate the clinical benefit of treatment with
      prednisone and everolimus in patients with chronic GvHDcGvHD. Treatment change or time to
      flare-up of cGvHD symptoms has been shown to correlate with survival of patients with cGvHD.
      In this study the addition of secondary treatment will reflect treatment failure and serve as
      a parameter for measuring clinical benefit.

      6.3 Discussion of study design

      Chronic GvHD occurs in about 50% of patients after allogeneic HSCT, more than 80% of whom
      will have moderate or severe disease requiring systemic therapy. The participation of 6
      centres enables the recruitment of 60 patients within 24 months. The follow-up period of 1
      year is sufficient to evaluate time to progression, which has been shown to predict survival.
      There is no control group. The findings of this study will be analysed and discussed in the
      light of historical data and lay the groundwork for a possible randomized study.

      The German-Swiss-Austrian GvHD-group will run a registry prospectively documenting cGvHD
      cases, their treatment and outcome as from 2012. The control population will consist of
      patients treated in the cGvHD registry within the same time period as in this study. A
      comparison to the historical population treated in the placebo arm of the impact of Myfortic®
      in first line treatment of cGvHD [Martin et al.,2009] will also be performed.

      7.4 Sample size estimation

      The sample size estimation is based on data from the placebo arm of the randomized trial led
      by Paul Martin evaluating the impact of additional MMF in the initial treatment of cGvHD
      [data kindly provided by Paul Martin].

      The rate of treatment success at 6 months in the placebo arm of the study (standard treatment
      with prednisone alone or prednisone plus a calcineurin inhibitor) was 62%.

      Assuming a treatment success rate of 65% for patients receiving standard therapy (steroids
      alone or steroids and calcineurin inhibitor) and testing whether the combination of
      prednisone and everolimus would improve the rate of treatment success to 85%, with 80% power
      and a one-sided type error (α) of 5%, then at least 57 patients will need to be recruited.
      This study thus plans to recruit a total of 60 patients. This patient number will enable both
      comparison with patients treated during the same period within the planed cGvHD registry as
      well as a historic comparison with data from the above mentioned study led by Paul Martin.

      8 Diagnosis and grading of cGvHD

      8.1 Overview

      Diagnosis and grading of cGvHD will be according to NIH consensus-criteria. If diagnosis of
      cGvHD depends on skin manifestations, an assessment of a biopsy should be organized by each
      site itself according to local routine. A central review is recommended but not obligatory.

      8.2 Definition of high-risk cGvHD

      High risk cGvHD is defined by one or more of the following criteria being fulfilled at time
      of diagnosis of cGvHD:

        -  &lt; 100,000/µl platelets

        -  progressive onset of cGvHD (see 7.2.1 for definition)

        -  involvement of &gt; 50% of total body surface area

        -  bilirubin &gt; 2 mg/dl

        -  bronchiolitis obliterans

      8.2.1 Definition of progressive onset cGvHD

      Progressive onset cGvHD is defined as acute GvHD preceding cGvHD whereby either

        1. no complete response (CR) of acute GvHD is attained before onset of cGvHD or

        2. the time between CR of aGvHD and onset of symptoms of cGvHD is less than 2 weeks.

      9.3 GvHD prophylaxis and acute GvHD therapy

      9.3.1 GvHD prophylaxis

      Any kind of GvHD prophylaxis may have been used, including mTOR-containing regimens. Type of
      GvHD prophylaxis will be documented and included in the analysis.

      9.3.2 Acute GvHD therapy

      Any kind of acute GvHD therapy may have been used, excluding mTOR inhibitors (everolimus or
      sirolimus).

      9.3.3 Conditioning regimen and stem cell source

        -  Any kind of conditioning regimen (myeloablative or reduced intensity) may have been used
           for transplantation

        -  Stem cell source may have been bone marrow, peripheral blood stem cells or cord blood

        -  Donors may have been related or unrelated, matched or mismatched Conditioning intensity,
           stem cell source donor type and donor/recipient histocompatibility will be documented
           and included in analysis.

      9.6 Patients' evaluation

      9.6.1 Assessment of pre-registration characteristics

      Prior to enrolment in the study patients will be examined for inclusion and exclusion
      criteria. A comprehensive assessment of organ involvement shall be performed according to the
      NIH consensus criteria. The time between this examination and the initiation of study
      treatment should be maximum 14 days.

      9.7 Study monitoring

      9.7.1 Clinical assessment visits

      Regular clinical assessment visits are planned to include patient's physical examination,
      blood counts, blood chemistry and everolimus level.

      9.7.2 Response assessment visits

      Response to treatment will be assessed after 2 weeks, month 1, 3, 6, 9, and 12 after
      initiation of treatment, before introduction of secondary treatment and in case of premature
      study withdrawal. Response assessment will be performed prospectively as described in the
      publication by Martin et al. and retrospectively according to NIH consensus recommendations.

      9.7.3 End of study assessment visits

      Patients going off protocol regularly (after complete response or max. 1 year of treatment)
      or prematurely will undergo response assessment as outlined in section 8.7.2.

      11 Treatment plan

      11.1 Overview

      After diagnosis of cGvHD patients will receive prednisone 1 mg/kg BW orally and everolimus
      (whole tablets or dispersible tablets) orally (targeted trough level 3-8 µg/l). Prednisone
      may also be administered intravenously at 1 mg/kg if patients are unable to take the oral
      formulation. Patients will be treated on the protocol for a maximum of 12 months. Patients
      still responding can continue with treatment off protocol at the discretion of the local
      physician. Patients will be followed-up for another 12 months after their end of protocol
      treatment.

      11.2 Regular dosing and tapering of immunosuppressive drugs

      11.2.1 Stopping of prior calcineurin inhibitors

      If the patient is on a calcineurin inhibitor at time of study inclusion, CNI should be
      tapered and stopped within 1-3 weeks of initiation of study treatment, with an initial
      reduction of 50% at initiation of everolimus. The CNI baseline level should be not higher
      than 100 µg/ml for CSA and not higher than 6 µg/ml for tacrolimus after start of everolimus.

      11.2.2 Stopping of prior mTOR inhibitors

      If the patient is on sirolimus or everolimus prophylaxis at time of study inclusion,
      everolimus will be continued; sirolimus will be switched to everolimus without tapering or
      loading.

      11.2.3 Dosing and recommended tapering of steroids

      The initial dose of prednisone is 1 mg/kg BW given as a single dose in the morning. It is
      recommended to maintain this dose for at least 2 weeks and then taper depending on the
      patient's response (CR or PR), according to appendix 13.1 and 13.2. These tapering
      recommendations are meant to guide tapering speed. Patients with progressive disease after 2
      weeks (&gt; 25% in any organ) will be considered steroid-refractory and require secondary
      therapy.

      11.2.4 Dosing and tapering of everolimus

      The initial dose of everolimus will be 0.75 mg twice daily. The dose shall be adjusted to a
      targeted trough serum level of 3-8 µg/l, measured by HPLC or immunoassay 4 to 5 days after
      the previous dose change. Initial dose reduction may be considered in the presence of a
      co-medication interfering with metabolism of everolimus (see also 10.3.7.) Dose adjustments
      shall be according to clinical judgement of the local physician taking into consideration
      toxicity, serum levels and concomitant medication. Since CNI (particularly CSA) interact with
      everolimus, trough levels of everolimus will need to be readjusted after stopping CNI.

      In patients with abnormal liver function tests the initial dose of everolimus will be 0.25 mg
      twice daily (see Appendix 13.5.5). Increment of daily dose should not surpass 0.5 mg within 1
      week and initial monitoring of everolimus levels should be twice weekly until stable levels
      are attained for 2 weeks. This close monitoring will be repeated in case of any further dose
      modification. In patients who develop abnormal liver functions (as above) while already under
      treatment with everolimus, serum levels of the drug also need to be monitored closely (twice
      weekly), for at least 2 weeks after emergence of abnormal liver function to enable prompt
      dose modification if required.

      After discontinuation of prednisone, patients should be monitored for at least 4 weeks for
      possible recurrence of cGvHD symptoms. In the absence of cGvHD activity, everolimus will be
      tapered off over a period of 12 to 24 weeks at the discretion of the local physician.

      11.2.5 Concomitant therapy

      Additional treatment with topical immunosuppressants like steroids is not considered
      treatment failure and can be given at the discretion of the local physician. Addition of
      secondary systemic immunosuppressive therapy is considered treatment failure as outlined in
      4.1. Prophylaxis of infections, red blood cell and platelet support and antithrombotic
      prophylaxis will be given according to institutional practice. Monitoring for cytomegalovirus
      reactivation and preemptive therapy with antiviral agents will be performed according to
      centres' policy.

      Documentation of adverse events and concomitant medications for each patient will be
      performed from the time a patient signs the informed consent form until the patient
      completes, withdraws or is withdrawn from the study.

      11.3 Management of toxicity and dose modifications

      11.3.1 Toxicity evaluation

      Toxicity will be monitored at least once every month. Monitoring will include physical
      examination, laboratory liver and kidney function tests, blood lipids and blood counts.

      11.3.2 Management of hyperlipidaemia

      Patients with hyperlipidemia should be advised to maintain a diet. They should also receive
      HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors or fibrates. However caution must be taken and patients
      monitored for development of rhabdomyolysis. Everolimus should be continued during the
      treatment of hyperlipidaemia unless the lipid levels are uncontrollable with standard
      therapy. Dose modifications of everolimus for hyperlipidaemia and after diet and appropriate
      treatment with HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors or fibrates should be according to appendix
      13.5.3

      11.3.3 Management of TMA

      TMA shall be documented and reported immediately. In the event of TMA, everolimus shall be
      discontinued. Plasmapheresis may be used at the discretion of the managing physician.
      Prevention of TMA involves avoiding drug levels above target range. High drug levels should
      prompt closer monitoring of hematocrit, platelets, LDH, BUN, creatinine and schistocytes.

      11.3.4 Management of hematotoxicity

      Patients with severe cGvHD often have cytopenia. Cytopenia may also be caused by concomitant
      medication like antiviral drugs or antibiotics or cGvHD itself. Dose modification of
      everolimus will therefore take baseline platelet counts into consideration. Absolute
      neutrophile count (ANC), hematocrit and platelet counts shall be monitored regularly. If
      other causes of cytopenia have been ruled out, everolimus dose will be modified according to
      appendix 13.5.4. GCSF, blood and platelet transfusions may be given at discretion of the
      local physician.

      11.3.5 Management of non-infectious pneumonitis (NIP)

      Symptoms of NIP usually subside completely within one month after cessation of treatment.
      This reversibility will enable differentiation from BOOP. The incidence and outcome of NIP
      will be documented and assessed in this study. Treatment with everolimus will not be
      restarted after diagnosis of NIP.

      11.3.6 Management of other toxicities

      Patients will also be monitored for other toxicities such as edema, arthralgias or aphthous
      ulcers. Efforts will be made to rule out other causes. If other causes of toxicity have been
      ruled out and toxicity is thought to be caused by everolimus and is significant, everolimus
      dose will be decreased to 50%. If symptoms do not improve or resolve after 2 weeks,
      everolimus will be held. If symptoms improve or resolve, everolimus will be restarted at 50%
      and gradually increased to full dose as tolerated. Everolimus can be held for a maximum of 14
      successive days with the patient remaining on study, longer treatment breaks will mean
      premature termination of study treatment.

      11.3.7 Other important considerations

      Serum levels of everolimus are significantly influenced by food intake, thus everolimus
      should be taken at consistent times of the day consistently with or without food to minimize
      variability.

      In appendix 13.5.1 and 13.5.2 drugs are listed which are known to interact with everolimus
      and/or prednisone. During concomitant medication with these drugs, caution should be taken
      and patients seen, at least once weekly to once every two weeks in order to closely monitor
      drug levels and perform clinical examinations for toxicity. Concomitant treatment not
      recommended should only be administered if deemed absolutely necessary.

      Grapefruit juice or St. John's Wort must not be taken during treatment with everolimus.

      Concomitant treatment with voriconazole is not recommended and should be avoided. If use of
      voriconazole is deemed absolutely clinically necessary, dose reduction of everolimus of up to
      90% may be necessary. Concomitant treatment with other azoles like fluconazole or
      posaconazole also requires caution including closer monitoring of everolimus serum levels and
      dose adjustments. Concomitant treatment with atorvastatin, pravastatin or other HMG-CoA
      reductase inhibitors or fibrates requires monitoring of patients for signs of rhabdomyolysis
      and everolimus levels. Patients receiving Ciclosporin or tacrolimus will have these tapered
      and stopped as described in chapter 10.2.1. Everolimus dose will be adjusted thereafter
      according to serum levels.
