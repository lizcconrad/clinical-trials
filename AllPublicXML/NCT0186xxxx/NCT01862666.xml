  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Barrett's esophagus (BE) is a pre-neoplastic condition formed by the metaplasia of the normal
      squamous mucosa of the distal esophagus into a specialized intestinal mucosa. Its development
      is mostly associated with chronic injury from gastroesophageal reflux. BE is widely
      considered the leading risk factor for the development of esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC).

      Volumetric laser endomicroscopy (VLE) can be thought of as an analogous technique to
      ultrasound, however, instead of producing an image from the scattering of sound waves, it
      utilizes optical scattering based on differences in tissue composition to form a
      two-dimensional image. The benefit of VLE over ultrasound is that it is capable of generating
      cross-sectional images of tissues with an axial-resolution of up to 10 micrometers, which is
      comparable to low-power microscopy.

      The proposed trial will evaluate the ability of physicians to use VLE to visualize high grade
      intraepithelial neoplasia (HGIN) or intramucosal adenocarcinoma (IMC) in both the ex-vivo and
      in-vivo setting and correlate those images to standard histology of endoscopic mucosal
      resection specimens as the gold standard.

      The diagnosis of dysplasia and early adenocarcinoma in BE remains challenging. At present,
      endoscopy with biopsy of suspected BE lesions is the only available method. However, the
      endoscopic recognition of early dysplasia in BE relies on the subjective visual recognition
      by an endoscopist. The subtle mucosal variations and early dysplastic changes in the
      esophagus may easily be missed. The development of a wide-field, high resolution endoscopic
      microscopy could enhance the early detection and treatment of dysplasia in BE.

      Endoscopic Mucosal Resection (EMR). With this technique, the mucosa is resected by injecting
      a liquid in the submucosal space, after which the thus created pseudopolyp can be resected
      using a snare and electrocoagulation. The histological processing of the ex-vivo EMR specimen
      will be carried out according to hospital standards
