  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Essential voice tremor is a neurological condition that produces a regular, shaking quality
      in the voice. One form of drug treatment that produces some improvement in tremor of the
      hands is octanoic acid, which is a food additive that is similar to alcohol. Research
      suggests that octanoic acid may reduce tremor in the hands/arms with few side effects and no
      intoxication effects. This study will determine whether octanoic acid may be useful for
      reducing tremor when it affects the voice. Researchers are hypothesizing that octanoic acid
      will reduce the effects of tremor on the voice.

      Background:

        -  Essential tremor of the voice produces regular shaking and hoarseness in the voice,
           making it difficult speech difficult to understand

        -  Several previous studies have found that octanoic acid and octanol, which are related to
           alcohol, can improve tremor in some people without producing many side effects and
           without producing intoxication

        -  Researchers are interested in determining whether octanoic acid can improve tremor that
           affects the voice

      Objectives:

        -  To determine the effects of octanoic voice using voice recordings and listener ratings
           of voice

        -  To determine the effects of octanoic acid on level of voice disability experienced by
           people with essential voice tremor
