  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Interstitial lung disease (ILD) is characterised by inflammation and scarring of the lung and
      is the leading cause of death in patients with systemic sclerosis, and contributes
      significantly to morbidity and mortality in many other connective tissue diseases (CTDs) such
      as polymyositis/dermatomyositis and mixed connective tissue disease. When ILD is extensive
      and/or progressive, immunosuppressive medication is often required to stabilize lung disease
      and alleviate symptoms. Current standard care for CTD associated ILD is extrapolated from
      studies performed in individuals with systemic sclerosis and comprises low dose
      corticosteroids and intravenous cyclophosphamide followed by oral azathioprine. In some
      individuals even this intensive immunosuppression is insufficient to prevent deterioration,
      and in a significant minority of affected individuals this results in respiratory failure and
      death. Rituximab has recently been reported as an effective 'rescue therapy' for stabilizing
      and even improving ILD in this patient group. Based on observations gained from this
      experience, the investigators believe that rituximab is a potential important alternative to
      current best therapy for this patient group. This study has therefore been initiated to
      evaluate the efficacy of rituximab (compared with standard therapy) in patients with
      progressive CTD related ILD.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Age 18 to 80 years at visit 1

          -  A diagnosis of connective tissue disease, based on internationally accepted criteria,
             in one of the following categories21-24: (see Appendix 1 for details)

               -  Systemic sclerosis

               -  Idiopathic interstitial myopathy (including polymyositis/dermatomyositis)

               -  Mixed connective tissue disease

          -  Severe and/or progressive interstitial lung disease associated with the underlying
             connective tissue disease.

          -  Chest HRCT performed within 12 months of study visit 1

          -  Intention of the caring physician to treat the ILD with intravenous cyclophosphamide
             (with treatment indications including deteriorating symptoms attributable to ILD,
             deteriorating lung function tests, worsening gas exchange or extent of ILD at first
             presentation) and where there is a reasonable expectation that immunosuppressive
             treatment with stabilize or improve CTD-ILD. In individuals with scleroderma it is
             anticipated that subjects will fulfil the criteria for extensive disease defined by
             Goh et al19

             leukoencephalopathy; PML). Neurological symptoms arising as a consequence of the
             underlying CTD do not necessitate exclusion.

          -  Other investigational therapy (participation in research trial) received within 8
             weeks of visit 1

          -  Immunosuppressive therapy (other than corticosteroids) received within 2 weeks of
