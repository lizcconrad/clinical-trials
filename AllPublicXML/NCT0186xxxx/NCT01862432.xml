  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      At birth, the passage from intrauterine to the aerial life can be considered as one of the
      most stressful and painful life events. Skin-to-skin contact (STSC) with mother is known to
      provide numerous virtues and World Health Organisation (WHO) recently supported the
      introduction of such care among healthy, term-born neonates. Here, the investigators
      hypothesized that immediate STSC could reduce neonatal, birth-evoked stress and pain. This
      randomized controlled trial (RCT) aimed to compare the pain and stress response of C-section
      born neonates that received either immediate STSC with mother (intervention) or classical
      support and monitoring (control).

      Women are recruited before elective c-section.

      Randomizatiion is performed just before the operation.

      Control group:

      The operation is performed as usual, with observation of the newborn by medical staff. The
      newborn is then wrapped in a blanket and given to the father.

      Intervention group:

      The newborn is given to the mother in the first minute of life, placed on her chest to allow
      complete skin-to-skin contact. Observation of the baby is performed in this position. The
      skin-to-skin contact lasts as long as the operation is not completed or the mother is not
      able anymore to keep her baby on her chest.

      Sampling (in both groups):

        -  salivary samples are obtained with salivettes from the mother 1)before the operation and
           2) after the operation, in the recovery room (90 minutes after birth).

        -  salivary samples are obtained with salivettes from the newborn 1) 20 minutes after birth
           and 2) 20 minutes after the vitamin K injection (performed at 60 minutes of life)

        -  A cord blood sample is obtained for prolactin, ACTH and cortisol analysis.

      Video recording:

      The newborn is video recorded at the vitamin K injection (from 1 minute before the injection
      to 5 minutes after) for analysis with the Neonatal Infant Pain Scale.

      Satisfaction:

      The mother's satisfaction is evaluated with a questionnaire 24 to 48 hours after birth.

      Breastfeeding:

      The breastfeeding is evaluated by a research nurse 1) at the hospital and 2) by phone
      interviews, up to 6 months after birth.
