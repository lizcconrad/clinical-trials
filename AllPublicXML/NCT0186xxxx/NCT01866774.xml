    <textblock>
      Triaging new pediatric gastroenterology consultations is challenging as both inflammatory and
      non-inflammatory gastrointestinal (GI) diseases can present with non-specific chronic
      abdominal pain and/or diarrhea. Examples of inflammatory GI diseases include Crohn's disease,
      ulcerative colitis and celiac disease and non-inflammatory GI diseases lactose intolerance,
      irritable bowel syndrome and non-ulcer dyspepsia. Inflammatory GI diseases require different
      investigations and treatment than non-inflammatory GI diseases and ideally, would be
      identified early. Higher priority triage of these patients would allow timely organization of
      further investigations including pertinent laboratory testing, radiologic studies and
      gastrointestinal endoscopies. These more invasive procedures are not needed in most patients
      presenting with non-specific gastrointestinal symptoms. Therefore, the investigators do not
      routinely ask for screening laboratory testing or other studies in children referred to our
      clinic.

      Non-invasive screening tests for GI disorders may aid in appropriately triaging new
      consultations to pediatric gastroenterology. Calprotectin is a protein found in inflammatory
      cells called neutrophils. The concentration of calprotectin in stool reflects the presence of
      an inflammatory process occurring in the GI tract. Thus, testing for calprotectin has been
      proposed as a potentially useful test for detecting some inflammatory GI diseases, most
      notably Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. Alternatively, a simple gastrointestinal
      questionnaire of &quot;red flag&quot; symptoms and family history of GI disorders may also be of
      benefit. The investigators hypothesize that the use of fecal calprotectin and a screening GI
      questionnaire will aid in identifying children at higher risk of an inflammatory GI disorder.
      Subsequently, higher priority triaging of these patients will decrease the time to diagnosis
      of inflammatory GI disease.

      This will be a single centre, stratified, randomized clinical trial conducted in Kingston,
      Ontario, Canada. Patients referred to the pediatric gastroenterology service without a known
      diagnosis for non-specific chronic abdominal pain and/or diarrhea will be asked to
      participate in the study. All patients who meet the inclusion criteria will be consented by
      telephone with a standard form. Consenting patients will be mailed the GI questionnaire and
      the fecal calprotectin test kit. The fecal calprotectin test kid includes instructions, a
      stool collection kit and return postage. All patients will be given the next available
      appointment with a pediatric gastroenterologist. Patients will then be randomized to receive
      either usual care (50%, 40 patients) or to have a screening fecal calprotectin (FC)
      measurement (50%, 40 patients). Patients in the FC group will have FC measured by the Quantum
      Blue® Rapid Calprotectin Assay. If the calprotectin level is high (above 50 μg/g), the
      patient will be contacted again by telephone and given a new appointment time (within 14
      working days). This study may have a positive impact by demonstrating a novel method for
      decreasing the time to diagnosis of inflammatory GI disease.
