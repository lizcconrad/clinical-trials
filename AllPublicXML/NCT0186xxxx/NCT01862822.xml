  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Urinary tract infection (UTI) is a frequently suspected cause of fever in young children,
      justifying urine cultures. Sampling procedures are decisive for the reliability of UTI
      diagnosis. Even though official guidelines recommend clean catch method, catheterization or
      suprapubic aspiration, urine bag collection remains widely used. In our experience, the rate
      of contaminated bag-obtained cultures reaches 30.2 %. In a recent study, the investigators
      have noticed that the rate of contaminated urine cultures was lower when children were kept
      in an upright position at the time of urine collection. The upright position could explain
      this decrease, perineum being less in contact with urine. These results are borderline
      significant, the investigators would like to confirm them with a specific study.
