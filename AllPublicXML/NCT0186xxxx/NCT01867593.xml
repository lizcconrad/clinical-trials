    <textblock>
      This research study is a prospective pilot study. The purpose of a pilot clinical study is to
      obtain preliminary data to support the reason for doing a larger clinical trial on testing
      the clinical effectiveness of an investigational intervention. &quot;Investigational&quot; means that
      the role of MET-PET scans is still being studied and that research doctors are trying to find
      out more about it. It also means that the FDA has not approved this intervention for your
      type cancer.

      In this research study, the investigators are evaluating whether or not MET-PET scans have
      value in predicting response to standard chemoradiation therapy in participants with
      newly-diagnosed glioblastoma. A standard treatment for glioblastoma is treatment with a
      combination of radiation therapy and chemotherapy with the drug temozolomide.

      In PET scans, a radioactive substance is injected into the body. The scanning machine finds
      the radioactive substance, which tends to go to cancer cells. With standard PET scans, the
      radioactive substance used is FDG. FDG goes to many areas of the normal brain which makes it
      difficult for use in distinguishing brain tumors from normal tissue.

      For the PET scans in this research study, the investigators are using a radioactive substance
      called MET, instead of the standard substance FDG. MET gets absorbed by cancer cells but not
      by normal brain and therefore may be better than FDG in evaluating brain tumors and therefore
      may be better than FDG in evaluating brain tumors and their response to treatment.

      In this research study, participants will receive standard chemotherapy and radiation therapy
      for glioblastoma as well as standard MRI scans. In addition, participants will undergo
      L-[Methyl]-11C Methionine Positron Emission Tomography (MET-PET) scans twice. The first
      MET-PET scan will occur after enrollment but prior to radiation therapy. The second MET-PET
      scan will occur approximately one month after completion of radiation therapy.

      After agreeing to take part in this research study you will be asked to undergo some
      screening tests or procedures to confirm that you are eligible. Many of these tests and
      procedures are likely to be part of regular cancer care and may be done even if it turns out
      that you do not take part in the research study. If you have had some of these tests or
      procedure recently, they may or may not have to be repeated. The screening process will
      include the following: A medical history, performance status, physical exam, routine blood
      tests, assessment of your tumor, diagnosis confirmation and pregnancy test. If these tests
      show that you are eligible to participate in the research study, you will begin the study
      treatment. If you do not meet the eligibility criteria, you will not be able to participate
      in this research study.

      Within 3 weeks after your surgery you will undergo a MET-PET scan to define residual
      metabolic activity.

      After completion of radiation therapy at 1,3,5,7,9 and 11 months following radiation therapy
      you will undergo: a medical history, physical exam, assessment of your tumor by MRI,
      documentation of your current dose of steroids, blood tests and an evaluation for side
      effects.

      At one month after the completion of radiation therapy you will undergo the second and final
      MET-PET scan to assess response to therapy.

      After the 11 month follow-up visit, we would like to keep track of your medical condition for
      the rest of your life as part of our routine care. If we no longer see you in person in the
      clinic, we would like to do this by calling you on the telephone once a year to see how you
      are doing. Keeping in touch with you and checking your condition every year helps us look at
      the long-term effects of the research study.
