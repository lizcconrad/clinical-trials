  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This pilot study will test the feasibility and acceptability of a 12 week combined aerobic
      and strength training intervention among persons with HIV who are age 50 or older and do not
      exercise frequently, and its preliminary effects on aging-related outcomes . The study uses
      an randomized, controlled trial design and is intended to lead to a larger clinical trial
      with long-term follow-up. The intervention incorporates small group instruction from a
      trainer, a small wearable accelerometer to provide accurate data on physical activity, and
      real-time feedback to participants about exercise levels. The primary outcome measure will be
      changes in fitness, measured as change in maximal oxygen consumption (VO2 max). The control
      group will receive a comparable exercise intervention after they complete 12 weeks of
      observation.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Approximately 40 individuals with HIV infection of at least 6 months duration who currently
      exercise infrequently will be randomized in a 2:1 ratio to either Intervention Arm (immediate
      exercise intervention program for 12 weeks duration), or the Control Arm (observation only
      for 12 weeks duration followed by treatment onset after observation is completed).

      Persons assigned to the Intervention Arm will meet initially once per week with a personal
      trainer, and once per week in small groups with a personal trainer, for a total of two weekly
      sessions of assisted strength training. In addition, participants will be encouraged to
      engage in three sessions of aerobic exercise per week of gradually increasing intensity of
      about 40 minutes duration each, for the 12 week intervention period. Instruction in walking
      and running form and body awareness that may reduce the risk of injuries (ChiWalking and
      ChiRunning technique) will be provided to the Intervention Arm by a certified coach during
      three sessions over the course of the 12 week intervention period as part of the aerobic
      exercise plan.

      Paid gym memberships will be provided for the 12 week treatment period for both groups
      (memberships for participants assigned to the Control Arm will not begin until the end of the
      12 week observation period).

      Data will be collected for strength training activity using the passive FitLinxx system at
      the study gym, and for aerobic steps and pace using accelerometers (Pebble by FitLinxx).
      Participants in both groups will be asked to wear accelerometers for the duration of the
      study period.

      Participants will be evaluated at baseline, week 6 and week 12 for changes in lab values and
      questionnaire items. Change in fitness will be assessed using V02 max at baseline and week
      12.

    <description>The exercise intervention has three components: (1) aerobic exercise with a metabolic equivalent of task (MET) energy expenditure of at least 900 MET-minutes per week; (2) strength training consisting of 2 sets of 4 upper body exercises (bench press, seated row, shoulder press, and pull down), 3 sets of 3 leg exercises (leg press, extension, and flexion) and 2 sets each of abdominal crunches and back extensions. Weights for each exercise will be gradually increased as participants can complete 12 repetitions for each set on 2 consecutive sessions, with participants performing strength training twice per week total. Three workshops on using ChiWalking or ChiRunning technique for achievement of aerobic activity goals will be provided to participants in the experimental arm.</description>
