  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Studying the morphology and function of the normal and diseased retina in vivo is needed for
      advancing the detection, diagnosis, and treatment of retinal disease. This protocol uses an
      adaptive optics scanning laser ophthalmoscope (AOSLO) to image the normal and diseased retina
      with individual cellular resolution non-invasively. The primary objective of this study is to
      obtain and analyze high-resolution images of the retina, in particular by imaging the cone
      photoreceptor mosaic, the retinal vasculature and other retinal layers. The study design will
      involve case-control studies, where cases are followed over time. Subjects age 7 and older
      may be invited to participate. The main research procedure involves retinal imaging with the
      AOSLO. The primary endpoint is the observation of differences in retinal images between
      subjects with and without retinal diseases. These changes will be quantified by examining the
      cell density, size, spacing and regularity of the cone photoreceptor mosaic, as well as
      examining the differences between other retinal layers.

        Individuals age 7 and older will be recruited for purposes of this study. Adults must have
        the capacity to give informed consent. Subjects age 7 to 17 will need parent/guardian
        consent to participate in the study. Subjects aged 7 to 17 will need to assent to
        participate in the study. We will recruit subjects with both normal (disease-free) retinas
        and subjects with retinal degenerations including Leber's Congenital Amaurosis, Stargardt's
        Dystrophy, retinitis pigmentosa, age-related macular degeneration, Choroideremia,
        Geographic Atrophy, etc. Subjects will not be excluded based on ethnic or racial
        background; we expect that enrollment will be split evenly between males and females.
