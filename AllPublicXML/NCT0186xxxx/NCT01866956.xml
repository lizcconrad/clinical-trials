      The KSADS-COMP will facilitate identification of comorbid psychiatric and substance use
      diagnoses frequently missed in clinical practice, and improve adolescent treatment outcomes.
      The self-administered version of the KSADS-COMP can also be used cost-effectively in schools
      and juvenile justice settings where there is a growing interest in early identification and
      referral of youth in need of mental health services. The KSADS-Bridge assessment tool with
      its RDoC neurocognitive tasks, when completed with the self- or clinician administered
      KSADS-COMP, will help to create cross-talk between the DSM and RDoC diagnostic perspectives,
      and begin to generate a database on the relationship between RDoC constructs and treatment
      outcomes across a range of diagnostic categories.

      This Phase II SBIR grant is a follow-up to the Phase I SBIR grant &quot;Computerized Screening for
      Comorbidity in Adolescents with Substance or Psychiatric Disorders.&quot; During Phase I, parent
      and adolescent self administered computerized versions of the psychiatric interview, the
      Kiddie Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia (KSADS), were developed to assess
      DSM-IVR diagnoses in adolescents. Since the funding of the Phase I grant, there have been two
      significant developments in the field: the American Psychiatric Association's release of the
      DSM-5 manual, and NIMH's launch of the Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) initiative that aims
      to create the necessary database to derive a new psychiatric nomenclature informed by
      neuroscience, genetics, and psychology. The primary goals of Phase II include: 1) Update the
      parent and adolescent self-administered computerized KSADS (KSADS-COMP) so it is compatible
      with DSM-5 criteria; 2) Develop software for a clinician-administered computerized KSADS
      (KSADS-COMP); 3) Create a KSADS- Bridge product that includes a battery of RDoC computerized
      neurocognitive tasks that can be completed with the self- or clinician-administered
      KSADS-COMP; and 4) Examine the criterion, convergent, and discriminant validity of the
      self-administered KSADS-COMP, and the relationship among DSM-5 diagnoses, dimensional
      measures of psychopathology, and performance on RDoC neurocognitive tasks. Ultimately the aim
      of this initiative is to create an instrument that, in addition to providing a reliable
      comprehensive assessment tool for psychiatric disorders in adolescents, can bridge DSM-5 and
      RDoC diagnostic perspectives. A sample of 400 adolescents and their parents will be recruited
      for this study: half will complete the self-administered KSADS-COMP; the other half will
      complete the clinician-administered KSADSCOMP. All 400 adolescents and their parents, in
      addition to completing one of the KSADS-COMP versions, will also complete a battery of
      dimensional symptom rating scales. A subset of 210 adolescents and their parents will then
      complete the other version of the KSADS-COMP to test diagnostic concordance between the self-
      and clinician-administered KSADS-COMP. To obtain reliable Kappa estimates, this subset will
      include 30 adolescents with no psychopathology and 30 adolescents that meet criteria for each
      of the following diagnoses: conduct disorder, major depression, bipolar; substance use
      disorders; post traumatic stress disorder; and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. This
      subset of 210 adolescents will also be administered the RDoC battery of neurocognitive
      computerized tasks. The KSADS-COMP and KSADS-Bridge assessment tools will have multiple
      clinical and research applications. In addition to helping identify comorbidity in teens with
      substance or psychiatric disorders, it will help to create the cross-talk needed between the
      DSM and RDoC diagnostic perspectives, and will help to improve clinical care in the short-
      and long-run as the field aims to transition to a new psychiatric nomenclature.
