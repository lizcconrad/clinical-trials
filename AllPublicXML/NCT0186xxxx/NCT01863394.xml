    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to determine the efficacity of a community strategy for
      screening children 06-59 months old for Severe Acute Malnutrition (SAM) conducted by their
      mothers' compared with a community screening strategy conducted by Community Health Workers.

    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Coverage of the the therapeutic nutritional treatment program is defined as the proportion of children 06-59 months with Severe Acute Malnutrition (Mid Upper Arm Circumference &lt;115mm and/or oedema) receiving treatment in the program, amongst the total number of children diagnosed with Severe Acute Malnutrition</description>

    <description>One Community Health Worker (CHW) will be trained per village in the comparator arm. The training the CHWs receive will be identical to that delivered in the Community Management of Acute Malnutrition program run by ALIMA/BEFEN (Bien Être de la Femme et l'Enfant Niger) over the last 3 years. This involves 6 hours theoretical training and a practical session in the health centre.
CHWs will screen children 06-59 months in their village once a month</description>

    <arm_group_label>Screening by mothers</arm_group_label>
    <arm_group_type>Experimental</arm_group_type>
    <description>Mothers in the intervention health district will be trained in small womens' groups in their village. Training will have a theoretical component and a practical demonstration component on children in the village
During the first baseline door to door mass screening campaign, mothers will also receive individual training on conducting a Mid Upper Arm Circumference (MUAC) classification and looking for pedal oedema. they will receive a brief recap during the three monthly door-to-door mass screening campaigns
Mothers will be asked to check their child's MUAC and look for pedal oedema
whenever the child does not seem to be in 'good health' to the mother
whenever the mother feels that the child is 'unwell' or 'sick'
whenever it seems to the mother that her child has lost weight
whenever the mother thinks that it is necessary to do so</description>
