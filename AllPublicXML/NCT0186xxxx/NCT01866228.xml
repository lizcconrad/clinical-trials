  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The time period from diagnosis through to the end of treatment is challenging for patients.
      Patients need information, assistance with decision making, and emotional and social support
      to help cope with their diagnosis and treatment. The first meeting with the cancer doctor is
      especially anxiety-provoking for patients who will learn, for the first time, their treatment
      options and likelihood of being cured. This anxiety causes many patients to have difficulty
      remembering the important pieces of information that their cancer doctor tells them during
      this consultation. The main goal of this study is to demonstrate the benefits of giving
      cancer patients an audio-recording of their first consultation with their cancer doctor. The
      investigators will include newly diagnosed patients from cancer centres in Winnipeg and
      Calgary. The types of cancer that will be included in this study are brain and
      neuroendocrine. Patients with these types of cancer are more likely to have confused
      thinking, and therefore may have the most to gain from receiving their consultation
      recordings. The study will include 244 patients, and those who sign consent forms to
      participate will be assigned by chance to either receive their treatment consultation
      recording or not. Patients will receive their recording immediately after their consultation,
      and will be able to listen to the recording at any time either alone, or with family and
      friends. To figure out whether the consultation recording provides patients with benefits,
      the investigators will administer some questionnaires to patients at 1 week after the
      consultation, and again at 3 and 6 months after the consultation. These questionnaires will
      assess the following patient outcomes: i) anxiety and depression, ii) perception of being
      informed about the disease and treatment, iii) satisfaction with cancer care, iv)
      satisfaction with the doctor, and v) the extent to which patients are satisfied with their
      degree of involvement in treatment decision making. The investigators hypothesize that
      patients who receive their consultation recording will experience more benefits than patients
      who do not receive their consultation recording.
