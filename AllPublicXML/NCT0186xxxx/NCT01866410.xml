      This phase II trial studies how well cabozantinib-s-malate and erlotinib hydrochloride works
      in treating patients with previously treated metastatic non-small cell lung cancer.
      Cabozantinib-s-malate and erlotinib hydrochloride may stop the growth of tumor cells by
      blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Cabozantinib-s-malate may also stop the
      growth of non-small cell lung cancer by blocking blood flow to the tumor. Giving
      cabozantinib-s-malate together with erlotinib hydrochloride may be an effective treatment for
      non-small cell lung cancer.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate for efficacy by response rate (RR) when patients with advanced non-small cell
      lung cancer (NSCLC) harboring an epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutation who have
      progressed following EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) therapy are treated with XL184
      (cabozantinib [cabozantinib-s-malate]) and erlotinib (erlotinib hydrochloride).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine progression free survival (PFS) for combination XL184 (cabozantinib) and
      erlotinib in EGFR mutation positive patients following progression on erlotinib.

      II. Assess overall survival. III. Evaluate change in tumor growth rate on XL184
      (cabozantinib) and erlotinib.

      IV. Evaluate type, severity, duration and outcome of toxicities. V. Correlate outcome with
      tumor biomarkers such as met proto-oncogene (MET) amplification, T790M mutation, and serum
      markers of the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and MET pathways in a preliminary
      manner.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive cabozantinib-s-malate orally (PO) daily and erlotinib hydrochloride PO once
      daily (QD) on days 1-28. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression
      or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 12 weeks for 1 year and
      then annually thereafter.

               -  To the thoracic cavity, abdomen, or pelvis within 2 weeks before the first dose
                  of study treatment, or has ongoing complications, or is without complete recovery
                  and healing from prior radiation therapy

               -  To bone or brain metastasis within 14 days before the first dose of study
                  treatment

               -  To any other site(s) within 28 days before the first dose of study treatment

          -  The subject has received prior treatment with a small molecule kinase inhibitor or a
             hormonal therapy (including investigational kinase inhibitors or hormones) within 14
             days or five half-lives of the compound or active metabolites, whichever is longer,
             before the first dose of study treatment; prior erlotinib is required and does not
             require a 14-day wash out

          -  The subject has received any other type of investigational agent within 28 days before
             the first dose of study treatment

          -  The subject has not recovered to baseline or Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse
             Events (CTCAE) =&lt; grade 1 from toxicity due to all prior therapies except alopecia and
             other non-clinically significant adverse events (AEs)

          -  The subject has a primary brain tumor

          -  The subject has active brain metastases or epidural disease; subjects with brain
             metastases previously treated with whole brain radiation or radiosurgery or subjects
             with epidural disease previously treated with radiation or surgery who are
             asymptomatic and do not require steroid treatment for at least 2 weeks before starting
             study treatment are eligible; baseline brain imaging with contrast-enhanced CT or MRI
             scans for subjects with known brain metastases is required to confirm eligibility

          -  The subject has prothrombin time (PT)/ International Normalized Ratio (INR) or partial
             thromboplastin time (PTT) test &gt;= 1.3 x the laboratory ULN within 14 days before the

          -  The subject requires concomitant treatment, in therapeutic doses, with anticoagulants
             such as warfarin or warfarin-related agents, heparin, thrombin or Factor Xa
             inhibitors, or antiplatelet agents (e.g., clopidogrel); low dose aspirin (=&lt; 81
             mg/day), low-dose warfarin (=&lt; 1 mg/day), and prophylactic low molecular weight
             heparin (LMWH) are permitted

          -  Strong cytochrome P450 (CYP)3A4 inducers and inhibitors should be avoided; selection
             of alternate concomitant medications with no or minimal CYP3A4 enzyme inhibition
             potential is recommended; because the lists of these agents are constantly changing,
             it is important to regularly consult a frequently-updated list such as
             http://medicine.iupui.edu/clinpharm/ddis/table.aspx; medical reference texts such as
             the Physicians' Desk Reference may also provide this information; as part of the
             enrollment/informed consent procedures, the patient will be counseled on the risk of
             interactions with other agents, and what to do if new medications need to be
             prescribed or if the patient is considering a new over-the-counter medicine or herbal
             product

                       first dose of study treatment

                    -  History of organ transplant

                    -  Concurrent uncompensated hypothyroidism or thyroid dysfunction within 14
                       days before the first dose of study treatment

                    -  History of major surgery as follows:

                         -  Major surgery within 8 weeks of the first dose of cabozantinib, with
                            complete wound healing; (patients with ongoing wound healing or other
                            complications will be excluded)

                         -  Minor surgery within 4 weeks of the first dose of cabozantinib; Pleurx
                            catheter placement within 7 days of the first dose of cabozantinib

          -  The subject is unable to swallow tablets

          -  The subject has a corrected QT interval calculated by the Fridericia formula (QTcF) &gt;
             500 ms within 28 days before treatment; note: if initial QTcF is found to be &gt; 500 ms,
             two additional electrocardiograms (EKGs) separated by at least 3 minutes should be
             performed; if the average of these three consecutive results for QTcF is =&lt; 500 ms,
             the subject meets eligibility in this regard

          -  The subject is unable or unwilling to abide by the study protocol or cooperate fully
             with the investigator or designee

          -  The subject has had evidence within 2 years of the start of study treatment of another
             malignancy which required systemic treatment

          -  History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic
             composition to XL184 (cabozantinib) or erlotinib

          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study; breastfeeding should be discontinued if
             the mother is treated with XL184 (cabozantinib); these potential risks may also apply
             to other agents used in this study

          -  Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive patients on combination antiretroviral
             therapy are ineligible; appropriate studies will be undertaken in patients receiving
             combination antiretroviral therapy when indicated
