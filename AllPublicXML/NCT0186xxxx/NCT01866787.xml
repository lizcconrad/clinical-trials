  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this observational study is to evaluate the baroreceptor function in relation
      to surgical inflammation and orthostatic intolerance after elective hip arthroplasty.

      The main hypothesis is that baroreceptor function is attenuated after surgery and related to
      surgical inflammation.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Orthostatic intolerance and hypotension is prevalent during early mobilization after major
      surgery.

      This observational study aims to evaluate the baroreceptor function during using a
      standardized evaluation protocol before, 6- and 24 hours after elective primary unilateral
      hip-arthroplasty.

      The study hypothesis is that baroreceptor function as expressed by the valsalva ratio is
      attenuated after surgery and related to surgical inflammation.
