        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Male and female patients ≥ 18 to ≤ 65 years of age with or without documented coronary
             artery disease.

          -  Taking statin therapy for at least 30 days prior to Screening (Visit 1).

          -  In the opinion of the investigator, patient currently on statin therapy other than
             atorvastatin 40 mg or rosuvastatin 20 mg or atorvastatin 80 mg or rosuvastatin 40 mg
             who could be switched to one of these regimens at Visit 1 for the duration of the
             study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Clinically significant heart disease which will require coronary bypass, PCI, cardiac
             transplantation, surgical repair and/or replacement during the course of the study.

          -  Coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) procedure within the past 90 days.

          -  Have a body mass index (BMI) greater than 36 kg/m2.

          -  Patients of East Asian descent (due to pharmacological food effect noted for
             rosuvastatin).

          -  Previous or current diagnosis of severe heart failure (NYHA Class III-IV) or a
             documented left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of &lt; 25% as determined by
             contrast left ventriculography, radionuclide ventriculography or echocardiography. The
             absence of an LVEF measurement in a patient without a previous or current diagnosis of
             heart failure does not prohibit entry into the study.

          -  Patients with evidence of cardiac electrophysiologic instability including a history
             of uncontrolled ventricular arrhythmias, uncontrolled atrial fibrillation/flutter or
             uncontrolled supraventricular tachycardias with a ventricular response heart rate of &gt;
             100 beats per minute at rest within 4 weeks prior to Visit 1.

          -  Evidence of renal impairment

          -  Have hypertension that is uncontrolled defined as 2 consecutive measurements of
             sitting blood pressure of systolic &gt;160 mmHg or diastolic &gt; 95 mmHg at Visit 1.

          -  Women of child-bearing potential who do not agree to use two reliable methods of birth
             control during the study and for one month following the last dose of study drug, or
             pregnant or nursing (lactating) women. Where pregnancy is defined as the state of a
             female after conception and until the termination of gestation, confirmed by a
             positive ß-hCG laboratory test (≥ 5 IU/L) at the time of enrollment. Where women of
             child-bearing potential are defined as women not surgically sterilized and between
             menarche and 1 year post menopause, and a reliable method of birth control includes
             use of oral contraceptives or levonorgestrel; or a reliable barrier method of birth
             control (diaphragms; cervical caps; condoms; intrauterine devices; partner with
             vasectomy; or abstinence).

          -  Current or recent (within 12 month prior to Visit 1) treatment with immunosuppressants
             (e.g., Cyclosporine).

          -  Triglycerides &gt; 4.5 mmol/L at screening Visit 1.

             distribution, metabolism or excretion of medication including, but not limited to any
             of the following: cholecystitis, Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, or any gastric
             bypass alteration.

          -  Evidence of hepatic disease

          -  A total bilirubin that is &gt; ULN by local laboratory at screening, Visit 1

          -  History of malignancy of any organ system, treated or untreated, within the past 5
             years of Visit 1 whether or not there is evidence of local recurrence or metastases,
             with the exception of localized basal cell carcinoma of the skin.

          -  History or evidence of drug or alcohol abuse within 12 months of Visit 1.

          -  Current dependence on nicotine containing products.

          -  Any surgical or medical condition, which in the opinion of the investigator, may place
             the patient at higher risk from his/her participation in the study, or is likely to
             prevent the patient from complying with the requirements of the study or completing
             the study.

          -  Use of any HIV and/or chemotherapy drugs, and/or antibiotics within 30 days or 5
             half-lives of Visit 2, whichever is longer.

          -  Use of other investigational drugs and devices at the time of enrollment, or within 30
             days or 5 half-lives of Visit 2, whichever is longer.

          -  History of noncompliance to medical regimens or unwillingness to comply with the study
             protocol.

          -  Any condition that in the opinion of the investigator would confound the evaluation
             and interpretation of efficacy and/or safety data.

          -  Persons directly involved in the execution of this protocol.
