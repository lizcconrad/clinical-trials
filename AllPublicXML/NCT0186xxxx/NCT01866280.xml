      The purpose of this study is to test the effects of sleep and meal timing, independent of
      sleep duration, on glucose regulation and metabolic and hormonal control of energy balance in
      normal weight adults.

      This study will be a 4-phase, randomized controlled study of 5 days each in which
      participants will undergo 2 phases of late sleep times that differ in meal timing (normal or
      late) and 2 phases of normal sleep times that differ in meal timing (normal or late).

      The Aims and Hypotheses of this study are:

      Aim 1: To compare hormonal regulation of food intake and metabolic risk markers in response
      to altered sleep and meal timing.

        -  Hypothesis 1: There will be an interaction between sleep and meal time on glucose,
           insulin, and glucose and insulin area under the curve after the glucose tolerance test
           such that the late sleep/late meal will result in the worst metabolic profile, normal
           sleep/late meal and late sleep/normal meal will have an intermediate profile, and normal
           sleep/normal meal will result in the best metabolic profile.

        -  Hypothesis 2: There will be an interaction between sleep and meal time on leptin and
           ghrelin concentrations such that the late sleep/late meal timing phase will result in
           low leptin/high ghrelin, normal sleep/late meal timing and late sleep/normal meal will
           have an intermediate profile, and normal sleep/normal meal timing will result in high
           leptin/low ghrelin.

      Aim 2: To compare food intake over a 24-h period in response to altered sleep and meal
      timing.

      â€¢ Hypothesis 3: Energy and fat intakes will be greater during the late sleep timing phase
      compared to normal sleep timing.
