  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Psychological mindedness(PM) is a meta cognitive process in which the person uses his
      cognitive and affective abilities to better understand his thoughts, feelings, and his
      behaviors as they interact with his internal experiences and his external experiences in the
      world, and dynamically modifies his behavior to move towards self actualization, in a manner
      positive to himself and the world. We investigate whether assessment of PM can distinguish
      depressed patients who benefit from CBT.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cognitive Behavior Therapy (CBT) was found to be the most effective psychotherapy for
      depression. Yet, it is effective only for 40% of the depressed people who receive this
      treatment. Until this day there is no method of predicting whom can be helped among depressed
      patients by CBT. In this study we examine whether level of psychological mindedness can
      predict who may benefit from CBT among depressed patients. Subjects who are found to be
      clinically depressed are given 14 sessions of CBT.

      The screening procedure for this study includes a 20-30 minute telephone or in-person
      interview. Clinical staff members trained in diagnostic interviewing will conduct an initial
      phone interview to determine likely diagnostic suitability. If the subject is deemed
      preliminarily eligible for participation, meaning he or she is clinically depressed, they
      will then be invited for an in-person psychiatric evaluation conducted at the Depression
      Evaluation Services at New York State Psychiatric Institute.

      Upon arrival the subject will read the Depression Evaluation Services consent form for
      evaluation.Questions will be answered and the consent will be offered to read and sign,if
      agreeable. The evaluation will include a clinical interview, a structured clinical interview
      (the SCID-IV), collection of blood samples for routine medical tests, including thyroid
      function tests, and a urine sample [for urine analysis and toxicology screen].

      Important to note: subjects who enroll in the study need to not take any psychiatric
      medications or they must be on the same medications for 3 months and the same dose for 4
      weeks. During the psychotherapy, the patients will continue to see their own physician for
      medications. Medication management will NOT be within the province of this protocol. During
      the study there will be an ongoing consultation with the outside physician, particularly with
      regard to changes in medication and/or dosage. Should the MD or patient decide to make
      alternations in use of medication, this will not affect the patient's participation in
      psychotherapy or in this study.

      Subjects who were found to be eligible for the study will return within two weeks after the
      evaluation visit. An evaluator will rate the HDRS-17 and CG I-Severity.If they are still
      eligible, they will be asked to sign the study consent form, have the study explained,
      including its risks and possible benefits, as well as alternatives and its voluntary nature.
      Once they sign the consent form, patients will complete a battery of self-report instrument.
      Also they will be interviewed by a clinician with a structured clinical interview of PM.
      After that they will schedule their weekly CBT sessions with the study therapist. During 14
      weeks they will be clinically monitored by Beck Depression Inventory at the beginning of
      every session and HDRS-17 every four weeks. They will complete study measures at week 8 and
      after the the 14 weeks sessions.

      Study participants who do not remit (end treatment HDRS-17 &gt; 7) at the end of CBT trial will
      be offered medication for three months or will receive referral for alternative
      psychotherapy, per patient's preference.
