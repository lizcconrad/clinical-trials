      This is a multicenter retrospective analysis .The aim of the present study is to investigate
      the molecular predictors of vinorelbine response in tumor samples of a series of MPM patients
      and evaluate the possible impact on clinical outcome.

      Sample size: around 150 patients based on the availability of tumor size

      Vinorelbine has recently become an alternative option for palliation in selected
      pemetrexed-pretreated patients with malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM). However, nowadays
      there are no definitive data about vinorelbine predictors of response in MPM patients. The
      identification of molecular predictors of effective therapy is important for maximizing
      therapeutic efficacy and minimizing useless treatment in cancer patients.

      In oncology a pharmacogenetic approach to customize the chemotherapy treatment according to
      individual as well as tumour genetic characteristics represents a modern and intriguing
      challenge. Recent studies have suggested that the expression levels of class III β-tubulin
      (TUBB3) or BRCA1, are related to a survival benefit from vinorelbine chemotherapy among
      patients with advanced solid malignancies, especially non-small cell lung cancer. There are
      no data about the predictive factors to vinorelbine in MPM patients. The identification of
      molecular predictors of effective therapy may allow in the future the development of better
      therapies.
