      The purpose of this study is:

        -  to assess clinical efficiency of Subetta in the combined treatment of type I diabetes
           mellitus;

        -  to assess safety of Subetta in the combined treatment of type I diabetes mellitus.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with type I diabetes mellitus are included in the trial. It is concerned those
      patients, who by the time of the trial receive functional (basal bolus) insulin therapy of
      type I diabetes mellitus according to acceptable standard therapy, including basal insulin
      (using intermediate and long acting medications) and alimentary or prandial insulin (short
      and ultra short acting medications), and with lack of optimal glycemic control (HbA1c&gt;7.0%).
      For patients, which will be included in the trial (mainly middle aged patients without severe
      complications of diabetes), HbA1c&gt;7.0% is the marker showing that optimal individual goal of
      glycemic control is not achieved.

      If a patient meets inclusion criteria and does not show non-inclusion criteria he/she is
      randomized in one of 2 groups: Group 1 - the group receiving standard type I diabetes
      mellitus therapy + Subetta at a dose of 1 tablet 4 times a day; Group 2 - the group receiving
      standard type I diabetes mellitus therapy + Placebo under the regimen used for Subetta. The
      invented names of the drugs containing basal and alimentary insulin should be unchanged for
      each patient during the whole trial.

      All patients will receive glucometers and the appropriate glucose test strips, so they could
      self monitor blood glucose and register this data in their diaries.

      The trial duration is 38 weeks; the main stages of the trial are conducted during screening,
      then in 4 weeks (Visit 2), in 12 weeks (Visit 3), in 24 weeks (Visit 4) and in 36 weeks
      (Visit 5). In 1 week after randomization and the onset of the trial therapy and between the
      visits to the study site (on weeks 8±1, 18±1 and 30±1) an investigator collects data on
      patient's health and complaints (phone visits) to decide whether it is necessary to arrange
      unplanned visit to the site.
