  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It is hypothesized that excessive generation of free radicals involves in the pathogenesis of
      radiation-induced brain necrosis. This study therefore evaluated the effect of free radical
      scavenger, edaravone, on radiation-induced temporal lobe necrosis (TLN) in patients with
      nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) after radiotherapy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Radiation-induced temporal lobe necrosis (TLN) is the most serious sequelae of radiotherapy
      and impairs the patients' quality of life profoundly. Steroid is one of the conventional
      treatment methods for TLN. However, its response rate was still not so satisfactory (about
      30%-35%).The mechanism of TLN is under exploring and not completely understood. It has been
      proposed recently that chronic oxidative stress and inflammation involve in the pathogenesis
      of radiation-induced late normal tissue injury.

      Edaravone(3-methyl-1-phenyl-2-pyrazolin-5-one), which is proved to be an excellent free
      radical scavenger, has been applied to a wide range of oxidative stress-related
      diseases.Thus, it may exert a therapeutic effect on radiation-induced temporal lobe necrosis.
      To support this hypothesis, the investigators carried out a randomized study of combining
      edaravone with common fundamental management versus common fundamental therapy in patients
      with TLN, and analyzed the Late Effects of Normal Tissues -Subjective, Objective, Management,
      Analytic (LENT/SOMA) scale before and after treatment.

    <description>The radiographic response was assessed by difference between MRI pretreatment and post-treatment, which included T1-weighted gadolinium contrast-enhanced and T2-weighted image. The maximum area measurement of the radiation necrosis lesions were recorded (the product of the longest trans diameter and its longest perpendicular). And the change of the maximum area of the necrosis lesion on MRI three months after treatment was used as the secondary end point.</description>

    <description>Clinical symptoms and signs were evaluated by Late Effects of Normal Tissues -Subjective, Objective, Management, Analytic (LENT/SOMA) scale(16) before drug administration and three months after treatment. Subjective domain contains five items: headache, somnolence, intellectual deficit, functional competence, and memory. Objective domain contains four items: neurologic deficit, cognitive functions, mood &amp; personality changes, and seizures. And Analytic domain includes neuropsychologic and radiologic assessments. Each domain scores from 0 to 4. The summary of each domain represents the final score of LENT/SOMA scale. The primary end point was the change in LENT/SOMA scale scores at three months after treatment from base line.</description>
