      This study is an open label, non-randomized phase I single-armed study in women with
      metastatic breast cancer (MBC) who have previously undergone all available standard
      chemotherapy regimens. The purpose of the study is to estimate the pharmacokinetics (PK)
      after single dose and multiple dose of BP-C1, investigate interleukin levels during BP-C1
      treatment and assess treatment response according to RECIST criteria.

    <textblock>
      BP-C1, solution for injections 0.05%, is currently being developed for treatment of patients
      with metastatic breast cancer with palliative intent. Active substance of the product, which
      is a novel platinum-containing anticancer agent developed for intramuscular administration,
      is cis-coordinated complexes of platinum(II) with the polymer of benzene polycarboxylic acids
      derived from lignin (CDBPA). The product is a complex between cis-diammineplatinum(II)
      derived core and an amphiphilic polymer, containing a composition of benzene polycarboxylic
      acids. The amphiphilic characteristics of the polymer have resulted in a product with clear
      and significantly altered and improved properties compared to other platinum analogues, e.g.
      cisplatin, carboplatin and oxaliplatin.

      BP-C1 preserves antitumour activity of its predecessors (e.g. cisplatin and carboplatin),
      additionally offering the following advantages that ensure favourable outcome of treatment of
      metastatic breast cancer patients:

        -  injectable solution (intramuscular) does not cause injection site reactions;

        -  can be administered at home by a nurse or a patient;

        -  has an improved pharmacokinetic profile;

        -  demonstrates efficacy comparable to cisplatin and much higher than carboplatin
           (in-vitro; in-vivo data);

        -  exerts an additional immunomodulatory activity.

      In this study six female patients with MBC who have previously undergone all available
      standard chemotherapy regimens will be enrolled. Each included patient will participate in a
      screening period (maximum duration of 21 days) following by 32-day treatment period and
      28-day follow-up period.

      The patients will be treated with BP-C1(daily intramuscular injections) for 32 consecutive
      days. The study is undertaken to evaluate pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and treatment
      effect of BP-C1.

Progressive disease (PD): at least 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions. In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum might also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 mm. The appearance of one or more new lesions will also be considered progression. Stable disease (SD): neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR, nor sufficient increase to qualify for PD, taking as reference the smallest sum diameters while on study</description>
