      Background:

      - GATA2 deficiency is a disease caused by mutations in the GATA2 gene. It can cause different
      types of leukemia and other diseases. Researchers want to see if a stem cell transplant can
      be used to treat this condition. A stem cell transplant will give stem cells from a matching
      donor (related or unrelated) to a recipient. It will allow the donor stem cells to produce
      healthy bone marrow and blood cells that will attack the recipient s cancer cells.

      Objectives:

      - To see if stem cell transplants are successful at treating GATA2 mutations and related
      conditions.

      Eligibility:

        -  Recipients who are between 8 and 70 years of age and have GATA2 deficiency, or the
           clinical syndrome MonoMac.

        -  Donors who are between 6 and 70 years of age and are matched with the recipients.

        -  Have a 10/10 or 9/10 HLA-matched related or unrelated donor, or a haploidentical related
           donor.

      Design:

        -  All participants will be screened with a physical exam and medical history. Blood
           samples will be collected. Recipients will have imaging studies and other tests.

        -  Donor participants will provide stem cells for the treatment. In some cases, Filgrastim
           injections will allow these cells to be collected from the blood. Bone marrow donations
           will be used as stem cells source.

        -  Recipients will have chemotherapy or radiation to prepare for the transplant. On the day
           of the transplant, they will receive the donated stem cells.

        -  Recipients will stay in the hospital until their condition is stable after transplant.

        -  Frequent blood tests and scans will be required for the first 6 months after the
           transplant, followed by less frequent visits over time.

      Background:

      Genetic and sporadic mutations on one allele of the GATA2 gene lead to a syndrome termed
      MonoMAC. MonoMAC is characterized by: 1) infections with Mycobacterium Avium Complex (MAC)
      and other opportunistic infections, 2) deficiency of monocytes, Blymphocytes, and Natural
      Killer (NK) cells in the peripheral blood, and 3) progression to myelodysplastic syndrome
      (MDS), chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML), and acute myelogenous leukemia (AML), and 4)
      mutations on one allele of GATA2 in most patients. We propose to evaluate the efficacy and
      safety of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) using different
      conditioning regimens for different donor sources and post-transplant immunosuppressive
      regimens in reconstituting normal hematopoiesis and reversing the disease phenotype in
      patients with mutations in GATA2, or the clinical syndrome of MonoMAC.

      Objectives:

      Primary:

      (NotEqual) (Cross)To determine whether allogeneic HSCT approach reconstitutes normal
      hematopoiesis and reverses the disease phenotype by one year in patients with mutations in
      GATA2 or the clinical syndrome of MonoMAC.

      Eligibility:

      (NotEqual) (Cross)Recipients ages 8-70 years old with mutations in GATA2, or the clinical
      syndrome of MonoMAC. Clinical history of at least one life-threatening infection.

      (NotEqual) (Cross)Have a 10/10 or a 9/10 matched related or unrelated donor (HLA -A, -B, -C,
      DRB1, DQB1 by high resolution typing identified through the National Marrow Donor Program),
      or a haploidentical related donor.

      Design:

      (NotEqual) (Cross)Patients with mutations in GATA2, or the clinical syndrome of MonoMAC, with
      a 10/10 matched related or unrelated donor will receive a pre-transplant conditioning regimen
      consisting of fludarabine 40 mg/m2 IV once daily for 4 days on day s -6, -5, -4, and -3,
      busulfan 3.2 mg/kg IV once daily on day s -6, -5, -4, and -3, and HSCT on day 0. The busulfan
      dosing will be adjusted based upon a test dose of busulfan. If the patient has normal,
      favorable, or intermediate cytogenetics, post-transplant GVHD prophylaxis will consist of
      cyclophosphamide 50 mg/kg IV once daily for 2 days on day s +3 and +4, along with
      mycophenolate mofetil from day +5 to day +35 and tacrolimus from day +5 to day 180. If there
      is no evidence of GVHD, tacrolimus will be begin tapering at approximately day +180. If the
      patient has unfavorable cytogenetic abnormalities prior to transplant, then the
      posttransplant GVHD prophylaxis will consist of methotrexate 5 mg/m2 IV on day s +1, +3, +6,
      and +11 and tacrolimus daily from day -3 until day +180. If there is no evidence of
      graftversus-host disease, tacrolimus will be stopped at approximately day +180.

      (NotEqual) (Cross)Patients with mutations in GATA2, or the clinical syndrome of MonoMAC, with
      a 9/10 matched related or unrelated donor will receive a pre-transplant conditioning regimen
      consisting of cyclophosphamide 14.5 mg/kg IV once daily for 2 days on day s -6 and -5,
      busulfan 3.2 mg/kg IV once daily on day s -4, -3, (if clonal cytogenetic abnormalities are
      present, then three days of busulfan 3.2 mg/kg IV once daily on day s -4, -3, and -2 will be
      given), fludarabine 30 mg/m2 IV once daily for 5 days on day s -6 to -2, 200 cGy TBI on day
      -1, and HSCT on day 0. The busulfan dosing will be adjusted based upon a test dose of
      busulfan. Post-transplant immunosuppression for GVHD prophylaxis for recipients of 9/10
      donors will consist of cyclophosphamide 50 mg/kg IV once daily for 2 days on day s +3 and +4,
      along with mycophenolate mofetil from day +5 to day +35 and tacrolimus from day +5 to
      approximately day 180. If there is no evidence of graft-versus-host disease, tacrolimus will
      be stopped at approximately day +180.

      (NotEqual) (Cross)Patients with mutations in GATA2, or the clinical syndrome of MonoMAC, with
      a haploidentical related donor will receive pre-transplant conditioning with cyclophosphamide
      14.5 mg/kg IV once daily for 2 days on day s -6 and -5, busulfan 3.2 mg/kg IV once daily on
      day s -4, -3, (if clonal cytogenetic abnormalities are present, then three days of busulfan
      3.2 mg/kg IV once daily on day s -4, -3, and -2) will be given, fludarabine 30 mg/m2 IV once
      daily for 5 days on day s -6 to -2, and 200 cGy TBI on day -1, and HSCT on day 0. The
      busulfan dosing will be adjusted based upon a test dose of busulfan. Post-transplant
      immunosuppression for GVHD prophylaxis for recipients of haploidentical donors will consist
      of cyclophosphamide 50 mg/kg IV once daily for 2 days on day s +3 and +4, along with
      mycophenolate mofetil from day +5 to day +35 and tacrolimus from day +5 to day 180. If there
      is no evidence of graft-versus-host disease, tacrolimus will be stopped at approximately day
      +180.

          4. 10/10 or 9/10 HLA-matched related or unrelated donor, or a haploidentical related
             donor.

          5. Patients may have evidence of MDS with one or more peripheral blood cytopenias and
             greater than 5% blasts but less than 10% blasts in the bone marrow in the absence of
             filgrastim.

          6. Left ventricular ejection fraction &gt; 40%, preferably by 2-D echo obtained within 28
             days of enrollment

          7. Creatinine: Adult patients: less than or equal to 2.0 mg/dl and creatinine clearance
             greater than or equal to 30 ml/min; Pediatric patients ( &lt;18 years old) creatinine

             times upper limit of normal

          9. Adequate central venous access potential.

         10. Ability of subject or Legally Authorized Representative (LAR) (if the patient is
             deemed by the treating physician to be cognitively impaired or questionably impaired
             in such a way that the ability of the patient to give informed consent is
             questionable) to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent
             document indicating that they are aware of the investigational nature of this study or
             written informed consent obtained from parent or legal guardian if subject is a minor.

         11. Disease status: Patients are to be referred in remission for evaluation. Should a
             patient have progressive disease, or a donor becomes not available after enrollment,
             the patient will be referred back to their primary hematologist-oncologist for
             treatment. If this course of action is not in the best interest of the patient
             according to the clinical judgment of the PI/LAI, then the patient may receive
             standard treatment for the malignant disease under the current study. If under either
             of these settings, it becomes apparent that the patient will not be able to proceed to
             transplant, then he/she must come off study. Recipient-Subjects receiving a standard
             therapy will be told about the therapy, associated risks, benefits alternatives of the
             proposed therapy, and availability of receiving the same treatment elsewhere, outside
             of a research protocol.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA- Recipient

          1. Patient age less than 8 years old or greater than 70 years old

          2. HIV infection.

          3. Chronic active hepatitis B. Patient may be hepatitis B core antibody positive. For
             patients with a concomitant positive hepatitis B surface antigen, patients will
             require a hepatology consultation. The risk-benefit profile of transplant and
             hepatitis B will be discussed with the patient, and eligibility determined by the PI
             or Lead Associate Investigator.

          4. History of psychiatric disorder which may compromise compliance with transplant
             protocol, or which does not allow for appropriate informed consent.

          5. Active infection refractory to antimicrobial therapy.

          6. Active CNS involvement by malignancy (patients with known positive CSF cytology or
             parenchymal lesions visible by CT or MRI).

          7. Pregnant or lactating.

          8. Sexually active individuals capable of becoming pregnant who are unable or unwilling
             to use effective form(s) of contraception during time enrolled on study and for 1 year
             posttransplant. Effective forms of contraception include one or more of the following:
             intrauterine device (IUD), hormonal (birth control pills, injections, or implants),
             tubal ligation/hysterectomy, partner s vasectomy, barrier methods, (condom, diaphragm,
             or cervical cap), or abstinence. The effects on breast-milk are also unknown and may
             be harmful to the infant; therefore, women should not breast feed during the interval
             from study entry to one year post-transplant. Males on the protocol must use an
             effective form of contraception at study entry, and for one year post-transplant. The
             effects of transplant, the radiation, and the medications used after transplant may be
             harmful to a fetus.

          9. Presence of active malignancy in another organ system other than the hematopoietic,
             except when driven by viruses in which case the immune reconstitution after transplant
             may control the malignancy.

         10. No available 10/10 or 9/10 HLA-matched related or unrelated donor, or haploidentical
             related donor.

        INCLUSION CRITERIA- Matched Related Donor

          1. Related donor matched at 9/10 or 10/10 HLA-A, B, C, DR, and DQ loci by high resolution
             typing.

          2. Ability to give informed consent

          3. Age 6-70 years

          4. No history of life-threatening opportunistic infection

          5. Adequate venous access for peripheral apheresis, or consent to use a temporary central
             venous catheter for apheresis.

          6. Donors must be HIV negative, hepatitis B surface antigen negative, and hepatitis C
             antibody negative. This is to prevent the possible transmission of these infections to
             the recipient.

          7. A donor who is lactating must be willing and able to interrupt breast-feeding or
             substitute formula feeding for her infant during the period of filgrastim
             administration and for two days following the final dose. Filgrastim may be secreted
             in human milk, although its bioavailability from this source is not known.

          8. No mutation in GATA2, or in the case where the mutation in GATA2 has not been
             identified, but the recipient has the clinical syndrome of MonoMAC, the donor is
             required to have no clinical evidence of MonoMAC .

        INCLUSIN CRITERIA- Matched Unrelated Donor

          1. Unrelated donor matched at 10/10 or 9/10 HLA-A, B, C, DRB1, and DQB1 loci by high
             resolution typing.

          2. The evaluation of donors shall be in accordance with existing NMDP Standard Policies
             and Procedures. General donor inclusion criteria specified in the NMDP Standards.

        INCLUSION CRITERIA- Haploidentical Related Donor

          1. A haploidentical donor is a related donor that shares one haplotype in common with the
             recipient such that HLA compatibility will be a minimum of 5 out of 10 HLA loci
             matched. The HLA loci to be tested will be HLA A, B, Cw, DRB1, and DQB1. A minimum
             number of mismatches is desirable; however if several options are available the
             selection of a donor will be based on the loci where the mismatch occurs and the
             relative importance of its potential immunological function. Donor-recipient pairs
             will initially be typed molecularly to provide a low resolution typing (antigen-level)
             to aid in the selection of the potential donor. Upon review of the familial
             inheritance pattern, a qualified HLA staff member will review haplotype inheritance.
             High resolution (allelelevel) typing will be performed. Final selection of a donor
             will be in consultation with NCI physicians and qualified HLA personnel.
             Haploidentical related donors for pediatric recipients must be 6 years of age or
             older. If more than one haploidentical related donor is available, we will evaluate
             each donor individually according to overall health, ABO matching, CMV, etc. to select
             the donor

          2. Age 6-70 years

          3. No history of life-threatening opportunistic infection

          4. Donors must be HIV negative, hepatitis B surface antigen negative, and hepatitis C
             antibody negative. This is to prevent the possible transmission of these infections to
             the recipient.

          5. Haploidentical donors will undergo marrow harvest with general anesthesia. Subjects
             will undergo anesthesia consultation prior to enrollment. CD34 plus fraction will be
             determined.

          6. No mutation in GATA2, or in the case where the mutation in GATA2 has not been
             identified, but the recipient has the clinical syndrome of MonoMAC, the donor is
             required to have no clinical evidence of MonoMAC

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA- Matched Related Donor

          1. Age less than 6 years or greater than 70 years.

          2. History of psychiatric disorder which in the opinion of the PI may compromise
             compliance with transplant protocol, or does not allow for appropriate informed
             consent.

          3. History of other medical conditions that in the opinion of PI constitute a
             contraindication to donation.

          4. History of prior malignancy. However, cancer survivors who have undergone potentially
             curative therapy may be considered for stem cell donation on a case-by-case basis.
             Risk/benefit of the transplant and the possibility of transmitting viable tumor cells
             at the time of transplantation will be discussed with the patient.

          5. Donors must not be pregnant. Pregnancy is an absolute contraindication under this
             protocol. The effects of cytokine administration on a fetus are unknown. Donors of
             childbearing potential must use an effective method of contraception. Effective forms
             of contraception include one or more of the following: intrauterine device (IUD),
             hormonal (birth control pills, injections, or implants), tubal ligation/hysterectomy,
             partner s vasectomy, barrier methods, (condom, diaphragm, or cervical cap), or
             abstinence.

          6. Mutation in GATA2, or evidence of loss of expression of one allele of GATA2 by cDNA
             analysis performed by a CLIA certified laboratory, or in the case where the mutation
             in GATA2 has not been identified, but the recipient has the clinical syndrome of
             MonoMAC, the donor is excluded if he or she has the clinical syndrome of MonoMAC.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA- Matched Unrelated Donor

        a) Failure to qualify as an NMDP donor.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA- Haploidentical Related Donor

          1. Age less than 6 years or greater than 70.

          2. HIV infection

          3. Chronic active hepatitis B. Donor may be hepatitis core antibody positive.

          4. History of psychiatric disorder which in the opinion of the PI may compromise
             compliance with transplant protocol, or which does not allow for appropriate informed
             consent

          5. History of other medical conditions that in the opinion of PI constitute a
             contraindication to donation.

          6. History of prior malignancy. However, cancer survivors who have undergone potentially
             curative therapy may be considered for stem cell donation on a case-by-case basis. The
             risk/benefit of the transplant and the possibility of transmitting viable tumor cells
             at the time of transplantation will be discussed with the patient.

          7. Donors must not be pregnant. Pregnancy is an absolute contraindication under this
             protocol. The effects of cytokine administration on a fetus are unknown. Donors of
             childbearing potential must use an effective method of contraception. Effective forms
             of contraception include one or more of the following: intrauterine device (IUD),
             hormonal (birth control pills, injections, or implants), tubal ligation/hysterectomy,
             partner s vasectomy, barrier methods, (condom, diaphragm, or cervical cap), or
             abstinence.

          8. Mutation in GATA2, or evidence of loss of expression of one allele of GATA2 by Cdna
             analysis performed by a CLIA certified laboratory, or in the case where the mutation
             in GATA2 has not been identified, but the recipient has the clinical syndrome of
             MonoMAC, the donor is required to have no clinical history of MonoMAC
