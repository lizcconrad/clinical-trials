      brain activity.

      The advent of an appreciation that alternative and complementary practices can have some
      beneficial effect on health has prompted the question of whether there are empirical measures
      of improvement that do not rely solely on subjective reports. The present study proposes to
      explore whether transcranial stimulation (or cranial electrotherapy stimulation; CES) using
      an FDA-approved device can alter brain function, mood and responses to cognitive tasks.

    <description>Quantitative changes in neural activation patterns during task performance as measured by BOLD functional MRI from 20 minutes of CES compared to pre-treatment.
The coupling ratio is defined as the percent change in the cerebral blood flow divided by the percent change in the cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen consumption.</description>

    <measure>Change in Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS) in Active Stimulation Arm</measure>
    <time_frame>within 30 minutes after CES treatment concluded; pre-treatment is at least 20 minutes before end of treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS), as defined by Watson et al. (1988), range between 10 and 50 points. Anchors of &quot;not at all&quot; (10) to &quot;most ever&quot; (50) were used to rank each measure. Change compares post-treatment to pre-treatment.
Positive Affects included the following terms: Attentive, Active, Alert, Excited, Enthusiastic, Determined, Inspired, Proud, Interested, and Strong. Negative Affects included the following terms: Hostile, Irritable, Ashamed, Guilty, Distressed, Upset, Scared, Afraid, Jittery, and Nervous. Higher positive affect scores indicated a better outcome, while lower negative affect scores indicated a better outcome.</description>

    <measure>Change in Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) in Active Stimulation Arm</measure>
    <time_frame>within 30 minutes after 1-day CES treatment concluded; pre-treatment is at least 20 minutes before end of treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) ranges from 0-100. Anchors of &quot;not at all&quot; (0) to &quot;most ever&quot; (100) were used to rank the following:
anxious, sleepy, dizzy, relaxed, physical symptoms, confused, sluggish, energetic, fatigued, and stressed. Change compares post-treatment to pre-treatment.</description>

The device has been designated by the FDA to be minimally invasive and has FDA approval to be used to reduce symptoms associated with anxiety, depression, pain and insomnia. The unit is locked at the factory to deliver a maximal output of 4 mA of current and has a timer that prevents it from staying on longer than 20 minutes.

Positive Affects included the following terms: Attentive, Active, Alert, Excited, Enthusiastic, Determined, Inspired, Proud, Interested, and Strong. Negative Affects included the following terms: Hostile, Irritable, Ashamed, Guilty, Distressed, Upset, Scared, Afraid, Jittery, and Nervous.

          <description>The Fisher Wallace Cranial Electrostimulation device generates micro currents of electricity using a patented series of radio frequencies. The device has been designated by the FDA to be minimally invasive and has FDA approval to be used to reduce symptoms associated with anxiety, depression, pain and insomnia. The unit is locked at the factory to deliver a maximal output of 4 mA of current and has a timer that prevents it from staying on longer than 20 minutes. Current will be limited to a maximum of 2 mA.
