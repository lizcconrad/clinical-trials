    <textblock>
      The Harvard Biomarker Study is a Harvard-wide, longitudinal case-control study designed for
      discovering, replicating, and developing biomarkers for Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's
      disease. High-quality biosamples and high-resolution clinical phenotypes are tracked at three
      visits over a two-year period for more than 2,000 individuals with early-stage PD, MCI/AD,
      and controls without neurologic disease.

      The present &quot;Ancillary Longitudinal CSF Collection Study (short HBS2)&quot; is an ancillary study
      to the parent Harvard Biomarker Study. HBS2 is funded by the NINDS. In HBS2, 75 participants
      are more intensely studied and followed over a three-year time period. Clinical data and
      blood biospecimens are collected every six months and four annual CSF collections are
      performed. Biospecimens and clinical data are deposited into the NINDS PD Biomarkers Program
      (PDBP) Repository and the Data Management Resource (DMR) and are accessible through the PDBP
      DMR website.
