  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Two hundred moderate to severely asthmatic children (6-12 years) will be enrolled in a study
      to look at the effectiveness of high efficiency filtration of indoor air in homes on reducing
      asthma symptoms. One intervention group will have high efficiency filters or filtration
      systems installed in their central heating and air conditioning (HVAC) system. The second
      intervention group will have high efficiency portable air cleaners placed in the child's
      bedroom and in the main living area. Each participant will receive true air filtration for a
      year and a placebo for a year. During the placebo period a sham filter will be used that
      removes very little of the particles. Measures of health effects will include days of
      symptoms, unplanned utilization of the healthcare system for asthma-related illness,
      short-term medication use, peak exhaled flow, spirometry, and exhaled nitric oxide (eNO).

    <measure>Days with asthma symptoms</measure>
    <time_frame>Measured at 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21, and 24 months</time_frame>
    <description>The maximum number of days with symptoms, from a two-week recall period, will be determined every three months. The maximum number of days with symptoms will be defined as the largest value among the following three variables: (i) number of days with wheezing, tightness in the chest, or cough because of asthma, (ii) number of days that the child had to slow down or stop his/her play or activities because of asthma, wheezing or tightness in the chest, or cough, or (iii) number of nights that the child woke up because of asthma, wheezing or tightness in the chest, or cough.
The seasonally adjusted mean difference in the number of symptom days between the true and sham filtration periods will be estimated using generalized linear mixed-effects regression models.</description>
