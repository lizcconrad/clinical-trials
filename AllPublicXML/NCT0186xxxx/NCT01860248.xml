  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study was aimed to compare pain levels from arterial blood gas (ABG) sampling performed
      with vapocoolant spray in comparison to placebo.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Previous studies of vapocoolant sprays for reducing pain were mainly on venopuncture with
      inconsistent results. There was only one prospective open labeled controlled study on
      arterial blood gas sampling with ethyl chloride which did not show effectiveness. This study
      will assess the efficacy and tolerability of a topical alkane vapocoolant spray for arterial
      puncture in adults in comparison to control spray.
