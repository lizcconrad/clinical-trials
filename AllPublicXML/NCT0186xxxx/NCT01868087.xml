    <textblock>
      Radical cystectomy (RC) is the removal of the entire bladder and nearby organs that may
      contain cancer cells. It is a major surgery that can lead to breakdown of proteins in the
      body and a decreased immune response, both of which increase the risk of illness and death.
      Poor nutrition status before RC surgery is linked to a higher rate of death after surgery.
      Therefore, it is important to eat a balanced diet before and after RC surgery to avoid
      negative outcomes.

      Studies show that patients who drink a nutritional supplement that may enhance the immune
      system before and after gastro-intestinal surgery may have fewer infections and shorter
      hospital stays after surgery. Patients with cancer of the colon/rectum, stomach, and pancreas
      who drank a similar immune-enhancing nutritional supplement before and after surgery also had
      fewer infections.

      The purpose of this study is to attain pilot data for a larger trial.
