  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this preliminary experiment is to measure the effect of a novel ventilation
      system on the physiological strain during exercise in high heat load while wearing ballistic
      protective vest. Ten young and healthy participants will participate in the study. They will
      all go through a six days heat acclimation period in a heat chamber according to a valid
      protocol. Afterwards they will be randomly exposed to 4 conditions during four separate
      consecutive days.

      Ten young and healthy civilian participants will participate in the study. They will all go
      through a six days heat acclimation period in a heat chamber according to a valid protocol.
      After heat acclimation the participant will be randomly exposed to 4 conditions during four
      separate consecutive days: 1) walking on a treadmill for two hours in hot-wet conditions
      (30OC, 70% RH) while wearing military uniforms and a vest (control group); 2) walking on a
      treadmill for two hours in hot-dry conditions (40OC, 30% RH) while wearing military uniforms
      and a vest (control group); 3) walking on a treadmill for two hours in hot-wet conditions
      (30OC, 70% RH) while wearing military uniforms and a vest with a ventilator (experimental
      group); 4) walking on a treadmill for two hours in hot-dry conditions (40OC, 30% RH) while
      wearing military uniforms and a vest with a ventilator (experimental group). During the heat
      exposures, rectal temperature, skin temperature and heart rate will be continuously
      monitored. Subjective comfort measures, heat strain indices, sweat rate and sweat evaporation
      will be also measured/calculated. The differences in the above measures, during exposure to
      exercise in the heat between ventilator and no ventilator will be then analyzed.

    <measure>Heat tolerance test</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>The test is performed in a climatic chamber at a temperature of 40oC and 40% relative humidity. During the test, the subject walks on a treadmill at a speed of 5 km/hr at a 2% grade for 2h. Body core temperature and heart rate are continuously monitored, and sweat rate is computed from body weight prior to and after the test, corrected for fluid intake. Heat intolerance is determined when body core temperature elevates above 38.5oC, when heart rate elevates above 150 bpm, or when either does not tend to reach a plateau.</description>
