  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the pharmacokinetic (what the body does to the
      medication) comparability of guselkumab in lyophilized and liquid formulations. Also to
      evaluate pharmacokinetic comparability of liquid formulation of guselkumab when delivered as
      prefilled syringe with UltraSafe Passive Delivery System [PFS-U] or with a prefilled syringe
      facilitated injection device [PFS FID]) following a single subcutaneous (SC) administration
      of 100 mg guselkumab in healthy participants.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label (all people know the identity of the intervention), randomized (the
      study medication is assigned by chance), parallel study (each group of participants will be
      treated at the same time) of guselkumab in healthy participants. Approximately 140
      participants will be randomly assigned in the ratio 2:2:2:1 in to 4 treatment groups: Group 1
      (SC injection of lyophilized formulation), Group 2 (subcutaneous [SC] injection of liquid
      formulation with PFS-U), Group 3 (SC injection of liquid formulation with PFS-FID), and Group
      4 (IV infusion of liquid formulation). The study consists of 3 phases: screening (up to 4
      weeks), open-label treatment and inpatient follow up (1 week) and outpatient follow up (11
      weeks). Safety evaluations will include assessment of adverse events, vital signs, physical
      examination, electrocardiograms, injection-site reactions, and clinical laboratory tests. The
      total duration of the study for each participant will be approximately 16 weeks.
