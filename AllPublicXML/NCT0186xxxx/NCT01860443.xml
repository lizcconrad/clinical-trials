    <textblock>
      Background: Depression is common in adolescents and it is associated with serious
      consequences. In Chile, primary care team has a leading role in the management of depression
      in adolescents. Nevertheless, the majority of primary care professionals report not feeling
      adequately prepared to take on this responsibility and having difficulties referring patients
      to specialists. This situation is particularity complex in regions far away from the central
      zone. Telepsychiatry is a potential solution to an equitable access to specialized clinical
      expertise.

      Purpose: The purpose of this study is to determine whether a telepsychiatry-based
      collaborative program is effective to improve the management of depression in adolescents
      between 13 and 19 years of age in 16 primary care clinics in the Araucanía Region, Chile.

      Study design: A cluster-randomized clinical trial will be carried out with 237 adolescents.
      The efficacy, adherence, and acceptability of the telepsychiatry-based collaborative program
      will be evaluated.

      General aim To carry out a randomized controlled trial to compare the efficacy of
      telepsychiatry intervention versus usual care to treat depression in adolescents in primary
      care clinics in the Araucanía Region, Chile.

      Specific aims

        1. To compare the level of depressive symptoms of adolescents suffering depression
           participating in a telepsychiatry program versus usual care in primary care clinics.

        2. To compare the level of health-related quality of life (HRQoL) of adolescents suffering
           depression participating in a telepsychiatry program versus usual care in primary care
           clinics.

        3. To compare adolescents' adherence with a telepsychiatry program versus usual care in
           primary care clinics.

        4. To evaluate adolescents' satisfaction with a telepsychiatry program.

        5. To evaluate health staff's satisfaction with a telepsychiatry program.
