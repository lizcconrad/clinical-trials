  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To assess the application of partially randomized patient preference (PRPP) trial model which
      concerns the patients' preference on evaluation the therapeutic effect of non-pharmaceutical
      therapy, and to observe the therapeutic effect of two kinds of non-pharmaceutical therapies
      (acupuncture and cupping therapy) for fibromyalgia.

    <description>Individual interview or the focus group interview will be applied after the treatment, all the practitioners in the study (including acupuncturists and cupping therapy practitioners) will be interviewed to know their attitude for conducting the partially randomized patient preference trial model and their thoughts of this model compare to general randomized controlled trial.</description>

    <time_frame>Adverse events will be observed for the duration of 5 weeks' treatment and 3 months' follow-up, with an expected average of totally 17 weeks.</time_frame>

    <description>The length of scale of VAS is 100mm, 0 is representing for no pain, and 100 is representing unbearable pain which may affect appetite and quality of sleep. Researchers should show the scale to patients, and note the scores of pain degree given by patients according to the scale.</description>

    <description>Use retained cupping as the main cupping method, supplemented with flash cupping and/or moving cupping. First use empty cupping, which means the cups are removed after suction without delay, then practitioners should control the suction by gently moving the cup toward direction of DU and/or BL, repeat this moving for several times, finally cupping practitioners utilize the flaming heating power to achieve suction (minus pressure) inside the cups to make them apply on the desired part of the body. Cups should retain for 10 minutes daily, patients accept the treatment three times weekly for totally 15 times.</description>
