  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pre-procedural ultrasound for Spinal &amp; Epidural anesthesia is now being increasingly
      performed worldwide. Pre-procedural ultrasound assessment of the spine has been shown to
      facilitate the placement of epidural anesthesia in pregnant women, diagnostic lumbar
      punctures, performance of spinal anesthesia in non-obstetric patients and accurate
      identification of the interspace at which the puncture is being performed. This is especially
      important during spinal anesthesia, where puncture below the ending of the spinal cord is
      recommended for safety.

      The purpose of this study is to compare the performance of spinal anesthesia between the
      pre-procedural ultrasound assessment of the spine and the traditional palpatory technique, in
      term pregnant women undergoing elective cesarean delivery. Furthermore, we aim to describe
      sonoanatomic features of the spine that could predict the ease of insertion of spinal
      anesthesia in that patient population.

      We hypothesize that in term pregnant women undergoing elective cesarean delivery,
      pre-procedural ultrasound assessment of the spine will improve the success rate of spinal
      anesthesia at first attempt, compared to the traditional palpatory technique.
