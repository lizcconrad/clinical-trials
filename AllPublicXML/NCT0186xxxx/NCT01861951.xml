  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with a locally advanced or metastatic (i.e., there are already metastases of the
      diagnosed tumor in the body outside the primary lesion) soft tissue sarcoma will be recruited
      for this study. The minimum age to enter the study is 60 years.

      Therapy with doxorubicin is the mainstay of palliative chemotherapy for these patients, which
      is associated with hematological toxicity and an increase of the infection rate. Pazopanib is
      known to rarely induce hematological toxicity or to trigger infection. We therefore assume
      that pazopanib exerts similar activity while decreasing neutropenia and neutropenic fever.
      Pazopanib is already approved in the U.S. and Europe for the treatment of advanced soft
      tissue sarcoma.

      Doxorubicin and pazopanib will be randomly allocated to either receive doxorubicin or
      pazopanib in a phase II clinical trial. The aim of this study is to measure the treatment
      effect (reduction in tumor size or tumor stabilization) for both drugs, as well as the
      survival rate, and the duration of tumor control by the different therapies. A further
      objective is to measure the quality of life by standardized questionnaires throughout the
      course of treatment.
