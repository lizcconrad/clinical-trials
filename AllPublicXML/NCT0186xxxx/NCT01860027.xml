    <textblock>
      The mechanism of the eye movement anomalies seen in dyslexic patients is not well defined.
      Some optometrists use observational eye movement tests as screening devices for dyslexia and
      advocate eye movement therapy as a treatment option for dyslexia. The reliability of the
      clinical eye movement tests and the efficacy of the eye movement therapies have not been
      determined.

      Saccades are the fast eye movements that move our eyes from one word to the next when we
      read. The eye movement recordings from patients diagnosed with reading disorders, extra
      ocular muscle imbalances and control patients (no learning disability or eye movement
      disorder) will be analyzed and compared. The sensitivity and specificity of detecting reading
      disorders will be determined for the Visagraph III and the Readalyzer. Although these
      clinical tests are frequently used to diagnose saccadic inaccuracies and diagnose dyslexia in
      school aged children, the validity of these clinical screening tests has not been determined.

    <time_frame>June 2014</time_frame>
    <description>The primary analysis will be determining the sensitivity and specificity of the eye movement recording devices to recognize reading disorders. The sensitivity (true positive rate) of the eye movement recorders will be determined by the ability of each device to recognize children with reading disorders in Group 1. The specificity of the recorders will be determined by calculating the false positives in group 2 (eye movement disorders), and group 3 (control subjects).</description>

    <measure>Comparison of eye movement characteristics amongst patients with reading disorders, eye movement abnormalities and control subjects.</measure>
    <time_frame>June 2014</time_frame>
    <description>The secondary analysis will be a study group comparison of eye movement results for each reading variable using an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model. The 6 calculated reading variables are listed below and will be individually compared amongst the three groups.
i. Fixations / 100 words ii. Regressions / 100 words iii. Average span of recognition iv. Average duration of fixation v. Reading rate with comprehension vi. Grade level Efficiency</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  1. Age 7 to 13 (Must be in at least 2nd grade, but not higher than 8th grade) 2.
             Complete ophthalmic examination performed by a pediatric ophthalmologist and
             orthoptist.

             3. All ocular structures must be within normal limits. 4. Best corrected visual acuity
             must be equal to or better than 20/30 in each eye.

             5. Group 1:

               1. Children with a reading disability must be given the diagnosis by a clinical
                  educational specialist, educational psychologist or neuro-behavioral
                  psychologist.

               2. Children with a reading disability may not have any ophthalmic anomaly determined
                  by testing as described above. This includes but is not limited to amblyopia,
                  strabismus, nystagmus, or any organic disease.

             a. Eye movement disorder confirmed by testing by a pediatric ophthalmologist and/or
             orthoptist b. All other ocular structures must be within normal limits (including
             visual acuity).

             7. Group 3:

               1. No evidence of reading disability, attention deficit disorder or ocular anomaly,
                  including eye muscle or movement disorder as specified above.

                  Exclusion Criteria:

          -  1. Myopia more than - 6.00 diopters (spherical equivalent) in either eye. 2. Hyperopia
             more than + 6.00 diopters (spherical equivalent) in either eye. 3. History of vision

             movement disorder for group 2.
