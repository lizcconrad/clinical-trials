      The purpose of this study is to assess the effectiveness and safety of JNJ 49095397 in
      participants with symptomatic moderate to severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
      (COPD).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized (the study medication is assigned by chance), double-blind (neither
      physician nor participant knows the treatment that the participant receives),
      placebo-controlled (an inactive substance that is compared with a medication to test whether
      the medication has a real effect in a clinical study), multicenter, parallel-group (each
      group of participants will be treated at the same time) study. Approximately 200 participants
      will be randomly assigned to JNJ 49095397 or placebo in the ratio 1:1. The study consists of
      3 phases: screening (3 weeks), double-blind treatment (12 weeks), and follow up (4 weeks).
      Safety evaluations will include assessment of adverse events, vital signs, physical
      examination, electrocardiograms, and clinical laboratory tests which will be monitored
      throughout the study. The total duration of the study for each participant will be
      approximately 19 weeks.

    <description>FEV1 is the amount of air that can be exhaled in one second. FEV1 will be measured by spirometry. A positive change from baseline in FEV1 indicates improvement in lung function.</description>

    <description>Use of inhaled rescue medication (expressed as the number of occasions) taken on a schedule and/or for control of symptoms will be recorded twice daily.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in EXAcerbations of Chronic Pulmonary Disease Tool-Respiratory Symptoms (E-RS) at Week 12</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Week 0) to Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>E-RS is an 11-items respiratory system scoring algorithm to assess the severity of respiratory symptoms in participants with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Each item has either 5 or 6 response options. Higher score indicates more severe COPD.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in the Total Score of the St. George's Respiratory Questionnaire for COPD Patients (SGRQ-C) at Week 12</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Week 0) to Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>SGRQ-C is a 40-item questionnaire designed to measure health impairment in participants with COPD. SGRQ-C is divided into two components: 1) symptoms, 2) activity&amp; impacts. Total SGRQ-C score ranges from 0 (best) and 100 (worst). Higher scores indicate greater health impairment.</description>
