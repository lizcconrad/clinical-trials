  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will test the investigational antibody, MEDI6469 (anti-OX40), in combination with
      stereotactic body radiation in breast cancer patients that have liver or lung metastases and
      have received systemic therapy and have progressive disease. The investigators hypothesize
      that SBRT directed at metastatic breast cancer lesions will result in a systemic anti-tumor
      immune system response. This amplified and directed immune response could result in
      anti-tumor responses.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients will receive one of three different doses of SBRT depending on which cohort they are
      in. The doses are:

      Cohort 1: 15 Gy (central tumors 10 Gy); Cohort 2: 20 Gy (central tumors 15 Gy); Cohort 3: 20
      Gy x 2 (central tumors 15 Gy x 2).

      In addition, all patients will receive three doses of MEDI6469. MEDI6469 is administered at
      0.4 mg/kg IV over 60 minutes using in-line filter on Days 1, 3, and 5.

    <measure>Determine the maximum tolerated dose and safety profile of radiation administered in combination with anti-OX40 in patients with metastatic breast cancer.</measure>
    <time_frame>From Day 1 to Day 36</time_frame>
    <description>A dose limiting toxicity (DLT) is defined as any greater than or equal to grade 3 non-hematologic toxicity (except hypothyroidism or vitiligo) that in the opinion of the investigator is considered at least possibly related to treatment. Grade 3 or 4 hematologic toxicities that take longer than 10 days to resolve will be considered DLTs. Patients will have 8 clinic visits over 36 days to identify toxicities.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Estimate the response rate of combined modality treatment in both irradiated and non-irradiated tumors.</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 36</time_frame>
    <description>Patients will have CT scans for tumor measurements at Day 36. Patients achieving a radiographic response, or are stable, will be followed monthly with physical exam and laboratory studies with CT (or other imaging as deemed appropriate) scans obtained every 3 months (± 2 weeks) for up to 24 months and then ever 6 months (± 2 weeks) for up to 4 years.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Determine the influence of anti-OX40 and radiation on circulating CD4+ and CD8+ T cells.</measure>
    <time_frame>Screening to Day 36</time_frame>
    <description>Patients will provide 9 blood samples over 36 days to measure the number of CD4+ and CD8+ T Cells.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Histologically confirmed breast cancer with clinical evidence of stage 4 disease

          -  Measurable disease and at least one lesion in either liver or lung that is amenable to
             stereotactic body radiation

          -  One site of disease that will not receive radiation

          -  Patients with hormone receptor positive breast cancer must have received prior

             hormone receptor negative breast cancer must have received at least one prior
             chemotherapy regimen and progressed.
