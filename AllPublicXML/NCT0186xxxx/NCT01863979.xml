    <textblock>
      Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common sustained cardiac arrhythmia and its prevalence
      increases with aging of the population. It is reflected in the ECG recording by the
      replacement of regular P-waves by an undulating baseline and irregular ventricular complexes
      [2]. The uncoordinated atrial activity prevents effective atrial contraction, leading to clot
      formation. Atrial fibrillation contributes significantly to population morbidity and
      mortality, and presently available therapeutic approaches have major limitations, including
      limited efficacy and potentially serious side effects. It can be classified into one of the
      three following categories:

        1. Paroxysmal: self-termination within 7 days

        2. Persistent: requires termination by pharmacological or direct-current electric
           cardioversion

        3. Permanent: restoration to sinus rhythm is impossible or inadvisable

      It is believed that in many cases the natural history of AF involves evolution from
      paroxysmal to persistent to permanent forms through the influence of atrial remodeling caused
      by the arrhythmia itself and/or progression of underlying heart disease. As many underlying
      conditions contribute to the development and progression of AF, the full and exact mechanisms
      standing behind this common arrhythmia are not completely or sufficiently understood.

      Thromboembolism is by far the most important complication of AF, and the most common factor
      in stroke in the elderly. The determinants of Virchow triad, including stasis, endothelial
      damage, and coagulation properties, are centrally involved in AF- related thrombus formation.

      Hence, thorough searching for new possible causes or contributing factors for the developing
      and progression of AF and its most threatening complication, thromboembolism, is mandatory

      The aim of the study is to look for new possible causes of atrial fibrillation and its
      complications.

      This is an observational historical prospective study. All patients admitted to the Rambam
      health care campus between 1.1.2007 and 31.11.2011 with the primary diagnosis with Acute
      Atrial Fibrillation and were 18 years old or older at the time of diagnosis, will be included
      in this historical prospective study.

      Patients' demographic data, medical history, permanent medications, laboratory studies,
      electrocardiographic and echocardiographic reports will be collected from the radiologic
      information system; a computed medical registry.

      After collecting the data, statistical analysis will be performed aiming to discover possible
      causes or predictors for atrial fibrillation development and the occurrence of its adverse
      complications, especially thromboembolism.
