  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is 1) to determine what physiologic factors (extracellular fluid
      overload or vasoconstriction) contribute more to increased blood pressure levels between
      dialysis treatments in hemodialysis patients whose blood pressure increases and decreases
      during hemodialysis and 2) to determine whether carvedilol provides better control of blood
      pressure between dialysis treatments than prazosin in patients whose blood pressure increases
      during dialysis.
