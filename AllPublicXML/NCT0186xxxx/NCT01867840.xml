  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In recent years, ion channels have emerged as new therapeutic targets for pain. Among these
      channels, ASICs (Acid Sensing Ion Channels) are of particular interest because they are
      directly activated by extracellular acidity, which is a major cause of pain. Indeed, many
      painful conditions such as ischemia, inflammation, tumor development or tissue incision are
      accompanied by tissue acidification. ASIC are excitatory ion channels that are expressed in
      neurons, including nociceptive sensory neurons. In humans, the use of amiloride, a
      nonspecific inhibitor of ASICs, has demonstrated their role in the perception of pain induced
      by subcutaneous injections of acidic solutions. ASICs thus appear as new candidates capable
      of mediating pain in humans. A growing number of data suggests that, in addition to protons,
      ASICs may also be activated by one or more endogenous compounds produced during inflammation.
      The purpose of this research project is to identify these compounds by testing the effects of
      human inflammatory exudates on ASICs activity. The discovery of such compounds would
      definitely validate ASICs as novel therapeutic targets for pain treatment in humans
