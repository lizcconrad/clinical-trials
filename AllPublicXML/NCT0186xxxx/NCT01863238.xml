      This study is designed to evaluate the risk of cataracts (lens opacities) and describe the
      best corrected distance vision (with glasses/contacts for those who wear them) of pediatric
      patients with Cystic Fibrosis who are 11 years of age or younger at the time of ivacaftor
      treatment initiation and are receiving or planning to receive commercially-available
      ivacaftor in the US.
