  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:

      - Enzalutamide is a hormone therapy that is used to treat advanced prostate cancer. It is
      given after chemotherapy and surgery to help the body destroy the cancer cells. A new
      possible way of treating prostate cancer is using a vaccine that may help stimulate the
      immune system. It will help white blood cells recognize and kill the cancer cells in and
      around the prostate. Researchers want to see whether this vaccine, given with enzalutamide,
      is more effective at treating advanced prostate cancer than enzalutamide alone.

      Objectives:

      - To compare the safety and effectiveness of enzalutamide with and without vaccine therapy
      for advanced prostate cancer.

      Eligibility:

      - Men at least 18 years of age who have advanced castration-resistant prostate cancer.

      Design:

        -  Participants will be screened with a physical exam and medical history. Blood and urine
           samples will be collected. Imaging studies will be used to monitor the cancer before
           treatment.

        -  Participants will be separated into two groups. One group will have enzalutamide and the
           study vaccine. The other group will have enzalutamide alone.

        -  All participants will take enzalutamide once a day. They will take the drug during
           4-week cycles of treatment.

        -  Treatment will be monitored with frequent blood tests and imaging studies. Participants
           will continue to take the study drug for as long as the cancer does not grow and the
           side effects are not severe.

        -  The vaccine group of participants will also have the new study vaccine. They will have a
           single injection on the first day of the first study cycle. There will be regular
           booster injections afterward. There will be one on day 15 of the first cycle, the first
           day of the second cycle. The vaccine will then be given every 4 weeks for the next four
           cycles, and then every 12 weeks (every 3 cycles) thereafter. Participants will continue
           to have the study vaccine for as long as the cancer does not grow and the side effects
           are not severe.

      Background:

        -  Enzalutamide is a well-tolerated, modern androgen receptor antagonist (ARA) with more
           enhanced anti-tumor activity compared to previous ARAs. Phase III trial has demonstrated
           a 4.8 month improvement in survival and a 37% risk reduction in death in metastatic
           castration resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) patients who have had previous docetaxel.

        -  PROSTVAC is a therapeutic cancer vaccine which is designed to induce an anti-tumor
           immune response. In a randomized controlled Phase 2 trial, PROSTVAC therapy was
           associated with a prolongation of survival by 8.5 months in men with metastatic
           castrateresistant prostate cancer. An international Phase 3 trial is on-going.

        -  Preclinical data has demonstrated that hormonal therapies such as ARAs can enhance the
           immune response through multiple mechanisms. Specifically, our group has shown that
           enzalutamide can increase thymic production of na(SqrRoot) ve T-cells, which could be
           activated by a cancer vaccine. Together, these data provide an important rationale to
           combine enzalutamide with PSA-TRICOM in mCRPC.

        -  Data from the clinical trials with these therapies suggest that they are very well
           tolerated and without overlapping toxicity.

      Objective:

      -Determine if PSA-TRICOM combined with enzalutamide will increase time to progression (as
      defined by Prostate Cancer Clinical Trials Working Group 2 criteria, incorporated in section
      5.2) in chemotherapy-naive metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer patients compared
      to enzalutamide alone.

      Design:

        -  The study will randomize chemotherapy-naive, mCRPC patients to either enzalutamide alone
           or enzalutamide with PSA-TRICOM. Enzalutamide will be given at the standard dose of 160
           mg daily.

        -  PSA-TRICOM will be administered identical to the Phase III dosing with vaccine given
           week 1 (vaccinia-PSA-TRICOM, 2x10(8) units subcutaneously) and then week 3, 5 and then
           monthly fowlpox-vaccine (1x10(9) units subcutaneously).

        -  After completing 6 months of vaccine, fowlpox-vaccine (1x10(9) units subcutaneously will
           be administered every 3 months. Patients will be treated until radiographic progression
           on scans using Prostate Cancer Working Group Criteria.

      Eligibility:

        -  mCRPC patients with rising PSA or progressive disease despite castration levels of
           testosterone.

        -  Chemotherapy-na(SqrRoot) ve with minimal or no symptoms related to prostate cancer.

        -  Patients with history of autoimmune disease, brain/leptomeningeal metastasis, a second
           malignancy within 3 years of enrollment, or a severe co-morbid condition will be
           excluded.

        -  Patients who have received abiraterone will be excluded

        -  Patients will be stratified based on previous immunotherapy used as cancer treatment.
