  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This clinical trial is aimed to establish a recommended starting dose of ipilimumab for a
      future efficacy trial when used in combination with intensity modulated radiation therapy
      (IMRT) and cetuximab.

    <textblock>
      The investigators proposed to integrate anti-CTLA-4 specific mAb, ipilimumab, into a standard
      regimen of cetuximab plus RT (70-74.0 Gy) in a dose finding, phase I trial, to inform the
      design of a future phase II clinical trial which would determine clinical efficacy.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  AJCC stage III/IVB, excluding T1N1, histologically or cytologically confirmed squamous
             cell carcinoma or undifferentiated carcinoma of the head and neck. Patients should not
             have distant metastasis. Primary sites include: oropharynx, hypopharynx, larynx

          -  Patients must have high or intermediate risk disease, defined as follows:

        High risk: p16- Intermediate risk: p16+, ≥ 10 pack-year tobacco exposure and ≥ N2 disease.

          -  Patients must have measurable disease, defined as at least one lesion that can be
             accurately measured in at least one dimension (longest diameter to be recorded for
             non-nodal lesions and short axis for nodal lesions) as &gt;20 mm with conventional
             techniques or as &gt;10 mm with spiral CT scan, MRI, or calipers by clinical exam. See
             Section 11 for the evaluation of measurable disease.

          -  Patients should be newly diagnosed HNSCC, with no prior therapy for this disease.

          -  Age &gt;18 years.

          -  ECOG performance status typically &lt;1 (Karnofsky &gt;70%)

          -  Patients must have acceptable organ and marrow function as defined below:

        leukocytes &gt;3,000/mcL absolute neutrophil count&gt;1,200/mcL platelets &gt;75,000/mcL total
        bilirubin ≤ 2 mg/dL (≤ 3 mg/dL in case of gilbert's syndrome) AST/ALT ≤ 2 times
        institutional ULN creatinine clearance &gt;40 mL/min/1.73 m2

          -  Patients must have the ability to understand and to sign written informed consent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients who have had prior chemotherapy, radiotherapy, or surgery with curative
             intent for HNSCC.

        Patients with a history of prior treatment with ipilimumab, anti-PD 1 antibody, CD137
        agonist or other immune activating therapy such as anti-CD 40 antibody.

          -  Patients who are receiving any other investigational agents.

          -  Autoimmune disease: Patients with a history of inflammatory bowel disease, including
             ulcerative colitis and Crohn's Disease, are excluded from this study, as are patients
             with a history of symptomatic non-gastrointestinal autoimmune disease (e.g.,
             rheumatoid arthritis, systemic progressive sclerosis [scleroderma], systemic lupus
             erythematosus, autoimmune vasculitis [e.g., Wegener's Granulomatosis]); CNS or motor
             neuropathy considered of autoimmune origin (e.g. Guillain-Barre Syndrome and
             Myasthenia Gravis, multiple sclerosis.).

          -  Patients with known immunodeficiency disorder, or presumed to be unable to respond to
             anti-CTLA4 mAb

          -  Patients with distant metastatic disease (stage IVC).

          -  History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic
             composition to cetuximab or ipilimumab.

          -  Patient is &lt; 2 years free from a second primary malignancy unless the other malignancy
             is non-melanomatous skin cancer or an in-situ tumor treated with curative intent.

          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac
             arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with
             study requirements. Patients with chronic Hepatitis B or hepatitis C infections are
             excluded because of potential effects on immune function and/ or drug interactions, as
             well as the potential for confounded interpretation of immune-related adverse events
             such as hepatic inflammation occurring on protocol.

          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because ipilimumab may have the potential
             for teratogenic or abortifacient effects. These potential risks may also apply to
             other agents used in this study.

          -  HIV-positive patients on combination antiretroviral therapy are ineligible because of
             the potential for pharmacokinetic interactions with ipilimumab and immunosuppressed
             individuals. Appropriate studies will be undertaken in patients receiving combination
             antiretroviral therapy when indicated.
