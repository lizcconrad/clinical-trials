  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs) are a form of sarcoma and the most common sarcoma
      tumors of the gastrointestinal tract. The limited clinical experience suggests that GIST
      patients may benefit from neo-adjuvant therapy from primary GIST. This is a prospective,
      multicenter, open, observational study in evaluation of safety and efficacy of imatinib
      compared with that of historical data for locally unresectable advanced GIST without
      metastasis. The study will include an up to 28-day screening period, followed by receiving
      imatinib mesylate (400 mg/day) for at least 6-12 months and followed up for 3 years after
      surgery.

      Primary Objective

        -  To observe the safety of imatinib compared with that of historical data for locally
           unresectable advanced GIST without metastasis.

      Secondary Objective

        -  Progression-free survival (PFS) in resected patients during follow up

        -  R0 resection rate

        -  objective response rate, tumor shrinkage rate

        -  Correlation of mutation status with response

        -  Correlation of PK with response

        -  Surgical morbidity and mortality and safety follow up

        -  Quality of life

        -  Overall survival (OS)

        The study will be conducted in four branch hospitals of Chang Gung Memorial Hospital,
        Taiwan including Keelung, Linkou, Cha-Yi, and Kaoshung, respectively. To target 50
        patients; 90% patients with response after imatinib treatment; 10% patients without
        response; compare the result with historical data.
