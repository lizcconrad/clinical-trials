  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Alzheimer's disease is a devastating neurodegenerative disorder, for which there is currently
      no effective treatment to slow or halt progression. Beta amyloid peptide accumulates in the
      brains of those with Alzheimer's, and is thought to play a major role in triggering the
      dementia. The investigators recently characterized a molecular pathway by which ß-amyloid
      damages neurons, and showed that the protein termed Fyn kinase is crucial. Our data suggest
      that blocking Fyn will have a significant therapeutic benefit for Alzheimer's. Astra Zeneca
      has developed a blocker of Fyn and related kinases (AZD0530) for the treatment of cancer.
      Chronic AZD0530 administration is well tolerated in humans, and the investigators propose to
      test its potential as a novel Alzheimer's disease modifying therapy. This study will assess
      the safety and tolerability of AZD0530 in patients with Alzheimer's disease.

    <measure>Number of Participants with Adverse Events on AZD0530</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Patients will be followed closely for any adverse events. These include laboratory measurements, such as complete blood cell counts, basic metabolic panel, including renal function and electrolyte levels, coagulations factors, and liver function tests. These measures will be assessed weekly. Patients will have cognitive testing weekly, to ensure the absence of a prominent decline in function while on study drug. General daily function will be assessed, and any clinical symptoms, such as dizziness, headache or other symptoms will be addressed. All measures will be compared to baseline testing before drug therapy is started.</description>
