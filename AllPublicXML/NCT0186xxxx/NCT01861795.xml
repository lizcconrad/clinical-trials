  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this observational study is to collect data on vital signs, oxygen
      requirements and other data related to ventilator care in preterm neonates under standard of
      care treatment.

      The objective of this study is to collect data on vital signs, oxygen requirements and other
      data in preterm infants who are breathing stably on non-invasive ventilatory support. The
      data obtained during this study will be used to compare data obtained in a future study that
      will add a new medicinal product in combination with non-invasive ventilatory support to
      accelerate lung development in preterm infants.

      The study will enroll approximately 40 patients. Participants will not be receiving any
      investigational medicinal product or device in this study.

      All participants will have vital signs, oxygen requirements and other data collected
      continuously throughout the study.

      This multi-centre trial will be conducted in Germany. The overall time to participate in this
      study is up to 10 weeks. Participants will be observed until they reach 36 weeks of
      gestational age or until they are discharged from the hospital.
