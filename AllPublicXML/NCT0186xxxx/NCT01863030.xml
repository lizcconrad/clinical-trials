      The objective of this study is to collect efficacy, safety and utility data with Phasix™ Mesh
      in ventral and incisional repair procedures by evaluating the following:

        1. Hernia recurrence rate of ventral and incisional hernias post repair with Phasix™ Mesh
           for up to 12 months post surgery.

        2. Perioperative, short-term and long-term procedural and/or device related complications.

        3. Abdominal Wall Function and mobility.

          2. Subject or subject's legally authorized representative must be willing give written
             informed consent.

          3. Subject must be diagnosed with a ventral, incisional or first-recurrent incisional
             hernia.

          4. Hernia size greater than 10cm2 and less than 250cm2

          5. Subject must be willing to undergo ventral hernia repair and be able to undergo all
             other study procedures as outlined in this protocol.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        The subject must be excluded from study enrollment if any of the following criteria are
        met:

          1. Subject's hernia is multiply recurrent.

          2. CDC wound classification other than clean or clean-contaminated

          3. The use of surgical repair as a bridge.

          4. Patient has a contraindication to placement of mesh.

          5. Concomitant procedures with wound classification other than clean

          6. Subject has peritonitis.

          7. Subject is on or suspected to be placed on chemotherapy medications during any part of
             the study.

          8. Subject's body mass index (BMI) &gt;55 kg/m2.

          9. Subject has cirrhosis, and/or ascites.
