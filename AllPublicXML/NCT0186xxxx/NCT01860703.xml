      <population>Fifty subjects were enrolled in order to have at least 33 subjects complete the study. The sample size calculations were based on the ICH E14 Guidance which defines a negative TQT study as one “in which the upper bound of the 95% one-sided CI for the largest time-matched mean effect of the drug on the QTc interval excludes 10 msec.”</population>

          <description>Subjects in this cross-over study all received one dose of each the following: A) a maximum therapeutic dose of 33 mg deferiprone, B) a supratherapeutic dose of 50 mg/kg deferiprone, C) placebo, and D) moxifloxacin (active control). They were randomized to receive these products in different orders: ABCD, BDAC, CADB, or DCBA. Treatments were separated by a 7-day washout period.</description>
