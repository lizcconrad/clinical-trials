  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this investigation is intended to evaluate the efficacy of surgically
      facilitated orthodontic treatment (SFO) in terms of treatment time, incidence of root
      shortening, and occurrence of mucogingival side effects compared to conventional orthodontic
      therapy in patients undergoing orthodontic treatment to correct crowding and/or
      retroclination of their mandibular anterior dentition.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The null-hypothesis for this research project is that there will be no difference in the rate
      of orthodontic movement among patients requiring proclination or alignment of their
      mandibular anterior teeth with SFO (TEST group) as compared to conventional orthodontic
      treatment (CONTROL group). A null-hypothesis is that there will be no difference between both
      treatment groups in the occurrence of dental (root shortening) or periodontal (mucogingival
      defects, alveolar bone resorption) complications associated with orthodontic treatment.
