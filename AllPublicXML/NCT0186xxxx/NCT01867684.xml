  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Stroke, head injury and other forms of brain injury are a major cause of physical,
      psychological and social disability in the adult population. Psychological distress is common
      following brain injury, but the evidence base for specific psychotherapeutic methods in this
      population is limited, and standard treatment approaches may not be suitable. Recently there
      has been a growing interest in positive psychology - the study of wellbeing, positive
      emotions and characteristics, and personal growth. The investigators believe that positive
      psychotherapy interventions may be beneficial after acquired brain injury, to reduce
      psychological morbidity. Because such interventions have not previously been applied in this
      population, the investigators propose to conduct a pilot randomised controlled trial to
      examine the feasibility of a brief positive psychotherapy intervention in an out-patient
      setting. This project will produce essential information to allow us to plan future
      full-scale clinical trials in this area.

          -  Between 3 and 12 months post-injury at time of recruitment;

          -  Presence of emotional distress (score in moderate or above range on at least one
