      Sensory disorders in patients with multiple sclerosis are among the most common symptoms
      encountered.

      A functional impairment based on sensory disorders of the hand. The hand is a sensory organ
      that transmits the cerebral cortex protopathic sensitive information, proprioceptive or
      epicritiques. The view-hand association plays an important role in the understanding of the
      environment. Its exploratory use remains an essential and voluntary basis. The process of
      recognition of the object passes through manipulation, but operates instantaneously. The
      brain is able to do a quick summary of the information it receives to determine the nature of
      the manipulated object. The exploration takes a posteriori, the brain can then determine the
      details component object (texture, shape, composition, temperature and weight).

      Neurophysiological mechanisms that would explain the analgesic effects of transcutaneous
      electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) are not fully understood. Several theories underlying its
      use as a neuromodulator of pain. The gate control theory has led to the development of TENS
      devices. Recruitment of myelinated, large caliber, by the TENS electrodes afferent fibers
      increases the control exerted on spinal level, thereby inhibiting the action of afferent
      fibers of small caliber related to nociception. This stimulation strengthens the blocking of
      &quot;gate&quot; at the corresponding cell bodies of spinothalamic tract and reduces the transmission
      of nociceptive impulses to the spinal cord dorsal horn. This is segmental presynaptic
      inhibition depends on the area and stimulated.

      The objective of this study is to improve the quality of life through improved sensitivity
      disorders of the hand in patients with MS, thanks to reeducation of the hand.

    <description>At first, the patient is asked to gradually define the different types of touch that is applied to the hyposensitive area (fixed or mobile touches) with different textures and then compare them with the healthy side. In a second step, the patient is asked to associate multiple items sensation shape and texture, shape and weight. In a third step is used everyday objects.
Desensitisation techniques find their interest mainly when symptoms or dysesthetic hyperesthésique. The objective is to increase the threshold of sensitivity to textures and particles eventually reduce dysaesthetic sensations.
The patient class in order of increasing tolerance 10 textures. Dysesthetic area is stimulated 5 to 10 minutes by the first texture to numb the area by saturation of the action potential. This helps promote functional work and recognition of objects. As soon as the texture causes more trouble we go to the next texture by applying the same job.</description>

    <description>Well known in the management of neuropathic pain based on the gate control theory, the application of TENS in the rehabilitation of touch remains to be demonstrated.
