  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary goal in the treatment of acute myocardial infarction is to reperfuse the ischemic
      myocardium to reduce infarct size. Animal data and human data suggest that whole-body cooling
      to temperatures below 35°C before revascularisation can additionally reduce infarct size and
      therefore improves outcome in these patients.

      The purpose of the study is to determine the feasibility and safety of a combined cooling
      strategy started in the out-of-hospital arena for achieving pre-reperfusion hypothermia in
      patients with acute st-elevation myocardial infarction.

    <description>Patients are monitored for incidence of shivering using a 4-point scale: 0, no shivering evident; 1, isolated facial or masticatory fasciculation; 2, peripheral shivering; 3, uncontrolled rigor during the cooling procedure (in average the first 4 hours)</description>
