  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study, the investigators will be examining the effects of the deep repetitive
      transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) using the H1 coil in patients over the age of 60 who
      have been unable to tolerate or failed to respond to antidepressant medications. The coil was
      designed to stimulate deeper regions of the left DLPFC. The investigators propose that active
      stimulation with the H1 coil will result in higher remission rates than placebo stimulation
      but will have a similar tolerability and safety profile.

      This study is a randomized double blind, sham controlled study to evaluate the safety and
      efficacy of H1-coil rTMS as a treatment for patients over 60 years of age with major
      depressive disorder who have not tolerated or failed to respond to antidepressant
      medications. The study duration is 4-6 weeks in length. The acute phase is 4 weeks of 5 daily
      treatments followed by 2 weeks of biweekly treatment if remission is achieved at the 4 week
      mark. Symptom change and remission criteria will be assessed using the HRDS-24 item.
      Cognition will be assessed using a validated battery.

    <description>Deep Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (DTMS) is a new form of TMS which allows direct stimulation of deeper neuronal pathways than the standard TMS. The H-coil is a novel DTMS coil designed to allow deeper brain stimulation without a significant increase of electric fields induced in superficial cortical regions</description>
