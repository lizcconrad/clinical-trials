      The purpose of this study is to test wounds found on the outside of the body surface with an
      investigational medical imaging device that collects visual pictures and thermal digital
      pictures of the wound site. The investigational device has not been approved by the Food and
      Drug Administration (FDA).

      The medical imaging device is non-contacting and is non-radiating (delivers no energy to the
      body). It passively collects pictures (typical digital color photographs)and thermal pictures
      (black and white digital photographs of heat at the body surface.)

      This prospective study utilizes the WoundVision Wound Measuring and Monitoring System (WMMS)
      to study external wounds, which can currently be measured for length by width using a ruler.
      WMMS operates by taking simultaneous visual and thermal images of the external wound site and
      the associated body surface. These images are evaluated by utilizing the WMMS ImageReview
      measuring and monitoring software. WMMS ImageReview software allows for LxW (length by width)
      and surface area (cm squared),as well as perimeter (cm) external wound measurements of the
      visual image. WMMS ImageReview software also allows for the display of thermal intensity
      variation data for the associated body surface of the corresponding thermal image.

      This study is primarily designed to utilize the Coefficients of Individual Agreement (CIA)as
      a means of establishing the equivalence of area measurements utilizing the WMMS ImageReview
      software LxW technique and the current &quot;gold standard&quot; LxW manual ruler technique.

      A secondary objective measures the thermal intensity variation data of the external wound bed
      by overlaying the corresponding &quot;Visual External Wound Trace&quot;from the visual image onto the
      thermal wound bed.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Age 18 or greater, of either gender and of any ethnic background

          -  Able to tolerate position changes and turns for up to 10 minutes comfortably

          -  Have an existing external wound that is currently measured for length and width using
             a ruler

               -  The protocol will allow imaging up to 3 external wounds per subject

               -  The 3 external wounds must be in separate body locations (ex: one on the right
                  heel, one on the left heel, and the other on the sacrum).

          -  Have qualifying external wound sites:

               -  External wounds whose external wound site fits entirely within the field of view
                  and do not wrap around a body edge.

               -  No device or treatment will obscure the external wound site

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Neonatal and pediatric patients

          -  Pregnant women

          -  Cannot tolerate position changes for up to 10 minutes comfortably (per external wound
             site imaged)

                  distinguished from other conditions at the external wound site (e.g. break down
                  or the deterioration of the surrounding body surfaces due to other conditions
                  such as cancer or other types of wounds makes determining the edge of the
                  external wound impossible)

          -  Have not provided signed informed consent

          <title>External Wounds Measured for Length by Width Using a Ruler</title>
          <description>This is a single arm study of subjects who have an external wound that is currently measured for length and width using a ruler. A study subject may have up to 3 qualifying external wounds.
&quot;gold standard&quot; LxW manual ruler measurement technique: Currently, the &quot;gold standard&quot; LxW manual ruler measurement technique is used for measuring the area of an external wound. The LxW is measured by measuring the longest length (head to toe) times the widest width (perpendicular to the length).
WMMS ImageReview software's LxW measurement technique: This software measurement technique is part of tthe WMMS and also measures the external wound LxW by the longest length (head to toe) times the widest width (perpendicular to the longest length).
WMMS ImageReview software's Visual External Wound Trace: This is a measurement technique of the ImageReview software that enables the user to trace the perimeter edge of the wound's visual image.</description>
