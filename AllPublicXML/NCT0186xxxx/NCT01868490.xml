    <textblock>
      Cytokine-induced killer (CIK) cells exhibit high proliferation rate and cytotoxic activity in
      vitro. The major effector cells are the CD3+CD56+ subset. The cytolytic activity of CIK cells
      being independent of MHC restriction implies feasibility in using CIK cells allogeneic to the
      tumors. Experiments to block the MHC class-I and -II pathways on tumors-RNA transfected DCs
      showed that only MHC class-I blocking led to a significant reduction of heterogeneous CIK
      cells cytotoxicity after the co-culture. The safety of CIK cells was demonstrated by the lack
      of cytotoxicity toward autologous as well as allogeneic normal cells. Co-culture of CIK cells
      with dendritic cells (DCs) has been reported by us and others in a myriad of cancer (e.g.,
      cholangiocarcinoma, osteosarcoma, glioblastoma multiforme, multiple myeloma, hepatocellular
      carcinoma, pancreatic carcinoma, renal &amp; colon carcinoma, murine leukemia &amp; lymphoma showing
      enhancement of anti-tumor cytotoxicity of CIK cell in all. The co-culture of CIK cells with
      DCs were reported to decrease the number of professional regulatory/ suppressor T cells
      (Treg, CD4+CD25+ cells) and decrease the secretion of IL-10, an immune suppressor cytokine,
      whereas the cytotoxic activity against target cells increased.

      We have recently brought CIK cells through the preclinical phase (animal study) of human
      cholangiocarcinoma treatment. Cholangiocarcinoma (CCA), is a bile duct epithelial cancer
      endemic in the Northeast of Thailand, with an increasing incidence discernible in Europe and
      North America. Conventional treatments including surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation do not
      bring satisfactory survival due to anatomic location, presence of metastases, and high
      recurrent rates. These unsatisfactory outcomes urge to search innovative treatments such as
      immunotherapy. We reported the safety and efficacy of CIK cells in SCID mice model for
      cholangiocarcinoma. Several conditions of human CIK cells were examined using ex vivo
      cytotoxic assay and SCID mice pre-inoculated with human cholangiocarcinoma cells. We
      monitored the ex vivo cytotoxicity, tumor sizes and immunohistochemistry. Optimal tumor
      suppression was observed when CIK cells were pre-exposed to dendritic cells (DCs).
      Tumor-infiltrating human CD3+ cells were observed from day 2 - 14, but not in normal tissues
      elsewhere. These altogether indicated the specific homing of CIK cells to tumor mass. All
      animals did not exhibit any noticeable adverse reaction from the CIK treatments. The
      CD3+CD56+ cells are logical candidates for clinical trial while the DC-co-cultured CIK cells
      produced similar efficacy and more feasible for clinical application.

      With a complete array of in vitro and in vivo study, the next rational step is moving forward
      to phase I/II clinical trials for a number of specified solid tumors (i.e.,
      cholangiocarcinoma, osteosarcoma, and glioblastoma multiforme, nueroblastoma) using the
      optimized autologous CIK cells. Subjects without prior exposure to or weaned for at least 3
      months from chemotherapy can be recruited to maintain the integrity of their immunological
      system, a critical factor for a successful immunotherapy.
