        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  patients who underwent uneventful phacoemulsification and posterior-chamber IOL
             implantation at the Eye and ENT Hospital of Fudan University, Xuhui, Shanghai, China,

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with traumatic cataracts or zonular weakness were excluded from the study, as
             were eyes with intraoperative complications, such as a posterior capsule opening,
             radial tearing of the continuous curvilinear capsulorhexis (CCC), or inappropriate IOL
             implantation.
