    <textblock>
      Acute aortic dissection (AAD) is an acute vascular lesions with high early misdiagnosis
      rate(31.8%), and mortality rate was 38%. In recent years, the incidence is rising and serious
      threat to human health. At present, the clinical diagnosis of AAD commonly used imaging
      methods, including chest X-ray, B ultrasound, CT, MRI and aortic angiography. Chest X-ray and
      two-dimensional ultrasound is limited in diagnosis of AAD, esophageal ultrasonography can
      display the intimal, identify the true and false lumen, but greater risk. CT, MRI and aortic
      angiography can be used as diagnosis method, but time-consuming, expensive and requires
      handling patients in emergency situations, should not be used as the preferred. Therefore, it
      is significance that biomarkers with high specificity and sensitivity for clinical fast
      diagnosis of AAD.

      Parts small sample tests found that single serum α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA), myosin heavy
      chain(MHC) and human soluble elastin fragments (sELAF) levels in patients with AAD were
      significantly higher than that of others (normal people, acute myocardial infarction
      patients). But because of the small study sample, limited control risk factors and incomplete
      comparison, their conclusions were questionable. In our previous studies also found that
      serum α-SMA, MHC and sELAF levels and the pathogenesis of AAD and prognosis are closely
      related. Therefore, on the basis, a prospective study is needed. We observe all the three
      biomarkers in enrolled patients with acute chest pain in emergency department, levels in
      healthy volunteers as the blank control. Then make definite diagnosis of the enrolled
      patients, and further observe the biomarkers dynamic change in AAD. Lastly, evaluate the
      early diagnostic value of combination serum α-SMA, MHC and sELAF level on patients with AAD.

      This is a prospective clinical study designed to procure blood samples from patients who
      present to the Emergency Department with suspected AAD.

      Subjects enrolled in this study will sign and informed consent and have 3 blood samples drawn
      at different time points during their emergency department visit. In addition, data will be
      collected about the patient's health history, hospital procedures, and final diagnosis.

      Blood samples collected in this study will be sent to laboratory for long-term storage and
      analysis in the future for these blood markers as they become available. No genetic testing
      will be conducted on these samples.
