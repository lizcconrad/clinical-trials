  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The present study is intended to evaluate the safety and tolerability of topical OC-10X
      Ophthalmic Suspension in healthy human subjects. OcuCure Therapeutics, Inc. (Roanoke, VA) has
      developed a lead compound, known as OC-10X, which is a selective tubulin inhibitor under
      development for the treatment of Proliferative Diabetic Retinopathy (PDR) and Age-related
      Macular Degeneration (AMD). When administered as a topical eye drop, OC-10X has demonstrated
      both anti-angiogenic (inhibition) and angiolytic (regression) properties in animal models of
      AMD. Unlike other therapies, OC-10X provides the efficacy of a vascular targeting agent
      without the traditional toxicity and works downstream independently of growth factors. As
      demonstrated by OcuCure's preclinical data, tubulin inhibition using OC-10X has promise as a
      new therapeutic approach. PDR is a major cause of blindness in adults and is also caused by
      the growth of abnormal blood vessels. These new blood vessels are fragile and may hemorrhage
      into the vitreous. PDR affects up to 80% of all diabetics who have had diabetes for 15 years
      or more. If administration of OC-10X is well tolerated as a topical eye drop and is well
      tolerated systemically, then OC-10X will have the potential to provide benefits to patients
      with ocular diseases associated with angiogenesis.

    <measure>Systemic Safety and Tolerability</measure>
    <time_frame>17 Days</time_frame>
    <description>Systemic safety and tolerability will be examined by checking vital signs including heart rate, blood pressure, body temperature and respiratory rate, by electrocardiography (ECG) and performing a physical exam. Normal systemic function will be examined by routine blood draw for clinical chemistry, complete blood chemistry (CBC) and measure of plasma concentration of OC-10X.</description>

    <description>Subjects selected to Cohort I will receive active 1% OC-10X in OD (Oculus Dexter - right eye) and placebo (vehicle) in OS (Oculus Sinister - left eye) in the Period 1 dosing. On Study Day 1 the subjects will have a drop instilled in each eye by personnel at study hours 0, 3, 6 and 9, and be evaluated frequently throughout the day. Subjects will be examined on Study Day 2 (24 hours after first dose). On Study Day 3 (48 hours after the first dose), these subjects will commence Period 2 dosing, with the active (OD) or placebo (OS). Dosing will continue q.i.d. for an additional 13 days.</description>
