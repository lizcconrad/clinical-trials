  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The most common forms of renal replacement therapy currently in use are high flux
      haemodialysis (HF-HD) and haemodiafiltration (HDF). Although these techniques appear similar
      to the patient, there are important differences in what happens to the blood as it travels
      through the dialysis machine.

      During HDF, the machine controls hydrostatic pressure across the dialyser to remove
      additional water together with toxins from the blood and this fluid volume is continually
      replaced with an ultra-pure solution. HDF has a theoretical advantage removing more waste
      substances, especially larger molecules, from the blood than HF-HD which may be of benefit to
      the patient in the medium to long term.Despite the theoretical advantages, trials have so far
      been unable to find any significant difference in death rates or the development of health
      problems among patients on HDF or HF-HD.

      It is therefore important to examine other factors which may help doctors and patients to
      decide which treatment to use. The investigators have designed a study which aims to answer
      three main questions:

        1. Does HDF make patients feel better?

        2. Is blood pressure more stable on HDF in comparison with HF-HD?

        3. Are Phosphate levels and other blood parameters better controlled with HDF than HF-HD?

      The investigators will do this by randomly assigning patients on HF-HD to receive 2 months of
      either HF-HD or HDF with as equivalent treatment prescriptions as possible and without the
      patient knowing which treatment they are receiving. After two months the patients will switch
      to the alternative form of dialysis for a further two months. During the study the
      investigators will ask the patients how long it took them to recover from the preceding
      session of dialysis, assess the frequency of symptomatic low blood pressure and also perform
      blood tests at set intervals to measure specific blood parameters.

    <description>During Haemodiafiltration, the dialysis machine removes more water from the blood than during &quot;normal&quot; hemodialysis. The additional liquid is continually replaced with an ultra-pure solution. Thus, the machine exchanges a high volume of fluid during treatment and removes the liquid together with toxins from the blood.</description>
