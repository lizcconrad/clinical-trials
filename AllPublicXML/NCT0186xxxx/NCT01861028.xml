      This study compares intraoperative fit of the patient-specific iTotal knee replacement to
      other standard knee replacement implants

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study is designed as a single center, two arm analysis. The study will be completed in
      two phases, based on measurement type.

      All additional data will be obtained from pre and post-operative subject surveys, operative
      and discharge records and radiographs.

    <measure>Tibial and Femoral Implant Fit</measure>
    <time_frame>Intraoperatively</time_frame>
    <description>Fit will be measured in 5 quadrants on the tibia using a ruler to measure the distance between the implant and the edge of the tibia.
Fit will be measured in the Medial-lateral dimension on both condyles on the femur in 5 or 6 different zones, depending on whether the femoral implant has 5 or 6 facets. Measurements will also be done in mm.</description>

    <description>A series of 50 consecutive primary iTotal patients will be compared to assess the fit of the tibial tray intra-operatively. These patients will have a series of tibial templates from Standard TKR implant sets trialed on the operative knee. Each template will be optimally sized and positioned based on the surgeon's judgment. Implant fit data (overhang and underhang) on the tibia for all templates will be taken from intra-operative measurements</description>
  </arm_group>
  <arm_group>
    <arm_group_label>Phase II</arm_group_label>
    <description>The Phase I (50 consecutive primary iTotal patients) will also have implant fit data assessed for the femur. After final implantation is complete measurement will be assessed and recorded. A series of 25 primary knees that are scheduled for Standard TKR implants will then undergo the same measurements of the femur.</description>
