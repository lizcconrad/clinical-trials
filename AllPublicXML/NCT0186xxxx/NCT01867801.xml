      The purpose of this Registry is creating a database management that allows continuous
      monitoring characteristics, evolution, prognostic indicators and management of patients
      undergoing coronary angioplasty in Portuguese Hospitals, and identify the appropriateness of
      clinical and interventional practice recommendations for diagnosis and treatment of coronary
      disease and monitoring its evolution.

      Cardiovascular disease remains the main cause of death in Portugal and approximately one
      quarter of these are directly to ischemic heart disease. In order to better characterize
      percutaneous coronary intervention in Portugal, the Portuguese Society of Cardiology has
      promoted the Portuguese registry on percutaneous coronary intervention.

      This will include all adult patients (â‰¥ 18 years), eligible for percutaneous coronary
      intervention (PCI) in accordance with PCI state-of-art recommendations (including unstable
      and stable coronary disease). The Cardiology department where the patient has been
      hospitalized is responsible for the patient inclusion in the study.

      Excluded patients are those in whom the preferred treatment is Coronary Artery Bypass Graft
      (CABG), age under 18 years or life expectancy of less than 12 months.
