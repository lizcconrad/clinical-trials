  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hereditary cardiac arrhythmias (genetically caused disturbances of heart rhythm) are life
      threatening conditions affecting otherwise healthy young individuals. Due to the
      inaccessibility of heart tissue, the abnormal electrical current(s) in the heart cells
      causing the rhythm disturbance can be difficult to study in detail and therefore in many
      cases remain untreatable. The investigators propose to study heart cell electrical function
      from such patients by reprogramming skin cells to become stem cells and then differentiating
      them to heart muscle cells.

      The hypothesis of the study is that the differentiated cardiac cells will display electrical
      abnormalities dependent on the mutation causing the disease. These abnormalities can
      therefore provide a clue as to the nature of the mutation causing the disease or information
      about its effective management

    <measure>Derivation of iPS cells</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Induced pluripotent cells will be derived from all participants in the study. Differences in the efficiency of iPS cell generation from different patients will be recorded, and correlated with disease status and age. iPS cell generation will be confirmed by pluripotency markers (stable endogenous gene expression of Nanog, Oct4, Sox2; colony formation; expression of SSEA4) and ability to differentiate in the absence of self-renewal stimulus (ability to self-renew in the absence of self-renewal stimulus -loss of markers above)</description>

    <measure>Differentiation of iPS cells to cardiomyocytes</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The ability of each iPS cell line to differentiate into spontaneously beating cardiomyocytes will be assessed. Efficiency of differentiation per lina and per patient will be recorded.</description>

    <measure>Electrophysiology on iPS-derived cardiomyocytes</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Ability to collect electrophysiological measurements from iPS-derived cardiomyocytes will be asssessed. Resting membrane potential, Ca2+, K+ current function and sponteneous and induced depolarisation will be measured per line and per patient. Correlations with patient disease phenotype will be recorded.</description>

      Skin biopsies will be extracted and used to derive fibroblasts. These will be retained and
      reprogrammed to iPS cells (also to be retained). Derived cell lines are not considered a
