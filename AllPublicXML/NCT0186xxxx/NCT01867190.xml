  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will assess the safety and efficacy of intra-arterial infusion and intramuscular
      injection of an autologous, bone marrow-derived stem cell preparation (ASCT01) versus placebo
      in patients with critical limb ischemia who have exhausted all medical and surgical
      therapeutic options. The safety and tolerability will be evaluated by regular monitoring of
      the general physical condition, vital signs, and the occurrence of AE and SAE, respectively.
      Furthermore, the standard biochemical and blood variables (red and white blood cell counts,
      Hb, Ht, platelets, sodium, potassium, chloride, calcium, phosphor, ASAT, ALAT, bilirubin,
      total protein, albumin, AP, cholesterol (LDL,HDL), triglycerides, urea and creatinine,
      immunoglobulins, HBA1c, C-peptide) will be checked before the treatment as well as 30 and 90
      days after the treatment.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Efficacy will be determined by number of collateral arteries as assessed magnetic resonance
      angiography at baseline and again at 3 months, rate of major amputation (above the ankle) of
      the affected limb within 3 months or an unchanged critical limb ischemia of the affected limb
      after 3 months defined as less than 15% change in tcPO2 or ABI or absolute ankle
      pressure.Efficacy endpoint is at 3 months. Clinical endpoints and safety will be measured
      through 12 months.
