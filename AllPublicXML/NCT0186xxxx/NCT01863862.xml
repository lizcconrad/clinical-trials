    <textblock>
      In elderly patients postoperative mortality measured 3-6 months after total mesorectal
      excision is high. Thus, less toxic treatments may lead to a survival benefit for elderly
      patients even if a risk of local recurrence is slightly higher compared to the open surgery.
      The investigators addressed the question whether watch and wait policy is safe in clinical
      complete responders after (chemo)radiation for elderly patients with small or moderately
      advanced tumours.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There are two steps of selection. In the first step, the elderly patients with small or
      moderately advanced tumours who should routinely receive neoadjuvant chemoradiation (or
      radiation alone in those unfit for chemotherapy) prior to full-thickness local excision using
      transanal endoscopic microsurgery or prior to total mesorectal excision will be included. In
      the next step, only patients with clinical complete response obtained 8-10 weeks from
      completion of (chemo)radiation are selected. Those patients constitute study group and will
      be observed without further treatment. The remaining patients with residual cancer will
      proceed to routine management, namely transanal endoscopic microsurgery or total mesorectal
      excision. Patients undergoing transanal endoscopic microsurgery and having poor response to
      (chemo)radiation (ypT2-3 disease or positive margin) will proceed to the conversion to total
      mesorectal excision.

      Neoadjuvant chemoradiation: 50 Gy total dose over 5 weeks with 2 Gy per fraction delivered
      with simultaneous chemotherapy consisting of three cycles of 5-Fu 200 mg/m2 i.v. bolus and
      leucovorin 100 mg/m2 i.v. short infusion over 2 days given during 1-2, 15-16, and 29-30 days
      of radiotherapy. Patients unfit for chemotherapy will receive 25 Gy total dose over 5 days
      with 5 Gy per fraction.

      The study hypothesis is that in clinical complete responders after (chemo)radiation treated
      without initial surgery, the local recurrence rate will be less than 25% and results of the
      rescue surgery (local and distant recurrence rate) will be not worse (or only slightly worse)
      than that seen after up-front total mesorectal excision in patients with similar stage of the
      disease.

Patients with complete clinical response 8-10 weeks after radiotherapy will be closely observed and rescue surgery will be performed in a case of local recurrence.
Patients with persistent tumour 8-10 weeks after radiotherapy will undergo transanal endoscopic microsurgery or total mesorectal excision. After transanal endosciopic microsurgery, patients with ypT0-1 disease and negative surgical margins will be closely observed and rescue total mesorectal excision will be performed in a case of local recurrence; those with ypT2-3 disease or with positive margin will undergo immediate conversion to total mesorectal excision.</description>
