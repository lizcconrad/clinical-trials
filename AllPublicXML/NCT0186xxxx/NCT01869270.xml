      Hypothesis: To study the natural history of Tay-Sachs disease and evaluate therapeutic
      interventions.

      This study is intended to work in collaboration with NCT00668187 &quot;A Natural History Study of
      Hexosaminidase Deficiency.&quot; Because so few patients with Tay-Sachs disease present annually,
      we will maximize both research projects by enrolling patients in both studies. For this
      present study, we will perform retrospective medical record review to gather data. Through
      this medical record review, we will collect biomarker analysis results, neuroimaging report
      data, quality-of-life questionnaire data and ophthalmology exam findings. If the subject has
      undergone therapy or treatment, the results will be noted.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Much has been done in the past four decades to better understand, improve diagnostic measures
      of, and prevent hexosaminidase deficiency diseases, yet all of them — Tay-Sachs, Sandhoff,
      and Late Onset Tay-Sachs (LOTS) — remain diseases without treatment. Much work remains to be
      done to understand and effectively treat these diseases. To date, no comprehensive assessment
      of the natural history of Tay-Sachs or Sandhoff has been undertaken. The information that is
      gathered through this study will characterize and describe the Tay-Sachs disease population
      as a whole, including the variability and progression of this disease. This information, in
      turn, will function as a point of reference against which to assess the efficacy of
      therapeutic interventions. Therapeutic interventions may include any treatments/therapies the
      subject may have undergone in the past, including hematopoietic cell transplantation, and/or
      the administration of miglustat, acetylcysteine, or other pharmaceutical agents; and possible
      future gene therapies.
