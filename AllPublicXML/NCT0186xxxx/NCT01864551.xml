      The investigators hypothesized that olanzapine will be superior to lamotrigine in the
      prevention of any kind of recurrence of bipolar disorder. On the other hand, lamotrigine
      group will have better prevention of depressive episode than olanzapine group. Meanwhile, the
      investigators supposed that there will be more concomitant medicine in lamictal group than
      olanzapine group. The comorbidity will influence the measurement of outcome such as time
      period of recurrence of depressive episode in both groups..

      Background:

      Bipolar disorder is a highly recurrent disease and has great impact on the function of
      patients. Depressive symptoms consist of more than 50% of life time during the illness and
      may lead to self harm or suicidal behaviors. Lamotrigine, a kind of mood stabilizer, was
      proved to be effective in preventing depressive episode in Bipolar disorder. However, it is
      still lacking evidence that monotherapy with atypical antipsychotics such as olanzapine had
      the efficacy of preventing the recurrence of depressive episode in the patients with bipolar
      disorder although it had demonstrated good prevention in manic episode of bipolar disorder.

      Methods:

      The investigators will enroll 60 patients who had bipolar disorder in remission state for at
      least two months and have already received olanzapine or lamotrigine as the maintenance
      treatment. The patients maintained with olanzapine will be applied to olanzapine group (N=30)
      whereas those maintained on lamotrigine will be applied to lamotrigine group (N=30) for one
      month before entering into this study. They will be followed up to 12 months. The demography
      data will be compared between two groups. The concomitant medicine in the maintenance period
      of the subjects recruited will be recorded and analyzed. The time period to recurrence of
      depressive episode will be compared between groups. In addition, they will investigate if
      there is any independent factor such as comorbid substance use disorder, alcohol use
      disorder, personality disorders, other psychiatric disorders (posttraumatic stress disorder,
      eating disorder), or medical illness correlating with higher recurrent rate of depressive
      episode in bipolar disorder.
