  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter study for the long-term follow-up of surviving patients who are
      expected to complete or who have completed at least two years of follow-up after treatment
      with Iodine I 131 Tositumomab (BEXXAR) on studies CP-97-011, CP-98-025, CP-99-032, or
      CP-99-036. All patients will be assessed for survival and disease status, including
      subsequent therapy for Diffuse Large B-cell Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma (NHL), and for long-term
      safety. Additionally laboratory evaluations consisting of a thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH)
      level and a complete blood cell (CBC) count with a differential and platelet count will be
      obtained annually. Additionally, patients who remain in long-term response following Iodine I
      131 Tositumomab treatment will be followed for response and progression.

    <textblock>
      This is a phase II, open-label, multicenter study of Iodine-131 Anti-B1 Antibody
      consolidation for 20 patients with diffuse large B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL)
      achieving a partial response (PR), an unconfirmed complete response (CRu), or complete
      response (CR) following 6-8 cycles of first-line cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine,
      and prednisone (CHOP) chemotherapy. Although the majority of patients entered in previous
      Iodine-131 Anti-B1 Antibody studies had low-grade or transformed low-grade NHL, 15 patients
      with de novo intermediate-grade NHL have been treated. Patients will undergo two dosing
      phases of Iodine-131 Anti-B1 Antibody.

      In the first phase, termed the &quot;dosimetric dose,&quot; patients will receive an infusion of
      unlabeled Anti-B1 Antibody (450 mg) over 60 minutes followed by a 30-minute infusion
      (including a 10-minute flush) of Anti-B1 Antibody (35 mg) that contains 5 mCi of Iodine-131.
      Whole body gamma camera scans will be obtained on Day 0; Day 2, 3, or 4; and Day 6 or 7
      following the dosimetric dose. Using the dosimetric data from the three imaging time points,
      a patient-specific dose of Iodine-131 will be calculated to deliver the desired total body
      dose of radiotherapy. In the second phase, termed the &quot;therapeutic dose,&quot; patients will
      receive a 60-minute infusion of unlabeled Anti-B1 Antibody (450 mg) followed by a 30-minute
      infusion (including a 10-minute flush) of 35 mg Anti-B1 Antibody labeled with a
      patient-specific dose of Iodine-131 calculated to deliver a 75 cGy total body radiation dose
      . Patients who have platelet counts of 100,000-149,999 cells/mm3 will receive 65 cGy and
      patients who are obese will be dosed based upon 137% of their lean body mass. Patients will
      be treated with saturated solution potassium iodide (SSKI), Lugol's solution, or potassium
      iodide tablets starting at least 24 hours prior to the first infusion of the Iodine-131
      Anti-B1 Antibody (i.e., dosimetric dose) and continuing for 14 days following the last
      infusion of Iodine-131 Anti-B1 Antibody (i.e., therapeutic dose).

      The primary endpoint of this study is to determine the incidence of Grade IV hematologic
      toxicity following Iodine-131 Anti-B1 Antibody consolidation for patients with diffuse large
      B-cell NHL who achieved a response (PR, CRu, CR) following first-line CHOP chemotherapy. The
      secondary efficacy endpoints are to determine the complete response rate, duration of
      response, duration of complete response, progression-free survival, and time to treatment
      failure. The pharmacokinetic endpoint is to determine the total body residence time following
      the dosimetric dose. The secondary safety endpoints are to determine the incidence of adverse
      experiences, hematologic toxicity (e.g., nadir, time to nadir, and time to recovery), use of
      supportive care, percent of patients converting to human anti-murine antibody (HAMA)
      positivity, and survival.

    <time_frame>From Baseline until Week 25 and follow-up (up to 130 months)</time_frame>
    <description>CR is defined as the complete disappearance of all detectable clinical/radiographic evidence of disease, the disappearance of all disease-related symptoms if present before therapy, and normalization of biochemical abnormalities definitely assignable to non Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL). PR is defined as a &gt;=50% decrease in the sum of perpendicular diameters (SPPD) of splenic and hepatic nodules determined at Baseline. SD is defined as less than a PR, but not PD, which is defined as a &gt;=50% increase from nadir in SPPD of splenic and hepatic nodules or the appearance of any new lesion during or at the end of therapy that was &gt;1.5 centimeters (cm) by radiographic evaluation or &gt;1.0 cm by physical examination. RD is defined as the appearance of any new lesion or an increase of &gt;= 50% in the size of nodules. Confirmed response requires that the same or better response be confirmed by two consecutive post-therapy response evaluations at least 4 weeks apart.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Time to Treatment Failure (TTF)</measure>
    <time_frame>From Baseline until Week 25 and follow-up (up to 130 months)</time_frame>
    <description>TTF is defined as the time from the start of treatment to the first occurrence of treatment withdrawal, decision to seek additional therapy, study removal, disease progression, or death. Duration measures were calculated using Kaplan-Meier techniques. Disease progression was based on radiographic or photographic evidence, and assessments were made by the investigator. PD is defined as a &gt;=50% increase from nadir in SPPD of splenic and hepatic nodules or the appearance of any new lesion during or at the end of therapy that was &gt;1.5 centimeters (cm) by radiographic evaluation or &gt;1.0 cm by physical examination.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Total Body Residence Time (TBRT)</measure>
    <time_frame>From Baseline until Week 25 and follow-up (up to 130 months)</time_frame>
    <description>TBRT is the time at which the activity of infusion is 37% of that at time zero. Whole body images from anterior and posterior gamma camera scans were collected to assess dosimetry. The assessment of organ dosimetry required gamma camera scans from at least 4 time points. Nuclear medicine reviewers conducted a visual examination of the gamma camera scans and calculated the TBRTs. Residence time is calculated from the rate of total body clearance of iodine I-131 radioactivity during the dosimetric dose. Residence time is a measure of how long the drug resides in the body.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants With an Adverse Experience, Including Adverse Events (AEs) and Serious Adverse Events (SAEs)</measure>
    <time_frame>From Baseline until Week 25 and follow-up (up to 130 months)</time_frame>
    <description>An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a participant administered a pharmaceutical product and does not necessarily have to have a casual relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign, symptom, or significant worsening of a pre-existing sign or symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product. An SAE is defined as any experience occurring at any dose that results in the following outcomes: death, a life-threatening adverse experience, in-patient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, a persistent or significant disability/incapacity, or a congenital anomaly/birth defect. See the SAE/AE module for a complete list of SAEs/AEs.</description>

PR is defined as a &gt;=50% decrease in the sum of perpendicular diameters (SPPD) of splenic and hepatic nodules determined at Baseline. SD is defined as less than a PR, but not PD, which is defined as a &gt;=50% increase from nadir in SPPD of splenic and hepatic nodules or the appearance of any new lesion during or at the end of therapy that was &gt;1.5 centimeters (cm) by radiographic evaluation or &gt;1.0 cm by physical examination. RD is defined as the appearance of any new lesion or an increase of &gt;= 50% in the size of nodules. Confirmed response requires that the same or better response be confirmed by two consecutive post-therapy response evaluations at least 4 weeks apart.</description>

        <description>TBRT is the time at which the activity of infusion is 37% of that at time zero. Whole body images from anterior and posterior gamma camera scans were collected to assess dosimetry. The assessment of organ dosimetry required gamma camera scans from at least 4 time points. Nuclear medicine reviewers conducted a visual examination of the gamma camera scans and calculated the TBRTs. Residence time is calculated from the rate of total body clearance of iodine I-131 radioactivity during the dosimetric dose. Residence time is a measure of how long the drug resides in the body.</description>

        <description>An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a participant administered a pharmaceutical product and does not necessarily have to have a casual relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign, symptom, or significant worsening of a pre-existing sign or symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product. An SAE is defined as any experience occurring at any dose that results in the following outcomes: death, a life-threatening adverse experience, in-patient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, a persistent or significant disability/incapacity, or a congenital anomaly/birth defect. See the SAE/AE module for a complete list of SAEs/AEs.</description>
