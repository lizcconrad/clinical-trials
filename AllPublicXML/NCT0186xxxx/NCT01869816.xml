  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Visceral obesity is the one of the major causes of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in
      industrialized countries. Adipose tissue secretes various kinds of bioactive molecules termed
      adipokines which contribute to the development of obesity-related disorders including
      cardiovascular disease (CVD). Progranulin and CTRP3 are recently discovered novel adipokines.
      Therefore, the investigators tried to compare circulating CTRP-3 and progranulin levels in
      patients with CAD and investigated whether CTRP-3 or progranulin is significantly associated
      with CAD prevalence after adjustment for well-known CAD risk factors.
