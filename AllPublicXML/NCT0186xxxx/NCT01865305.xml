  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This trial is conducted in Europe. The aim of this trial is to compare different ratios of
      explorative formulations, not similar to the proposed commercial formulation, of IDegAsp
      (co-formulation of insulin degludec/insulin aspart and insulin aspart) with separately
      injected, simultaneous doses of insulin degludec (insulin 454), and insulin aspart, compared
      with biphasic insulin aspart 30 in male subjects with type 1 and type 2 diabetes mellitus.

      Trial part 1 is a five-period cross-over trial with incomplete block-design in subjects with
      type 1 diabetes where each subject will be randomised to five out of the ten possible
      treatments. Each treatment consists of an injection of the insulin product followed by a
      euglycemic clamp with a washout period of 7-15 days between treatments.

      Trial part 2 is a three-period cross-over trial with complete blockdesign in subjects with
      type 2 diabetes. Each treatment consists of an injection of the insulin product followed by a
      euglycaemic clamp with a washout period of 7-15 days between treatments.
