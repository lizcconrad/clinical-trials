      The purpose of this study is to find out whether talking to a pharmacist on the telephone can
      help to support people taking medicine for a long-term condition.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Non-adherence to medication is common and although some interventions have shown promise in
      improving adherence, the findings are inconsistent. This randomised controlled trial aims to
      test the effectiveness of a pharmacy-based telephone intervention compared to usual care on
      medication adherence and health outcomes in patients taking medicines for a long-term
      condition.
