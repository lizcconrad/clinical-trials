    <textblock>
      This RCT will randomly assign 40 of the CBOs to receive the Multimedia intervention and
      training package (Multimedia)and the other 40 to receive the original, manualized Connect
      intervention and training package (Traditional). The technology transfer process involves all
      agencies receiving four days of training and two planned technical assistance conference
      calls, by study investigative staff, in the first four months following training. Telephone
      assessments completed by up to 6 staff at each agency will measure primary outcomes,
      mediating, moderating and process measure variables at baseline, 6, 12 and 18 months
      post-technology transfer. The primary outcome of the study is adoptions of the Connect
      intervention. The unit of analysis is the CBO.
