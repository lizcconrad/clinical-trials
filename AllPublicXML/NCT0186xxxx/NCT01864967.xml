  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Carbon dioxide infusion is a non surgical procedure applied via percutaneous, transdermal and
      subcutaneous. Increase in the concentration of carbon dioxide decreases pH activating local
      nitric oxide that stimulates collateral vessels formation, vascular endothelial growth factor
      and basic fibroblast growth factor. Carbon dioxide infusion restores the blood flow in
      chronic wounds of the lower limbs.

    <textblock>
      Ten patients with chronic wounds caused by venous insufficiency at both lower limbs were
      distributed into groups. Group I was composed by wounds in the right lower limb that received
      carbon dioxide and group II by wounds in the left lower limb that not received carbon
      dioxide, both related to the same patient. Carbon dioxide infusion was performed with the
      needle pointed toward the granulation tissue, 5cm distant from each one at intervals of 4
      days. Biopsies were collected from the wounds before carbon dioxide infusion and after the
      3rd, 5th and 10th application. Statistical analysis of the data was performed using
      Wilcoxon's test and Friedman's variance analysis and multiple comparisons test.
