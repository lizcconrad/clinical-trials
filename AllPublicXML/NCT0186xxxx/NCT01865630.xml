  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) is a special type of stroke that typically results from a
      ruptured intracranial aneurysm, a weakening in the wall of a blood vessel. This type of
      life-threatening bleeding occurs in over 3000 Canadians per year, usually in working age
      adults. Although this type of stroke accounts for only 5-10% of strokes, it contributes a
      disproportionately larger percent of overall stroke morbidity and mortality due in part to
      the young age of those affected. If one is fortunate enough to survive the initial bleeding
      episode and the subsequent surgical treatment of the aneurysm, a patient may still develop
      secondary strokes 3 to 14 days after the initial bleed. These delayed strokes are the most
      significant cause of morbidity and mortality after SAH and may be potentially preventable.
      Currently, there is only one medication (an anti-hypertensive) that has convincingly shown to
      improve outcomes after SAH. The molecular pathway causing these delayed strokes is still not
      clear, and this is an active area of research.

      Animal studies have revealed that these delayed strokes may be caused by a pro-inflammation
      molecule called tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFa). Delayed strokes were prevented
      experimentally by a TNFa blocker called etanercept. This clinical study, utilizing
      prophylactic treatment with etanercept in patients with SAH, will ensure the safety of this
      drug and determine its effectiveness in preventing delayed strokes.

    <textblock>
      SAH from a ruptured cerebral aneurysm has an incidence of 10 per 100,000 Canadians (over 3000
      people annually). If a person survives SAH from a ruptured intracranial aneurysm, the most
      common complication is delayed cerebral ischemia (DCI). This is the delayed neurologic
      deterioration associated with angiographic vasospasm. Vasospasm refers to the arterial
      constriction that typically begins 3 days after SAH, is maximal 7 to 8 days later and
      generally resolves by 14 days. About two-thirds of patients with SAH develop vasospasm,
      one-third develop DCI and one-sixth of SAH patients die or sustain permanent disability from
      DCI, despite aggressive medical/surgical intervention.

      Nimodipine, a calcium-channel antagonist, is currently the only drug to convincingly improve
      outcomes after SAH. Randomized multi-centre clinical trials utilizing clazosentan, an
      endothelin receptor antagonist, demonstrated no change in clinical outcome despite
      significant decrease in large vessel vasospasm. These results have shifted the research in
      the pathophysiology of DCI to alternative mechanisms other than large vessel vasospasm.

      It is known that the presence of blood in the subarachnoid space triggers massive local and
      systemic inflammation, including increase in the production of a pro-inflammatory cytokine
      called tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFa). We have shown in mice that global, and smooth
      muscle-specific knockout of TNFa prevents increased myogenic tone and reduces brain injury
      after SAH. Furthermore, systemic or intrathecal treatment with etanercept may prevent the
      increase in myogenic tone observed after SAH and may reduce brain injury. Administration of
      etanercept to patients with SAH is a critical step in determining the safety and potential
      efficacy of TNFa antagonists in SAH.

    <description>Phase 1 safety, feasibility study in which patients with aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (aSAH) will be treated with etanercept, 25 mg subcutaneously starting within 36 hours of SAH, then receive doses 3.5 days and 7 days later for a total of 3 doses. Patients must have the aneurysm secured by neurosurgical clipping or endovascular coiling and have an external ventricular drain placed as part of routine care. Other aspects of routine care include clinical monitoring (vital signs, neurological exam), daily bloodwork, daily cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples, and brain imaging typically magnetic resonance imaging/angiography (MRI/MRA) within 48 hours of coiling, and CTA at day 7-11 post-bleed. Etanercept levels determined by ELISA, will be measured in the blood and CSF samples, as well as IL-1 levels.
Adverse events will be recorded in case-report forms. Total study duration for each patient is 12 weeks, including hospital stay and clinical follow-up at 4 and 12 weeks post-SAH.</description>
