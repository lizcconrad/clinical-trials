    <textblock>
      MRI, without any contrast injection, allows a non-invasive evaluation and quantification of
      hepatic overloads, especially iron (liver iron content LIC) and fat (steatosis) overloads,
      but in certain clinical circumstances, cases require to improve performances. The aim of the
      study is to add to MRI scans which currently must be performed innovative sequences
      appropriate for the clinical question to overall appreciate on a varied range of patients
      their quality, their robustness, their relative performance and, for patients having a
      biopsy, their accuracy.
