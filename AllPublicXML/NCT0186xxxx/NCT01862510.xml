  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study evaluates whether hypothyroid patients requiring elevated doses of levothyroxine to
      maintain a euthyroid state are at increased risk of having celiac disease. It also attempts
      to determine if there is a threshold level of levothyroxine needed to maintain a euthyroid
      state in patients with hypothyroidism that should prompt serologic testing for celiac
      disease.

      This study is looking at whether hypothyroid patients who require above 125 mcg/day (or
      &gt;1.5mcg/kg/day) of levothyroxine are more likely to have celiac disease than those who
      require smaller doses. It also looks to see if the prevalence of celiac disease in
      hypothyroid patients who require elevated doses of levothyroxine is high enough to warrant
      screening in that population.
