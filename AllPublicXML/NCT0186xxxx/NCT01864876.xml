    <textblock>
      This protocol is for a phase 1, randomized, single-blinded study to evaluate the safety and
      tolerability of a single 5 mcg dose of GLA-SE administered intramuscularly and GLA-AF
      administered subcutaneously. The second focus will be to detail the global immune response by
      measuring systemic cytokines, chemokines, and global gene regulation. The third focus will be
      to investigate the effects of GLA on the peripheral blood immune cells including monocytes
      and dendritic cells. The results of this trial will generate supportive human data to use GLA
      as an adjuvant in a dendritic cell-targeted vaccine strategy.

    <description>Local reactogenicity events and systemic reactogenicity events will be monitored for 28 days post injection.
Local reactogenicity events include tenderness, erythema, skin discoloration, edema, vesicle formation or ulceration, induration, pruritus, formation of a crust or scab, or other.
Systemic reactogenicity events include fever, chills, headache, nausea, vomiting, malaise, myalgia, arthralgia, and rash.
Long term safety will be monitored by follow-up phone calls at 3 months, 6 months, and 1 year post injection.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Healthy adult males and females, as assessed by a medical history, physical exam,and
             laboratory tests;

          2. Age of at least 18 years of age on the day of screening and no greater than 50 years
             at time of administration;

          3. Willing to comply with the requirements of the protocol and available for follow-up
             for the planned duration of the study (screening plus 4 weeks);

          4. Willing to undergo HIV testing and counseling and receive HIV test results;

          5. If a female of child bearing potential, must be willing to use two effective methods
             of contraception (combined oral contraceptive pill; injectable contraceptive;
             diaphragm; Intra Uterine Device (IUD); condoms; anatomical sterility in self or
             partner) until 6 weeks after study drug administration. If a sexually active male,
             must be willing to use two effective methods of contraception (such as condoms,
             anatomical sterility) from screening until 6 weeks after study drug administration
             (same as above) and will be advised not to get his partner(s) pregnant during this
