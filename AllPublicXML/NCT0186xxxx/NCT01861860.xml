    <textblock>
      Rationale IVUS has shown to be efficient for bare metal stent deployment, but has not been
      specifically studied for Drug Eluting Stents. The angiographically versus IVUS optimization
      (AVIO) study was performed with (medical device's type )Promus stent, results are promising,
      but the study was not designed for clinical endpoint.

      There is no consensus on IVUS criteria for stent deployment. The MUSIC criteria were widely
      used in the early 2000, but have limitations for complex long lesions. The AVIO criteria were
      recently proposed for complex lesions, but these criteria also have some issues and the
      complexity make their routine use challenging.

      We performed a pilot study for long complex lesion analysis using IVUS, in order to define
      easy to use criteria, applicable for complex lesions in drug eluting stents (DES) era. The
      new criteria (OPERA) are an adaptation of the MUSIC criteria.

      OTELLO study is an ongoing trial sponsored by Boston Scientific Inc, to determine Major
      Adverse Cardiac Event with the new TAXUS Element stent. 500 patients will be enrolled in the
      study.

      Main question Is IVUS using simplified new criteria beneficial for long (&gt;28mm) TAXUS element
      stent deployment?

      Study design This study will consist to prospectively include consecutive patients with&gt;28mm
      taxus element stent using IVUS. OPERA Criteria for stent deployment will be the objectives to
      reach. OPERA is an adaptation of the MUSIC criteria for long complex lesion. The patients
      from the OTELLO study, with the same inclusion criteria, will composed the control group .
      Population will be matched using the propensity score.

      20 to 30 French centers involved in OTELLO study will be contacted for participating in
      OPERA.

      Hypothesis:

      Long lesion percutaneous coronary intervention(PCI) have specific characteristics like
      Diffuse old atheroma Calcifications Discrepancies between prox and distal diameter
      Infiltration longer than the target lesion Bifurcations Inhomogeneous strength due to the
      balloon (Laplace law) Primary hypothesis Long Taxus element deployed using IVUS and OPERA
      criteria have better outcomes than without IVUS

      Primary Objectives 38% MACE (SAT, target lesion revascularization (TLR), myocardial
      infarction (MI), Death) reduction using IVUS and OPERA criteria for Taxus element ≥ 28 mm
      implantation

      Secondary endpoint

        1. MACE determination for Taxus element ≥ 28 mm implantation with IVUS and OPERA criteria

        2. Safety: procedural Stroke, Urgent cardiac surgery, procedural MI

        3. Comparison of IVUS criteria: OPERA, MUSIC, AVIO

      Secondary objectives Safety of OPERA criteria Feasibility of using OPERA criteria in non
      expert IVUS center MACE determination with a 4% margin error for Taxus element ≥ 28 mm
      implantation with IVUS and OPERA criteria

      Methods Inclusion of consecutive patients using IVUS Taxus element ≥ 28 mm in a multicentric
      study propensity score matched analysis matched for comparison to OTELLO study. (Same
      inclusion criteria as OTELLO)

      Statistical analysis Primary Endpoint: MACE expected in the OTELLO study=18% MACE expected in
      the OPERA study=11% Number of patient in the OTELLO study=500 Alpha=0.05,1- Beta=0.73 Number
      of patients analysable in the OPERA study needed =250 patients i.e 300 pts inclusions.

      Secondary Endpoint 4% margin error with a MACE of 11% need also 250 pts

      Type of study Biomedical research French study Centralized IVUS analysis 1, 6 and 12 months
      telephone contact

      Safety and efficacy measures Efficacy: MACE (Cardiac Death, target vessel revascularization
      (TVR), Myocardial Infarction) at 12 months Safety: procedure related event: Urgent surgery,
      According to Good Clinical Practices serious adverse event (SAE) declared within 24 Hours

    <description>The MACE composite criteria includes all cardiac deaths and infarctions in the regions of treated lesions as well as revascularization of treated lesions (via iterative angioplasty or aortocoronary bypass) of lesion(s) that receive TAXUS long stent according to the Commission Evaluation of Products and Service (CEPP) over a 12 months period after inclusion in the trial.
To demonstrate improvement of MACE during deployment of 28, 32 and 38 mm TAXUS™ Element™ stents using IVUS. The main objective of the trial is the collection of health data, especially the rate of serious cardiac events at 12 months in the indications recognized by the LPPR. These events are represented by a MACE composite criteria at 1 year, including all cardiac deaths and infarctions in the region of the stented artery and revascularization of the stented artery (TVR) where the reference population is the OTELLO population.</description>
