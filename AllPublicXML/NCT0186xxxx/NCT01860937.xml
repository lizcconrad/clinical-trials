  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test the safety of giving the patient special cells made from
      their own blood called &quot;Modified T-cells&quot;. The goal is to find a safe dose of modified
      T-cells for patients whose leukemia has returned to the bone marrow.

    <textblock>
      This is a phase I multicenter clinical trial for pediatric and young adult patients with
      relapsed/refractory CD19+ B-ALL. The T cell doses originally proposed in this study were
      based on doses administered safely in prior T cell adoptive therapy trials, but the dose has
      been modified based on the toxicities observed in adult patients with morphologic evidence of
      relapsed B-ALL treated on MSKCC IRB 09-114.

    <description>of gene-modified autologous T cells targeted to CD19 and infused into patients with relapsed/refractory B- ALL. Toxicities will be graded on a scale of 1 to 5 as described by the NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE), version 4.0. Adverse Events/Toxicities will be graded/attributed starting at time of T cell infusion and continue for up to 30 days or until modified T cells are no longer present.</description>

    <description>Gene-modified T cells will be measured as per Table II from peripheral blood, bone marrow and/or lymph nodes. The percentage of gene-modified T cells T cells will be calculated and summarized at each follow-up time point.

    <description>Patients with no morphologic evidence of disease at the time of T cell infusion, (&lt;5% blasts in the bone marrow) as assessed by morphology or flow cytometry. Participating site PI to determine cohort stratification in the event of morphology/flow cytometry blast count discrepancy.

During formulation of End of Production (EOP) T cells, under or over estimation of CAR modified T-cells may occur. Patients may receive an altered fractionation of the total doses (e.g. ½ on Day 0 and ½ on Day +1) or up to 35% over total cell dose with approval by the participating site PI. In both cohorts, patients will be allowed to receive a 2nd treatment of 19-28z+ T cells if they benefited from the first infusion and did not experience any non-hematologic grade 4 toxicities.</description>

             o If the LP is traumatic (containing RBCs) and cannot be repeated the Steinherz/Bleyer
             ratio will be used to determined unequivocal evidence of CSF leukemia at the
             discretion of the treating physician.

          -  Uncontrolled, symptomatic, intercurrent illness including but not limited to
             infection, psychiatric illness, or social situations that would limit compliance with
             study requirements or in the opinion of the treating investigator would pose an
             unacceptable risk to the subject.

          -  Prior neurologic toxicity to previous immunotherapy

          -  Preceding and/or ongoing organ dysfunction or other co-morbidity including but not

          -  Recent prior therapy: Systemic chemotherapy less than 2 weeks prior to infusion or
             apheresis (6 weeks for clofarabine or nitrosoureas for apheresis) or radiation therapy
             less than or equal to 3 weeks prior to apheresis. Exceptions:

        oThere is no time restriction in regard to prior intrathecal chemotherapy provided there is
        complete recovery from any acute toxic effects of such.

        oSubjects receiving hydroxyurea or oral maintenance chemotherapy may be enrolled provided
        there has been no increase in dose for at least 2 weeks prior to starting apheresis or
        treatment.

        oSubjects receiving steroid therapy at physiologic replacement doses only are allowed
        provided there has been no increase in dose for at least 2 weeks prior to starting
        apheresis or treatment.

        oSubjects must have recovered from the acute side effects of their prior therapy, such that
        eligibility criteria are met. Cytopenias deemed to be disease-related and not
        therapy-related are exempt from this exclusion.
