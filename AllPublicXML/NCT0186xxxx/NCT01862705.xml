  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Thoracic spine thrust manipulation (TSM) has been shown to be an effective intervention in
      the management of patients with neck pain. However the mechanisms for pain relief associated
      with this intervention remain largely unexplained. Recent evidence suggests structures within
      the brain may have a role in creating responses of pain relief. This study aims to use
      functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to determine if there is a change in blood flow
      to structures within the brain following TSM in patients with neck pain. All patients will
      undergo fMRI while receiving painful stimuli directed to two separate sites, the cuticle of
      the index finger and the great toe. Subjects will then receive either TSM or
      sham-manipulation and then immediately undergo a second fMRI scan receiving the same painful
      stimuli. The primary outcome of interest is the shift in blood flow within the brain before
      and after TSM or sham manipulation as measured by Blood Oxygen Level Dependent (BOLD)
      technology. This study will be the first to examine this type of response to manual therapy
      within the brain in patients with neck pain.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Primary complaint of mechanical neck pain of less than 6 weeks in duration as
             identified in the patient's initial physical examination. Mechanical neck pain is
             defined as generalized neck and/or shoulder, peri-scapular pain with symptoms provoked
             by neck postures, neck movements, or palpation of the cervical musculature

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Any medical red flags suggestive of non-musculoskeletal origin of pain, such as
             metabolic disorders, osteoporosis, tumor, and/or rheumatoid arthritis

          -  No contraindications to spinal mobilization

          -  No contraindications to MRI (claustrophobia, presence of cardiac pacemakers, cochlear
             implants, metal implants, implanted hearing aids, and previous injuries caused by
             bullets or shrapnel, pregnancy or thought to be pregnant
