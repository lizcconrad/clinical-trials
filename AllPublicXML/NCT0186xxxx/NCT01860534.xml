    <textblock>
      Pupillary dilation induced by mydriatic agents during Retinopathy of Prematurity exams can
      persist for hours. Despite regular use of eye protection for mydriatic-induced light
      sensitivity for infants, children and adults, eye protection after mydriasis has not been
      addressed in neonates. This study examines the use of eye patches to protect the dilated
      pupil from light exposure and their impact on vital signs and pain scores. prevents
      tachycardia, tachypnea and discomfort in neonates after ROP screening.

    <textblock>
      Pain management for Retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) screening focuses on pharmacological and
      non-pharmacological interventions during the actual eye examination. Management of pain
      related to increased light sensitivity during the post-mydriasis period has not been
      described.

      This prospective, randomized study evaluated the impact of protecting the eyes from ambient
      light exposure post mydriasis. Vital signs and pain scales were recorded in infants
      randomized to either wear or not wear eye patches after mydriasis for their ROP exam. Infants
      less than 30 weeks gestational age or less than 1500 grams at birth were included. Standard
      statistical methods were used to compare vital signs and pain scores for each group at
      baseline, 1 and 3 hours after mydriasis.

    <description>At 3 times (pre-mydriasis, 1 hour and 3 hours after Cyclomydril drops), subjects were exposed to ambient lighting for a period of five minutes. This usually entailed removing isolette covers and exposing the patient to the ambient room light. During this time, pain and vital signs were recorded every minute. Heart rate was recorded directly from their cardio-respiratory monitor (Agilent M1106C). The mean of the five recorded values for each variable was used</description>

    <description>At 3 times (pre-mydriasis, 1 hour and 3 hours after Cyclomydril drops), subjects were exposed to ambient lighting for a period of five minutes. This usually entailed removing isolette covers and exposing the patient to the ambient room light. During this time, pain and vital signs were recorded every minute. Pain scores were recorded by direct observation using the Neonatal and Infant Pain Scale (NIPS). The mean of the five recorded values for each variable was used. NIPS scoring consists of 6 measures associated with neonatal or infant pain, each with a range of 0-7 with low scores (0-2) associated with no pain and scores &gt; to 4 associated with severe pain. Maximum scoring would be 42 for severe pain and minimal being 0 for no pain. The six measures on NIPS include: facial expression, crying, breathing patterns, arm movements, leg movements and state of arousal.</description>

    <description>The infants were randomly assigned by alternating enrolled patients between one of two groups prior to their first ROP screening. Group A was patched for their first ROP exam and then unpatched for their second exam while group B was unpatched for their first ROP exam and patched for their second exam. The patched subjects had eye covers after their eyes were dilated, and the unpatched subjects had comfort measures similar to the patched subjects but their eyes were not covered. The patching of the eyes was done in the same way that it is done for eye protection during phototherapy, with the same model of eye patches (Natus biliband) and with the same nursing care.</description>

NIPS scoring consists of 6 measures associated with neonatal or infant pain, each with a range of 0-7 with low scores (0-2) associated with no pain and scores &gt; to 4 associated with severe pain. Maximum scoring would be 42 for severe pain and minimal being 0 for no pain. The six measures on NIPS include: facial expression, crying, breathing patterns, arm movements, leg movements and state of arousal.</description>

          <title>Eye Patches Covers</title>
          <description>The infants were randomly assigned by alternating enrolled patients between one of two groups prior to their first ROP screening. Group A was patched for their first ROP exam and then unpatched for their second exam while group B was unpatched for their first ROP exam and unpatched for their second exam. The patched subjects had eye covers after their eyes were dilated, and the unpatched subjects had comfort measures similar to the patched subjects but their eyes were not covered. The patching of the eyes was done in the same way that it is done for eye protection during phototherapy, with the same model of eye patches (Natus biliband) and with the same nursing care.</description>
