      Primary Objective:

      To assess the long term safety and tolerability of SAR339658

      Secondary Objective:

      To assess the long term efficacy of SAR339658

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study period per patient will include 62 weeks treatment, 6 weeks post treatment safety
      follow-up, followed by a long term safety follow-up performed in the form of a phone
      interview at 3, 6, 12, 18 and 24 months from the last administration of the study medication.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion criteria:

          -  Patients with Ulcerative Colitis (UC) who were previously randomized and have
             completed the 8-week treatment in ACT12688 study with an acceptable safety profile.
             Patients who for administrative reasons could not be enrolled in the LTS12593 study
             right after completion of the 8-week treatment in the ACT12688 study must be enrolled
             within 3 months from the end of the ACT12688 study

          -  Signed written informed consent for Study LTS12593

        Exclusion criteria:

          -  Patient with any adverse event leading to study drug (active or placebo) treatment
             discontinuation from ACT12688 study.

          -  Patient with any abnormalities or adverse events that per investigator judgment would
             adversely affect patient's participation in the long-term extension study.

          -  Use of any immunosuppressant (if patient is on immunosuppressant he or she must
             discontinue immunosuppressant before starting the LTS12593).

          -  If the patient started biological treatment for UC while waiting to be enrolled in the
             LTS12593, then he or she must stop the biological treatment and must have 8 weeks of
             wash out period before starting treatment with SAR339658 (only anti-tumor necrosis
             factors (TNFs) are allowed)

          -  Patients exposed to an anti-integrin or any investigational drug administered after
             the end of treatment in ACT12688

          -  Positive pregnancy test

          -  Breast feeding woman

          -  Women of childbearing potential not protected by highly effective contraceptive method
