  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the pharmacokinetics of trifluorothymidine (FTD) as a
      component of TAS-102 with FTD alone.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1, open-label, randomized, parallel, 2-group study evaluating the PK of FTD
      as a TAS-102 component compared with FTD alone in patients with advanced solid tumors
      (excluding breast cancer). Patients will be randomized to receive a single dose of TAS-102 or
      FTD during the PK contribution phase and will receive continuing cycles of TAS-102 during the
      extension phase.
