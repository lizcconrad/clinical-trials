  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients having Cesarean section after they have been in labor for many hours bleed much
      more, in average twice as much, as compared with patients having an elective Cesarean
      section. The investigators believe a simple change in practice might contribute to reduce
      this bleeding. This study will involve the use of oxytocin (also known as syntocinon),
      ergonovine (also known as ergot) and carboprost (also known as hemabate). Oxytocin is
      routinely used to help contract the uterus and keep it contracted after the delivery of the
      baby and placenta, so as to reduce the amount of blood loss. Ergonovine is also given through
      the intravenous line, while carboprost is given as an injection in the muscle. Although they
      are not routinely given in every case, these are very frequently given as rescue medications
      to patients who fail to respond appropriately to oxytocin. This study is designed to
      determine if ergonovine or carboprost given in association with oxytocin, in a preventive
      way, after delivery of the baby and placenta, can reduce the amount of blood loss during
      Cesarean sections following a trial of labour.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The objective of the investigators study is to compare the efficacy of intravenous ergonovine
      and intramuscular carboprost, when administered with oxytocin infusion, prophylactically to
      decrease blood loss at Cesarean section for labor arrest. Desensitization of the oxytocin
      receptors has been recently demonstrated in cultured human myometrial cells after continuous
      and prolonged exposure to oxytocin in-vitro. This could be also the reason for a greater risk
      of uterine atony and postpartum hemorrhage (PPH) seen in women requiring induction and
      augmentation of labor. Therefore, addition of a different uterotonic agent, involving a
      different mechanism of action, to oxytocin infusion is likely to be beneficial, especially in
      women undergoing CS following failure to progress in labor, who are at a greater risk for
      PPH.
