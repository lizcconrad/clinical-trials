      Anemia is a common complication in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). In addition to
      erythropoietin deficiency, many studies have identified iron deficiency as a cause of anemia
      in CKD patients. Most patients with CKD are iron deficient because of: inadequate intake and
      absorption, gastroenteric bleeding, urinary iron loss in patient with significant
      proteinuria. The iron treatment is pivotal to manage anemic patients with CKD: the
      prescription of iron is usually oral because of practicality and safety, but often it is
      inevitable to administer intravenous iron because of gastroenteric malabsorption, intolerance
      to oral administration, irregular intake. There're few randomized controlled studies about
      the efficacy of oral iron versus intravenous iron in patients not on dialysis; most of them
      demonstrate superiority of intravenous therapy to restore iron deficiency and hemoglobin
      levels. A particular formulation of iron, liposomal iron has a high gastroenteric absorption
      and high bioavailability with lower incidence of side effects. The investigators study aims
      to evaluate the efficacy of treatment with liposomal oral iron compared to intravenous iron
      in CKD anemic patients not on dialysis in the presence of iron deficiency.
