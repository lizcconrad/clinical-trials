    <textblock>
      This project was undertaken by Qilu Hospital of Shandong University and other well-known
      hospitals in China. In order to report the alteration of Different Immune Parameters in ITP
      Patients Receiving Eltrombopag Treatment.

    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to determine the efficacy of oral eltrombopag as a
      thrombopoietic agent treating previously treated chronic Chinese ITP patients and investigate
      the alteration of Different Immune Parameters after eltrombopag therapy.

      Approximately 30 eligible subjects with primary ITP who have not responded to or have
      relapsed after previous treatment for ITP will be selected. The initial dose of eltrombopag
      administration is 25 mg orally once daily. During the 6 weeks follow-up, dose of
      investigational product will be adjusted according to the weekly subject platelet count, and
      a battery of immune parameters will be monitored at the end of each week. Additionally, the
      efficacy of oral eltrombopag for ITP will be assessed after 6 weeks administration.

             (except splenectomy), or who have relapsed prior therapy.

          4. Previous therapy for ITP including rescue must have been completed at least 2 weeks
             prior to randomization, and other TPO-R agonists, such as romiplostim or recombinant
             human thrombopoietin (rhTPO), must have been completed for more than 30 days before
             enrollment.

          5. Subjects treated with maintenance immunosuppressive therapy must be receiving a dose
             that has been stable for at least 1 month.
