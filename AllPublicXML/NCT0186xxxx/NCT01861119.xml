  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hypertrophic or keloid scars develop for about 39% to 68% of patients after surgery. The
      subjective opinion of the patient regarding the scar will often constitute the standard for
      judging the success or failure of the procedure. Surgical scars are not only a cosmetic
      concern but they can also cause pain, itching, discomfort, contracture, and other functional
      impairment. Various treatment options exists for treating hypertrophic scars and keloids,
      including intralesional steroid injection, dermabrasion, pressure therapy, surgical excision,
      radiotherapy, cryotherapy, pulse dye, and carbon dioxide laser ablation. However, these
      treatments often require multiple visits and have limited success. Therefore, prevention and
      early recognition of hypertrophic scars and keloids are very important in their management.

      Among preventive treatments available, silicone gel and onion extract gel have been marketed
      as products to improve the appearance and texture of surgical scars. Despite its popularity,
      data demonstrating the efficacy of these gels are lacking. Furthermore, there is no
      comparative study of silicone gel and onion extract gel for preventing postsurgical
      hypertrophic or keloid scars. The investigators therefore conducted this randomized
      controlled trial to compare the efficacy of silicone gel and onion extract gel for the
      prevention of postsurgical hypertrophic scars. The investigators also compared patient
      compliance and side effect between two topical gels.
