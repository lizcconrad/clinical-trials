  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This trial is conducted in Europe. The aim of this trial is to compare the pharmacodynamics
      (the effect of the investigated drug on the body) and pharmacokinetics (the exposure of the
      trial drug in the body) of insulin degludec (insulin 454), an explorative formulation, not
      similar to the proposed commercial formulation, with insulin glargine in subjects with type 1
      and type 2 diabetes.
