      A proof of concept study to evaluate the feasibility of safe and effective treatment of upper
      limb spasticity using the Cryo-Touch III Device.

    <textblock>
      Spasticity, common in neurological disorders, is part of the upper motor neuron syndrome
      displaying increased tone, clonus, spasms, spastic dystonia and co- contractions. The impact
      of spasticity on the patient varies from a subtle neurological sign to severe spasticity
      causing pain and contractures. Upper limb spasticity (ULS) is the rapid contraction or
      shortening of the muscles in the arm causing abnormal muscle movements in the elbow, wrist
      and fingers. It has been reported that over 1 million Americans with traumatic injury to the
      brain or spinal cord, stroke, multiple sclerosis and cerebral palsy experience ULS. Tightly
      clenched fists, twisted wrist and elbow joints, and fixed arms in flexed positions result in
      extreme discomfort, pain and spasm. A nonsurgical, minimally invasive, effective approach to
      pain associated with ULS is desirable.

      Myoscience, Inc. (Redwood City, CA) has developed a pain management device - the Cryo-Touch
      III - for a novel, minimally invasive procedure using focused cold therapy to target sensory
      nerve tissue and offer long-lasting pain relief through cryoanalgesia. The device operates on
      the well-established cryobiology principle that localized exposure to controlled, moderately
      low temperature conditions can alter tissue function. The therapy treats nerves via a probe
      in the form of an assembly of small diameter needles, creating a highly localized, low
      temperature treatment zone around the probe. This focused cold therapy creates a conduction
      block that prevents nerve signaling. Prior studies of the Cryo-Touch, Cryo-Touch II,
      Cryo-Touch III (a.k.a. PCP 1.0) devices have provided preliminary evidence of effectiveness
      on motor nerves and have been shown to be safe with no serious device-related adverse events.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Male or female, 18 years of age and older.

          2. Trial participants must have a confirmed diagnosis that results in spasticity
             involving muscle innervated by the musculocutaneous nerve (MCN).

          3. Any medications must be maintained on a stable schedule for at least two weeks prior
             to treatment. No washout period is allowed.

          4. Must have an average score on the Modified Ashworth Scale for Spasticity of â‰¥ 2 over
             the last 30 days in the elbow.

          5. Subject, in the Investigator's opinion, will not be exposed to unacceptable risk by
             participation.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Previous surgical intervention that altered the target neural anatomy of the upper
             limb.

          2. Any injection (neurolytic, sclerosing, anesthetic, etc.) to the upper limb within the
             last 4 months.

          3. Current enrollment in an investigational drug or device study that specifically
             targets spasticity management.

          4. Allergy or intolerance to local anesthesia.

          5. Any local skin condition at the treatment site that in the investigator's opinion
             would adversely affect treatment or outcomes.

          6. Any chronic medication use (prescription, over-the-counter, etc.) that in the
             investigator's opinion would affect study participation or subject safety.

          7. Diagnosis of cryoglobulinemia, paroxysmal cold hemoglobinuria, cold urticaria,
             Raynaud's disease, open and/or infected wounds.

          8. Diagnosis of progressive neurologic diseases such as ALS.

          9. For any reason, in the opinion of the investigator, the subject may not be a suitable
             candidate for study participation (i.e., history of noncompliance, drug dependency,
             any related upper limb injury, etc.).
