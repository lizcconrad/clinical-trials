  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase IB trial aims to identify anticancer activity of GSK3052230 in subjects with
      malignancies with abnormal dependence on FGF pathway signaling. Combination doses of
      GSK3052230 with standard of care chemotherapy in the first and second line or greater setting
      of metastatic squamous non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and first line malignant pleural
      mesothelioma subjects will be studied in the 3+3 dose-escalation design. This will be a
      multi-arm, multicenter, non-randomized, parallel-group, uncontrolled, open-label Phase IB
      study designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability and preliminary activity of GSK3052230 in
      combination with paclitaxel + carboplatin (Arm A), in combination with docetaxel (Arm B), or
      in combination with pemetrexed + cisplatin (Arm C). Approximately 70 subjects will be
      enrolled in the study (approximately up to 120 may be enrolled).

          -  Signed written informed consent

          -  Histologically or cytologically confirmed diagnosis: Arm A and B- stage IV recurrent
             metastatic squamous NSCLC with Fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 (FGFR1) gene
             amplification by central laboratory testing. Arm C- recurrent after local therapy or
             unresectable MPM with measurable lesions.

        For specific arms the following requirements:

        Arm A: Subjects who have received no prior therapy for Stage IIIB or Stage IV or recurrent
        metastatic disease. Note, to avoid any undue delay of initiating systemic chemotherapy for
        these subjects with newly diagnosed metastatic disease, it is allowed to initiate the first
        cycle of chemotherapy while eligibility for the study is still being determined, as long as
        the first dose of GSK3052230 is given no later than Cycle 2 Day 1 of chemotherapy. In
        addition, subjects with Stage IIIB or Stage IV disease and recurrence after previous NSCLC
        that has been treated with surgery and adjuvant chemotherapy or a radio- chemotherapy
        regimen with curative intent are eligible, provided 6 months has passed since this
        treatment ended.

        Arm B: Subjects who have documented tumor progression (based on radiological imaging) or
        intolerability after receiving at least one prior line of platinum containing combination
        chemotherapy for Stage IIIB or Stage IV or recurrent metastatic disease. Note: Prior
        treatment should not include docetaxel but may have included paclitaxel.

        - Availability of archival tumor tissue required for assessment of deregulated FGF pathway
        signalling, but not limited to, FGFR1 amplification or FGF2 or FGFR1 expression. If
        archival tissue is not available, a fresh biopsy is required. In Arms A and B, subjects
        will be prospectively screened for FGFR1 gene amplification using a Fluorescence in situ
        hybridization (FISH) assay for the dose expansion and the MTD/MFD cohorts only. For
        inclusion in this study, based on the central laboratory testing, FGFR1 gene amplification
        must meet one of the following criteria: a ratio of FGFR1/CEN 8 of &gt;=2; or average number
        of FGFR1 signals per tumor nucleus of &gt;=6; or the percentage of tumor nuclei containing &gt;=5
        FGFR1 signals is &gt;=50%.

        In Arm C, FGF2 expression by IHC will be evaluated retrospectively in tissue samples by a
        central laboratory and is not a requirement for study entry.

             vasectomy or agree to use effective contraception for at least 2 weeks prior to
             administration of the first dose of study treatment and for at least 6 months after
             the last dose of chemotherapy to allow for clearance of any altered sperm.

          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance Status of 0-1 for Arm A and C
             subjects and 0-2 for Arm B.
