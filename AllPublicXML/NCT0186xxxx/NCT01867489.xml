  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This qualitative study explores how patients deal with the side effects from chemotherapy at
      their home, what factors and ideas influence their symptom self-management and how
      professional caregivers contribute to the management of their symptoms at home. Data are
      collected through semi-structured interviews with adult patients treated with chemotherapy
      and analysed using a Grounded Theory approach.
