    <measure>Change from baseline in mean sitting systolic blood pressure (msSBP) of LCZ696 monotherapy compared to placebo</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Sitting blood pressure will be measured at trough (immediately prior to dosing at clinic) and recorded at all study visits. At the first study visit, blood pressure will be measured in both arms and the arm with highest sitting SBP will be found and used for all subsequent readings throughout the study. The 4 repeat sitting measurements will be made at 2 minute intervals and the mean of these four sitting systolic blood pressure measurements will be used as the mean sitting systolic blood pressure for that visit.</description>
