      1. To evaluate the safety, and efficacy of Lisdexamfetamine dimesylate in the treatment of
           outpatients with DSM-IV ADHD with anxiety and depressive disorder comorbidity, as well
           as to evaluate the effects on quality of life .

        2. To evaluate the efficacy of Lisdexamfetamine dimesylate in the treatment of anxiety and
           depressive disorders which commonly occur with ADHD.

        3. To examine the potential relationship between telomere length and Adult ADHD with
           comorbidity and the potential effect of treatment response.

        4. To examine the potential associations with specific genes and Adult ADHD.
