        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Has a history of severe glaucoma, uveitis, optic neuropathy or any confirmed damage to
             the optic nerve and/or visual cortex,

          -  Has any disease (other than study allowed diseases) or condition that affects retinal
             function of the study eye (e.g., central retinal artery/vein occlusion, end-stage
             diabetic retinopathy, current or prior retinal detachment, infectious or inflammatory
             retinal disease, etc.),

          -  Has any disease or condition that prevents adequate visualization of the retina of the
             study eye including, but not limited to, corneal degeneration that cannot be resolved
             prior to implantation,

          -  Has any disease or condition of the anterior segment of the study eye that prevents
             adequate physical examination (e.g., ocular trauma, etc.),

          -  Has severe nystagmus,

          -  Has any ocular condition that leads him or her to eye rubbing,

          -  Has any disease or condition that precludes the understanding or communication of the
             informed consent, study requirements or test protocols (e.g., deafness , multiple
             sclerosis, amyotrophc lateral sclerosis, neuritis, etc),

          -  Has a history of epileptic seizure,

          -  Has a history of chronic or recurrent infection or inflammation that would preclude
             participation in the study,

          -  Is pregnant or lactating,

          -  Has another active implanted device (e.g. cochlear implant) or any form of metallic
             implant in the head (other than dental work) that may interfere with the device
             function,

             implant, etc.),

                  surgery),

               -  Oral anticoagulants (5 days before until 3 days after surgery),

          -  Is participating in another investigational drug or device study that may interfere
             with the proposed treatment or the ensuring follow-up schedule, (in Germany: Is
             participating in another investigational drug or device study)

          -  Has any health concern that makes general anaesthesia inadvisable, (in Germany:
             Patients with an ASA-Score of 3 or higher are excluded from the study)

          -  Is likely requiring MRI scans subsequent to implantation and prior to explantation,

          -  Is likely requiring therapeutic ultrasound subsequent to implantation and prior to
             explantation of the Retinal Implant

        In Germany: - Patients with recurrent or chronic inflammations or infections are excluded
        from the study. Specifically patients with the following disorders are excluded:

          -  Common inflammation - severe chronic and consuming diseases that frequently associated
             with infection (e.g. Crohn disease, Whipple's disease)

          -  Chronic inflammation of the skin in the area of the eye (e.g. dermatitis, rosacea,
             infection of the skin, herpes zoster)

          -  Chronic inflammation in the area of the eye (e.g. herpes of cornea and/or conjunctiva,
             recurrent blepharoconjunctivitis, horedolum, chalazion) In Germany: - Has a severe
             psychological disorder. When in any doubt, an expert assessment needs to be arranged
             to clarify whether the patient's psychological health is suitable for the trial.

        In Germany: - Has severe renal, cardiac, hepatic etc. organ diseases
