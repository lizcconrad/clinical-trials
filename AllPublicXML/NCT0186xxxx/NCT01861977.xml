    <description>Participants in this arm will be invited to attend 8 weekly group meetings and 3 monthly follow-up meetings. In each meeting a coordinator will explore the experiences of the participants and encourage them to look for strategies to solve problems associated with changing habits. In the meetings we will use a therapeutic education approach with motivational interviewing techniques and problem solving in order to increase self-efficacy and motivation to adopt healthy habits. There will be periodic reminders and telephone contacts with patients before the meetings to assess the achievement of objectives.</description>
