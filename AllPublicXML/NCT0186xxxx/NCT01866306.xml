  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to establish the safety and tolerability of Unbiased Biomarkers
      for the Prediction of Respiratory Disease Outcomes (U-BIOPRED) human rhinovirus 16 (RV16UB)
      in healthy and asthmatic participants, and to identify an appropriate dosage of RV16UB in
      order to study biomarkers in asthmatic participants. The study is divided into 2 parts. Part
      1 is a dose-finding study where healthy participants, and asthmatic participants, who were
      either treated or not treated with a class of long-acting beta antagonists (LABA) will be
      recruited to undergo nasal challenge with increasing doses of RV16UB. Part 2 is a biomarker
      study where mild to moderate asthmatics undergo challenge with the most appropriate dose of
      RV16UB identified in Part 1, based on tolerability and viral effects. .

    <measure>Number of Healthy and Asthmatic Participants With Events of Clinical Interest (ECI) (Part 1)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to Day 24</time_frame>
    <description>ECI are selected non-serious and serious adverse events which include the following: an overdose of Sponsor's product; requirement for systemic steroids to treat asthma exacerbation related to virus challenge; acute reaction to virus challenge, confirmed through repeat measurement and when considered potentially associated with administration of virus; specified vital sign findings within 4hr of challenge; specified symptom findings within 24hr of challenge; &gt;20% decrease in Forced Expiratory Volume in 1 second (FEV1) relative to baseline within 4hr of challenge; dyspnea associated with drop in FEV1 (within 4hr of challenge) that is unresponsive to a bronchodilator rescue agent within 20 minutes; Grade 2+ deviation from normal values of liver-related laboratory parameters at any time between challenge and day 14.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants With Serious Adverse Events (SAE) (Parts 1 and 2)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to Day 24</time_frame>
    <description>A SAE is any adverse event occurring at any dose or during any use of the Sponsor's product that: results in death; is life threatening; results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity; results in or prolongs an existing in-patient hospitalization; is a congenital anomaly/birth defect; is a cancer; is associated with an overdose; is another important medical event.</description>

    <measure>Number of Asthmatic Participants Treated With a Viral Dose of 100 TCID50 With Challenge Induced Upper Airway Symptoms (Part 1)</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1 up to Day 7</time_frame>
    <description>Asthmatic participants from Part 1 were treated with RV16UB virus at a dose of 100 TCID50, and challenge induced upper airway symptoms were monitored with a diary recording Jackson Cold Symptom Score (CSS). The CSS measures 8 cold symptoms, with each symptom scored from 0 (absent) to 3 (severe). The total score ranges from 0-24, with higher scores reflecting greater severity. The number of participants with a CSS score equal or greater than 3 for two days in a row are presented.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Time -Weighted Average (TWA) Percent Change From Baseline (CFB) in Morning FEV1 in Asthmatic Participants on Days 1-7 (Part 2)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Days 1 - 7</time_frame>
    <description>Log-transformed FEV1 data were fit by Bayesian hierarchical longitudinal models, with a random participant effect and a fixed categorical effect for day. All baseline (day -7 to day -1) FEV1 were assumed to be with equal mean. FEV1 assessments obtained between 3 am to 3 pm were counted as morning measurements. The TWA CFB morning FEV1 on days 1-7 was calculated as the difference of the mean of estimated day 1-7 morning FEV1 value and the corresponding estimated baseline value. The 95% Confidence Interval actually refers to a 95% Credible Interval. The anticipated mean reduction from baseline is 10%.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>TWA Percent CFB in Evening FEV1 in Asthmatic Participants on Days 1-7 (Part 2)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Days 1- 7</time_frame>
    <description>Log-transformed FEV1 data were fit by Bayesian hierarchical longitudinal models, with a random participant effect and a fixed categorical effect for day. All baseline (day -7 to day -1) FEV1 were assumed to be with equal mean. FEV1 assessments obtained between 3 pm to next day 3 am were counted as evening measurements. The TWA CFB evening FEV1 on days 1-7 was calculated as the difference of the mean of estimated day 1-7 evening FEV1 value and the corresponding estimated baseline value. The FEV1 readings on the evenings of sputum inductions were excluded from the analyses. The 95% Confidence Interval actually refers to a 95% Credible Interval. The anticipated mean reduction from baseline is 10%.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in Mean Maximum Jackson Cold Symptom Score (CSS) on Days 1 to 14 in Asthmatic Participants (Part 1)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Days 1 - 14</time_frame>
    <description>Asthmatic participants from Part 1 were treated with RV16UB virus, and challenge induced upper airway symptoms were monitored with a diary recording CSS. The CSS measures 8 cold symptoms, with each symptom scored from 0 (absent) to 3 (severe). The total score ranges from 0-24, with higher scores reflecting greater severity, and a positive change from baseline indicating worsening symptoms.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Asthmatic Participants Demonstrating at Least 10^3 Copies/ml of Viral RNA in Nasal Lavage Fluid on Days 1 to 14 (Part 1)</measure>
    <time_frame>Days 1 - 14</time_frame>
    <description>Viral RNA was measured by real time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) from nasal lavage fluid collected on day 3 and day 7 from asthmatic participants, and the number of participants with at least 10^3 copies/ml was determined.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Mean Percent Change From Baseline in Maximum Drop FEV1 of Asthmatic Participants (Part 2)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and up to day 7</time_frame>
    <description>Log-transformed FEV1 data were fit by Bayesian hierarchical longitudinal models, with a random participant effect and a fixed categorical effect for day. All baseline (day -7 to day -1) FEV1 were assumed to be with equal mean. The FEV1 readings on the evenings of sputum inductions were excluded from the analyses. The percent decrease of the lowest FEV1 measurement after viral challenge compared to the TWA of the baseline FEV1 is presented. The 95% Confidence Interval actually refers to a 95% Credible Interval. The mean percent decrease is anticipated to be different from zero.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Mean Change From Baseline in TWA Asthma Control Diary (ACD) Score of Asthmatic Participants on Days 3 to 10 (Part 2)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Days 3 to 10</time_frame>
    <description>The ACD contains seven symptom questions (nocturnal awakening, waking in the morning with symptoms, activity limitation, shortness of breath and wheezing) which are answered on rising in the morning and retiring at bedtime. Missing scores are imputed by linear interpolation or extrapolation. Daily ACD score was fit by a Bayesian hierarchical longitudinal model with participant-specific intercept and a fixed categorical effect for day. All baseline (day -7 to day -1) ACD scores are assumed to be with equal mean. The ACD score is the sum of responses to the seven questions, with answers on a 7-point scale (0= no impairment; 6 = maximum impairment) with the score ranging from 0 to 42, and higher scores indicating greater impairment. The 95% Confidence Interval actually refers to a 95% Credible Interval. The mean percent increase is anticipated to be different from zero.</description>

        <description>Asthmatic participants from Part 1 were treated with RV16UB virus at a dose of 100 TCID50, and challenge induced upper airway symptoms were monitored with a diary recording Jackson Cold Symptom Score (CSS). The CSS measures 8 cold symptoms, with each symptom scored from 0 (absent) to 3 (severe). The total score ranges from 0-24, with higher scores reflecting greater severity. The number of participants with a CSS score equal or greater than 3 for two days in a row are presented.</description>

          <description>Asthmatic participants from Part 1 were treated with RV16UB virus at a dose of 100 TCID50, and challenge induced upper airway symptoms were monitored with a diary recording Jackson Cold Symptom Score (CSS). The CSS measures 8 cold symptoms, with each symptom scored from 0 (absent) to 3 (severe). The total score ranges from 0-24, with higher scores reflecting greater severity. The number of participants with a CSS score equal or greater than 3 for two days in a row are presented.</description>

        <description>Log-transformed FEV1 data were fit by Bayesian hierarchical longitudinal models, with a random participant effect and a fixed categorical effect for day. All baseline (day -7 to day -1) FEV1 were assumed to be with equal mean. FEV1 assessments obtained between 3 am to 3 pm were counted as morning measurements. The TWA CFB morning FEV1 on days 1-7 was calculated as the difference of the mean of estimated day 1-7 morning FEV1 value and the corresponding estimated baseline value. The 95% Confidence Interval actually refers to a 95% Credible Interval. The anticipated mean reduction from baseline is 10%.</description>

        <title>Mean Change From Baseline in TWA Asthma Control Diary (ACD) Score of Asthmatic Participants on Days 3 to 10 (Part 2)</title>
        <description>The ACD contains seven symptom questions (nocturnal awakening, waking in the morning with symptoms, activity limitation, shortness of breath and wheezing) which are answered on rising in the morning and retiring at bedtime. Missing scores are imputed by linear interpolation or extrapolation. Daily ACD score was fit by a Bayesian hierarchical longitudinal model with participant-specific intercept and a fixed categorical effect for day. All baseline (day -7 to day -1) ACD scores are assumed to be with equal mean. The ACD score is the sum of responses to the seven questions, with answers on a 7-point scale (0= no impairment; 6 = maximum impairment) with the score ranging from 0 to 42, and higher scores indicating greater impairment. The 95% Confidence Interval actually refers to a 95% Credible Interval. The mean percent increase is anticipated to be different from zero.</description>
