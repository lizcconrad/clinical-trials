    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the extent to which bacterial growth in the
      nostrils by S. aureus, a common bacteria that is found in hospital environment, can be
      reduced by NOZIN® Nasal Sanitizer® antiseptic nasal swabs during the course of a typical
      10-hour work period in participants known to have S. aureus in their nose passages.

      The purpose of the proposed pilot study is to employ a repeated sampling protocol to test the
      effectiveness of a currently marketed, over-the-counter topical preparation to reduce
      carriage of Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) in the nasal vestibules of health professionals
      working in an outpatient clinical setting. The product to be tested is the NOZIN® Nasal
      Sanitizer® antiseptic produced by Global Life Technologies Corp. It is an alcohol-based,
      non-antibiotic antiseptic preparationl

      The study has one primary Specific Aim:

      To determine the extent to which colonization of the vestibular region of the nares by S.
      aureus can be reduced by a regimen of nasal topical applications of the alcohol-based
      antiseptic during the course of typical 10-hour work day in subjects known to exhibit S.
      aureus nasal carriage.

      A secondary aim of the study will be to evaluate the concurrent effectiveness of the
      antiseptic applications on a measure of general bacterial colonization within the vestibules
      of each subject.
