  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Regular physical activity has been found to be important in maintaining health and well-being
      in people with COPD. The purpose of this study is to test new technology and health coaching
      aimed to help people with COPD become more physically active in their daily lives.

      This study consists of a home-based pulmonary rehabilitation system. The system consists of a
      tablet computer, pulse oximeter, activity monitor and weekly telephone health coach calls.
      The rehabilitation period lasts 8 weeks. This is a randomized trial with two groups. Group A
      will complete the study activities during the first 8 weeks of the study followed by a period
      of observation. Group B will complete 8 weeks of observation followed by 8 weeks of
      rehabilitation.
