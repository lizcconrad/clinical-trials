      The purpose of this study is to assess the feasibility and safety of topical administration
      of etanercept via AFL micropores to psoriatic plaques in patients with mild to moderate
      plaque-type psoriasis.

      While a wide variety of therapeutic innovations to treat moderate-to-severe psoriasis
      (accounting for around 30% of the cases) become available each year, there are few
      innovations for topical therapies to treat mild/localized psoriasis (accounting for around
      70% of the cases). Given that only about half of the patients respond adequately to the
      current standard of care, the topical application of a fixed combination of calcipotriole and
      betamethasone, there is a medical need for better topical therapies.

      Etanercept has been used successfully to treat moderate-to-severe plaque-type psoriasis in
      children and adults for more than a decade. Its standard route of application is through
      subcutaneous injections. Different dosing regimens have been used: 1 x 50 mg or 2 x 50 mg per
      week as well as 1 x 25 mg or 2 x 25 mg per week. Under these regimens, etanercept has a
      well-established favorable long-term safety record, with injection site reactions (pain,
      swelling) the most frequently reported side effects. However, rare but serious side effects
      such as serious opportunistic infections resulting from immune system inhibition common to
      anti-TNF agents limit its systemic use to these patients. For this reason, a localized
      topical alternative route of administration would be desirable. However, the large molecular
      size and chemical nature of etanercept prevent it from crossing the epidermal barrier. A CE
      certified ablative fractional laser (AFL) device with Er:YAG source will be used to create
      micropores in plaques to allow local delivery of etanercept directly into psoriatic plaques.

      Monocentric, observer partially-blinded Phase I study.

      In this study, three similar plaques on each patient will be prospectively identified by the
      blinded observer and then randomized by an unblinded investigator by using the eCRF to one of
      the three study treatments:

        1. Standard of care (daily administration of Daivobet® by the patient),

        2. Ablative fractional laser microporation + topical application of etanercept

        3. Ablative fractional laser microporation alone.

      Over the treatment period of 8 weeks, patients will return to the clinic twice weekly for
      assessment of the three study plaques by the blinded observer, followed by administration of
      the treatment of plaques assigned to AFL microporation with or without etanercept. Patients
      will treat the remaining plaque with Daivobet® themselves on a daily basis.

      Although no incompatibilities of AFL and etanercept are anticipated, because this is the
      first time etanercept is administered topically via AFL micropores and using a AFL
      microporation device, the study will be conducted in two stages: a Safety Stage consisting of
      the first five patients and the Study Stage with thirty patients.

      In the Safety Stage of the study, three different plaques of the first 5 patients will be
      randomized and administered the respective treatments only once. Enrollment will be suspended
      after the 5th patient has been enrolled to permit the data monitoring committee (DMC) to
      review of the initial safety data from these first 5 patients to reassess risk. Based on this
      review, the DMC will make one of three recommendations:

        1. to continue the study as planned,

        2. to continue the study with adjustments to study procedures, such as changes to laser
           parameters, frequency of treatments or concentration of etanercept or,

        3. in the event of extreme safety concerns, to terminate the study.

      If option 1 is recommended, the study will resume with the Study Stage (Stage 2), in which
      the initial 5 patients will once again begin treatment, with their plaques receiving the same
      treatments to which they were previously randomized. Their treatment will continue for 8
      weeks. Enrollment will also resume and continue until an additional 25 patients have been
      enrolled. If the DMC recommends option 2, treatment and enrollment will resume as just
      described after an adapted protocol has been submitted to and approved by the relevant
      authorities. If the DMC recommends option 3, then the study will terminate.

      The Study Stage will consist of 2 periods: screening period (up to 2 weeks prior to baseline
      assessments and randomization) and treatment period (for the first 5 patients: initially 1
      set of treatments, followed by suspension of treatment until after DMC review, then 8 weeks
      of treatment; for the remaining 25 patients: 8 weeks of treatment depending on plaque
      randomization, either daily Daivobet® or biweekly AFL with or without etanercept).

             In the case of oophorectomy alone, only when the reproductive status of the woman has

             bearing potential

             and/or places the patient at unacceptable risk for receiving an immunomodulatory
             therapy

         19. History of clinically significant liver disease or liver injury as indicated by
             abnormal liver function tests. Aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine

             virus) or hepatitis B infection (i.e. positive hepatitis B surface antigen [HBsAg]).

             known human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection

         26. Active tuberculosis. If a QuantiFERON®- Tuberculosis (TB) Gold test at screening is
             positive, further work-up, according to local guidelines/practices needs to be
             performed to conclusively establish that that the patient has no evidence of active
             tuberculosis.

         27. History of serious recurrent, chronic infectious disease (excluding fungal infections
             of the nail beds) or active systemic infections during the last two weeks (exception:

             patients with a history or evidence of opportunistic infections including specific
             pathogens such as listeria, legionella and parasitic infections. Investigator
             discretion should be used regarding patients who have traveled or resided in areas of
             endemic mycoses, such as histoplasmosis, coccidioidomycosis or blastomycosis and for
             patients with underlying conditions that may predispose them to infection, such as
             advanced or poorly controlled diabetes

             for carcinoma in situ of the cervix or non-invasive malignant colon polyps that have
             been removed)

         30. Current severe progressive or uncontrolled disease which in the judgment of the
             clinical investigator renders the patient unsuitable for the trial

         31. Inability or unwillingness to undergo repeated venipuncture (poor tolerability or lack
             of access to veins)

         32. Blood donation or blood loss of &gt;400 ml in the 8 weeks prior to randomization.

             syringes for Enbrel® contain dry natural rubber)

         35. Any medical or psychiatric condition which, in the Investigator's opinion, would
             preclude the participant from adhering to the protocol or completing the study per
             protocol

         36. History or evidence of ongoing alcohol or drug abuse, within the last six months
             before baseline

             tanning devices) during the course of the study.
