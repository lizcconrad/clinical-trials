  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients taking chemotherapeutic agents often do not comply well with their dosing regiment
      since many of these medications cause a metallic taste in the mouth. The primary intent is to
      determine the effectiveness of the oral rinse in reducing the metallic taste in the mouth
      associated with various chemotherapeutic agents. This clinical study a randomized,
      double-blind, single-treatment, parallel design with a placebo as the control. The duration
      of the trial will be 1 month.
