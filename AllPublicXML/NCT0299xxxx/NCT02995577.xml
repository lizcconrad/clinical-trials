    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigates serum and stool biomarkers as predictors for
      post-operative feeding intolerance in infant patients with complex congenital heart defects
      who undergo single ventricle staged palliation surgery.

    <description>Patients that are able to reach 80-100% of full enteral feeds (whether fed by mouth or through a nasogastric tube) 7 days after the initiation of feeds.

    <description>Patients with GI symptoms (vomiting, abdominal distention, diarrhea, hematemesis, and/or hematochezia) that persist for 48 hours or longer while needing to be NPO, this patient is retrospectively categorized into the feeding intolerance group. Patients with feeding intolerance may also include infants that are made NPO, placed on bowel rest, and are started on antibiotics to rule out NEC, but are never diagnosed with NEC. Exclusion criteria include patients that are continued on antibiotics for greater than 48 hours due to diagnosed bacterial sepsis or diagnosed NEC, and those that have a positive blood, urine, or sputum culture.</description>

        The study population will be infants with complex congenital cyanotic heart disease
        requiring single ventricle staged palliation surgery at Children's Memorial Hermann
        Hospital (CMHH) at the Texas Medical Center. This will include neonates undergoing single
        ventricle staged palliation in the form of (a) Norwood-type procedure, (b)
        systemic-to-pulmonary artery shunt procedure, or (c) pulmonary artery banding.
