  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      prospective interventional study. The aim is to analyse the effect of usual ongoing
      treatments over the microvascular cutaneous response to galvanic current application (Current
      induced vasodilation ; CIV) on the forearm of subjects referred for ultrasound investigations
      due to suspicion of peripheral artery disease. Hypothesis is that the use of aspirin (even at
      low dose) abolishes the response .

      At admission eligible patients are proposed to participate. Written consent is signed after
      complete oral and written explanation of the protocol is signed.

      No register of non-included patients will be kept. In included patients, in parallel to the
      routine ultrasound investigation for which the patient is referred, microvascular
      investigation will be performed as explained later in arm description.

      Usual ongoing treatments are obtained by history and recorded. The end of the visit is the
      end of the participation of the subjects.

    <description>A galvanic current (0.1 mA) will be applied between 2 patches on the forearm of patient and protocol was repeated at 4 minutes.
Microvascular response to current application (CIV) will be recorded by laser speckle flowmetry 10 minutes later.
