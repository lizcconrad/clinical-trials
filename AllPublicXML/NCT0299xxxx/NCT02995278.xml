      Pain is the most common reason patients consult primary care providers. According to recent
      surveys, One in six Americans live with chronic or recurrent pain and pay an estimated $120
      billion a year in medical costs in the United States. Oral opioids are the common treatment
      options for various chronic pains including joint pain, musculoskeletal pain, neuropathic
      pain and migraines. This narcotic-based management of pain is often associated with
      undesirable side effects with addictive and potential abuse.

      To ensure proper usage of prescribed medications, physicians use drug screens to monitor
      therapeutic levels and test for presence of illegal drugs or medications that may cause a
      drug-drug interaction. Upon receiving quantitative or qualitative results from these drug
      screens, the physician may change the treatment plan for patients to improve efficacy of
      prescribed medications.
