      The aim of the study was to compare the restoration of the GI tract by the closure of
      protective ileostomy after low anterior resection for rectal cancer after 14 days and more

    <textblock>
      The closure of the protective ileostomy created during the low anterior resection for rectal
      cancer to protect the colo-rectal anastomosis is inevitable to restore the continuity of the
      gastrointestinal tract. It usually takes place several months after the primary surgery,
      because the patients starts chemotherapy and cannot undergo the procedure during the therapy.
      It results in the relative low quality of life of the patient, as well as often leads to
      complications. Therefore, it seem reasonable to close the stoma as soon as possible to take
      the burden off patient.

      It is well known that the healing process of the anastomosis runs in the three phases, but
      only two first are crucial for the clinical result. The second takes place between 5th and
      14th postoperative day. Therefore it should be possible to perform successful restoration of
      the GI tract already after two weeks after operation, and not after many moths.

      The aim of the study was to compare the restoration of the GI tract after 14 days and more
      than 3 months, so to compare the traditional and early strategy.
