      .Rerouting operation takes the advantage of minimal recurrence rate as well as minimal
      incontinence that is associated with less sphincter division,It is indicated in patients with
      transsphincteric fistula in whom lay open is expected to be associated with significant
      incontinence .

      Lay open is the classic surgical management for Peri Anal fistula,however division of
      significant portion of anal sphincter may be divided with postoperative fecal
      incontinence,Many surgical techniques have been described for sphincter preservation ,But
      unfortunately associated high recurrence rate.Rerouting operation takes the advantage of
      minimal recurrence rate as well as minimal incontinence that is associated with less
      sphincter division,It is indicated in patients with transsphincteric fistula in whom lay open
      is expected to be associated with significant incontinence .The operation is done in tow
      stages ,the first is to mobilize the transsphincteric part into the inter sphincteric plane
      thus converting it to intersphincteric fistula which is then laid open , with division of
      internal sphincter with preserving external sphincter.
