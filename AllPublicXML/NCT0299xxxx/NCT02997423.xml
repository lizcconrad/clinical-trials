    <textblock>
      This is a multi-institutional, consortium-based, non-interventional prospective blinded
      endpoints clinical study to determine whether high activity of Cytochrome C Oxidase (CcO) in
      tumor specimens from subjects with newly diagnosed primary GBM is associated with shortened
      OS (primary outcome) and PFS (secondary outcome) times.

    <textblock>
      This Biomarker trial is designed to prospectively evaluate the hypothesis that the overall
      survival (OS) time of a subject with newly diagnosed primary GBM tumors, treated by standard
      of care (SOC), is a function of the CcO enzymatic activity in the tumor (OS; time interval
      from date of first diagnosis to death from any cause, irrespective of post-SOC therapies,
      assessed up to 24 months from accrual). In particular, tumors with high CcO activity are
      associated with shorter OS time as compared to tumors with low CcO activity. SOC consists of
      post-surgical radiation therapy with concurrent Temozolomide followed by up to 12 cycles of
      adjuvant Temozolomide.

      Additional outcomes are to study the relation between CcO activity in the GBM tumors and
      progression free survival times (PFS; time intervals from dates of diagnosis to documented
      disease progression by MRI or tumor-related death) and, to compare the prognostic abilities
      of CcO activity to other frequently used biomarkers, namely the methylation status of
      O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT), on OS and PFS.

      Tumor tissue will be submitted by participating centers for measurements of the CcO/Citrate
      Synthase (CS), MGMT promoter methylation. The subjects will agree to receive the SOC
      treatment. The therapeutic option at the time of first recurrence is at the discretion of the
      treating physician. PFS and OS times will be compared with high vs. low CcO activity and with
      the MGMT methylation status of the tumor. At the time of death or at 24 months s/p enrollment
      (whichever comes first), the site PI will complete an exit form documenting the details of
      enrollees' treatment history and date(s) of any tumor progression.

    <description>This Biomarker trial is designed to prospectively evaluate the hypothesis that the overall survival (OS) time of a subject with newly diagnosed primary GBM tumors, treated by standard of care (SOC), is a function of the CcO enzymatic activity in the tumor. OS is defined as the time interval from date of first diagnosis to death from any cause, irrespective of post-SOC therapies, assessed up to 24 months from accrual. In particular, tumors with high CcO activity, defined as CcO/citrate synthase (CcO/CS) ratio &gt; 4, are associated with shorter OS time as compared to tumors with low CcO activity (CcO/CS &lt; 4). SOC consists of post-surgical radiation therapy with concurrent Temozolomide followed by up to 12 cycles of adjuvant Temozolomide.
While on therapy, the subjects will be evaluated either in clinic or via telephone interviews at 6 months s/p enrollment and then at 3 month intervals up to 24 months or death, whichever comes first.</description>

    <description>This Biomarker trial is also designed to prospectively evaluate the hypothesis that Progression Free survival time (PFS) is a function of the CcO enzymatic activity in the tumor. PFS is defined as time interval from date of first diagnosis to first documented progression by MRI (RANO criteria) or tumor-related death of subjects, irrespective of post-SOC therapies, assessed up to 24 months from accrual. In particular, tumors with high CcO activity, defined as CcO/citrate synthase (CcO/CS) ratio &gt; 4, are associated with shorter PFS time as compared to tumors with low CcO activity (CcO/CS &lt; 4).</description>

    <description>Methylation status of O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) from tumor tissues will be assayed.

        Inclusion Criteria

        Pre-Surgery:

          1. Willingness and ability to provide written informed consent and to comply with the
             study protocol as judged by Physician interview (NOTE: This could be patient's
             Neurosurgeon, Neuro-Oncologist or Study Investigator).

          2. Age ≥ 21years

             study.

          3. Secondary GBM or other gliomas.

          4. History of sensitivity to Temozolomide.
