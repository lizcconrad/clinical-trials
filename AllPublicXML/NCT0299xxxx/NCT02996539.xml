  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Several studies have investigated an association between cardiac autonomic neuropathy (CAN)
      and albuminuria, glomerular filtration rate, or both, and hypothesized that CAN is involved
      in the pathogenesis of nephropathy. However, most of these studies had focused on Caucasians
      and were limited to a small number of patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus, or had used a
      conventional Ewing battery of tests based on dynamic cardiovascular maneuvers.Yet, there is
      consistent data showing that Asian diabetic populations, including the Chinese, have a higher
      risk of renal complications than Caucasians do.

      The present study investigated an association between heart rate variability (HRV) parameters
      and diabetic kidney disease (DKD) in Chinese type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) patients,
      specifically through time and frequency domain analyses of HRV and urine albumin creatinine
      ratio (UACR) or estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR).

    <description>Assessment of HRV HRV measurement based on 24-hour ambulatory ECG monitoring was obtained from all patients using a 3- channel digital Holter recorder (CB-2302-A, Wuxi, Jiangsu, China). Assessment of DKD DKD was defined as the presence of albuminuria (UACR ≥ 30 mg/g,urine albumin in milligram,creatinine in gram) or eGFR &lt; 60 mL/min/1.73 m^2 (creatinine concentration in umol/l,creatinine molecular weight in micromole, volume in litre;urine volume per minute in milliliter per minute; body surface area in square meter) based on SCr levels. Albuminuria was defined using UACR of a single early-morning urine measurement.For all Participants, 132 patients had albuminuria and 50 patients with eGFR &lt; 60 mL/min/1.73 m^2</description>

    <description>Clinical examination and laboratory measurements Subjects were interviewed by a physician regarding their medical history, history of hypoglycemic attacks, smoking status, and alcohol consumption. A trained examiner measured the height (in meters) and body weight (in kilograms) of the patients. Body mass index (BMI) in kg/m^2, weight in kilograms, height in meters. Hypertension was defined as systolic blood pressure ≥140 mm Hg or diastolic blood pressure ≥90 mm Hg, or both, or if the patient was already taking anti-hypertensive drugs. Blood and urine samples were analyzed at the medical examination center of Kunming First People's Hospital.</description>

    <description>Subjects were interviewed by a physician regarding their medical history, history of hypoglycemic attacks, smoking status, and alcohol consumption. Concentrations of blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and serum creatinine (SCr) were analyzed by the urease-ultraviolet rate method and picric acid method, respectively. Serum uric acid was determined using the enzymatic colorimetric method. Serum hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) was measured by liquid enzymatic assay. Urine albumin and urine creatinine were found through immune turbidimetric analysis and the enzymatic method, respectively.</description>

        392 patients of T2DM consecutively recruited from February 2013 to April 2015 in the
        inpatient department of Kunming First People's Hospital.The Institutional Review Board of
        Kunming First People's Hospital approved the study protocol. Adult patients with T2DM who
        had consecutively undergone 24-hour Holter monitoring for HRV analysis were included.
