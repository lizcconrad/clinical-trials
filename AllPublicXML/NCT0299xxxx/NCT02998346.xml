      The purpose of this observational study is to measure the number of calories delivered from
      fluids used in continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT). We are doing this research study
      because the fluids used in this treatment may deliver an important number of calories. In the
      future this could help better estimate how much nutrition patients in the Critical Care Unit
      should get every day from other sources like tube feeding or nutrition through a person's
      veins.

      The goal of this study is to quantify the specific metabolic contribution of standard
      continuous renal replacement protocols (including citrate anticoagulation) in the intensive
      care unit patient population at Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota utilizing a prospective,
      observational study. This data will allow practitioners to better tailor caloric provision
      with nutrition support programs, minimizing the risk of overfeeding in this complex critical
      care patient population.
