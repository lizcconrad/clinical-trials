  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, single arm, multi-center, pilot study of Nivolumab in pediatric
      patients with recurrent or refractory hypermutant malignancies aged 12 months to 18 years of
      age. This study is to assess clinical and radiological benefits of treatment with Nivolumab
      in children with hypermutated cancers, including those with bMMRD syndrome. It is our
      expectation that patients with bMMRD syndrome will account for the majority of patients
      enrolled on this study.

             and be monitored.

             Exclusion Criteria:

             - 3. Pregnancy or Breast-Feeding

               -  Pregnant or breast-feeding women will not be entered on this study due to risks
                  of fetal and teratogenic adverse events as there is yet no available information
                  regarding human fetal or teratogenic toxicities.

               -  Women of childbearing potential (WOCBP)* must have a negative serum or urine
                  pregnancy test (minimum sensitivity 25 IU/L or equivalent units of HCG) within 1

               -  WOCBP who are sexually active must be willing to adhere to effective
                  contraception** during treatment and for 23 weeks after the last dose of

               -  Men who are sexually active with WOCBP must be willing to adhere to effective
                  contraception** during treatment and for 31 weeks after the last dose of the

               -  Women, who are surgically sterile as well as azoospermic men do not require
                  contraception.

                    -  &quot;Women of childbearing potential&quot; is defined as any female who has
                       experienced menarche and who has not undergone surgical sterilization
                       (hysterectomy or bilateral oophorectomy) or who is not postmenopausal.

                         -  List of contraception methods is provided in the Appendix II

        4. Concomitant Medications

             not have received systemic corticosteroids within 7 days prior to enrollment. Note:
             Use of topical, ocular, intra-articular, intra-nasal or inhaled corticosteroids will
             not render a patient ineligible. Physiological replacement doses of systemic steroids
             can be permitted even if &gt; 10mg/day prednisone equivalent. A brief course of
             corticosteroids for prophylaxis (eg, contrast dye allergy) or for treatment of
             non-autoimmune conditions (eg, delayed-type hypersensitivity reaction caused by
             contact allergen) is permitted if completed at least 7 days prior to initiation of
             therapy.

             5. Patients with the History of Autoimmune Disease: patients with a history of any
             Grade autoimmune disorder are not eligible. Asymptomatic laboratory abnormalities
             (e.g. ANA, rheumatoid factor, altered thyroid function studies) will not render a
             patient ineligible in the absence of a diagnosis of an autoimmune disorder. Patients
             are permitted to enroll if they have vitiligo, type I diabetes mellitus, psoriasis not
             requiring systemic treatment, or conditions not expected to recur in the absence of an
             external trigger.

             6. Hypothyroidism: patients with ≥ Grade 2 hypothyroidism due to history of
             autoimmunity are not eligible. Note: patients with residual hypothyroidism due to
             autoimmune condition only requiring hormone replacement, or hypothyroidism due to
             previous irradiation or thyroidectomy will be permitted.

             7. Infection: patients who have an uncontrolled infection are not eligible.

             8. HIV and/or Hepatitis B/C Patients: patients with known HIV/AIDS or acute/chronic
             hepatitis B or C are excluded.

             transplants or prior solid organ transplantation are not eligible.

             10. Non-Compliance: patients who in the opinion of the investigator may not be able to

             11. Previous anti-PD1 and/or anti-PD-L1 therapy: Patients who have received prior
             anti-PD1 and/or anti-PD-L1 directed therapy (mAb or small molecule) are not eligible
