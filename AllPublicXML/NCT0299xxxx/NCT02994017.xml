      The objective of study is to prospectively determine if CPET with blood gas analysis should
      have a prognostic value in CF. The study plans to include 300 cystic fibrosis patients.
      Inclusion criteria will be: age &gt;15 years, cystic fibrosis confirmed by chloride sweat test
      or genetic analysis, clinical and functional stability in the 2 month before CPET. Patients
      will perform a maximal exercise test on a cycloergometer during the inclusion visit, with
      pulmonary function testing and a six-minute walk test. The study will also include a visit
      every 6 months with: body mass index calculation, pulmonary function testing with DLCO
      (diffusing lung capacity for carbon monoxide), a six minute walk test, and
      antibacteriological study of sputum. The results of this study could help identify earlier
      the patients for referral to a lung transplantation centre, by using the usual criteria and
      the CPET abnormalities.

      Current guidelines for referring cystic fibrosis (CF) patients for lung transplantation,
      based on clinical and functional resting parameters, are insufficient to predict 3-year
      mortality. Previous studies have shown that sex, impaired pulmonary function, undernutrition
      and colonization of the respiratory tract by Pseudomonas aeruginosa are associated with a
      poor prognosis. Current guidelines for referral to a lung transplant center include age, sex,
      forced expiratory volume at one second (FEV1) below 30% predicted or a rapid decline of FEV1,
      in particular in young female patients, increasing frequency of exacerbations requiring
      antibiotic therapy, refractory or recurrent pneumothorax, recurrent hemoptysis not controlled
      by embolization. But, despite these criteria, near that 30% of patients are still dying while
      on the lung transplant waiting list, or are transplanted in high emergency. Cardiopulmonary
      exercise testing (CPET) in CF patients would have an interest in the following of cystic
      fibrosis patients. A previous study, carried out on fifty one adult patients, showed that
      CPET with blood gas analysis may have a prognosis value in cystic fibrosis. The authors found
      that a BMI &lt; 19.8 and P(A-a)O2 peak &gt; 43 mmHg were independently associated with a lower
      chance of survival.

    <description>The Cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET) was performed at the beginning of the study, the same at each center. Each patient underwent a symptom-limited incremental exercise test on an ergometric bicycle (Ergoline-Ergometrics 800®). The protocol included a warm-up period of 3 min at 20 W followed by a progressively increasing work rate (WR) in a ramp fashion and then 3 min recovery. The ramped WR increment was individualized (range,8-30 W/min). during exercise, heart rate (HR) was monitored continuously by 12-lead ECG, and arterial oxygen saturation (SpO2) was measured by pulse oximetry (Nellcor N-395). The expired gases were analyzed with an Ergocard®, focusing on oxygen consumption(VO2), carbon dioxide production (VCO2), minute ventilation (VE), and tidal volume (VT).</description>
