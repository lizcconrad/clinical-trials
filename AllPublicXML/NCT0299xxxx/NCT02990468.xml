  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1a-b study of newly diagnosed patients with biopsy-proven head and neck
      cancer (squamous cell carcinoma) who are undergoing standard radiation therapy and treatment
      with cisplatin. BMX-001 added to radiation therapy and cisplatin is expected to reduce
      radiation-induced mucositis and xerostomia and also has the potential to benefit the survival
      of head and neck cancer patients. In Phase 1a, safety and tolerability of BMX-001 will be
      assessed using a Continual Reassessment Method (CRM) and a maximum tolerated dose (MTD) will
      be determined. BMX-001 will be given subcutaneously first with a loading dose zero to four
      days prior to the start of chemoradiation and followed by twice a week doses at one-half of
      the loading dose for the duration of radiation therapy plus two weeks. In Phase 1b both
      safety and efficacy of BMX-001 will be evaluated. Impact on mucositis and xerostomia will
      also be assessed. A maximum of 48 patients will be enrolled to the MTD dose determined in
      Phase 1a to confirm the MTD. The investigators hypothesize that BMX-001 when added to
      standard radiation therapy and cisplatin will be safe at pharmacologically relevant doses in
      patients with newly diagnosed head and neck cancer. The investigators also hypothesize that
      in Phase 1b of this study the addition of BMX-001 will reduce the severity of
      radiation-induced mucositis and xerostomia in patients receiving head and neck radiation
      therapy.

          2. Treatment plan to receive a continuous course of IMRT delivered as single daily
             fractions of 2.0 to 2.1 Gy with a cumulative radiation dose between 60 Gy and 70 Gy

             unresectable/organ preservation high risk. Planned radiation treatment fields must
             include at least two oral sites buccal mucosa, retromolar trigone, floor of mouth,
             oral tongue, soft palate, hard palate) with a portion of each site receiving a minimum
