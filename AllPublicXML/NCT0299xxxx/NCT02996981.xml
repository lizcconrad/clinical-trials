      This is a retrospective chart review using Electronic Privacy Identification Center (EPIC)
      database to determine if the addition of cranberry juice capsules to our discharge medication
      regimen for patients discharged home with an indwelling urinary catheter following pelvic
      floor gynecology surgery reduced the incidence of UTI.

    <textblock>
      The incidence of urinary tract infection (UTI) in women undergoing pelvic floor gynecologic
      surgery is high, ranging from 10-64%. A recent randomized trial showed that cranberry juice
      capsules significantly reduced the incidence of UTI in patients undergoing elective
      gynecologic surgery (19% vs 38%; odds ratio 0.38 with confidence interval 0.19-0.79).

      Cranberry juice capsules were incorporated into the standard practice of Cincinnati
      Urogynecology Associates, TriHealth Inc in mid-March 2016. Currently, all patients who
      undergo pelvic floor gynecologic surgery and are discharged from the hospital with an
      indwelling urinary catheter postoperatively are prescribed cranberry juice capsules to reduce
      the risk of UTI.

      The purpose of this study is to determine if the addition of cranberry juice capsules to the
      discharge medication regimen for patients discharged home with an indwelling urinary catheter
      following pelvic floor gynecology surgery significantly reduced the incidence of UTI,
      compared to a separate cohort that did not have cranberry prescribed.
