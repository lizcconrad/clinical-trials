      This is an extension study, to provide continued access to PRO 140 to subjects who complete
      participation in PRO140_CD02 and continue to receive clinical benefit and would require PRO
      140 to form a viable regimen, in the opinion of the treating physician. The patient
      population for this trial are treatment-experienced HIV infected patients with CCR5-tropic
      virus who demonstrate evidence of HIV-1 suppression after successfully completed 24 weeks of
      treatment in the PRO140_CD02 study.

        Inclusion Criteria: Potential subjects are required to meet all of the following criteria
        for enrollment into the study.

          1. Subjects who have completed 24 weeks of treatment in PRO 140_CD 02 study, and
             Investigator believes subject requires continued access to PRO 140 in order to
             continue deriving clinical benefit and maintain HIV-1 viral suppression

          2. HIV-1 RNA â‰¤ 50 copies/ml at T23 Visit in PRO140_CD02 study

          3. Both male and female patients and their partners of childbearing potential must agree
             to use 2 medically accepted methods of contraception (e.g., barrier contraceptives
             [male condom, female condom, or diaphragm with a spermicidal gel], hormonal
             contraceptives [implants, injectables, combination oral contraceptives, transdermal
             patches, or contraceptive rings], and intrauterine devices) during the course of the
             study (excluding women who are not of childbearing potential and men who have been
             sterilized).

             Females of childbearing potential must have a negative urine pregnancy test prior to
             receiving the first dose of study drug.

          4. Willing and able to participate in all aspects of the study, including use of SC
             medication, completion of subjective evaluations, attendance at scheduled clinic
             visits, and compliance with all protocol requirements as evidenced by providing
             written informed consent.

        Exclusion Criteria: Potential subjects meeting any of the following criteria will be
        excluded from enrollment.

          1. Not currently enrolled in PRO 140_CD 02 study

          2. Any active infection or malignancy requiring acute therapy (with the exception of
             local cutaneous Kaposi's sarcoma)

          3. Females who are pregnant, lactating, or breastfeeding, or who plan to become pregnant
             during the study

          4. Any other clinical condition that, in the Investigator's judgment, would potentially
             compromise study compliance or the ability to evaluate safety measures
