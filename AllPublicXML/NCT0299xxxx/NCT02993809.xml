      The intent of this clinical study is to evaluate the safety of the injection composed of
      autologous bone marrow derived endothelial cells (BM-ECs) and platelet-rich plasma extract
      (PRPE) for the treatment of critical limb ischemia.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Limb ischemia patients(e.g. arteriosclerosis obliterans,diabetic critical limb ischemia,
        thromboangitis obliterans)

          1. 18 Years to 80 Years (Adult, Senior);

          2. Have ability to understand and comply with the study requirements, and provide the
             written informed consent prior to any procedures ;

          3. Patient meets at least one of the following diagnostic criteria for the index limb:

               1. ABI&lt;0.7mmHg

               2. TcpO2 &lt;40 mm Hg

               3. Or, nonhealing ulcer due to local arterial compromise with no opportunity for
                  revascularization;

          4. Have no improvement after conservative treatment and are not suitable for surgical
             bypass surgery because no outflow tract of diseased vessel can be found by imaging;

          5. Despite having good outflow artery, but the elderly and frail patients can also not
             tolerate revascularization or interventional surgery;

          6. Unlikelihood of major amputation of the leg during the next 12 months;

          7. Expected life span more than 2 years.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Pregnant or lactating;

          2. Diabetics with poorly controlled blood glucose levels (defined as HbA1cï¼ž7% and/or
             proliferative retinopathy);

          3. Patients with decompensated cardiac, renal or liver disease;

          4. Patients with confirmed malignant tumor;

          5. Subjects are with serious heart, liver, kidney and lung failure or under poor general
             condition that are inability to undergo bone marrow harvesting and transplantation;

          6. Known or suspected disease of the immune system or osteomyelitis;

          7. Inability to sign informed consent form and to comply with the schedule of the study;

          8. There has reason to suspect that the patient is forced to join the study;

          9. Any other condition, in the opinion of the investigator, would render the patient
             unsuitable for the study.
