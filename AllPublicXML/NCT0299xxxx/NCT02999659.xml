    <textblock>
      The pupilometer determines the alteration of the pupil diameter after a defined light
      stimulus. In this study data is collected from pupilometer measurements of patients with an
      acute cerebral disease. The measurements take place during daily neurological routine
      examinations. The values are compared to outcomes resulting from pupilometer measurements
      done on patients having not an acute cerebral disease (e.g. cerebral aneurysm without
      symptoms). The study aims to establish the not invasive method of pupillometry for detecting
      neurological degradations early.

      The pupilometer determines the alteration of the pupil diameter after a defined light
      stimulus providing information of the autonomic nerve system. The result collecting from
      pupillometry is objective and more precise than the subjective-visual evaluation of the pupil
      and its reactivity.

      In this observational study data is collected from pupilometer measurements of patients with
      an acute cerebral disease. The measurements take place during neurological routine
      examinations. The first measurement is done during the initial diagnosing examination,
      followed by daily measurements and ending with measurements after 3 and 6 month upon hospital
      discharge. The values are compared to standard values resulting from pupilometer measurements
      done on patients having non-acute cerebral disease (e.g. cerebral aneurysm without symptoms).
      The study aims to establish the not invasive method of pupillometry for detecting
      neurological degradations early.
