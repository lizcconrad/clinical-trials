        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patient's custodial parent(s) must provide signed ICF prior to the involvement of the
             patient in any trial-related activities

          2. The subject's custodial parent(s) must have the ability to comply with the protocol

          3. The subject must have a confirmed diagnosis of alpha-mannosidosis as defined by
             alpha-mannosidase activity in leukocytes or fibroblasts &lt; 10% of normal activity
             (historical data)

          4. The subject must have an age at the time of screening &lt; 6 years.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. The subject's diagnosis cannot be confirmed by alpha-mannosidase activity &lt; 10% of
             normal activity

          2. Presence of known chromosomal abnormality and syndromes affecting psychomotor
             development, other than alpha-mannosidosis

          3. History of BMT

          4. Presence of known clinically significant cardiovascular, hepatic, pulmonary, or renal
             disease or other medical conditions that, in the opinion of the Investigator, would
             preclude participation in the trial

          5. Any other medical condition or serious intercurrent illness, or extenuating
             circumstance that, in the opinion of the Investigator, would preclude participation in
             the trial

          6. Planned major surgery that, in the opinion of the Investigator, would preclude
             participation in the trial

          7. Participation in other interventional trials testing the IMP within the last 3 months.
