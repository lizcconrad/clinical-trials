  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Rupture of abdominal aortic aneurysms(AAA) causes 12,000 deaths/year in the UK.1 Elective
      repair to prevent this carries a perioperative mortality of 4.5% for open surgery and 1% for
      endovascular repair. This risk is associated with poor cardiorespiratory fitness which can be
      measured using Cardiopulmonary Exercise Testing(CPET) with the CPET variables, peak oxygen
      uptake(peakVO2)&lt;15ml/kg/min and anaerobic threshold(AT)&lt;10.2ml/kg/min identifying patients at
      increased risk of early death after AAA repair.3 These variables can therefore be used as
      surrogate markers for cardiovascular fitness and risk of mortality and morbidity in AAA
      surgery; optimising these markers should improve fitness and decrease this risk. The optimal
      duration and type of exercise training for improving peak VO2 and AT in AAA patients is not
      known. AAA patients are unique as they are motivated to reduce the risk of impending surgery
      but are afforded the time to improve their fitness as repair may not be needed for months or
      even years.

      The investigators propose a pilot randomised controlled trial to explore the effectiveness of
      a 20-week community (either home or gym-based) exercise programme to achieve sustained
      improvements in peak VO2 and AT, as measured by CPET, in AAA patients. Changes in QoL,
      habitual activity levels and cardiovascular risk will also be assessed. The results will
      inform a definitive multicentre clinical trial on exercise to improve outcomes in elderly
      patients with cardiovascular disease and AAA.

    <description>1. Usual care (control)
Usual care given to patients on AAA surveillance. This includes six-monthly or annual ultrasound measurements of AAA, attendance to surveillance clinic and written (APPENDIX A) and verbal advice on managing cardiovascular risk. This advice will be based on current widely available NHS patient information15 and consists of the following information with regard to:

    <description>Community based-exercise (in addition to usual care) with the choice of either:
Home-based exercise training Participants choosing to exercise at home will follow the programmes intended for this setting, with each exercise designed to be possible without the need for specialist equipment.
Gym-based exercise training Participants will exercise at their nearest Life Leisure LTD gym, following one of the instructor designed programmes , using a combination of aerobic and resistance equipment, as well as simple floor exercises.
Duration and Frequency At least 50 minutes of exercise per day on three non-consecutive days of the week for 20 weeks.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Men with an AAA ≥ 3.0 and &lt; 5.0 cm and women with a AAA ≥ 3.0 and &lt; 4.5 cm

          2. Aged 60 - 85 years inclusive

          3. Willing and able to engage in gym- and/or home-based exercise training and undertake
             CPET

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Unable or unwilling to undertake CPET or exercise training Patients unwilling will not
             be able to give informed consent and those who are unable would not be able to be
             randomised to the intervention study group nor undergo satisfactory testing to obtain
             our outcome measures.

          2. High levels of habitual physical activity (those scoring &quot;high&quot; on the PASE
             questionnaire) These patients already have a high level of physical activity and
             therefore it may not be possible to improve their fitness any further which is the
             primary objective of the study.

             Exclusion criteria 3-10 are all based on medical conditions which would mean either
             exercise training may be unsafe, they would require further investigation and
             treatment of that medical condition or are likely to need upcoming intervention for
             their medical condition which would take priority over any participation in a research
             study. If any medical conditions are discovered during the study, these patients will
             be withdrawn from the study and referred to the necessary health professional.

          3. Severe liver disease (INR &gt; 2, serum albumin &lt; 3.0g/dL, bilirubin &gt; 50µmol/L)

          4. Unstable angina, angina of &lt; 2 month's duration, occurring more than twice daily,
             angina that is increasing in frequency or precipitated by less exertion, angina at
             rest

          5. Uncontrolled atrial fibrillation (AF) or other arrhythmia: untreated paroxysmal AF

          6. Moderate or severe aortic valve stenosis (peak systolic pressure gradient &gt;40mmHg or
             with an aortic valve area &lt; 1cm2)

          7. Class II/III/IV heart failure and/or left ventricular ejection fraction &lt; 25%

          8. Pericarditis or myocarditis within last six months

          9. Patients with &gt; 2mm ST depression on exercise ECG will not be eligible to take part
             and will be referred to a cardiologist for further assessment.

         10. Diagnosis or treatment for a malignancy over the previous 12 months
