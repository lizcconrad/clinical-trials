  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators will conduct a randomized clinical trial pilot study to examine the
      effectiveness of a theoretically based intervention (called ReMind) encompassing two key
      components: (a) Resourcefulness Training for parent caregivers, and (b) daily mindfulness
      meditation delivered using a smart phone application (Stop, Breathe &amp; Think™) with an
      intervention (Mind Only) that consists only of daily mindfulness meditation. Both components
      of the intervention have been tested separately (but not combined) and both interventions can
      be self-tailored, which meets the vital need for these caregivers to engage in
      self-management activities when it is convenient for them. The investigators will test the
      two arms of the intervention in 30 parents of technology-dependent children, 15 parents in
      each group. The investigators will collect mixed data at baseline, 3 months and 6 months
      after subject enrollment to describe changes in proximal and distal outcomes. The
      investigators aim to:

        1. Evaluate the intermediate (3 month) and long-term (6 month) effects of the ReMind and
           Mind Only interventions on study mediators (HPA Axis Function and stress, cognitive
           factors, resourcefulness) and determine if there are different effects between ReMind
           and Mind Only interventions.

        2. Evaluate the differences in distal psychological (Mental Health Related Quality of Life,
           Depressive Cognitions, Depressive Symptoms, Anxiety, Caregiver Burden), physical
           (Physical Health Related Quality of Life), and cost outcomes between subjects in the
           ReMind and Mind Only arms over time.

        3. Determine the moderating effects of parents' social support, demographics (age, gender,
           family income) and children's functional status on (a) proximal outcomes and the
           relationship between (a) the intervention arm and distal outcomes, and (b) HPA Axis
           Function, stress, cognitive factors and distal outcomes.

        4. Evaluate the impact of decentering on the association between the interventions and the
           proximal and distal outcomes.

        5. Explore differences in neurological processing (DMN and TPN) and decentering in proximal
           and distal outcomes associated with each intervention.

      Design Overview. The investigators will conduct a two-arm Randomized Clinical Trial to
      compare the effects of the ReMind with the Mind interventions on psychological and physical
      health outcomes and cognitive task switching between the DMN and TPN neural networks in
      Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) and Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI). The full
      ReMind intervention involves daily self-tailored mindful meditation application focused on
      kindness and compassion for 4 weeks with self-selected frequency of use thereafter. The
      application that is being used is theoretically constructed and tested and can be delivered
      on a smart phone app for free (iPad, computer as well). ReMind also includes five
      resourcefulness training aspects: 1) one face-to-face session for teaching social
      (help-seeking) and personal (self-help) resourcefulness skills, 2) ongoing web access to
      video vignettes of parents of technology-dependent children describing the application of
      resourcefulness skills in daily life, 3) 4 weeks of skills' reinforcement using daily journal
      writing by the parents, 4) weekly phone calls from the intervention nurse over 4 weeks after
      face-to-face intervention training. The Mind Only intervention includes only the meditation
      component. Thus, the investigators will be able to see if the addition of Resourcefulness
      Training will significantly impact proximal outcomes (self management behaviors) such as
      appraised sleep quality, positive health practices and distal outcomes such as psychological
      health (Mental Health Related Quality of Life, depressive cognitions, anxiety, caregiver
      burden), physical health (Physical Health Related Quality of Life), and economic costs.

      Sample. A purposive sample of 30 parent caregivers of technology-dependent children (n=15
      ReMind, n=15 Mind Only) seen at outpatient clinics (Pulmonology, Gastroenterology,
      Trach/Vent). The investigators have used this patient population in prior work. Given the
      availability of potential subjects and the investigator's experience with this population,
      the investigators anticipate little difficulty in recruiting 30 subjects.
