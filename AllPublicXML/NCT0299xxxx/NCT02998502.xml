    <textblock>
      The Freespira Breathing System (FBS; www.freespira.com) developed by Palo Alto Health
      Sciences, Inc, is a portable home device , and has been employed in breathing biofeedback in
      adults with panic disorder (PD). The FBS has now received FDA clearance for the treatment of
      PD adults and is currently commercially available and more than 150 therapist have provided
      the service nationally. However, FBS has not yet been tested for efficacy in a pediatric
      populations. Due to its portability, FBS may pose an advantage for use in younger age groups,
      compared to multiple therapy sessions required for cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) or
      lower acceptability for long-term medication use for adolescent PD.

      In this pilot intervention study, the efficacy of the FBS system in youth will be tested. In
      children adolescents, PD itself is less common than in adults, but when present, PD is
      commonly associated with and/or preceded by other anxiety conditions, including generalized
      anxiety disorder (GAD), social phobia (SoP) and separation anxiety (SAD). Thus, in children
      and adolescents, the breathing biofeedback intervention for panic, should include other
      anxiety disorders.

    <description>Clinician's Global Impression (CGI) scale is a three item observer rated scale that measures illness severity, global improvement or change, and therapeutic response. It is rated on a seven point scale with the severity of illness scale using a range of responses from one (normal) to seven (around the most severely ill patients). Each component of the CGI is rated separately; the instrument does not yield a global score.
This will serve as the measure of overall improvement in the patients symptoms because of the FBS treatment.</description>

    <time_frame>Visit 1</time_frame>
    <description>Child Yale Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale is a measure of obsessive compulsion disorder symptoms. This scale is designed to rate the severity of obsessive and compulsive symptoms in children from 6-17 years. In general the ratings depend on the child's and parents report; however the final rating is based on the clinical judgement of the interviewer. The characteristics of each item over the prior week up until; and including, the time of the interview are rated. The child's symptoms are scored using the compulsions checklist and the obsessions checklist as guides. All 19 items are rated but only items 1-10 are used to determine the final score. The total score is the sum of items 1-10; the obsession and compulsion subtotals are the sums of items 1-5 and 6-10, respectively. This will be measured through out the study to see the effectiveness of the treatment.</description>

    <description>The CSDS was designed to measure the extent to which the child's anxiety symptoms were interfering with daily functioning. The CSDS is an adaptation of the Sheehan Disability Scale and consisted of items inquiring about the degree to which the child's anxiety symptoms interfere with school, social, and family functioning. As on the SDS, items are measured on an 11-point Likert-type scale ranging from 0 (not at all) to 10 (very, very much) .The wording of the anchors on the SDS was adapted to be more appropriate for children. A parent version (CSDS-P) that included six items was also created. The CSDS-P included three items that assessed the degree to which the parents perceived the child's anxiety symptoms to be interfering with the child's functioning (school, social, family) as well as three items that assessed the degree to which the child's symptoms were viewed as interfering with the parent's functioning (work, social, family).</description>
