  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Damage to teeth from decay or previous old silver fillings can be repaired with
      tooth-coloured filling materials that stick to the tooth. These materials have been around
      for some years and have become more sophisticated; with greater ease of placement by the
      dentist and better durability for the patient. The fillings are designed to be used in
      combination with a specific glue (adhesive) that is designed to stick to the different parts
      of the tooth to provide a good seal, the outer enamel and the inner dentine.

      This study will examine the performance of a state-of-the-art modern tooth coloured filling
      material (Ceram X) in combination with an existing adhesive (control adhesive) and a new
      adhesive (Prime &amp; Bond Universal) used in two different techniques; both of which are known
      to work but one is easier to apply. This results in three treatment groups.

      At the start of the study, the test material Prime&amp;Bond Universal is CE-marked, as are all
      other medical devices used. Thus, this study is not conducted to meet any regulatory
      requirements. The rationale of this study is the extension of knowledge primarily concerning
      the clinical performance of Prime&amp;Bond Universal in molars.

      Two investigators (to be confirmed) will place a minimum of 25 restorations per group (75
      restorations in total) to assess the performance of the materials in a comparative design.
      The study restorations will be monitored for a period of 18 months (with the option to extend
      the evaluation period to 48 months).

      After placement of restorations under controlled clinical conditions, the primary objective
      of the study is the determination of post-operative sensitivity and pulp vitality, marginal
      adaptation and staining of margins of the restorations. In addition, fracture of material and
      retention, recurrent caries, occlusal contour and wear, approximal anatomical form will be
      determined as well as the failure rate as defined by the ADA.

          -  Patients of either gender and at least 18 years old at the start of the study
             (enrollment), who are seeking treatment at the dental clinic involved, will be invited
             to participate in the study if they are in need of at least one eligible Class II
             posterior restoration in a permanent molar.

        Tooth inclusion criteria:
