    <textblock>
      This observational study introduced an new advanced bleeding control strategy during complex
      liver resection.This newly described &quot;stepwise vascular control&quot; technique was efficacious
      and feasible to control intra-operative bleeding in complex hepatectomy involving second
      hepatic hilum and retro-hepatic inferior vena cava.

    <description>Before liver parenchymal resection, we performed &quot;total hepatic vascular preparation for occlusion&quot; with portal triad (PT), infra-hepatic inferior vena cava (IIVC), and supra-hepatic inferior vena cava (SIVC) preparation in order. Then we performed step-by-step vascular occlusion according to the individual bleeding situation.</description>
