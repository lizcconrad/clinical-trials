  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The tasks of the project are to map the potency and kinetics of the neurologic, autonomic
      peripheral, inflammatory, and behavioral responses to vagal nerve stimulation (VNS) vs. sham
      treatment, at baseline and in response to stressful traumatic scripts related to personal
      traumatic events, as well as a series of other stressors.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this project is to develop the fundamental physiological understanding of
      feedback controlled vagal nerve stimulation (VNS) using positron emission tomography (PET)
      brain imaging and blood biomarker measurement with stress in healthy individuals. Healthy
      human subjects with a history of psychological trauma but without the diagnosis of a
      psychiatric disorder undergo PET imaging of the brain in conjunction with VNS or a sham
      treatment during exposure to neutral scripts and scripts of personal traumatic events. Blood
      is drawn simultaneously for measurement of a variety of stress responsive biomarkers,
      including inflammatory markers and neurohormones. A second PET scan with biomarkers assesses
      the delayed effects of VNS. On two other days subjects undergo exposure to random stressors
      with VNS or sham in conjunction with measurement of stress biomarkers.

    <description>Vasal nerve stimulation (VNS) will be self-administered using the electroCore non-invasive VNS device. The intensity of the stimulus (the current amplitude) will be adjusted by the user, to the maximum tolerable level to ensure VNS without causing excessive pain (typically 10-30 V), the burst frequency to 5 kilohertz (kHz), and the envelope frequency to 25 Hz. These are the standard frequency settings that electroCore has demonstrated to be most effective in capturing the vagus nerve based on evoked potential studies. The duration of delivery will be 2 minutes, one minute into which the high-resolution positron emission tomography (HR-PET) scan will be conducted; following an additional 8 minutes, a second VNS delivery will be administered, after which another scan will be obtained.</description>
