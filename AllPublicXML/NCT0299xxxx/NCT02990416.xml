  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the effectiveness of adding a single four-day treatment of the fusion
      protein A-dmDT390-bisFv(UCHT1) — plus single palliative tumor radiation — with standard of
      care KEYTRUDA (Pembrolizumab) therapy for the treatment of metastatic melanoma. The results
      will be measured by comparing the combined therapy to historical data of KEYTRUDA alone.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this trial is to test the hypothesis that A-dmDT390-bisFv(UCHT1) can act as an
      immunomodulator of late stage metastatic melanoma when combined with palliative radiation (to
      induce the priming of activated T cells with tumor antigens) and Pembrolizumab.

      A-dmDT390-bisFv(UCHT1), an anti-T cell immunotoxin is currently being studied as a treatment
      for cutaneous T cell lymphoma and other CD3+ malignant diseases (NCT00611208 and
      NCT02943642). During the course of this study, data accumulated that A-dmDT390-bisFv(UCHT1)
      could be acting as an immunomodulator. This was based on the observation that four out of six
      partial responses converted to complete responses at times ranging between 6 and 24 months
      following the completion of the 4-day treatment protocol (serum half life ~45 min.) and no
      other treatment took place. Complete response durations were 4-6+ years.

      Checkpoint inhibitors have revolutionized the treatment of certain solid tumors, notably
      melanoma, NSCLC and renal cancer. Yet the overall response rate remains low and the
      mechanisms limiting responses have not been elucidated.

      Based on the findings that checkpoint inhibitors have higher response rates when the tumor
      neoantigen burden is higher (over 1 mutation per megabase, Shumacher &amp; Schreiber, 2015) the
      investigators propose to increase the neoantigen burden by combining two distinct
      manipulations:

        1. Treatment with an anti-CD3 fusion protein Resimmune days 1-4 to induce a 20-fold
           increase in CD8+ central memory T cells and

        2. Treatment with anti-PD1 day 16 and q. 3 weeks to block PD-1/PD-L1 negative regulation on
           the newly activated T cells (Blake et al., 2015) and to block high levels of PD-1 in the
           tumor microenvironment (Ahmadzadeh et al., 2009).

      Palliative tumor radiation day 5 will provide the tumor antigen release needed to convert the
      expanded central memory T cells to effector memory T cells.

      The study will be a single-arm, uncontrolled phase I/II trial to estimate the safely of the
      combined treatment and then estimate the efficacy in terms of RECIST 1.1 in patients with
      stage Stage IV metastatic melanoma. The primary endpoint is the clinical response as defined
      by progression-free survival (PFS). The second end point will be tolerability to treatment.
      Secondary end points to be considered are overall survival (OS).

      The study is conducted in 2 phases. In phase I (safety), the investigators will enroll 6
      patients. In first stage, 25 total patients will be enrolled. Using Simon's two stage minimax
      design for phase II trials, the investigators plan to enroll a maximum of 63 patients.

          -  Patients must have:

               -  bilirubin &lt; 1.5 mg/dL,

               -  transaminases &lt; 2.5 X ULN,

               -  albumin &gt; 3 gm/dL,

               -  creatinine &lt; 2.0 mg/dL,

               -  adequate pulmonary function by physical exam and pulse oximetry and adequate
                  cardiac reserve (EF &gt; 50% normal).

          -  Patients must have a normal echocardiogram without any evidence of cardiac chamber
             hypertrophy, dilatation or hypokinesis. The Sponsor must be provided with copies of
             these tests before Sponsor will approve enrollment. In addition, the sponsor must
             receive a list of current medications taken by the patient before Sponsor will approve
             enrollment.

          -  Patients must give written informed consent prior to registration (see Informed
             Consent).

          -  Females and males must be willing to use an approved form of birth control while on
             this study and for 2 weeks after completion.

          -  Patients of ages 18-80 are eligible provided they have stage IV melanoma and are
             negative for BRAF or have failed BRAF inhibitor treatment or if they have failed or
             are intolerant to other established therapy known to provide clinical benefit for
             their condition or if they have been adequately consented and agreed to forgo FDA
             approved clinically meaningful therapy.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Failure to meet any of the criteria set forth in Inclusion Criteria.

          -  Inability to give informed consent because of psychiatric problems, or complicated
             medical problems.

          -  Serious concurrent medical problems, uncontrolled infections, or disseminated
             intravascular coagulopathy (DIC).

          -  Preexisting cardiovascular disease, the only exception being well controlled essential
             hypertension with a sitting B.P. of &lt;155 systolic and &lt;90 diastolic without any
             evidence of structural heart disease or one episode of myocardial infarction &gt; 8
             months ago. A past history of the any of the following are exclusions:

               -  Congestive heart failure,

               -  Atrial fibrillation,

               -  Pulmonary hypertension,

               -  Anticoagulant drug therapy,

               -  Thromboembolic events,

               -  Cardiomyopathy or a myocardial infarction within the past 8 months. Referring
                  physicians will be asked to verify that their referred patients do not have these
                  exclusionary histories listed in 3.2 and a copy of this verification must be sent
                  to the Sponsor before the Sponsor will approve of enrollment. Because
                  beta-blockers have been associated with adverse events during anaphylactic
                  reactions and because such reactions can occur with IV infusions of proteins such
                  as the study drug, the sponsor requires that patients receiving beta-blockers for
                  hypertension be converted to another anti-hypertensive reagent 2-3 weeks prior to
                  receiving the study drug. Angiotensin inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers
                  and calcium channel blockers are all acceptable.

          -  Pregnant or nursing women will be excluded from study.

          -  History of congestive heart failure.

          -  History of cirrhosis of the liver.

          -  Prior treatment with alemtuzumab (Campath) or similar agents or procedures that
             depress blood T cell counts to below 50% of the lower limit of normal.
