  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall goal of the proposed study is to compare the effects of 4 weeks of moderate or
      high intensity aerobic exercise on neuroplasticity, cognitive performance and gait and
      postural control in sedentary healthy adults.

  <detailed_description>

      The primary aim of the study is to compare the effects of a moderate intensity aerobic
      exercise intervention (delivered at 55-64% age-predicted maximal heart rate) with a high
      intensity aerobic exercise intervention (delivered at 65%-90% age-predicted maximal heart
      rate) on measures that probe cortical synaptic plasticity using transcranial magnetic
      stimulation (TMS) in sedentary healthy adults.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Adult males and females aged 18-60 years old

          -  Primary language is English

          -  Sedentary (defined as not engaging in purposeful physical activity more than 2 times
             over the last two months)

          -  Exercise clearance

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Presence of cognitive, neurologic or orthopedic conditions that could affect
             performance of the testing and training procedures

          -  History of migraines.

          -  History of fainting spells of unknown or undetermined etiology that might constitute
             seizures

          -  History of seizures, diagnosis of epilepsy, history of abnormal (epileptiform) EEG or
             family history of treatment resistant epilepsy

          -  Any current history of a psychiatric illness

          -  Any unstable medical condition

          -  No medication is an absolute exclusion from TMS. Medications will be reviewed by the
             Principal Investigator and a decision about inclusion will be made based on the
             following:

               -  The subject's past medical history, drug dose, history of recent medication
                  changes or duration of treatment, and combination with other CNS active drugs.

               -  The published TMS guidelines review medications to be considered with TMS (Rossi,
                  Hallett, Rossini, Pascual-Leone, &amp; Safety of TMS Consensus Group, 2009).

          -  Any metal in the brain, skull or elsewhere unless approved by the responsible MD

          -  Any medical devices (i.e. Cardiac pacemaker, deep brain stimulator, medication
             infusion pump, cochlear implant, vagal nerve stimulator)

          -  Intracranial lesion

          -  Substance abuse or dependence within the past six months Subjects who, in the
             Investigator's opinion, might not be suitable for the study
