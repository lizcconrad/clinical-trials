  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Secondhand smoke (SHS) exposure is a significant public health problem in that it both harms
      children and is widely prevalent, affecting more than 40% of US children. Tobacco cessation
      quitlines are effective in helping smokers quit, but few smokers make use of their services.
      Electronic health record-based systems that automate referral of interested parents to
      quitlines through pediatric settings may increase the proportion of smokers who successfully
      enroll in treatment.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized controlled study of electronic quitline referral compared to standard
      practice. Parent enrollment in the quitline will be reported to the study team by the state
      tobacco quitline, managed by the Pennsylvania Department of Health.

      This is a single site study at one large outpatient pediatric practice. Eligible study
      participants are parents/caregivers (hereafter referred to as &quot;parents&quot;), 18 years of age or
      older, who are present for the child's healthcare (both well-child and acute) visit, who
      smoke, and who are interested in receiving treatment through the tobacco quitline.

      The intervention is electronic referral to the tobacco quitline for parent smokers. The
      referral process will be embedded in a tobacco treatment clinical decision support (CDS)
      tool, created to help pediatricians provide counseling and treatment to parent smokers. The
      primary outcome of interest is smoker enrollment in the quitline, defined as the proportion
      of parent smokers identified in the clinic that enroll in quitline treatment compared across
      the intervention (electronic referral) and control (standard practice) approaches. Secondary
      outcomes include patient and parent demographic and behavioral factors associated with
      successful enrollment.

    <description>The electronic quitline referral will be embedded within the Tobacco Treatment CDS tool, a CDS system previously developed to help pediatricians provide smoking cessation counseling and treatment to parents who smoke, modeled off the CEASE intervention, an evidence-based approach for implementing smoking cessation treatment of parents in the pediatric setting. The parental tobacco treatment CDS tool prompts the pediatric clinician to ask the parent about smoking status and assess interest in quitting (at all well-child and acute visits), links to an electronic nicotine replacement therapy prescription for parents interested in quitting, and guides appropriate documentation. Electronic referral to the quitline will be made by clicking an automated link embedded in the tool that will send the parent smokers' names and telephone numbers (entered by the clinician) directly to the Pennsylvania (PA) Free Quitline.</description>

    <description>All procedures implemented in the standard referral approach will be identical to those in the electronic referral approach with the exception of providing the telephone number for the Quitline to the parent (rather than electronic referral). The clinician workflow will be nearly the same, in that the clinician will use the link embedded in the tobacco treatment CDS tool to add the quitline to the patient's discharge paperwork (rather than automatically refer to the quitline).</description>

    <intervention_name>Quitline Delivered Treatment</intervention_name>
    <description>The PA Free quitline is funded by the Pennsylvania Department of Health and staffed by trained cessation counselors available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. Counseling is available in English and Spanish and can be provided in at least 15 additional languages through a third party. All smokers who enroll in smoking cessation treatment will receive counseling and support consistent with accepted clinical practice guidelines. This treatment includes as many as 5 proactive counseling calls, each designed to help develop problem-solving and coping skills, secure social support, and plan for long-term abstinence. Participants can also call an 800 telephone number as needed for additional support between calls. The timing of counseling calls will be relapse sensitive and include a call 1-2 days after the quit date, another telephone call a week after the first call, and additional calls generally occurring at 2-3-week intervals thereafter.</description>
