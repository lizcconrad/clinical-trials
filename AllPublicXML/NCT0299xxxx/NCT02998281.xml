    <textblock>
      Even if cerebral palsy not directly effect respiratory system, impairment of nervous and
      muscle systems, because of the brain damage, may cause respiratory functions impairment. In
      literature, it has been showed that children with cerebral palsy have decreased respiratory
      muscle strength and associated with trunk control, quality of life and respiratory functions.
      But, there is no study in literature that aims to increase respiratory muscle strength in
      these children. Hence, the aim of this study is to investigate effects of inspiratory muscle
      training on respiratory functions, trunk control, activities of daily living, functional
      exercise capacity and quality of life in children with cerebral palsy.

      A convenience of children with hemiparetic and diplegia CP, 7-14 years, is going to recruited
      from Gazi University, Faculty of Health Science, Department of Physiotherapy and
      Rehabilitation. Patients will randomly allocate to either a treatment group or control group.
      The treatment group will receive inspiratory muscle training at 30-40% of maximal mouth
      pressure, the control group will receive sham inspiratory muscle training at a fixed work
      load, 5% of maximal mouth pressure. Groups are going to train for a total of 30 min/d, 7
      days/week, for 6 weeks. Before and after treatment, every each of patients pulmonary function
      test will be evaluated with using spirometry, respiratory muscle strength using with
      electronic mouth pressure device, trunk control with using trunk control measurement scale,
      activities of daily living using with Pediatric Evaluation of Disability Inventory (PEDI),
      functional exercise capacity usin with six minute walk test (6MWT) and quality of life using
      with Cerebral Palsy Quality of Life Questionnaire (CPQOL).

    <description>this is a simple test used to assess a person's mobility and requires both static and dynamic balance. It uses the time that a person takes to rise from a chair, walk three meters, turn around, walk back to the chair and sit down. During the test, the child is expected to wear their regular footwear and use any mobility aids that they would normally require.</description>

    <description>The treatment group received Inspiratory muscle training (IMT) at 40% of maximal mouth pressure (PImax) by using Threshold IMT and training loads were adjusted to maintain 40% of the PImax weekly. The PImax was measured at supervised sessions each week, and 40% of the measured value was determined as the new training work load.</description>

    <description>Training is going to perform by using a pressure threshold- loading device (Threshold, IMT, USA) used to inhale against a same-pressure load every inhalation for strengthening primarily the diaphragm and rib cage muscles. The device pressure is adjusted according to PImax, and reliability/reproducibility has been demonstrated.</description>
