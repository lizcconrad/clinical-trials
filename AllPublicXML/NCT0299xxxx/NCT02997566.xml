  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: the autism spectrum disorders (ASD) can be related with abnormalities in cortical
      structures and cause behavior imbalances. In addition, as soon as the diagnosis is done, the
      better will be the prognosis. In this context, heart rate variability (HRV) stands out, which
      is a non-invasive tool representing autonomic modulation, with potential prognostic value.
      The literature showed there are no changes in HRV at rest using linear methods of analysis,
      but changes can be identified during tasks. Nonlinear methods of HRV are more sensitive and
      provide additional information to the linear. Objective: to analyze autonomic modulation
      using nonlinear and linear indexes of HRV in children with ASD at rest and during tasks in
      comparison to typical children. In addition, to correlate HRV analysis between them, also
      between behavior and severity of the disease. Methods: this study involves both typical
      children and children with ASD. Autonomic modulation will be performed using nonlinear
      indices (extracted from Poincaré plot, detrended fluctuation of tendency analysis and
      recurrence plot) and linear indices of HRV in the time (RMSSD e SDNN) and frequency domain
      (LF, HF, VLF). The tasks consist in games to identify and recognize faces and facial
      expressions. Behavior and severity of the disease will be evaluated using the Autism Behavior
      Checklist and the Childhood Autism Rating Scale respectively. Statistical Analysis: to
      identify differences between moments and protocols two-way analysis of variance will be used
      along with the Bonferroni post-test or Dunn post-test according to the data distribution.
      Statistical significance will be set at 5%.
