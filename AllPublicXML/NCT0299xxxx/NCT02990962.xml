  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) is the most common peripheral entrapment neuropathy with
      involving compression of the median nerve in the carpal tunnel. Rather than other progressive
      disease, CTS is characterized by remission and recurrence. Although many conservative
      managements of CTS, the effectiveness of these methods is insignificant or only persist for a
      short duration including steroid injection. Recently, the ultrasound-guided perineural
      injection with 5% dextrose was widely used for entrapment neuropathy with positive benefit.
      The investigators design a randomized, double-blind, controlled trail to assess the effect of
      ultrasound-guided perineural injection with 5% dextrose in patients with CTS and compared
      with steroid injection.

    <textblock>
      After obtaining written informed consent, patients of clinically diagnosed with CTS were
      randomized into intervention and control group. Participants in intervention group received
      one-session ultrasound-guided perineural injection with 5% dextrose and control group
      received one-session ultrasound-guided perineural injection with steroid. No additional
      treatment after injection through the study period. The primary outcome is visual analog
      scale (VAS) and secondary outcomes include Boston Carpal Tunnel Syndrome Questionnaire
      (BCTQ), cross-sectional area (CSA) of the median nerve, sensory nerve conduction velocity of
      the median nerve, and finger pinch strength. The evaluation was performed pretreatment as
      well as on the 2nd week, 1st, 2nd, 3rd and 6 month after the treatment.
