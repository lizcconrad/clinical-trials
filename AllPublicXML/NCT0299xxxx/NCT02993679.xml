      The objective of this randomised cohort study was to evaluate the knee rotational stability
      after the single-bundle ACL reconstruction (SB) with addition of the ALL reconstruction and
      to compare it with the double-bundle ACL reconstruction technique (DB) and to analyse when
      the ALL is necessary to reconstruct.

      Background Rotational instability after the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury and
      subsequent reconstruction may be caused by the rupture of the anterolateral structures of the
      knee, specifically the anterolateral ligament (ALL).

      There are more techniques to improve the rotational stability of the knee. The objective of
      this randomised cohort study was: (1) To evaluate the knee rotational stability after the
      single-bundle ACL reconstruction (SB) with addition of the ALL reconstruction and to compare
      it with the double-bundle ACL reconstruction technique (DB). (2) To analyse when the ALL is
      necessary to reconstruct.

      Methods 60 patients underwent the ACL reconstruction with the average age of 29.5 years. In
      thirty patient's knees the ACL was replaced with quadriceps muscle graft using the SB
      technique in combination with the ALL reconstruction by the gracilis graft (ALL group). With
      another thirty patients the ACL was reconstructed performing DB technique with the use of
      hamstring tendons (DB group). The rotational stability was studied before and after the
      reconstruction of the ACL in time &quot;zero&quot; using the computer navigation system. In the ALL
      group, the rotational stability was also analysed after the ALL reconstruction.
