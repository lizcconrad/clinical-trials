  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the role the balloon mucosal impedance may have in diagnosing and
      monitoring the patients with Eosinophilic Esophagitis. We will compare the results of the
      balloon mucosal impedance in patients with Eosinophilic esophagitis and controls.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The standard diagnostic evaluation for EoE includes upper endoscopy with esophageal biopsies.
      Recently we completed the study &quot;Mucosal impedance in eosinophilic esophagitis and the effect
      of treatment&quot; using a new technology allowing for direct assessment of mucosal impedance at
      the time of routine upper endoscopy to assess esophageal integrity and disease activity and
      alevate the need for biopsies.

      For this study, Sandhill Scientific has customized a Mucosal Impedance balloon (MI) assembly
      to provide precise measurements over a broad area of esophageal epithelium, while eliminating
      the fluids and spanning across a 10 mm luminal area using the same direct assessment as the
      mucosal impedance at the time of routine upper endoscopy.

    <description>Patient with eosinophilic esophagitis have diminished mucosal impedance, reflecting increased permeability to allergens occurring in the esophagus. The impedance measurements are also variable throughout the esophageal mucosa reflecting the patchy histology of eosinophilic esophagitis.</description>

    <description>At the conclusion of the endoscopy, all fluids will be aspirated from the esophagus. The endoscope will then be left in place in the mid-esophagus and a custom Mucosal Impedance (MI) balloon assembly four axial arrays of 10 sensors (total of 40 sensors) will be positioned along the esophageal mucosal wall under direct visualization to directly measure MI at uniform intervals. Once in place, impedance readings will be recorded for a total of 2 minutes. At this point both the endoscope and impedance catheter will be withdrawn simultaneously.</description>

    <description>During the clinical endoscopy (a standard procedure that allows your doctor to look at the inside of your swallowing tube), the 2 mm catheter (tiny tube), called an Intraluminal Impedance Balloon, will be passed through the channel of the standard endoscope.
o The catheter (tiny tube) will be placed through the endoscope in your esophagus (swallowing tube) for two minutes, readings from the catheter will be recorded.</description>
