    <textblock>
      The outcome of HMA-refractory patients with MDS or AML is dismal with a median survival of 5
      months after failure, representing a significant unmet medical need due to the very limited
      treatment options. In this context, a specific targeting of the leukemic stem cell (LSC)
      seems a promising option to selectively combat the leukemic progenitor cells. In fact, CD123
      is overexpressed in AML and MDS progenitors making it an attractive target for
      immunotherapy-based approaches. JNJ-56022473 is a promising compound that has been engineered
      with regard to this strategy and the current phase II trial has the aim to evaluate the
      overall hematological response rate at 3 months in HMA refractory/relapsed AML and MDS
      patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) comprise a heterogeneous group of hematologic malignancies of
      the pluripotent hematopoietic stem cells characterized by clonal hematopoiesis and
      progressive bone marrow failure. Clinically, patients suffer from fatigue and are at high
      risk of infections or bleeding. Also, MDS patients are endangered by progression to secondary
      acute myeloid leukemia (AML), a disorder of early hematopoietic progenitor cells
      characterised by the clonal expansion of myeloid blasts in the peripheral blood, bone marrow,
      and/or other tissues.

      Up to now, allogeneic transplantation is considered the only curative option for both MDS and
      AML patients. However, as MDS and AML mainly manifest in the 7th and 8th decade of life, only
      a limited number of patients tolerating bone marrow transplantation and are therefore
      eligible for this procedure. In fact, comorbid conditions are common among the elderly such
      as heart disease, renal insufficiency and vascular disease thus influencing the ability to
      withstand exhausting transplantation procedures.

      Hence in recent years, novel therapeutic strategies have been developed and hypomethylating
      agents (HMAs) azacitidine and decitabine have emerged as new therapeutic options. In 2009,
      azacitidine was the first HMA in use having received approval for treatment of MDS and AML
      patients with 20-30% blasts. In 2012, also the sister compound decitabine got approval for
      treatment of AML patients ≥ 65 years of age and in 2015, azacitidine's approval was extended
      to AML patients ≥ 65 years of age that are considered unfit for allogeneic transplantation
      with &gt; 30% blasts.

      However, despite the efficacy and reported activity, only 50% of patients respond to the
      treatment with HMAs and the majority of them do relapse. Also the outcome of HMA- refractory
      patients is dismal with a median survival of 5 months after failure and hence MDS and AML
      patients with HMA failure represent a significant unmet medical need due to the poor
      prognosis and very limited treatment options.

      In this context, a specific targeting of the leukemic stem cell (LSC) seems a promising
      option to selectively combat the leukemic cells. In fact, CD123 (also known as
      interleukin-3-Rα) is expressed in different hematological malignancies, among others in MDS
      and AML. Interestingly, CD123 is expressed by the majority of AML blasts and it is also
      overexpressed by CD34+ CD38- LSCs compared with normal hematopoietic stem cells and other
      normal tissues. These features make CD123 an attractive target for anti-leukemia therapy.
      Recent data suggests that treatment with HMA can induce expression of CD123 on AML tumors
      opening up the potential that HMA failure patients may have even higher expression levels of
      CD123.

      Indeed, JNJ-56022473 is a promising compound that has been engineered with regard to this
      strategy. JNJ-56022473 is a humanized monoclonal antibody that targets the alpha chain of the
      interleukin-3-receptor and is optimized at the Fcγ region for enhanced activation of
      antibody- dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) via natural killer cells.

      Recently, JNJ-56022473 has been evaluated in a phase I study with AML patients at high risk
      for early relapse. There was a clear dose dependency on depletion of peripheral CD123 cell
      populations such as pDC and basophile with complete and sustained depletion seen in pts at
      doses ≥3 mg/kg Given the encouraging results of this phase I trial we now propose a phase II
      trial to evaluate JNJ-56022473 in AML patients as well as in MDS patients that have failed or
      are refractory to HMA- treatment.

      The clinical trial will be accompanied by a translational research program which aims at
      elucidating specific immune responses mediated by JNJ-56022473, in particular by descriptive
      and functional analyses. In this context bone marrow and peripheral blood will be collected
      during the study as well as before and after therapy.

      Constitutive overexpression of the α-subunit of the interleukin-3 receptor i.e. IL-3Rα, is a
      hallmark of the early AML progenitor cell population (i.e. leukemic stem cells) as well as
      leukemic blasts and IL-3Rα is also overexpressed in myelodysplastic syndromes. In fact, CD123
      is unique to the IL-3 receptor and is responsible for the high specificity and low affinity
      binding of IL-3. Upon ligand binding, the α-subunit CD123 associates with the βc-subunit
      (CD131) to form a high-affinity receptor complex initiating an intracellular signaling
      cascade through phosphorylation and activation of at least 3 distinct signal transduction
      pathways: the JAK/STAT-kinase, MAP-kinase-, and PI3-kinase-pathways. Under physiological
      conditions, activation of the IL-3 receptor induces proliferative, anti-apoptotic, and
      differentiating signals.

      JNJ-56022473 (CSL362) is a second generation antibody developed from the murine 7G3 anti-
      CD123 monoclonal antibody (mAb) in a stepwise process of humanization, affinity maturation,
      and Fc engineering. To enhance the cytotoxicity of the first-generation antibody CSL360, the
      proprietary Xencor (Xmab®) technology was applied and two amino acid mutations (S239D and
      I332E) were introduced into the Fc region. These amino acid substitutions led to improved
      binding to CD16 (FcγRIIIa) on natural killer (NK) cells and significantly enhanced the
      ability to induce ADCC.

      The JNJ-56022473 drug product that will be used in this study is produced in a different cell
      line with a different process compared with CSL362, the drug product used in the phase I
      study CSLCT-AML-11-73 described below. Comparability testing of JNJ-56022473 and CSL362 has
      shown the antibodies to behave similarly in biophysical, biochemical, and preclinical
      assessments. The primary structure, charge heterogeneity, size heterogeneity, purity, higher
      order structure, and process impurities were found to be highly similar between CSL362 and
      JNJ56022473. Pharmacodynamic (PD) studies in cynomolgus monkeys showed similar levels of
      biological activity between CSL362 and JNJ-56022473 (ie, basophil and pDC depletion; NK cell
      number and activity). Additionally, the pharmacokinetic (PK) profiles of JNJ-56022473
      following 30 and 100 mg/kg IV dosing of cynomolgus monkeys are highly similar to those of
      CSL362. Following the first weekly intravenous dose, mean Cmax and AUC0-167h of JNJ-56022473
      are 91% and 94% of those observed for CSL362, respectively.

      This is an open-label, single-arm, multicenter, phase II study of JNJ-56022473 in subjects
      suffering from MDS or AML. The trial will involve participating sites from Germany and
      France. Up to a maximum of 43 subjects will be enrolled in the study.

      JNJ-56022473 will be given intravenously to all subjects at a dose of 9 mg/kg once every 14
      days for an initial treatment period of 3 months (6 infusions). Responders will then receive
      up to 20 additional infusions whereas for non-responders the initial treatment will be
      followed by a up to 9 months observation period without further JNJ-56022473 treatment. Thus,
      the individual study duration for a subject will be approx. 1 year. A follow up visit will be
      performed after 3 months after last study drug administration for all patients to track
      pregnancy status according to IB.

      For patients who still benefit from the treatment and are graded as responders after the time
      period defined above, treatment will continue as long as medically indicated. End of study as
      a whole will be 16 months after LPFV (maximum of 26 treatment cycles plus follow up of three
      months). Data obtained after the end of the study (EoS) for patients who still responding
      will be reported under separate cover.
