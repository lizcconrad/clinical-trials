  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to learn if using a Entocort (budesonide) to treat diarrhea will
      be effective and safe for kidney transplant patients, allowing them to continue with MPA
      medication.

    <measure>Complete remission of diarrhea</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 8</time_frame>
    <description>Measured using symptom diary. Complete remission (CR) is defined as a mean of &lt;3 stools/day and a mean of &lt;1 watery stool per day without use of anti-diarrheal drugs.</description>

    <measure>Change in Gastrointestinal Symptom Rating Scale (GSRS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Baseline to Week 8</time_frame>
    <description>GSRS is a 15-item instrument designed to assess the symptoms associated with common GI disorders. The GSRS consists of 5 subscales (reflux, diarrhea, constipation, abdominal pain, and indigestion) producing a mean subscale score ranging from 1 (no discomfort) to 7 (very severe discomfort).</description>

    <time_frame>Change from Baseline to Week 8</time_frame>
    <description>The GIQLI is a 36-item questionnaire to assess the impact of GI disease on daily life. The GIQLI has 5 subscales (GI symptoms, emotional status, physical functions, social functions, and stress of medical treatment), producing a total score of the 36 items. Lower scores represent more dysfunction.</description>
