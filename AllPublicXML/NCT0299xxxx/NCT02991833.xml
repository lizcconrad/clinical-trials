  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this randomized controlled clinical trial, prospective study is to developing a
      new incontinece care product for containing the fecal incontinence and to examine the effect
      of this new product on prevention of perineal dermatitis.

      Urinary and faecal incontinence which affected the large number of people are common and
      embarrassing health problems. Urinary incontinence affects the life quality , and causes to
      isolation and depression. Faecal incontinence can cause to psychosocial problems such as loss
      of self-esteem, progressive isolation, social stigmatisation and reduces the life quality,
      also burden a high cost on the patients and the community . Both urinary and fecal
      incontinence may leads to incontinence-associated dermatitis (IAD), an inflamatory skin
      disease, which is a a clinical evolution of skin damage associated with moisture , as a
      result of chronic or repeated exposure of the skin to urine or fecal matter. In IAD shows as
      redness with or without blistering, erosion, or loss of the skin barrier function IAD which
      causes discomfort and stres for patients , is a serious and common problem in many health
      care setting and impacts patients' well-being. Health care professionals who are working in
      many health institutions struggled to giving the optimal care to keep incontinent patients'
      skin in a healthy condition. When IAD developed, the risk of infection, the length of
      hospitalization, and morbidity increases and those patients are at greater risk of developing
      a pressure ulser.

      The research question was; are there differences in the incidence of IAD in patients with
      fecal incontinence by a new incontinece care versus adult diaper.

    <description>Women patients were observed and evaluated daily during the morning care between 08:00 AM - 8:30 AM for a maximum 7 days. The visual scale contrived by (Fader et al.(2003) which is based on International Contact Dermatit Score, was used for graded the severity of IAD. Scoring is is 0-to 4 and when scoring is increased the severity of the IAD increased. To evaluate skin integrity, the perineal skin of the patients was observed every day by researcher and was recorded to the Perineal Skin Integrity Assesment Form. The number of defecation, stool consistency, and the number of care product (diaper and the novel incontinent care product) was observed daily and was recorded to the Patient Observation Form. The main study outcomes was IAD.We defined IAD having an erithema score of 1 or more, in the skin of buttock, sacrum, thight and groin.</description>

    <description>The novel incontinent care product is dressed and removed removed by opening both sides. In the part surrounding the waist and thights of the novel incontinent care product flexibility is achieved by planting rubber bien. When developing new incontinence care products was taken counselling from a faculty member from Department of Textile Engineering of one University Faculty of Engineering. The insurance policies was prepared for each patients attended to the study (Number: 481360).New care product is put on the experimental group. Perineal care was made to patients twice a day and after each defecation. After each perineal care, the novel incontinent care product was changed.</description>
