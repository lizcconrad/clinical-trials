  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Most of the nation's serious chronic health challenges and causes of death, including
      diabetes, heart disease, cancer, and obesity, are directly linked to sub-optimal diet. Both
      poor diets and associated disease are disproportionately common in the Appalachian counties
      of eastern Kentucky, a region with stark health inequities, including elevated rates of
      obesity, overweight, and premature mortality. The purpose of this study is to evaluate a
      multi-component intervention developed through community-based participatory research methods
      for improving access to healthy foods and enhancing dietary intake in eastern Kentucky. The
      intervention components evaluated in this study consist of: 1) a school-based campaign to
      promote water consumption in middle and high schools and 2) a series of group cooking classes
      for adults.
