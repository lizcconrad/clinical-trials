  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This pragmatic trial will compare two team-based care models for managing hypertension, Best
      Practice Clinic-based Care and Telehealth Care with pharmacist management, in a large care
      system in Minnesota. Clinics in the study are randomized to offer one of the two treatment
      models to participants with uncontrolled hypertension.

      The investigators aim to determine a) whether one model is more effective than the other for
      lowering patient's blood pressure and b) which model patients prefer.

      The objectives of the study are:

      Aim 1: Compare the effects of two evidence-based strategies on lowering blood pressure and
      other outcomes important to patients: best-practice clinic-based care and home-based
      telehealth care.

        -  Hypothesis 1.1: Compared with patients in clinics assigned to clinic-based care,
           patients in clinics assigned to telehealth care will have a 5 mm Hg greater change in
           systolic blood pressure over 12 months of follow-up.

        -  Hypothesis 1.2: Compared with patients in clinics assigned to clinic-based care,
           patients in clinics assigned to telehealth care will report: a) fewer treatment side
           effects; b) better ratings of patient experience of hypertension care; and c) higher
           self-monitoring rates and confidence in self-care.

      Aim 2: Conduct an evaluation of the reach, adoption, implementation, and maintenance of the
      telehealth care and clinic-based care interventions using a mixed-methods approach supported
      by the RE-AIM framework and the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR).
