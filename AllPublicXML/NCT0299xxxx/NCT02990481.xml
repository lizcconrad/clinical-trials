      1. To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and the dose limiting toxicities (DLTs) of
           TRK-950 as single agent

    <textblock>
      This study is a first-in-human study of TRK-950 in patients with advanced solid tumors and is
      primarily designed to determine the dose-limiting toxicities (DLT) and maximum tolerated dose
      (MTD) of TRK-950 administered via intravenous (IV) infusion once weekly for 3 weeks every 28
      days.
