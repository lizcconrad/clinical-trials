      HyPeR is a multi-centre Phase 1 Dose Escalation Study of Guadecitabine (SGI-110) a Second
      Generation Hypo-Methylating Agent in Combination with Pembrolizumab (MK3475) in Patients with
      Refractory Solid Tumours. The investigators will be investigating the safety and toxicity of
      the combination.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase I trial of the combination of the hypo-methylating agent guadecitabine and an
      anti-PD1 antibody (anti- programmed cell death protein 1) pembrolizumab. Patients will
      receive subcutaneous guadecitabine daily on Days 1-4 of each 21-day cycle. Patients will
      receive pembrolizumab intravenously once per 21-day cycle: on Day 8 of Cycle 2 and on Day 1
      of each cycle from Cycle 3 onwards.

      The rational for this design is that this pre-loading with Guadecitabine will sensitise the
      tumour to Pembrolizumab through the re-expression of genes that enhance tumour recognition,
      the increase in density of tumour infiltrating T-cells and stimulation of the adaptive immune
      response.

      In Part A (Dose Escalation) the investigators will investigate escalating doses of
      Guadecitabine in combination with Pembrolizumab. Patients with advanced solid tumours will be
      recruited in cohorts of 3 to 6 patients to investigate the combination of 200 mg of
      pembrolizumab, administered as an intravenous injection, with escalating doses of
      guadecitabine, administered via a subcutaneous injection, once a day for 4 days (Days 1-4).
      Guadecitabine dosing will start at 45mg/m2 but can be decreased to 30mg/m2 in the event of
      toxicities or increased to 60mg/m2 in the absence of toxicities. Once the maximum tolerated
      dose is reached (or under the advice from the Safety Review Committee) patients will be
      enrolled to the dose expansion phase (Part B).

      Part B (Dose Expansion): 20 patients will be recruited to Part B to further explore the
      safety and activity of the combination of guadecitabine and pembrolizumab. This cohort will
      include, but not be limited to patients with: castration resistant prostate cancer (CRPC),
      non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and possibly other solid tumours based on emerging
      anti-tumour activity data from Part A and any other relevant preclinical or clinical
      published data.

      Approximately 30 to 35 patients will be entered into this trial, 6 to 12 patients in Part A
      and 20 patients in Part B.

      The anticipated accrual rate of the dose escalation phase will involve approximately 3
      patients per month across 2 centres. Accrual rates could be higher or lower but this estimate
      takes into consideration that the first patient on an escalation cohort should complete Cycle
      2 Day 15 prior to accrual of further patients in the cohort. Accrual in the expansion phase
      is estimated at 2-4 patients per month across 2 centres. It is expected that the duration of
      recruitment will be 12-24 months.

             8. Agree to the use of archival paraffin embedded tissue (if available) for PD-L1
             (programmed death-ligand 1) analysis 9. Agree to provide a fresh tumour biopsy at
             baseline and on Cycle 2 Day 8 of a tumour lesion not previously irradiated (tumours
             progressing in a prior site of radiation are allowed for PD-L1 characterization, other
             exceptions may be considered after consultation with the Chief Investigator).

             10. Female subjects of childbearing potential should have a negative urine or serum
             pregnancy test within 14 days prior to receiving the first dose of study medication.
             If the urine test is positive or cannot be confirmed as negative, a serum pregnancy
             test will be required.

             11. Female subjects of childbearing potential should be willing to use 2 methods of
             birth control or be surgically sterile, or abstain from heterosexual activity for the
             course of the study through 6 months after the last dose of study medication. Subjects
             of childbearing potential are those who have not been surgically sterilized or have
             not been free from menses for &gt;1 year. Decitabine, a metabolite of Guadecitabine, can
             affect fertility and so oocyte cryopreservation should be discussed with female
             patients.

             12. Male subjects should agree to use an adequate method of contraception starting
             with the first dose of study therapy through 6 months after the last dose of study
             therapy. Decitabine, a metabolite of Guadecitabine, can affect fertility and so
             cryopreservation of sperm should be discussed with male patients.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Radiotherapy (except brief course for palliative reasons), endocrine therapy,
             immunotherapy or chemotherapy during the previous four weeks (six weeks for
             nitrosoureas, Mitomycin-C and 4 weeks for investigational medicinal products) before
             treatment, except for hormonal therapy with luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone
             (LHRH) analogues for medical castration in patients with CRPC, which are permitted.

          2. Patient has a known additional malignancy that is progressing or requires active

             and not requiring steroids for at least 4 weeks prior to start of study treatment.

          4. Ongoing toxic manifestations of previous treatments. Exceptions to this are:

               -  Grade 1 toxicities, which in the opinion of the investigator should not exclude
                  the patient

               -  Alopecia of any grade

          5. Has a diagnosis of immunodeficiency or is receiving systemic steroid therapy or any
             other form of immunosuppressive therapy within 14 days prior to the first dose of

             consultation with the chief Investigator.

          6. Has an active autoimmune disease that has required systemic treatment in past 3 months
             (i.e. with use of disease modifying agents, corticosteroids or immunosuppressive
             drugs). Replacement therapy (e.g., thyroxine, insulin, or physiologic corticosteroid
             replacement therapy for adrenal or pituitary insufficiency, etc.) is not considered a
             form of systemic treatment. Patients with Sjogren's syndrome will not be excluded from
             the study. In addition patients that experienced a Grade 2 or higher immune-related
             AE's on treatment with immunotherapy will be excluded from the study.

          7. Has evidence of interstitial lung disease.

          8. Has a history of (non-infectious) pneumonitis that required steroid treatment or has
             active pneumonitis. Pneumonitis includes acute interstitial pneumonitis, pneumonitis
             and idiopathic pneumonia syndrome.

          9. Active infection, requiring systemic therapy.

         10. Has received a live vaccine within 30 days of planned start of study therapy. Note:
             The killed virus vaccines used for seasonal influenza vaccines for injection are
             allowed; however intranasal influenza vaccines (e.g. FluMist®) are live attenuated
             vaccines and are not allowed.

         11. Major surgery (excluding minor procedures, e.g. placement of vascular access) from
             which the patient has not yet recovered.

                  events, such as heart failure, hypokalaemia, congenital long QT syndrome, family
                  history of long QT syndrome or unexplained sudden death under 40 years of age or
                  any concomitant medication known to prolong the QT interval

               -  Experience of any of the following procedures or conditions in the preceding 6
                  months: coronary artery bypass graft, angioplasty, vascular stent, myocardial
