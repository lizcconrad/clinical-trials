    <textblock>
      This randomized phase IIB trial studies how well tamoxifen or afimoxifene works in treating
      patients with estrogen receptor positive breast cancer. Estrogen can cause the growth of
      breast cancer cells. Hormone therapy using tamoxifen citrate or afimoxifene may fight breast
      cancer by blocking the use of estrogen by the tumor cells.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To demonstrate that 2 mg once daily per breast of 4-hydroxytamoxifen (4-OHT) topical gel
      results in a reduction in the Ki-67 labeling index of ductal breast carcinoma in situ (DCIS)
      lesions that is not inferior to that seen with 20 mg daily oral tamoxifen citrate (TAM) for
      8±2 weeks weeks weeks, when comparing the base-line diagnostic core biopsy to the therapeutic
      surgical excision sample.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To compare post-therapy changes in the oncotype DCIS-score between arms (this is a
      validated reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction [RT-PCR] assay for Ki67, STK15,
      survivin, cyclin B1, MYBL2, PR, GSTM1).

      II. To compare between-group post-therapy changes in immunohistochemistry (IHC) markers:
      CD-68 macrophage marker as a surrogate for response to therapy, p16 and COX-2.

      III. To compare post-therapy changes in breast density, quantitative estimate, between arms.

      IV. To compare post-therapy breast tissue and plasma levels of TAM and its metabolites
      (N-desmethyl tamoxifen [NDT], [E] and [Z] isomers of 4-hydroxytamoxifen [4-OHT],
      N-desmethyl-4-hydroxytamoxifen [endoxifen]).

      V. To compare post-therapy breast tissue and plasma levels of estradiol and progesterone
      between arms (optional).

      VI. To compare the post-therapy fraction of participants demonstrating &quot;no residual DCIS&quot;.

      VII. To compare post-therapy changes in plasma proteins involved in coagulation: factors VIII
      and IX, von Willebrand factor, total protein S between arms.

      VIII. To compare post-therapy changes in plasma markers of systemic estrogenic effect (IGF-1,
      SHBG).

      IX. To compare post-therapy changes in symptoms as captured in the breast cancer prevention
      trial (BCPT) Eight Symptom Scale (BESS) questionnaire and skin reactions to 4-OHT gel.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized into 1 of 2 arms.

      ARM I: Patients apply afimoxifene gel to both breasts and receive placebo orally (PO) daily
      for 8±2 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unexpected toxicity.

      ARM II: Patients apply placebo gel to both breasts and receive tamoxifen citrate orally PO
      daily for 8±2 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unexpected toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 1-2 weeks and 1 month after
      surgery.

          -  Current users of potent inhibitors of tamoxifen metabolism must be able to discontinue
             their use and switch to an alternative medication for the duration of participation,
             under the advice of their physician; if the physician feels that an alternative

             or biologic composition

          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac

             study requirements

             nursing mothers who agree to participate in the study

          -  Men are excluded from this study since DCIS of the breast is exceedingly rare in men,
             and there are no data regarding skin penetration of 4-OHT though male chest wall skin
             (which is thicker and hairier than female chest wall skin)
