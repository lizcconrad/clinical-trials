  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a study to determine if two ultrasound measures (Corrected Flow Time and B-Lines) can
      predict patients at higher risk of readmission within 30 days of hospital discharge for
      decompensated heart failure.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Heart failure (HF) resulting in congestion is the leading cause for admission in persons â‰¥65
      years of age and 20-25% of such patients are readmitted within 30 days of discharge. Efforts
      to treat HF are difficult without a simple method to detect early signs of congestion to
      direct therapy. Ultrasound can detect evidence of congestion by increased cardiac filling
      pressures two weeks prior to other markers of congestion such as weight gain or patient
      symptoms. Corrected flow time (FTc) measured by ultrasound, is an easy to perform vascular
      measure and correlates with cardiac filling pressures. Despite the relationship between FTc
      and filling pressures, this measure has never been studied in HF. The primary aim is to
      determine if FTc can predict patients at risk of readmission within 30 days. As a secondary
      aim, the investigators plan to validate a small study of patients reporting the ability of
      pulmonary ultrasound to predict readmissions. This study demonstrated pulmonary ultrasound
      was 100% sensitive and 68% specific for predicting readmission at 3 months, however this
      investigation was small and validation is needed. It is expected ultrasound will be able to
      accurately and safely predict patients who will be readmitted within 30 days of discharge.
      This proposal is aimed at identifying a noninvasive measure to better assess congestion from
      HF and predict readmissions.

    <description>Daily corrected flow time measures will be obtained during hospitalization. Mean hospitalization time for the study population is 9 days, but will be measured during the duration of their hospitalization. Changes in corrected flow time values will be assessed for associations with 30 day return visits. 30 Day returns will be determined by medical record review as well as follow up phone calls to patients. Corrected Flow Time is a single measure performed serial with the same units of measure.</description>
