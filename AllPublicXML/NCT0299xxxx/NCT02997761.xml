      This phase II trial studies how well ibrutinib and blinatumomab work in treating patients
      with B acute lymphoblastic leukemia that has come back or is not responding to treatment.
      Ibrutinib may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell
      growth. Monoclonal antibodies, such as blinatumomab, may interfere with the ability of cancer
      cells to grow and spread. Giving ibrutinib and blinatumomab may work better in treating
      patients with relapsed or refractory B acute lymphoblastic leukemia.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the efficacy of ibrutinib and blinatumomab in patients with relapsed or
      refractory B acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) as measured by complete response (CR) rate.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To further examine the efficacy and safety of ibrutinib and blinatumomab in patients with
      relapsed or refractory B-ALL as measured by overall response rate (ORR, defined as CR plus CR
      with incomplete count recovery [CRi]), relapse free survival (RFS), overall survival (OS),
      minimal residual disease (MRD) response, proportion of patients bridged to allogeneic
      hematopoietic cell transplant (allo-HCT), and toxicity.
