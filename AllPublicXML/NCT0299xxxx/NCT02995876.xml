  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      When missing tooth structure or teeth are replaced, minimal biologic risk should be involved
      to re-establish function and esthetics. The increased use of the adhesive technique and
      preservation of dental tissues have greatly impacted conservative tooth preparation design.
      The development use of zirconia technology and all-ceramic systems has opened the potential
      for fabrication inlays zirconia bridges with durability and good aesthetics.

      The purpose of this study is to clinically evaluate the placement of inlay bridge made of a
      Y-TZP framework veneered with a pressed ceramic and bonded with a completely adhesive
      approach in the replacement of a single missing tooth.

      This study evaluates the use of inlay bridge made of Zirconia and all ceramic systems with
      three designs in the replacement process of one single tooth (i.e. a missing premolar or
      molar.) The first design is going to be fabricated with CAD/CAM Zirconia and the occlusal
      surface from e-max press.

      The second design is going to be fabricated with CAD/CAM Zirconia and the occlusal surface
      from e-max press and the internal surface coated with glaze layer to improve the adhesion.

      The third design is going to be fabricated with CAD/CAM Zirconia and the occlusal surface
      from e-max press and the internal surface coated with a layer of e-max ceramic press to
      improve the adhesion.
