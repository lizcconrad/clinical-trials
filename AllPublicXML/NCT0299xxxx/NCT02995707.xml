      This is an exploratory experiment, aims to explore the effective and safety of thalidomide in
      the treatment of NTDT to improve the hemoglobin level, improve the quality of life, reduce
      blood transfusion, so as to avoid the adverse reactions caused by transfusion.15~30 patients
      will be enrolled, including type α 5~13 cases, type β 10~17 cases.

      The project is a single arm research of thalidomide in NTDT,patients volunteered to
      participate in this trial and met the following inclusion criteria will be enrolled: age from
      18~65, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status score of 2 or less.
      Subjects should take thalidomide 50mg per day for 12 weeks. During this time, hepatic and
      renal function, hematologic function, electrocardiogram and the adverse reactions were
      closely observed. According to the protocol, the blood routine, peripheral blood reticulocyte
      count, nucleated red blood cell count, hemoglobin electrophoresis and other indicators were
      evaluated in screening-period visit, 4-weeks visit, 8-weeks visit and 12-weeks visit.
