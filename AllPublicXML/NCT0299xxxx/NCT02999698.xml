    <measure>Dermatology Quality of Life Index (DLQI)</measure>
    <time_frame>1 day</time_frame>
    <description>The Dermatology Life Quality Index or DLQI, developed in 1994, was the first dermatology-specific Quality of Life instrument. It is a simple 10-question validated questionnaire that has been used in over 40 different skin conditions in over 80 countries and is available in over 90 languages. Its use has been described in over 1000 publications including many multinational studies. The DLQI is the most frequently used instrument in studies of randomised controlled trials in dermatology.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS)</measure>
    <time_frame>1 day</time_frame>
    <description>Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) was originally developed by Zigmond and Snaith (1983) and is commonly used by doctors to determine the levels of anxiety and depression that a patient is experiencing. The HADS is a fourteen item scale that generates ordinal data. Seven of the items relate to anxiety and seven relate to depression.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Perceived Stress Scale (PSS)</measure>
    <time_frame>1 day</time_frame>
    <description>Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) was originally developed by Cohen (1983) and this scale is a self-report instrument that evaluates the level of stress perceived during the last month. The scale consists of 14 items with a response format of a five-point scale (0 = never, 1 = almost never, 2 = Every now and then, 3 = often, 4 = very often). The score obtained indicates that a higher score corresponds to a higher level of perceived stress.</description>

    <measure>The Holmes and Rahe stress scale</measure>
    <time_frame>1 day</time_frame>
    <description>The Holmes and Rahe stress scale is a list of 43 stressful life events that can contribute to illness.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Psoriasis Area Severity Index (PASI)</measure>
    <time_frame>1 day</time_frame>
    <description>The Psoriasis Area Severity Index (PASI) is an index used to express the severity of psoriasis. It combines the severity (erythema, induration and desquamation) and percentage of affected area.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Static Physician's Global Assessment (sPGA)</measure>
    <time_frame>1 day</time_frame>
    <description>The PGA is a 5 point ordinal rating ranging from &quot;clear&quot; to &quot;very severe psoriasis&quot;.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Hurley's staging system</measure>
    <time_frame>1 day</time_frame>
    <description>Hurley separated patients into three groups based largely on the presence and extent of cicatrization and sinuses. It has been used as a basis for clinical trials in the past and is a useful basis to approach therapy for patients. These three stages are based on Hurley's staging system, which is simple and relies on the subjective extent of the diseased tissue the patient has. Hurley's three stages of hidradenitis suppurativa.</description>

    <measure>Hidradenitis Suppurativa - Physician Global Assessment (HS-PGA)</measure>
    <time_frame>1 day</time_frame>
    <description>The six-point Physician Global Assessment (PGA) ranges from clear to very severe. It is used in clinical trials to measure clinical improvement in inflammatory nodules, abscesses and draining fistulae</description>
