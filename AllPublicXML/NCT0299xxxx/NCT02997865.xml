    <textblock>
      This study evaluates stepped care for depression in patients with heart failure (HF). The
      stepped care intervention includes cognitive behavior therapy (CBT), plus antidepressant
      medication when indicated. Half of the participants will receive stepped care and half will
      receive usual care for depression; all participants will receive heart failure self-care
      education and support. The primary aims are to determine whether stepped care is superior to
      usual care for depression, and whether treating depression improves heart failure self-care
      outcomes.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Depression is associated with poor heart failure self-care. Good self-care practices,
      including following dietary recommendations, taking prescribed medications, monitoring
      symptoms, and regular light exercise have been shown to improve quality of life and survival
      in persons with heart failure.

      Both CBT and antidepressant medications have been used in previous studies to treat major
      depression in patients with heart failure. Participants in the intervention arm in this trial
      will start with CBT. Those who do not improve very much within the first 5-10 weeks of CBT
      may also be given an FDA-approved antidepressant medication.

      Heart failure self-care education and support will be provided after the depression
      intervention. The study will determine whether people with heart failure benefit more from
      self-care education and support after their depression has been treated with a stepped care
      intervention, as compared to usual care for depression as provided by primary care providers.
