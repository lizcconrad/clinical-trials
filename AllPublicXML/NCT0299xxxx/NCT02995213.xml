    <textblock>
      The investigators are proposing a pilot study, the purpose of which is to use accelerometers
      to quantify UE use (1 and two hand use) in people post-stroke from which the investigators
      will develop use-based feedback to improve recovery in the home setting. The objectives of
      this pilot study are to:

      i.) determine the feasibility of using accelerometers to quantify amount of UE use in the
      home setting in individuals chronic post-stroke,

      ii.) quantify and compare the unilateral activity of the weaker (paretic) versus stronger
      (non-paretic) UEs, and

      iii.) assess the effect of a 7 sessions of in-home accelerometer used-based feedback on
      unilateral and bilateral UE use.

      iv.) assess kinematic, kinetic, and EMG data during UE movements unilaterally and bilaterally
      in subjects post-chronic stroke pre and post feedback.
