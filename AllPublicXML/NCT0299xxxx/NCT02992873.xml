  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sudden cardiac death is a major health problem in the western world. In Europe alone nearly
      300 000 patients are affected annually. The majority of victims suffering from an
      Out-of-Hospital Cardiac Arrest (OHCA have an initial cardiac rhythm that can be treated by
      means of defibrillation. In most emergency medical systems (EMS) time to defibrillation is
      too long and survival averages 10 %.However, when laymen operated Automated External
      Defibrillators (AEDs) are used within the first minutes, 7 out of 10 may survive.

      The aim of &quot;The Scandinavian AED and Mobile Bystander Activation&quot; (SAMBA) trial is to
      evaluate if a Mobile Phone Positioning system and a smartphone application will increase the
      proportions of patients with an attached Automated External Defibrillator (AED) before
      arrival of the Emergence Medical System (EMS). Mobile phone technology and a smartphone
      application will be used identify and recruit nearby CPR-trained lay people and automated
      external defibrillators (AEDs) to patients suffering out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA).
      The system is currently running in Stockholm Sweden and in the Gothenburg region.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Early defibrillation in out-of-hospital cardiac arrest is associated with high survival
      rates. If the operator at the dispatch center suspects an out-of-hospital cardiac arrest he
      or she will activate the mobile positioning system (MPS) wich is integrated in the operators
      computer environment.

      After activation, the system will locate all CPR-trained volunteers nearby the suspected
      OHCA. By computer based 1:1 randomization lay volunteers will be alerted and dispatched in 50
      % of all suspected OHCAs in where the system is triggered by the dispatchers. In the
      intervention group, the activation of the system is supposed to result in lay volunteers to
      be alerted and directed to fetch the nearest AED and commence early defibrillation. Dependent
      on geographical and logistical circumstances, at a minimum one lay volunteer or more will be
      alerted to provide bystander CPR only.

      In the control group the MPS will be activated and lay responders will be dispatched to
      suspected OHCA to perform CPR only. In both groups the ordinary EMS services are dispatched
      in a regular fashion.

    <description>All adverse events reported at a prehospital stage will be collected and presented as minor or major events related to lay persons participating as mobile phone dispatched rescuers events related to patients. Minor events are negative safety events with the potential to harm the lay rescuer or patient such as technical malfunction or dispatcher related communication failure. Major events are negative events that actually harms the lay rescuer or OHCA patient due to system malfunction, such as unsafe scene or violation of integrity.</description>
