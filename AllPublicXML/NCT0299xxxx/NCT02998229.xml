        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject has provided written informed consent using the IRB/EC-approved consent form
             and agrees to comply with protocol requirements.

          -  Subject is at least 22 years old at the time of consent.

          -  Subject has a ruptured or unruptured, wide neck, bifurcating saccular intracranial
             aneurysm (IA) requiring endovascular treatment.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject has more than one aneurysm requiring treatment.

          -  Subject underwent treatment of another aneurysm inside the affected territory of the
             target aneurysm.

          -  Aneurysm is partially thrombosed.

          -  Aneurysm has been previously treated with surgery or endovascular therapy, or there is
             a stent or other obstruction in the parent artery at the target aneurysm location.

          -  Subject has had subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) from non target aneurysm or any other
             intracranial hemorrhage within 90 days prior to study procedure.

          -  Subject vessel has characteristics that preclude safe endovascular access.

          -  Subject has active vasospasm, malignant brain tumor or vascular malformation (e.g.
             arteriovascular malformation).

          -  Subject has had major surgery including endovascular procedures within the past 30
             days prior to study procedure.

          -  Subject has a life expectancy of &lt; 12 months.

          -  The Investigator determines that the health of the subject or the validity of the
             study outcomes (e.g., high risk of neurologic events, conditions that may increase the
             chance of stroke) may be compromised by the subject's enrollment.

          -  Subject is pregnant or wishes to become pregnant during the length of study
             participation.

          -  Subject is participating in another clinical trial at any time during the duration of
             the study that could confound the treatment or outcomes of this investigation.
             Co-enrollment in concurrent trials is only allowed when documented pre-approval is
             obtained from Medtronic.
