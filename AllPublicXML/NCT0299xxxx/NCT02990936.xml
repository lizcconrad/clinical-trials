  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the impact of tumor growth velocity on the survival
      of patients with oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma treated by (chemo-)radiotherapy.

      Patients with stages I to IV oropharyngeal primary squamous cell carcinoma (OPSCC) elected
      for radiotherapy or radiochemotherapy with curative intent will be selected. Tumor volume and
      number and size of pathological neck lymph nodes (small diameter &gt; 1 cm) will be assessed on
      diagnostic CT-scan (DiCT) and treatment planning CT-scan (RtCT) using the summation of areas
      technique. Tumor progression and tumor doubling time will be calculated based on DiCT and
      RtCT. Tumor proliferation will be assessed on biopsy specimens by Ki67 immunohistochemistry
      and mitotic index. HPV status will be evaluated by PCR and p16 immunohistochemistry.
      Ulcerative or exophytic aspect will be noticed. Tumoral kinetics patterns will be correlated
      with disease free survival and overall survival of patients with OPSCC. These patterns will
      be compared to HPV status and proliferation markers in order to study their clinical
      signification [time frame: 5 years] and develop predictive markers of tumor progression for
      head and neck cancers.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) represents more than 90 percent of head and
      neck tumors and is one of the most frequent human neoplasms. During the last decades,
      radiotherapy has emerged as a standard treatment of HNSCC and the number of patients treated
      with this modality has continuously increased. Moreover, treatment schedules for radiotherapy
      have improved and require more preparation and are therefore more time consuming. Thus,
      waiting time prior to radiotherapy becomes a major concern in many countries with reported
      delays of 70 days or even more.Clinicians involved in treating HNSCC face the problem of
      rapidly growing tumors but despite significant progress in the understanding of these tumors,
      their development and progression remain currently unpredictible at the time of diagnosis. In
      a retrospective trial, Laccourreye et al. studied the time of progression of symptoms and
      signs (TPSS) before diagnosis and treatment in 966 HNSCC cases and showed that for a given
      tumor stage, the longer was the TPSS, the better were the vital prognosis, the local and
      lymph node control. But there is no clear definition of fast growing tumor, with objective
      measurement.

      Oropharynx squamous cell carcinomas (OPSCC), the most frequent HNSCC localization, are mainly
      treated by radiotherapy and mostly present at advanced stage. A CT-scan is perfomed at the
      time of diagnosis. Several weeks later, a second CT-scan is necessary for treatment planning
      in order to define the tumoral target volume. This necessity provides the opportunity to
      compare tumoral volumes on both exams, and thus to assess tumoral progression. In a pilot
      study conducted with Institut Gustave Roussy, the investigators studied retrospectively the
      tumor and loco-regional progression in the waiting time between diagnostic and treatment
      planning CT-scans in a cohort of patients with oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma, treated
      by radio(chemo)therapy between April 2005 and April 2007. The study demonstrated that 53% of
      the patients presented a tumoral progression of &gt; 50% within a mean waiting time of 42.1 +/-
      15.7 days. The investigators consider this situation as regrettable, and prospective trials
      are clearly needed to determine clinical consequences of these findings.

      The current project aims to study prospectively the loco-regional tumoral progression within
      the waiting time between diagnostic and treatment planning CT-scans in a cohort of patients
      with OPSCC. Patients with oropharyngeal primary squamous cell carcinoma elected for
      radiotherapy or radiochemotherapy with curative intent will be selected. Tumor volume, number
      and size of pathological cervical lymph nodes (small diameter &gt; 1 cm) will be assessed on
      diagnostic CT-scan (DiCT) and treatment planning CT-scan (RtCT) using the summation of areas
      technique (computerized delineation). Tumoral progression and tumor doubling time will be
      calculated based on DiCT and RtCT in order to define different tumoral kinetics patterns.
      Human papillomavirus (HPV) status will be assessed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and p16
      immunohistochemistry. As primary objective, the investigators will study the tumoral kinetics
      patterns with disease free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) in patients with OPSCC in
      order to study their clinical signification [time frame: 5 years]. As secondary objectives,
      the investigators will correlate the tumoral kinetics patterns with HPV status of patients
      with OPSCC, and compare tumoural kinetics to proliferation markers (Ki67, mitotic index) in
      order to develop predictive markers of tumour progression for head and neck cancers. An other
      complementary objective will compare tumor kinetics patterns with endoscopic aspect
      (ulcerative versus exophytic)
