  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The LTFU study will conduct a naturalistic follow up of the well characterized CAN-BIND study
      population of patients every six months and continuing over a five-year period. This will
      provide information on the longitudinal progress in mood, functioning, and quality of life of
      the CAN-BIND sample with a view towards long-term outcome and treatment.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a long-term follow up study of the 'Canadian Biomarker Integration Network in
      Depression' (CAN-BIND) study. The CAN-BIND study examines biological markers of
      antidepressant treatment response. The examined biomarkers included clinical, imaging, and
      genetic components. The Long Term Follow up (LTFU) study will continue to follow the patients
      in this study each six months over a five year period. By doing so, a comprehensive clinical
      outcome data on a well characterized cohort of depressed patients will be obtained.

      The research team will conduct a naturalistic study of CAN-BIND participants and will monitor
      the longitudinal progress in mood, functioning, and quality of life, with a view towards
      advising future treatment options. Each patient completing CAN-BIND will be asked to
      participate in the LTFU study.

    <measure>Change in Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) (Montgomery and Asberg 1979) scores from CAN-BIND baseline</measure>
    <time_frame>Every six months up to Year 5</time_frame>
    <description>Clinical response (equal to or greater than 50% reduction in MADRS scores from CAN-BIND baseline); Relapse is determined if the MADRS score is greater than or equal to 22 or there is suicidal ideation with intent, or suicidal behaviour.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Longitudinal Interval Follow-up Evaluation (LIFE) (Keller et al., 1978)</measure>
    <time_frame>Every six months up to Year 5</time_frame>
    <description>The LIFE is a clinician-rated interview that provides a structure for collecting and coding data on the longitudinal course of psychopathology. It allows for precise dating of onset and offset of symptoms (including sub-syndromal symptoms) and ranks severity on a week by week basis.</description>

    <measure>Quick Inventory Depressive Symptomatology-Self Report (QIDS-SR) (Rush et al., 2003)</measure>
    <time_frame>Every six months up to Year 5</time_frame>
    <description>The QIDS-SR is a 16 item scale used to assess the severity of depressive illness derived from the 30-item Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology (IDS). The scale includes questions on mood, sleep and level of interest, and takes 5-10 minutes to complete.</description>

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Quality of Life Enjoyment and Satisfaction Questionnaire (Q-LES-Q) (Endicott et al., 1993)</measure>
    <time_frame>Every six months up to Year 5</time_frame>
    <description>This 16-item questionnaire contains questions about your general life satisfaction on aspects such as physical health, leisure time and overall sense of well-being. Each item is scored on a 5-point scale (very poor to very good); higher scores indicate greater satisfaction and enjoyment. It takes 5 minutes to complete.</description>

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Sheehan Disability Scale - Visual Analog Scale (SDS-VAS) (Sheehan et al., 1996)</measure>
    <time_frame>Every six months up to Year 5</time_frame>
    <description>The SDS-VAS is a self-rated questionnaire that assesses functional disability and impairment due to psychiatric symptoms. The SDS-VAS consists of three functional impairment items and two items related to productivity losses due to the symptoms and impairment. Impairment is evaluated with the 10-point self-rated social life and family life/home responsibilities subscales of the Sheehan Disability Scale (0, none; 1-3, mild; 4-6, moderate; 7-9, marked; 10, extreme). Significant impairment for each subscale was defined by a rating of 7 or higher.</description>

    <measure>The Dimensional Anhedonia Rating Scale (DARS) (Rizvi et al., 2015)</measure>
    <time_frame>Every six months up to Year 5</time_frame>
    <description>The DARS is a new measure of anhedonia developed to address the limitations of the existing scales. It extends the concept of anhedonia to assess desire, motivation, effort and consummatory pleasure across four domains: pastimes/hobbies, food/drink, social activities and sensory experiences. Individuals are asked to list their own examples within each domain and respond to standardized questions on a Likert scale according to how they are feeling &quot;right now&quot;.</description>

    <measure>World Health Organization Quality of Life Short Version (WHOQOL-BREF) (Orley &amp; Kuyken, 1994)</measure>
    <time_frame>Every six months up to Year 5</time_frame>
    <description>The WHOQOL-BREF is a 26-item self-rated questionnaire that assesses perceived quality of life across four domains. The domains of health assessed include physical health, psychological health, social relationships and environment. Domain scores and global scores can be generated. The questions are related to aspects of the patient's life in the last four weeks.</description>

The nine dimensions are somatization, obsession-compulsion, interpersonal sensitivity, depression, anxiety, hostility, phobic anxiety, paranoid ideation and psychoticism. The number and intensity of symptomatology is given by three indices, the Global Severity Index, Positive Symptom Distress Index and Positive Symptom Total (PST). Each item is ranked on a 5-point scale from 0 (not at all) to 4 (extremely), and rankings represent intensity of distress over the past week.</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
