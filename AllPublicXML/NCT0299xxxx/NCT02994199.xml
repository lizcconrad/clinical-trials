  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the effectiveness of off-the-shelf (OTS) and adapted
      game controllers on quality of game play, enjoyment, and energy expenditure during active
      video gaming in persons with mobility impairments. The controllers to be evaluated include
      off-the-shelf and adapted gaming mats and off-the-shelf and adapted Wii Fit balance boards.

    <textblock>
      Previous studies have shown that individuals with disabilities have lower levels of physical
      activity and fitness and higher levels of obesity compared to their non-disabled peers.
      Research has also shown that engaging this population in physical activity can be extremely
      challenging due to physical impairments associated with their disability, as well as fewer
      opportunities to participate.

      Active video games (AVG), also known as exergames, are a category of video games that require
      much more body motion for successful play than the traditional pushbutton or joystick
      actions. The recent introduction of motion controlled AVGs allow a much greater variety of
      physical activity to be part of play. These games hold promise for promoting higher levels of
      energy expenditure, weight management and fitness. However, many current AVGs are
      inaccessible or offer limited play options for individuals who are unable to stand, have
      balance issues, poor motor control, or cannot use their lower body to perform game
      activities. Making AVGs accessible to people with disabilities offers an innovative approach
      to overcoming various barriers to participation in beneficial physical activity.

      A recent publication by Dr. Rimmer in the Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation journal
      examining the use of AVGs as a means to increase energy expenditure in non-ambulatory young
      adults with disabilities suggested that clinically significant increases in energy
      expenditure could be achieved with AVGs.
