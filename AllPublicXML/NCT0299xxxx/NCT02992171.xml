      Study investigators will develop and pilot-test an oncology nurse-led care management
      intervention to meet the primary palliative care needs of patients with advanced hematologic
      malignancies.

      Aim 1 is a case series to develop and refine the intervention. During this time, we will
      develop initial interventionist training materials, study protocols, and a web-based outcomes
      database; train 2 hematology-oncology nurses; enroll 10 patients with advanced hematologic
      malignancies and their informal caregivers to receive intervention visits; conduct debriefing
      interviews; iteratively refine the intervention based on nurse, oncologist, patient, and
      caregiver feedback; and prepare the protocol for Aim 2. Aim 2 is a pilot study to assess the
      feasibility and acceptability of administering the intervention and assessing outcomes. We
      will recruit 30 patients and their informal caregivers to receive the intervention developed
      in Aim 1 and collect measures of quality of life, symptom burden, anxiety and depressive
      symptoms, caregiver burden, and healthcare utilization at baseline and monthly for up to
      three months. Trial outcomes will include: rates of enrollment, study completion, and outcome
      completion; intervention fidelity; and self-reported measures of study burdensomeness and
      effectiveness among patients, caregivers, and clinicians.

    <description>Feasibility will be assessed through enrollment rates, intervention checklists to track whether the intervention was implemented according to protocol, and outcome assessment rates. We define adequate feasibility a priori as:
&gt; 60% consent-to-approach rate
&gt; 60% enrolled-to-consent rate
&gt; 70% intervention visit completion rate among enrolled participants
&gt; 70% of intervention components completed according to protocol

    <measure>Acceptability</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>We will assess acceptability based on patient, caregiver, and clinician responses to closed-end survey questions. Definitions of adequate acceptability based on these surveys include:
&gt; 80% of patient and caregiver participants would recommend the intervention to other patients with advanced hematologic malignancies and their caregivers.
&gt; 80% of patient and caregiver participants agree or strongly agree that intervention visits have been helpful for (a) improving pain or other symptoms, (b) helping with illness understanding, (c) helping with coping, and (d) helping with planning for the future.
&gt; 80% of oncologist participants disagree or strongly disagree that (a) working with intervention nurses has been burdensome or (b) the intervention has been disruptive to clinic workflow.
&gt; 80% of oncologist and nurse participants agree or strongly agree that the intervention (a) has helped me to take better care of my patients and (b) has improved the quality of care.</description>
