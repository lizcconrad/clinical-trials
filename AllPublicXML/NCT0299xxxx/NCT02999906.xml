  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, randomized (2:1 oral treprostinil: placebo), double-blind,
      placebo-controlled study in subjects with Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension (PAH) who are
      currently receiving background dual therapy (ambrisentan, tadalafil) for at least 30 days at
      randomization for their PAH. Once randomized, subjects will return for 5 study visits up to
      Week 28 during the blinded period. After the Week 28 Visit, eligible subjects will transition
      to the open-label period of the study for up to 20 weeks.

    <measure>Compare the effects of triple therapy versus dual therapy on the time to clinical worsening</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Week 28</time_frame>
    <description>clinical worsening is defined by 1 of the following:
Death (all causes)
Hospitalization due to worsening PAH
Initiation of long-term parenteral therapy
Disease progression
Unsatisfactory long-term clinical response</description>

    <measure>Change in N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) concentrations From Baseline to Week 28</measure>

    <description>The level of this biomarker of the (NT-proBNP) serum concentration will be assessed to compare the severity of heart failure at Baseline and Week 28.</description>

    <measure>Number of Participants with a Change From Baseline World Health Organization (WHO) Functional Classification at Week 28.</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to week 28</time_frame>
    <description>The WHO Functional Class of pulmonary hypertension is a physical activity rating scale as follows: Class I: No limitation of physical activity. Class II: Slight limitation of physical activity. Class III: Marked limitation of physical activity. Class IV: Inability to carry out any physical activity without symptoms.</description>

    <measure>Change in Quality of Life (QoL) Assessment: Cambridge Pulmonary Hypertension Outcome Review (CAMPHOR) From Baseline to Week 28.</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to week 28</time_frame>
    <description>The CAMPHOR is a health related quality of life instrument validated for pulmonary hypertension that assesses impairment (symptoms), disability (activities) and quality of life. The questionnaire is divided into three sections余 Symptoms (Scores 025余 high scores indicate more symptoms), Activity (Score 030余 low score indicates good functioning) and Quality of Life (025余 high scores indicate poor QoL). The sum of these scores equates to the Total score (080). In the CAMPHOR scores, lower scores indicate improvements.</description>
