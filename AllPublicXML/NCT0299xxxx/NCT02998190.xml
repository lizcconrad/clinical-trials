    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the safety profile of single and multiple doses of
      EB8018 in healthy male subjects, to determine the pharmacokinetic profile of single and
      multiple doses of EB8018 in healthy male subjects and to assess preliminary effects of EB8018
      on the healthy male gut microbiome.

    <textblock>
      Crohn's Disease is a chronic inflammatory disease of the gastrointestinal tract. Emerging
      evidence suggests that the microbiome plays an important role in triggering an abnormal
      mucosal immune response in patients with Crohn's Disease. Independent studies have
      demonstrated an imbalance of the microbiome with a significant increase of E coli with
      invasive properties, termed adherent-invasive E coli (AIEC). These AIEC bacteria attach to
      the gut wall of susceptible patients via the fimbrial adhesion protein FimH, and subsequently
      trigger inflammation by invading and proliferating within the gut wall. EB8018 is an oral
      small molecule that is designed to block FimH thereby preventing the entry of AIEC into the
      gut wall thereby disarming the bacteria without disrupting the gut microbiome.
