          -  BMI: 18.0 and 30.0 kg/m2 (inclusive).

          -  Judged by the Investigator to have no serious illness based on medical history,
             physical examination, ECG, vital signs and blood and urine assessments at screening.

          -  From the signing of the informed consent until 2 months after the last vaccination
             (Visit 3 for group 1 to 4 and Visit 2 for group 5 and 6) female subjects have to use
             contraceptive methods with a failure rate of &lt; 1% to prevent pregnancy (combined
             [oestrogen and progestogen containing] hormonal contraception associated with
             inhibition of ovulation [oral, intravaginal, transdermal], progestogen- only hormonal
             contraception associated with inhibition of ovulation [oral, injectable, implantable],
             intrauterine device [IUD], intrauterine hormone-releasing system [IUS], bilateral
             tubal occlusion, sexual abstinence). Any male partner should be willing to use condom
             or should be vasectomized.

          -  Diagnosis of laboratory-confirmed influenza in the 2015/2016 season.

          -  Use of any investigational drug product within 3 months before screening or planned
             use during the study period, including the safety follow-up.

          -  Administration of an influenza vaccine during the 6 months before screening.

          -  Previously received another vaccine within 28 days before administration of the study
             vaccine, or is scheduled to receive another vaccine during the study period, excluding
             the safety follow-up.

          -  Any contra-indication to intramuscular administration of the influenza vaccine
             AdimFlu-S according to its prescribing information.

          -  Any contra-indication to administration of the influenza vaccine Fluenz Tetra
             according to its summary of product characteristics (SmPC).

          -  History of any anaphylactic reaction and/or serious allergic reaction following a
             vaccination, a proven hypersensitivity to any component of the study vaccine (e.g., to
             eggs or egg product as well as ovalbumin, chicken protein, chicken feathers, influenza
             viral protein, kanamycin, gentamycin and neomycin sulphate).

          -  Diagnosis of asthma with poor disease control as assessed by the Investigator.

             medical history and physical examination.

          -  Any progressive or severe neurologic disorder, seizure disorder or Guillain-Barré
             syndrome.

          -  History of Guillain-Barré syndrome within 6 weeks of receipt of prior inactivated
             influenza virus vaccine.

          -  Received blood, blood products and/or plasma derivatives or any administration of

          -  Participation in blood donation within 3 months or plasma donation within 1 month
             prior to Visit 2.

          -  History of substance or alcohol abuse within the past 2 years.

          -  History or any illness/condition that, in the opinion of the Investigator, might

          -  Pregnant or lactating female or intent to become pregnant during the clinic phase (up
             until and including Visit 4 for group 1 to 4 and Visit 3 for group 5 and 6) and for 2
