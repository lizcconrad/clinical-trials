    <textblock>
      Premature babies, born several weeks before their due date, are often very ill in the first
      weeks and months of life, compared with those born at full term. Because babies' brains and
      bodies are still developing at this time, early birth puts them at increased risk of later
      problems with health and development. It is important to do everything possible to try to
      improve the overall health of these children. Not only will this help children and families,
      but it will also help to understand the correct amount and type of care they will need from
      the NHS in the future. At present, England has three types of neonatal units: Neonatal
      Intensive care units (NICUs) that can care for the most sick and most premature babies, Local
      Neonatal Units (LNUs) that generally care for slightly less sick babies, and Special Care
      baby units (SCBU) that care for larger premature babies who are generally well, but need time
      to grow and develop before going home.

      For those premature babies born between 27 and 31 weeks of pregnancy, there is no information
      on whether they benefit from being looked after in one type of unit or another. At present
      there is no guidance, so these babies may be looked after in either LNUs or NICUs. Babies who
      are born at this stage of pregnancy cannot be looked after in a SCBU and sometimes need to be
      moved after birth to either a NICU or LNU. There are 84 LNUs and 45 NICUs in England. In
      2014, about half of these babies were cared for in a NICU and half in a LNU. There is the
      need to know whether babies born between 27 and 31 weeks are best cared for in a NICU or LNU
      or if it does not matter.

      The main things that control where a baby is born are where the mother has her antenatal
      care, and where there is a cot available for the baby. A mother may have antenatal care in a
      hospital that has a NICU, LNU or SCBU. Because it is difficult to predict which mother is
      going to have her baby early, she cannot be directed, at the time of her choosing her
      hospital for antenatal care, where to go to for care. There is uncertainty before birth which
      baby is likely to require intensive care, but usually the less mature babies need more
      intensive care.

      In this study to find out where it is best to care for babies born at 27-31 weeks of
      pregnancy, the study will look at which type of unit: a) leads to the best outcome for babies
      born at each week of pregnancy in this range; b) is most cost-effective for families and the
      NHS and c) best considers views and needs of parents and staff caring for babies.

      Mixed methods, longitudinal study; 5 work streams, supported by a Parent Advisory Panel:

      Work stream 1:Clinical Outcomes Study Using routinely collected data from the National
      Neonatal Research Database (NNRD) for babies born at 27-31 weeks of gestation, admitted to
      neonatal units in England 01/01/14-31/12/17.Estimates of differences in mortality and
      specified morbidities between babies cared for in LNUs and NICUs will be obtained Data will
      be linked to Hospital Episode Statistics (morbidity) and ONS(mortality) up to 1 year of age
      for longer term outcomes.

      Work stream 2:Types of clinical care provided Using NNRD, data from a unit questionnaire
      (01/01/017-31/12/2017), and review of guidelines from neonatal units, variation in clinical
      practice in 6 areas will be examined: medical/nurse staffing; policies/practice re
      respiratory support; infection control, feeding and developmental care, discharge and length
      of stay. Where appropriate, outcomes (mortality, chronic lung disease, central line sepsis,
      receipt of breastmilk on discharge and length of stay in hospital) by week of gestational
      age, will be analysed between units with similar practices.

      Work stream 3:Economic analysis A cost-effectiveness study comparing costs and outcomes of
      LNU versus NICU will be conducted.

      Work stream 4:Ethnographic study with a representative group of parents and clinicians
      Observations and interviews will be used to explore factors parents think should guide
      decision making about place of care and how it happens in practice; clinicians'
      perspectives/practices on decision making and place of care; impact on parents/families of
      these decisions and subsequent change in care location; and how parents can best be supported
      at this time. 40 cases from 2 networks [20 real-time, 20 retrospective] will be studied.

      Workstream 5:

      Once the results of the 4 work streams are analysed, and conclusions reached, a working group
      will be set up in collaboration with BAPM to develop recommendations to be made available for
      health service delivery planning.
