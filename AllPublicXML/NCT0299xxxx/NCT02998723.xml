  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Attrition of skills after basic life support (BLS) training is common. Psychology studies
      have established that for basic memory recall tasks, spaced learning strategies improve
      retention. Spaced learning is often organized as a refresher or 'booster' course after
      initial training. This study aims to investigate if this principle holds true for BLS skills,
      which require rapid memory recall and efficient deployment of procedural skills while under
      time pressure.

      Novice laypeople who have not received BLS training in the 6 months leading up to the date of
      participation will be recruited from the University of Ottawa and the general public.
      Participants will be randomized into one of three groups: early booster, late booster, or no
      booster (control). Currently, no booster is the educational standard. The early booster group
      will receive a booster at 3 weeks, the late booster at 2 months, and no booster for the
      control. All participants will undergo BLS training, an immediate post-test, and a retention
      post-test at 4 months. Post-tests involve a simulated cardiac arrest scenario. Raters will be
      blinded to the group allocation and simulation test order.
