    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is investigate the immunogenicity and safety of CYD dengue vaccine and
      Tdap vaccine when both vaccines are administered concomitantly or sequentially.

      Primary Objectives:

        -  To demonstrate the non-inferiority of the humoral immune response to the Tdap booster
           dose concomitantly administered with the first dose of CYD dengue vaccine as compared to
           sequential administration, measured 28 days after Tdap booster dose

        -  To demonstrate the non-inferiority of the humoral immune response to the first dose of
           CYD dengue vaccine concomitantly administered with Tdap as compared to sequential
           administration, measured 28 days after the first dose of CYD dengue vaccine.

      Secondary Objectives:

        -  To demonstrate the non-inferiority of the humoral immune response of 3 doses of CYD
           dengue vaccine with the first dose concomitantly administered with Tdap as compared to
           sequential administration, measured 28 days after the third dose of CYD dengue vaccine.

        -  To describe the humoral immune response at baseline and 28 days after the first and
           third doses of CYD dengue vaccine, in each and any group.

        -  To describe the humoral immune response of Tdap vaccine at baseline and 28 days after
           concomitant administration with the first dose of CYD dengue vaccine as compared to the
           sequential administration, in each and any group.

        -  To describe the safety of the CYD dengue vaccine and of the Tdap booster dose after each
           and any injection in each group.

      All participants will receive the CYD dengue vaccine according to a 3-dose schedule to be
      administered 6 months apart, with the first dose of CYD dengue vaccine administered either
      concomitantly or sequentially with a booster dose of the Tdap vaccine, Adacel®.

      They will be assessed for immunogenicity and safety.
