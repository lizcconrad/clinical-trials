  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, non-randomized, single-center, phase Ib/II study, evaluating efficacy
      and feasibility of cytoreductive surgery(CRS), extensive peritoneal lavage, hyperthermic
      intraperitoneal chemotherapy(HIPEC) and post-operative intraperitoneal chemotherapy
      combination in gastric cancer with peritoneal metastasis

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Peritoneal metastases in gastric cancer are considered to indicate terminal disease due to
      poor prognosis because systemic chemotherapy is unlikely to accumulate in peritoneal nodules
      in cytotoxic concentrations. Cytoreductive surgery (CRS) along with hyperthermic
      intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC) has been suggested to improve survival in select
      patients with limited peritoneal spread, resulting in a median overall survival (OS) of 8 to
      14 months. It remains unclear, however, which regimen is best and who have benefits from CRS
      and HIPEC. Herein, we has conducting prospective phase Ib/II trial of CRC and HIPEC with
      intraperitoneal paclitaxel and cisplatin, and oral S-1 in gastric cancer with peritoneal
      metastasis.

Dose-escalation of intraperitoneal paclitaxel will follow a modified 3 + 3 dose escalation procedure.
II
① CRS If PCI &lt;12, CRS will be performed by gastrectomy with D2-lymphadenectomy and resection of any involved adjacent structures.
If PCI≥12, instead of CRS, 3 times of IP paclitaxel +cisplatin and oral S-1 chemotherapy every 3 weeks, and then PCI &lt;12, CRS will be done.
② Extensiveintraperitoneal lavage Peritoneal lavage after CRS will be done with 10 L before HIPEC.
③ HIPEC Following surgery HIPEC will be performed using CDDP (60 mg/m2) and PTX (P2RD mg/m2). IP chemotherapy will be performed.
④ Post-operative intraperitoneal chemotherapy Postoperative chemotherapy will be done 8 cycles of IP paclitaxel+ cisplatin and oral S-1 after 4 weeks.</description>
