  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study intends to evaluate the objectives in patients with advanced or metastatic biliary
      tract cancer who have not received systemic therapy for advanced/metastatic disease.

      Primary Objectives:

      Phase 1B • To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD), as determined by dose-limiting
      toxicities (DLTs), and to characterise the safety profile of Varlitinib in combination with
      Gemcitabine and Cisplatin.

      Phase 2

      • To compare the efficacy of Varlitinib in combination with Gemcitabine and Cisplatin to
      placebo in combination with Gemcitabine and Cisplatin as measured by progression-free
      survival (based on RECIST v1.1).

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In phase 1B part, patients will receive Varlitinib plus Gemcitabine and Cisplatin, and follow
      a modified 3+3+3 study dose escalation scheme starting from Varlitinib 200 mg BID. The
      primary objective of the phase 1B part is to determine the MTD of Varlitinib when given in
      combination with Gemcitabine and Cisplatin, and to characterise the safety profile of the
      study treatment regimen.

      Based on the determined MTD and clinical information obtained from phase 1B part of the
      study, the DSMB will review the safety data and, together with the sponsor, determine the MTD
      as well as the recommended dose for phase 2. The sponsor will make a decision when to proceed
      with the phase 2 part of the study.

      The phase 2 part will be a two-arm, double-blinded, placebo controlled study. Patients will
      be randomised into 2 arms to receive Varlitinib plus Gemcitabine and Cisplatin, or placebo
      plus Gemcitabine and Cisplatin. The primary objective of the phase 2 part is the
      progression-free survival .

      Patient screening activities including informed consent and study eligibility verification
      will be performed within 21 days prior to first dose of the study medication. Radiological
      imaging to assess the disease status will be performed at baseline and every 6 weeks until
      disease progression to evaluate the efficacy of the treatment. Blood samples will be taken
      during the screening phase, every week during the first cycle and then every cycle until end
      of treatment. Patients will be required to complete safety follow-up within 28 days after the
      last administration of study medication.
