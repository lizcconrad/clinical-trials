  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to assess the safety and tolerability of oral OV101 (gaboxadol)
      in adult and adolescent subjects with Angelman syndrome. In addition, several exploratory
      efficacy outcome measures will be investigated.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Two dosing schedules of OV101 (gaboxadol) giving as once daily or twice daily dose will be
      assessed against placebo.
