    <textblock>
      POEM is a new intervention for the treatment of achalasia and has been reported to relieve
      the dysphagia symptom effectively. Although the cost of POEM method is less than the method
      of Laparoscopic Heller Myotomy and Fundoplication, it is still of an economic burden for the
      patients with achalasia. In this trial, investigators plan to use snare to assist POEM
      procedure, to observe the safety, efficacy and cost-effectiveness of this method, compared
      with other knifes-assisted procedure.
