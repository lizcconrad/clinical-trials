  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Emotional instability disorder (IE) is appreciable since adolescence, and crises (suicidal
      ideation, self-harm, impulsive acts and brief psychotic episodes) carry a high use of health
      resources, coupled with the suffering of families who feel helpless and difficulties in
      handling.

      The purpose of the study is to evaluate the effectiveness of a dialectical behavior therapy
      (DBT) for parents of adolescents with IE who are in treatment in the different network
      devices of Child and Adolescent Mental Health of the Community of Madrid. Treatment goals are
      the development of communication skills, validation and crisis management as well as increase
      understanding and competence of the pathology.

      To evaluate the effectiveness of the DBT family group intervention, it is compared with a
      group of non-treatment or &quot;treatment as usual&quot; (outpatient treatment and parents without
      children specific group treatment). The DBT intervention will begin with two individual
      sessions with parents of patients and 10 theoretical and practical seminars in group format
      (6-7 families) following the model proposed by Marsha Linehan. The DBT interventions will be
      added to &quot;standard treatment&quot; that a patient with IE receives in the investigative devices.

      The result of these interventions will be measured after the end of treatment and after 6 and
      12 months after the treatment ends. The variables considered are family communication,
      cognitive skills, emotional and behavioral coping clinical in parents and as indirect
      measures of change in adolescents health resources used as , suicidal gestures, self-harm or
      aggressive behavior.

    <description>Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT) is a cognitive behavioral treatment that was originally developed to treat chronically suicidal individuals diagnosed with borderline personality disorder (BPD) and it is now recognized as the gold standard psychological treatment for this population. In addition, research has shown that it is effective in treating a wide range of other disorders such as substance dependence, depression, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and eating disorders.
