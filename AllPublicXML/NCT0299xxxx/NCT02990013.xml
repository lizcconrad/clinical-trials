      Aim 1: To determine in vivo capability of AvenovaTM against common cutaneous microbial biome
      on human skin

      Aim 2: To compare to povidone-iodine 5% solution, 4% chlorhexidine and isopropyl alcohol
      against AvenovaTM as a sterile skin agent

      A total of 30 eligible participants will be identified with clinically-acquired information
      by Dr. Wendy Lee, an oculoplastic surgeon and aesthetic treatment specialist at Bascom Palmer
      Eye Institute, during regular clinic visits.

      Part One: Patients will have their skin swabbed and then cultured for various skin flora
      agents. The petri dish will then be swabbed with Avenova to see what percent of skin flora
      microbe is killed.

      Part Two: Patients will have their skin divided into 5 quadrants. The area will be
      pre-swabbed to monitor microbe growth. One quadrant will be used as a control. The area will
      be cleansed for one minute with AvenovaTM , povidone-iodine 5% solution, 4% chlorhexidine and
      isopropyl alcohol, each in a different quadrant. The area will be post-swabbed for monitor
      for microbe growth.

      Specific pathogens tested would include staphylococcus epidermides, staphylococcus aureus,
      corynebacterium, candida albicans, herpes simplex virus 1 and 2 and adenovirus. Patients will
      not be told of positive results as these are normal skin flora.

    <description>The skin will be cleansed with the various cleansing agents as listed above. The concentration of staphylococcus epidermides, staphylococcus aureus, corynebacterium, candida albicans, herpes simplex virus 1 and 2 and adenovirus on the skin will be measured before and after the cleansing agent is applied. Perimetric statistics will be used to determine if there are any difference between the agents.</description>
