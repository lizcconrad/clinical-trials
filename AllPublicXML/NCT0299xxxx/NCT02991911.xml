      The purpose of this study is to assess the safety and tolerability, describe the
      dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs), and determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) or maximum
      administered dose (MAD [in the absence of establishing the MTD]) for single agent MEDI3726 in
      subjects with mCRPC who have received prior treatment with abiraterone or enzalutamide, with
      or without a prior taxane-based chemotherapy in the mCRPC setting

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Age ≥ 18 years at the time of screening.

          -  Histologically confirmed diagnosis of metastatic castration-resistant prostate
             adenocarcinoma (mCRPC).

          -  Documented PD in subjects with mCRPC as assessed by the Investigator and defined by at
             least one of the following according to the PCWG3 criteria:

               1. Radiographic progression.

               2. PSA progression.

          -  Prior exposure to abiraterone or enzalutamide of at least 12 weeks in the mCRPC
             setting.

        NOTE: Subjects who have received both abiraterone and enzalutamide in the mCRPC setting are
        eligible.

          -  In dose escalation: Prior taxane-based chemotherapy in the mCRPC setting is:

               1. Required for Arm A.

               2. Excluded for Arm B.

               3. Optional for Arm C.

                  Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects with neuroendocrine, neuroendocrine differentiation and/or small cell
             prostate cancer.

          -  The subject has received any conventional or investigational anti-cancer treatment
             within 21 days before the first dose of investigational product, with the following

               1. At least 14 days before the first dose of investigational product since
                  completion of treatment with abiraterone or enzalutamide

               2. At least 14 days before the first dose of investigational product since
                  completion of prior taxane-based chemotherapy

               3. At least 28 days before the first dose of investigational product since
                  completion of treatment with Radium-223.

               4. At least 42 days before the first dose of investigational product since
                  completion of prior bicalutamide and nilutamide treatment.

        NOTE: An LHRH agonist or antagonist required for ongoing testosterone suppression will be
        permitted if Inclusion Criterion is satisfied.

          -  Prior exposure to PSMA-directed therapies.

          -  Subjects with previous radiotherapy for the treatment of unresectable, locally
             advanced or metastatic prostate cancer are excluded if:

               1. More than 25% of marrow-bearing bone has been irradiated.

               2. The last fraction of radiotherapy has been administered within approximately 2
                  weeks prior to the first dose of investigational product.

          -  Brain metastases that are untreated, symptomatic, or require therapy to control
             symptoms; or any radiation, surgery, or other therapy to control symptoms from brain
             metastases within 2 months prior to the first dose of investigational product.
