  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In England each year over 70,000 people fracture their hip. Most of these patients are
      elderly females with the fracture occurring after a simple trip or stumble. Approximately
      half of these fractures are classified from their relationship to the hip joint capsule as
      intracapsular. These fractures are subdivided into those that are displaced and those that
      are undisplaced. The majority of displaced fractures are treated with a replacement
      arthroplasty. Current treatment for the undisplaced fractures is generally by internal
      fixation of the fracture using screws and a plate, although some centres prefer replacement
      arthroplasty.

      A recent randomised study on patients from Norway with undisplaced intracapsular fractures
      treated with either internal fixation or arthroplasty has just reported reduced complications
      and re-operations for those patients treated with an arthroplasty. In addition functional
      results were marginally better for those patients treated with an arthroplasty. Current
      practice in the UK is generally to treat these fractures by internal fixation. This study
      aims to see if replacement arthroplasty can indeed lead to the advantages suggested from the
      Norwegian study.

      Patients who satisfy the inclusion criteria and are willing to participate will be randomised
      to receive either reduction and internal fixation of the fracture with a screw and plate
      device or alternatively replacement of their femoral head with an artificial hip replacement
      (hemiarthroplasty). After surgery patients will receive the same treatment as normal and be
      discharge home when able, with follow-up review in the hip fracture clinic. Subsequent
      follow-up for the research project is by phone calls from a research nurse who is blinded to
      the type of treatment that the patient has received. There will be no additional
      investigations or out-patient follow-up visits for these patients in comparison to normal
      treatment protocols. Results of the study will ultimately be published in a medical journal.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  All patients admitted to Peterborough and Stamford Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust with
             an undisplaced intracapsular fracture will be considered for inclusion within the
             study. Patients who lack Capacity for example dementia who are unable to provide
             informed consent will be included if the assent of their next of kin or legal guardian
             can be obtained.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  â€¢ patients who decline to participate or in whom consent or assent is not available

               -  patients admitted when MJP is not available to supervise treatment

               -  patients with pathological fractures from Paget's disease of bone secondary's
                  from tumour

               -  patients with delayed presentation who would be treated conservatively

               -  patients considered unfit for either surgical procedure

               -  younger patients, aged less than 80 years who are independently mobile and very
                  active will be excluded at treated by internal fixation (the risk of fracture
                  healing complication for this group is less, whilst there is an increased risk of
                  long term complications after arthroplasty
