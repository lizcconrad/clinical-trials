    <textblock>
      This multicenter, non-randomized, Phase II study will assess the efficacy, safety, and
      pharmacokinetics of trastuzumab emtansine in participants with HER2 overexpressing locally
      advanced (unresectable and not treatable with curative intent) or metastatic urothelial
      bladder cancer (UBC), locally advanced (unresectable and not treatable with curative intent)
      or metastatic pancreatic cancer/cholangiocarcinoma with advanced disease where cure is no
      longer possible and where no other treatment options are available anymore. Participants will
      receive intravenous (IV) infusion of trastuzumab emtansine as Regimen A (2.4 milligrams per
      kilogram [mg/kg], weekly [qw]) or Regimen B (3.6 mg/kg, every 3 weeks [q3w]) until
      unacceptable toxicity, withdrawal of consent, disease progression (PD), or death, whichever
      occurs first. Based on tolerability and safety aspects, steering committee and Independent
      Data Monitoring Committee (iDMC) will decide on expansion of the study to include more
      participants with other carcinoma types.
