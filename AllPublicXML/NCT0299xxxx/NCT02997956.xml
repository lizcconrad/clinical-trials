  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase IB study design planned to identify the MTD (Maximum Tolerated Dose) of
      Tocilizumab in HCC (Hepatocellular Carcinoma) patients followed by a phase II design
      whereupon the primary objective will be median progression free survival (PFS).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      TACE (Transarterial Chemo Embolization) has shown to improve overall survival compared to
      non-treated patients with intermediate HCC (Hepatocellular Carcinoma) tumors. However, TACE
      is not considered a curative strategy and eventual local recurrence is observed in nearly all
      (&gt;95%) of cases. Therefore, significant clinical equipoise exists in this large group of HCC
      patients such that novel therapies can be tested in an adjuvant manner to TACE. Based on
      pre-clinical data in HCC and the increasing identification that IL-6 signaling leads to tumor
      progression or local recurrence in other solid malignancies, significant rationale exists for
      the use of Tocilizumab, an IL-6 receptor inhibitor adjuvant to TACE. While Tocilizumab has
      been demonstrated to be safe in RA patients and is FDA approved, limited data exists for the
      maximum tolerated dose (MTD) in patients with cirrhosis and HCC. Therefore, a lead in phase
      IB study design is planned to identify the MTD of Tocilizumab in HCC patients followed by
      expansion to the phase II component whereupon the primary objective will be median
      progression free survival (PFS).

    <measure>Maximum Tolerated Dose of Tocilizumab</measure>
    <time_frame>84 Days Post Treatment</time_frame>
    <description>The MTD is defined as the dose of Tocilizumab that induces dose-limiting toxicity in 20% of subjects or less when added to TACE. Patients must complete 84 days of treatment before the dose can be escalated.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Median Progression Free Survival</measure>
    <time_frame>2 Years Post Treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Patients will be followed every 3 months for 2 years post treatment. Progression-free survival (PFS) is defined as the duration of time from start of treatment to time of progression or death. Progressive disease is defined as at least a 20% increase in the sum of the LD or the appearance of one or more new lesions.</description>

    <description>Participants will receive Tocilizumab (ACTEMRA®) at 4, 6, or 8 mg/kg IV dose escalation on days 1, 29 and 57.
The first part of the trial will be Phase Ib and will enroll 18 participants. Participants will receive TACE on day 1 and Tocilizumab at dose level 1, 2, or 3 on days 1, 29 and 57. Maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of Tocilizumab will be determined.
The second part of the trial will be a Phase II and will enroll 50 subjects. Participants will receive TACE on day 1 and Tocilizumab at the MTD on days 1, 29 and 57.</description>
