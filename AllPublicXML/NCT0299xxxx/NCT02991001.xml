  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) is the most common peripheral entrapment neuropathy with
      involving compression of the median nerve in the carpal tunnel. Rather than other progressive
      disease, CTS is characterized by remission and recurrence. The hydrodissection could decrease
      the entrapment of nerve to restore blood supply. Despite the hydrodissection was pervasively
      used in clinical practice, current researches contain small participant without control group
      or randomized leading to foreseeable selection bias. The investigators design a randomized,
      double-blind, controlled trail to assess the effect after ultrasound-guided hydrodissection
      in patients with CTS.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      After obtaining written informed consent, patients with bilateral CTS will been randomized
      into intervention and control group. Participants in intervention group received one-dose
      ultrasound-guided hydrodissection and control side received one-dose ultrasound-guided
      injection at subcutaneous layer beyond carpal tunnel. No additional treatment after injection
      through the study period. The primary outcome is visual analog scale (VAS) and secondary
      outcomes include Boston Carpal Tunnel Syndrome Questionnaire (BCTQ), cross-sectional area
      (CSA) of the median nerve, sensory nerve conduction velocity of the median nerve, and finger
      pinch strength. The evaluation was performed pretreatment as well as on the 2nd week, 1st,
      2nd and 3rd month after the treatment.
