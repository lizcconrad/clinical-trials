  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Objectives: The primary objective is to determine the least frequent CPR training interval
      associated with continued performance of guideline-compliant CPR. The secondary objective is
      to determine whether certain physical characteristics, such as age, gender, exercise
      tolerance, height, and weight may be able to identify HCPs at high risk of being unable to
      perform high-quality CPR.

      Design: Randomized trial to compare the effect of different training frequencies on long-term
      CPR performance.

      Participants and setting: Nurses in all adult departments at Health Sciences North. Subjects
      will be randomly assigned to a group that undertakes short CPR assessment and training
      sessions either 1) every month, 2) every 3 months, 3) every 6 months, or 4) every 12 months
      (control group) over the course of a twelve-month period.

      Analysis: The proportion of nurses in each group that is able to perform &quot;excellent CPR&quot; at
      the twelve-month time point will be determined. Excellent CPR is defined as a two-minute CPR
      session where 90% of compressions are performed with correct depth (50-60 mm), 90% with
      correct rate (100-120 /min), and 90% with full chest recoil. A subgroup analysis will also be
      performed where the demographic data of individuals who are unable to perform excellent CPR
      at the twelve-month time point regardless of intervention group are compared against those
      who are successful.

      Conclusion: The results of our study will help determine the longest CPR training interval
      associated with maintenance of high-quality CPR skills to minimize training sessions required
      and decrease associated costs. The results will also generate hypotheses for future study
      about optimizing role assignments and team performance in resuscitation.
