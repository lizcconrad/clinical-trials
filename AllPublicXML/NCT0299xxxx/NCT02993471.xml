      This study is known as a &quot;drug interaction study.&quot; The purpose is to learn about how
      ixekizumab may affect the blood levels of a mixture of commonly used drugs (caffeine,
      omeprazole, warfarin, dextromethorphan, and midazolam) that are metabolized by cytochrome
      P450. Each participant will complete two study periods. Participants will take the mixture of
      commonly used drugs (plus vitamin K) by mouth on 3 occasions (prior to treatment with
      ixekizumab and after 1 and 12 weeks of treatment with ixekizumab). The study will last about
      17 weeks, including follow-up. Screening must be completed prior to study start.

             screening and first admission to the clinical research unit (CRU)

          -  Have both a Static Physicians Global Assessment (sPGA) score of ≥3 and Psoriasis Area
             Severity Index (PASI) score ≥12 at screening and first admission to the CRU
