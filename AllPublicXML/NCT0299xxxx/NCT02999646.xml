  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this trial is to determine the efficacy of the immunotherapy with MVX-ONCO-1
      in patients with advanced head and neck squamous cell carcinoma. MVX-ONCO-1 consists of dead
      tumor cells from the patient itself and genetically modified cells within a capsule. The
      whole treatment takes 9 weeks. At weeks 1, 2, 3, 4, 6 and 8, the tumor cells are injected
      underneath the skin and two capsules are implanted for a week. At weeks 2, 3, 4, 5, 7 and 9
      the capsules are removed again. The patients are then followed-up for 5 years.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with advanced HNSCC after platinum-based palliative chemotherapy have a poor
      prognosis, with no well-defined standard treatment and a survival between 6 to 9 months.

      MVX-ONCO-1 is a patient specific, cell-based, active immunotherapy, where the patient's
      immune response to tumor cells is stimulated and/or increased by triggering an immune
      response against the patients' cancer cells.

      Rationale for this trial is:

        1. HNSCC: there is a clear medical need in this patient population,

        2. Relapsing HNSCC often have accessible tumor tissue,

        3. HNSCC is considered an immunogenic tumor.

      This phase II study is a first step towards a potentially innovative immunotherapy for HNSCC.

      MVX-ONCO-1 is composed of:

        1. An immune-modulator (GM-CSF: granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor) released
           from an immuno-protected, encapsulated, allogeneic, genetically modified cell line
           (MVX-1), and

        2. Irradiated, autologous tumor cells as source of antigen.

      Each treatment consists of two macrocapsules containing the MVX-1 cell line implanted
      subcutaneously and lethally irradiated autologous tumor cells injected subcutaneously.
      Eligible patients will receive a treatment once weekly starting on week 1 for 4 weeks
      followed by two additional treatments 2 weeks apart (total 6 treatments over 8 weeks). Each
      macrocapsule is removed after 1 week. The patients are then followed-up for 5 years.
