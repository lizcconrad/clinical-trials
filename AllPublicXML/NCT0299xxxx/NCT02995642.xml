  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Stroke and abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs) are common and highly lethal vascular diseases.
      Angiogenesis and infiltration of inflammatory cells such as macrophages may cause stroke and
      AAAs.

      The purpose of this study is to test PET/CT and PET/MRI imaging to specifically detect those
      diseases using a new developed agent (18F-FPPRGD2) that can target angiogenesis and
      macrophages.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      20 subjects with either carotid bifurcation stenosis of &gt;50% by ultrasound on at least one
      side (10 patients) or advanced AAAs (10 patients) and surgical intervention planned will be
      identified from physicians from the Division of Vascular Surgery at Stanford.

      Either a PET/CT or a PET/MRI will be performed for each subject:

        -  PET/CT scans will be performed in 3D mode using GE Discovery 600 or GE Discovery 690
           scanners (GE Healthcare).

        -  PET/MRI scans will be performed using the novel PET/MRI system at Stanford, including a
           sensitive PET time-of-flight (TOF) scanner with an advanced 3T MRI scanner.

      The study patients will receive an intravenous administration of 10mCi of the prescribed
      radiotracer (18F-FPPRGD2). PET/CT or PET/MRI images will be obtained starting 45-60 minutes
      after radiotracer administration. For PET/CT, each image acquisition will begin with a
      non-contrast CT scan obtained from the vertex through the mid-thighs of the subjects. For
      PET/MRI, non-contrast images of the carotid or aorta will be performed. PET imaging will
      follow. Patient's vital signs will be monitored during the procedure and a physician will be
      available if there is need for immediate medical attention. The PET images will be
      reconstructed with a standard iterative algorithm using GE software release 5.0.

      After the planned surgery, we will also assess the histopathological correlation between the
      disease lesions and PET/CT or PET/MRI imaging characteristics.

    <description>The arterial standardized uptake value (SUV) for carotid plaque or AAA will be calculated as the mean pixel activity within the region of interest (ROI).
By averaging the SUV values for each artery slice, we will derived a mean SUV value for the entire artery (arterial SUV). This will be corrected for blood activity by division by the average blood SUV estimated from either the inferior vena cava or jugular vein to produce a blood-corrected artery SUV, known as the arterial tissue-to-background ratio (TBR).</description>
