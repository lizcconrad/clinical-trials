    <textblock>
      Our goal is to temporarily implant the following groups for 90 days:

        1. Three human partial hand amputees (amputated at the level of the hand) with 2 FAST-LIFE
           electrodes, one inserted into the motor fascicle of the ulnar nerve and the other into
           the sensory fascicle.

        2. Five human hand and forearm amputees (amputated at the level of the forearm) with 2
           FAST-LIFE electrodes in the ulnar nerve (one in the motor fascicle, one in the sensory
           fascicle) and 4-5 FAST-LIFE electrodes in the median nerve (one in the motor fascicle,
           one in each of the 3-4 sensory fascicles).

    <description>We will ask you to attempt to perform hand movements and positions as previously trained. The movement trials will consist of voluntary movements and positioning of both the uninjured/sound limb and the injured/amputated &quot;phantom&quot; limb done at the same time. This allows us to have a physical record of exactly what movement is being attempted by the amputated limb. We will record nerve and muscle electrode activity during all of the movement trials. During some movement trials, we will stimulate the LIFE neural electrodes while recording from implanted vs. surface adhesive vs. percutaneous needle muscle electrodes</description>

    <measure>Sensory Assessment</measure>
    <time_frame>weekly beginning 7 days after implantation up to day 90</time_frame>
    <description>We will also perform sensory detection and discrimination trials. Here, you will be asked to report if you detect any sensation during microstimulation (delivering very small electrical signals) via LIFE electrodes. If you do have a sensory perception, you will be asked to describe the quality and strength of the perception, e.g. location, touch, vibration, temperature. You may also be asked to fill out standardized sensory/pain assessments during microstimulation and after microstimulation is turned off. Several types of stimulation trials may be done.</description>

    <measure>Sensory-Motor Integration</measure>
    <time_frame>weekly beginning 7 days after implantation up to day 90</time_frame>
    <description>After determining your sensory detection and discrimination parameters (how well you can feel touch and movement), we will ask you to repeat standardized assessments using the existing myoelectric partial hand prosthesis. Microstimulation via LIFE electrodes will be paired with motion or contact during task performance in order to determine whether providing artificial sensation during prosthesis use improves task-based performance.</description>

        Criteria for Inclusion of Subjects:

        Hand and forearm amputees:

          -  Male or female, age 18 and older, of any race or ethnicity

          -  Able and willing to sign Consent

          -  Able and willing to participate in all study activities including implantation,
             testing and explantation of the study device.

          -  Able to communicate effectively in English without an interpreter

        After preliminary screening subjects will be assessed for the following inclusion criteria:

          -  Patient has an existing myoelectric hand prosthesis for &gt;3 months and demonstrates
             proficiency during daily use

          -  Overall and phantom pain are well-controlled and not incapacitating

        Criteria for Exclusion of Subjects:

        If MR neurogram and EMG/NCS study show nerve or muscle dysfunction/injury at a higher level
        than anticipated based on the appearance of the physical amputation stump, the subject may
        be excluded from the study due to adverse neuromuscular anatomy which would preclude use of
        the proposed experimental electrode implants. The radiographs will be used to confirm
        suitability of the amputation stump configuration. If the bony anatomy of the amputation
        stump is found to be unsuitable, the patient may be excluded from the study.
