    <textblock>
      Patients who hypogastric arteries and/or uterine arteries had been ligated will be evaluated
      in terms of ovarian reserve markers such as anti-mullerian hormone levels, ovarian volumes,
      antral follicule count, follicule stimuli hormone and estrogen levels. Investigators will
      search their archives for finding suitable patients for study. Investigators will especially
      notice being at least 6 month time of interval between surgery and evaluation time.
      Ultrasound examination and taking blood sample will be performed on 2nd or 3th day of
      menstrual cycle. These results will be compared with normal postpartum women's results. It
      will be evaluated that there is or not any effect of the hypogastric arteries and/or uterine
      arteries on ovarian reserve
