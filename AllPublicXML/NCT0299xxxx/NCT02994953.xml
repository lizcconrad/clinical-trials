  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study consists of 2 parts: Dose Escalation phase (Part A) and Expansion phase (Part B).
      The dose escalation phase will evaluate the safety, tolerability, and PK of avelumab in
      combination with NHS-IL12 in subjects with locally advanced, unresectable, or metastatic
      solid tumors. Expansion phase will assess the safety and clinical activity of the combination
      regimen in selected tumor types. In Expansion phase subjects who have completed the
      combination treatment of avelumab at a given dose level of NHS-IL12, a safety review will be
      performed by the Safety monitoring committee in order to make a decision on the next dose
      level. Successive cohorts of 3 to 6 subjects will be treated with escalating doses of
      NHS-IL12 with avelumab intravenous (IV).

             progressed after treatment with at least 1 platinum containing regimen for inoperable
             locally advanced or metastatic UC or disease recurrence. Availability of either tumor
             archival material or fresh biopsies (within 28 days) is acceptable with one of these
             being mandatory. For FFPE samples, either block or sections (&gt; 15) may be provided.
             Tumor biopsies and tumor archival material must be suitable for biomarker assessment.

          -  Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), first-line metastatic: Stage IV (per seventh
             International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer classification) histologically
             confirmed NSCLC. Subjects must not have received treatment for their metastatic
             disease. Subjects could have received adjuvant chemotherapy or loco-regional treatment
             that included chemotherapy for locally advanced disease, as long as disease recurrence
             occurred at least 6 months after the completion of the last administration of
             chemotherapy. Only epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and anaplastic lymphoma
             kinase (ALK) wild-type are allowed (ie, EGFR mutation and ALK translocation / re
             arrangement excluded). Non squamous cell histologies and never / former light smoker

             will not be opened for enrollment in Belgium, Czech Republic, Germany, Hungary, Italy,
             Netherlands, Spain, and United Kingdom. Availability of either tumor archival material
             or fresh biopsies within 28 days is acceptable with one of these being mandatory. For
             FFPE samples, either block or sections (&gt; 15) may be provided. Tumor biopsies and
             tumor archival material must be suitable for biomarker assessment.

          -  Colorectal cancer (CRC): Histologically or cytologically confirmed recurrent or
             refractory metastatic CRC (according to American Joint Committee on Cancer /
             International Union Against Cancer Tumor Node Metastasis [TNM] Staging System seventh
             edition) after failure of prior therapy containing oxaliplatin / fluoropyrimidine and
             / or irinotecan / fluoropyrimidine and, if eligible, cetuximab (Erbitux®) and
             bevacizumab (Avastin®). Only subjects with microsatellite instability (MSI)-low or
             microsatellite stable (MSS) metastatic CRC are eligible. Subjects without existing MSI
             test results will have MSI status performed locally by a Clinical Laboratory
             Improvement Amendments (CLIA)-certified IHC or polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based
             test (PCR based MSI test is preferred). Subjects must be willing to undergo an
             on-treatment biopsy procedure. For Belgium, Czech Republic, Germany, Hungary, Italy,
             Netherlands, Spain, and United Kingdom, subjects in the second-line setting should
             have exhausted or be considered ineligible or intolerant (in the opinion of the
             Investigator) of available second-line chemotherapy options. Availability of either
             tumor archival material or fresh biopsies within 28 days is acceptable with one of
             these being mandatory. For FFPE samples, either block or sections (&gt; 15) may be
             provided. Tumor biopsies and tumor archival material must be suitable for biomarker
             assessment.

          -  Renal cell carcinoma (RCC), primary immune checkpoint inhibitor failure:
             Histologically or cytologically documented metastatic RCC with a component of clear
             cell subtype. Subjects must have had progressive disease (PD) within 6 months or best
             overall response of stable disease (SD) for ≥ 6 months following start of therapy with
             any antibody / drug targeting T cell co-regulatory proteins (immune checkpoints) such
             as anti-PD-1, anti-PD-L1, or anticytotoxic T lymphocyte antigen-4 (CTLA-4) for
             advanced or metastatic disease (either as monotherapy or combination therapy, in any
             line). Availability of a fresh tumor biopsy is mandatory for eligibility in the RCC
             cohort. The biopsy or surgical specimen should be collected within 28 days prior to
             the first IMP administration. Subjects must also be willing to undergo an on-treatment
             biopsy procedure.
