  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the effects of fractional carbon dioxide (CO2) laser
      therapy immediately followed by intralesional steroid therapy against intralesional steroid
      therapy alone for the treatment of keloids.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Intralesional corticosteroids remain the gold standard treatment for keloids. However, more
      effective therapies are desperately desired. Ablative fractional laser (AFL) treatment
      facilitates delivery of intralesional steroid more deeply and uniformly into the skin by
      creating vertical channels. Recent studies have showed that fractional laser assisted steroid
      therapy can be effective in the treatment of keloids. However the studies are lacking in
      comparing this treatment modality to the gold standard of intralesional steroids.

             evaluation including medical history;

          -  The subject has at least two keloids of comparative size and texture located on the
             same general anatomic location (trunk or back);

          -  The subject is willing and able to comply with the requirements of the protocol. In
             particular, subject must adhere to the visits schedule and concomitant therapy. The
             subject is willing to comply with the 4 week washout period;

          -  The subject has understood and signed an Informed Consent Form approved by the
             Institutional Review Board (IRB) prior to any investigational procedure

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Any subject who is meeting one or more of the following exclusion criteria at the screening
        visit and/or at the baseline visit will not be included in this study:

          -  The subject has an underlying known disease, a surgical or medical condition that in
             the opinion of the investigator might put the subject at risk

             protocol-defined wash-out period prior to Baseline (checked at Screening and Baseline)
             or is unwilling to refrain from use during the study

          -  The subject is treated with anticoagulants or antiplatelet therapies

          -  The subject has a known allergy or sensitivity to any local anesthetic drug (e.g. EMLA
             or tetracaine 7%/lidocaine 23%) or a local antiseptic planned to be used for the
             laser.

          -  The subject is in an exclusion period from a previous study or is participating in
             another clinical trial

          -  The subject is an adult under guardianship or is hospitalized in a public or private
             institution, or is deprived of freedom

          -  The subject is unable to communicate or cooperate with the Investigator due to
