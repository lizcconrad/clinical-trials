      PROSPECT-C is a phase II study investigating the molecular markers of response or resistance
      to anti-epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) antibodies.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cetuximab or panitumumab are two monoclonal antibodies that are routinely offered to patients
      with metastatic colorectal cancer when they have no mutation in RAS genes. In Royal Marsden
      Hospital patients, who are refractory to all standard therapies and have metastatic
      colorectal cancer are offered one of these agents in third line metastatic setting. Whilst
      the mechanisms of response/resistance to these therapies are well studies, they are still
      incompletely understood. The main hypothesis of this study is that finding mechanisms of
      response and/or resistance by using novel techniques such as next generation sequencing (NGS)
      and/or digital droplet polymerase chain reaction (ddPCR) to these therapies will allow better
      patient selection and application of precision medicine in such patients.

      Both fresh frozen tissue and formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue samples will be
      obtained. In addition, the following blood samples will also be taken;

        1. Baseline: an initial 20mL research blood sample (EDTA or equivalent (CPT) tube) will be
           collected

        2. Every 4 weeks until disease progression or patient death: 1 x 10mL research blood sample
           (EDTA or equivalent (CPT) tube) will be collected

        3. At time of progressive disease: final 10mL research blood sample (EDTA or equivalent
           (CPT) tube)

             adenocarcinoma

          2. wild-type RAS tumour status by molecular analysis at the Royal Marsden Hospital

          3. patients with inoperable metastatic colorectal cancer who are scheduled to be treated

             chemotherapy with palliative intent

          4. patients who have received prior treatment with oxaliplatin, irinotecan and
