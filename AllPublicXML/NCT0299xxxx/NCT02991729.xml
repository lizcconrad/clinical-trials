  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators aim to assess whether use of a novel, tablet-based computerized decision
      aid for aneuploidy screening is similar to routine care with a brief genetic counseling visit
      in improving patient knowledge and decreasing decisional conflict.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      184 women will be randomized in a 1:1 fashion to use of a novel computerized iPad-based
      decision aid in addition to routine counseling or routine counseling only during a single
      study visit. This decision aid was developed at a 10th grade literacy level using input from
      Maternal Fetal Medicine physicians and certified genetic counselors, and piloted by 20
      English and Spanish speaking women of varying education levels. Following completion of
      genetic counseling, participants will complete several surveys assessing knowledge and
      decision conflict. Data will be abstracted regarding demographics, screening and diagnostic
      testing uptake, and testing results.

    <description>All patients in the intervention arm will complete a knowledge questionnaire following completion of the decision and and again immediately following genetic counseling. The investigators will assess noninferiority of the decision aid on participant knowledge, with primary outcome comparing knowledge after completion of the decision aid in the intervention arm, to knowledge following genetic counseling only in the routine care arm. The questionnaire is a modification of the validated Maternal Serum Screening Knowledge Questionnaire. This is on a 12-point scale (values 0-12), with higher score indicating greater knowledge.</description>

    <measure>Decisional conflict score</measure>
    <time_frame>At completion of genetic counseling, approximately 10-60 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>A low-literacy decisional conflict questionnaire will be used. This will be completed by patients in the intervention arm following use of the decision and and again following genetic counseling. It will be completed by patients in the routine care arm following genetic counseling. Decisional conflict at all time points (following completion of the decision aid in the intervention arm, and following completion of genetic counseling in both arms) will be compared. This questionnaire is on a 40 point scale (values 0-40), with higher score indicating higher level of decisional conflict.</description>

    <description>These patients will receive routine care at our institution for counseling on aneuploidy screening; they will be counseled by a genetic counselor on options, and following counseling, will select their test of choice. All patients will complete a knowledge and demographics questionnaire prior to genetic counseling. Patients in this arm will then complete a knowledge and decisional conflict survey immediately following genetic counseling.</description>
