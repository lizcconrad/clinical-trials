    <textblock>
      This trial will compare conventional sequential bilateral rTMS to a bilateral theta burst
      stimulation protocol. The right and left dorsolateral prefrontal cortices will be the site of
      stimulation in both treatment conditions. The site of stimulation will be targeted using MRI
      co-registration. The study seeks to determine if the bilateral theta burst protocol has
      similar effectiveness to the conventional bilateral rTMS protocol in treating major
      depression.
