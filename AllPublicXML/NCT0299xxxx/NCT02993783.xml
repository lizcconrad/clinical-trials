  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the initial activity, tolerability, safety and to
      identify a recommended dose and regimen of vedolizumab intravenous (IV) administered for
      treatment of steroid-refractory acute intestinal GvHD in participants who have undergone
      allo-HSCT.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The drug being tested in this study is called vedolizumab. This study will look at the
      tolerability and effectiveness of vedolizumab IV in participants with acute intestinal GvHD
      who have received no systemic therapy for the treatment of acute GvHD (prophylaxis
      acceptable) other than corticosteroids.

      The study will enroll approximately 38 participants. Participants will be randomly assigned
      (by chance, like flipping a coin) to one of the two treatment groups:

        -  Vedolizumab IV 300 mg

        -  Vedolizumab IV 600 mg

      All participants will be infused intravenously at the same time each day throughout the
      study. Vedolizumab IV will be administered on Days 1, 15, 43, 71, and 99. After approximately
      10 participants are enrolled at each dose level and have data available from the Day 28
      evaluation, safety, tolerability, efficacy, and pharmacokinetic (PK), results will be
      assessed for each dose level, and the appropriate dose for subsequent participants in the
      study will be determined. The cohort at the chosen dose level will then be expanded by
      approximately 18 additional evaluable participants to further assess the tolerability and
      effectiveness of vedolizumab. Both dose levels may be expanded based on accumulating results,
      if necessary.

      This multi-center trial will be conducted in multiple countries. The overall time to
      participate in this study is 36 months. Participants will make multiple visits to the clinic
      after last dose of study drug for a follow-up assessment.

    <description>Complete Response (CR) is defined as the resolution of all signs and symptoms of acute graft-versus-host-disease (GvHD). Very good partial response (VGPR) is defined as resolution of the signs and symptoms of the GvHD: 1) Skin: No rash, or residual erythematous rash involving less than (&lt;) 25 percent (%) of the body surface, without bullae (excluding residual faint erythema and hyperpigmentation).
2) Liver: Total serum bilirubin concentration &lt;2 milligram per deciliter (mg/dL) or &lt;25% of baseline at enrollment.
3) Gut: a) Participant tolerates food or enteral feeding; b) Predominantly formed stools; c) No overt gastrointestinal bleeding or abdominal cramping; d) No more than occasional nausea or vomiting. Partial Response (PR) is defined as improvement of 1 GvHD stage in 1 or more organs without progression in any organ.</description>

    <description>An Adverse Event (AE) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation participant administered a drug; it does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment. An SAE is defined as an untoward medical occurrence, significant hazard, contraindication, side effect or precaution that at any dose: results in death, is life-threatening, required in-patient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity, is a congenital anomaly/birth defect or is medically significant. Among these, events which are considered possibly associated with a medicinal product are defined as adverse drug reactions.</description>

    <description>An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation participant administered a drug; it does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (example, a clinically significant abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a drug, whether or not it is considered related to the drug. A TEAE is defined as an adverse event with an onset that occurs after receiving study drug.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Recipient of 1 allo-HSCT but not more than 1 allo-HSCT.

          2. Has primary steroid-refractory GvHD. Steroid-refractory disease is defined as
             worsening or no improvement in 5 to 7 days of treatment with methylprednisolone 2
             milligram per kilogram (mg/kg) or equivalent or lack of a CR after 14 days of primary
             treatment with methylprednisolone 2 mg/kg or equivalent. Note that participants who
             develop intestinal GvHD while receiving systemic therapy for other GvHD are still
             eligible after 5 to 7 days, even if the intestinal GvHD has not been present for the
             entire duration. Participants who may have received an increase in their steroid dose
             treatment (example, increased methylprednisolone from 1 mg/kg to 2 mg/kg) before
             enrollment will be eligible, provided the participant has met the definition of
             steroid refractory above. Participants who develop toxicity on corticosteroids or who
             are otherwise medically unable to be dosed to this level, will also be eligible.

          3. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 to 3.

          4. Evidence of myeloid engraftment defined by absolute neutrophil count greater than or
             equal to (&gt;=) 0.5*109/liter (L) on 3 consecutive days.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Presence of chronic GvHD at Screening (including acute-chronic overlap syndrome).

          2. Relapse of underlying malignant disease after allo-HSCT.

          3. Hyperacute GvHD defined as onset of GvHD within the first 15 days following
             hematopoietic stem cell infusion.

          4. Received systemic agents other than corticosteroids for treatment of acute GvHD. GvHD
             prophylaxis agents (example, calcineurin inhibitors) may be continued.

          5. Life expectancy of &lt;3 weeks.
