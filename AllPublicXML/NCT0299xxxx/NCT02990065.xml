      The purposes of the study are:

        -  To strictly ensure the appropriate level of protein and caloric provision in critical
           illness, according to the latest literature recommendation;

        -  To determine if an association exists between protein intake and nitrogen balance in the
           context of a nutrition with appropriate protein provision based on the latest literature
           recommendations, rather than in a standard diet with a caloric target weight-based.
           Creatinine clearance will also be evaluated to determine if there is any harmful effect
           to the kidney secondary to an elevated BUN.

        -  To determine if there is a difference in ICU mortality rate between the current
           nutrition standard and a hyperproteic nutrition protocol.

    <arm_group_type>Experimental</arm_group_type>
    <description>The protein-fortified diet consists on an energy goal based on REE measurement and a protein target based on the most recent literature recommendations (1.2-2 g/kg/die) (2). Daily caloric requirement, and subsequent protein content, of patients enrolled in the intervention group will be calculated using formulas in Table 1 (10, 12, 13). For each patient will be calculated the Resting Energy Expenditure (REE) and daily protein requirement (1.2-2g/kg/die of body weight registered at the admission) and the corresponding caloric intake (1g = 4 kcal). Finally, total daily caloric intake will be calculated by adding kcal from protein (1g = 4kcal) on kcal from non-protein (50% of REE).</description>

  <arm_group>
    <arm_group_label>STANDARD DIET</arm_group_label>
    <arm_group_type>No Intervention</arm_group_type>
    <description>The standard diet consists on an energy goal based on weight formula (20-25 kcal/kg/die). According to the ICU nutritional protocol, EN is started at an initial rate of 10ml/h, and increased by 20ml/h every 12 hours in the absence of significant gastric residuals (&lt;250ml), with the aim of reaching the energy goal within 72 hours from admission. The EN formulae used are standard (1-1,5 kcal/ml, 40g/l protein). If enteral nutrition is not tolerated or is not indicated, supplemental PN is used to make up the energy shortfall. The PN formula used is standard (1000 kcal/l, 37 g/l protein).</description>
