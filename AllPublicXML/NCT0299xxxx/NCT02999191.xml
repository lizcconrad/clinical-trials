  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this trial is to investigate the relative bioavailability of BI
      1467335, given as film-coated tablet compared to BI 1467335, given as oral solution. This
      assessment will be performed under fasted conditions. Furthermore, the effect of food on
      relative bioavailability of the tablet formulation of BI 1467335 will be investigated.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Healthy male subjects according to the investigators assessment, based on a complete
             medical history including a physical examination, vital signs (Blood Pressure
             (BP),Pulse Rate(PR)), 12-lead Electrocardiogram (ECG), and clinical laboratory tests

          -  Age of 18 to 55 years (incl.)

          -  Body Mass Index (BMI) of 18.5 to 29.9 kg/m2 (incl.)

          -  Signed and dated written informed consent prior to admission to the study in
             accordance with Good Clinical Practice (GCP) and local legislation

          -  Willingness to comply with contraception requirements. Subjects who are sexually
             active, must use, with their female partner, adequate contraception throughout the
             study and until one month after the last administration of trial medication. Adequate
             methods are:

               -  Sexual abstinence or

               -  A vasectomy performed at least 1 year prior to screening in combination with a
                  barrier method (condom or diaphragm) or

               -  Surgical sterilisation (including bilateral tubal occlusion, hysterectomy or
                  bilateral oophorectomy) of the subjects female partner or

               -  The use of condoms, if the female partner uses in addition an adequate
                  contraception method, e.g., intrauterine device (IUD), hormonal contraception
                  (e.g. implants, injectables, combined oral or vaginal contraceptives) that
                  started at least 2 months prior to first drug administration, or barrier method
                  (e.g. diaphragm with spermicide) Unprotected sexual intercourse with a pregnant
                  female partner is not allowed throughout the study and until one month after the
                  last administration of trial medication.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Any finding in the medical examination (including Blood Pressure (BP), Pulse Rate (PR)

             by the investigator

          -  Repeated measurement of systolic blood pressure outside the range of 90 to 140 mmHg,
             diastolic blood pressure outside the range of 50 to 90 mmHg, or pulse rate outside the
             range of 50 to 90 beats per minute (bpm)

             investigator

          -  Gastrointestinal, hepatic, renal, respiratory, cardiovascular, metabolic,
             immunological or hormonal disorders

             repair)

          -  Diseases of the central nervous system (including but not limited to any kind of
             seizures or stroke), and other relevant neurological or psychiatric disorders

          -  History of relevant orthostatic hypotension, fainting spells, or blackouts

          -  Chronic or relevant acute infections

          -  History of relevant allergy or hypersensitivity (including allergy to the trial
             medication or its excipients)

          -  Use of drugs within 30 days prior to administration of trial medication, if that might
             reasonably influence the results of the trial (incl. QT/QTc interval prolongation)

          -  Participation in another trial where an investigational drug has been administered
             within 60 days prior to planned administration of trial medication or current
             participation in another trial involving administration of investigational drug

          -  Smoker (more than 10 cigarettes or 3 cigars or 3 pipes per day)

          -  Inability to refrain from smoking on specified trial days

          -  Inability to comply with dietary regimen of trial site

          -  A marked baseline prolongation of QT/QTc interval (such as QTc intervals that are
             repeatedly greater than 450 ms) or any other relevant ECG finding at screening

          -  A history of additional risk factors for Torsades de Pointes (such as heart failure,
             hypokalaemia, or family history of Long QT Syndrome)

          -  Subject is assessed as unsuitable for inclusion by the investigator, for instance,
             because considered not able to understand and comply with study requirements, or has a
