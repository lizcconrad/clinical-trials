  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The BENEFIT-Study is a randomized controlled 3-arm intervention trial investigating the
      currently discussed hypothesis that exercise concomitant to chemotherapy (CTx) may have a
      beneficial effect on cancer prognosis by boosting the anti-tumoral effect of the cytostatics
      or by enhancing therapy compliance. This hypothesis is based on pre-clinical and exploratory
      clinical trials. Breast cancer patients scheduled for neoadjuvant CTx will be randomized to
      either a resistance training or an aerobic training concomitant to the neoadjuvant CTx, or a
      waiting list control group that will get no exercise intervention during neoadjuvant CTx
      (i.e. usual care) but will exercise after breast surgery. The primary study endpoint is the
      tumor size. Further, the effects of resistance and aerobic exercise on the
      clinical-pathologic stage (CPS-EG) score, the pathological complete response (pCR),
      tolerability and compliance to CTx, physical fitness, patient reported outcomes such as
      fatigue, sleep problems, quality of life, depressive symptoms, anxiety and pain, as well as
      cognitive function, and selected biomarkers will be investigated.

      A confirmation of the study hypothesis would be a strong argument for patients to engage in
      exercise as early as during neoadjuvant CTx. The trial will also provide evidence-based
      guidance for patients regarding type and timing of training.

    <description>The training will take place twice weekly over the course of neoadjuvant CTx at the NCT Heidelberg or in regional qualified centers under supervision and guidance of experienced exercise therapists. The aerobic exercise will be performed on a cycle ergometer (or alternatively at a treadmill, elliptical, rowing ergometer, or combination) progressing from 60% to 70% VO2max with increasing duration. During weeks 7-18 the goal is to perform an extensive interval training.</description>

    <description>The control group receives no exercise intervention during neoadjuvant CTx, which reflects the usual care condition. To investigate effects of different exercise timing, and to provide those patients also a potential health benefit and reduce drop-out and contamination, the control group will receive 18 weeks resistance or aerobic exercise (according to their personal preferences) after breast cancer surgery.</description>
