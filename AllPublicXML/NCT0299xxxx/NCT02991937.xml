  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized controlled trial of 190 subjects comparing non-operative management with
      antibiotics to surgical management of uncomplicated acute appendicitis. The hypothesis is
      that antibiotics are not worse than surgery for the treatment of uncomplicated appendicitis
      in children. The primary outcome will be survey scores on the Pediatric Quality of Life
      Inventory (PedsQL) Generic Core Scale Parent-proxy report. Secondary outcomes will include
      child scores on the PedsQL; length of stay; immediate, 1-week, 2-week, 30-day, and 60-day
      success of non-operative management; readmission rates for both groups; and long-term
      complications over one year.

    <description>Subjects in the medical therapy arm will be treated with piperacillin/tazobactam for at least 24 hours. Ciprofloxacin/metronidazole will be used in penicillin-allergic patients. Subjects will be maintained on nothing by mouth with intravenous fluids for at least 12 hours. Subjects will be transitioned to oral antibiotics when their WBC is normal, they have a decrease in CRP by ≥ 15%, and they have been afebrile for 24 hours on IV antibiotics.</description>

    <description>Subjects in the surgical treatment arm will receive intravenous antibiotics until the time of operation, and will be maintained on intravenous fluids and no oral intake until they undergo appendectomy as per standard of care. Appendectomy will occur within 24 hours of enrollment. Subjects in the surgical treatment arm will receive post-operative antibiotics as per standard of care.</description>
