      The aim of this study will be to verify the effect of creatine supplementation associated to
      clinical treatment of the functional capacity in patients with intermittent claudication. The
      sample will be composed by patients with intermittent claudication of both sexes. The
      patients will be ramdomized in a double-blind procedure to receive during seven days
      (loading) and posteriorly 49 days (maintenance) a creatine (Cr) supplementation or placebo
      (PLA), associated to the clinical treatment. Before (&quot;baseline&quot;), after &quot;loading&quot; period and
      after the maintenance period of supplementation, the patients will go through a functional
      capacity evaluation. The fuctional capacity evaluation will be evaluated by a six
      minute-walking test. For statistical analysis it will be used the ANOVA of two factors for
      repeated measurements, having the (Cr and PLA) group and the time (pre, post-loading and
      post-maintenance), and when needed the post-hoc of Newman keuls. The adopted level of
      significance will be P&lt;0.05.
