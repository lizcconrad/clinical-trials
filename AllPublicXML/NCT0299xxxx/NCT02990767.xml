  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aims of this study are to develop algorithms based on a combination of maternal factors,
      uterine artery PI, MAP and serum biomarkers to estimate patient-specific risks for early
      Preeclampsia (PE) and to evaluate the screening performance of such algorithms in twins.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Preeclampsia (PE) is still a leading cause of fetal and maternal morbidity and mortality with
      an incidence of 3-5% worldwide. Despite intensive research efforts the pathogenesis of the
      disease is still unknown but it is likely to be multifactorial.Clinical risk factors
      traditionally have been used to identify women at high risk of developing preeclampsia,and
      biophysical factors that may help predict hypertensive disorders of pregnancy.In
      addition,changes in the serum concentrations of angiogenic and antiangiogenic factors are
      implied in the pathogenesis of PE and have possible relevance in the diagnosis of the
      disease.
