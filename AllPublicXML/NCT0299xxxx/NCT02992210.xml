    <textblock>
      Patients with refractory and/or recurrent solid tumor have poor prognosis despite complex
      multimodel therapy and therefore, novel approaches are urgently needed. The investigators are
      attempt to treat these diseases using T cells genetically modified with a 4th generation
      lentiviral chimeric antigen receptor (4SCAR fused with an inducible apoptotic caspase 9
      domain) targeting GD2 (4SCAR-GD2). The 4SCAR-GD2-modified T cells can recognize and kill
      tumor cells through the recognition of GD2, a surface protein expressed at high levels on
      many types of tumors but not on normal tissues. This study will evaluate the side effects and
      effective doses of 4SCAR-GD2 T cells in treating refractory and/or recurrent tumors.

      Background:

      Patients with refractory and/or recurrent solid tumors have poor prognosis despite complex
      multimodal therapy; therefore, novel curative approaches are needed. The investigators are
      attempting to use T cells obtained directly from the patient, which can be genetically
      modified to express a 4th generation GD2-specific chimeric antigen receptor (4SCAR-GD2). The
      chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) molecules enable the T cells to recognize and kill tumor
      cells through the recognition of a surface antigen, GD2, which is expressed at high levels on
      tumor cells but not at significant levels on normal tissues. This study will evaluate the
      side effects and the best dose of a novel 4th generation anti-GD2 CAR T cells to refractory
      and/or recurrent solid tumors.

      Design:

      Participants will be screened through physical exam and medical history. Blood and urine
      samples will be collected. Imaging studies or bone marrow aspirates may be performed.

      Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) will be obtained by apheresis, and T cells will be
      activated and modified to express the 4SCAR-GD2 gene.

      On Day -5 to -7, PBMC will be activated and enriched for T cells, which will be followed by
      4SCAR-GD2 lentiviral transduction. The total culture time is approximately 5-7 days.

      Participants will receive a preparative conditioning regimen comprising
      cyclophosphamide/fludarabine to prepare their immune system to accept the modified CAR T
      cells.The preparative regimen will be based on patient immune condition and consistent with
      standard chemotherapy conditioning regimen.
