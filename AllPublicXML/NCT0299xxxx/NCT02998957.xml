      Introduction:

      Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) presents with a gradual reduction and little
      bitterness reversible airflow causing shortness of breath, chronic cough and sputum abnormal.
      Patients with COPD often suffer exacerbations of their symptoms, particularly dyspnea,
      causing hospital admissions. Recent studies have shown that acupuncture stimulation
      transcutánea (AcuTENS) Dingchuan point (EX-B1) could help reduce dyspnea in patients with
      COPD.

      Objective:

      The aim of this study was to evaluate the possible utility of adding to the usual treatment
      stimulation AcuTENS in COPD patients admitted with severe dyspnea.

      Methodology:

      Patients who agree to participate will be randomly divided into two groups. The intervention
      group will receive a daily treatment, during the period of hospitalization, 45 minutes
      stimulation at acupuncture point AcuTENS Dingchuan (EX-B1), while the control group performed
      the same procedure with a device TENS simulated. The extent of dyspnea in both groups as well
      as the number of days of hospitalization and the number of drugs consumed.
