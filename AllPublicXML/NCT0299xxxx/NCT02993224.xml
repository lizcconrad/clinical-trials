        had surgical bilateral oophorectomy (with or without hysterectomy) or tubal ligation at
        least six weeks ago. In the case of oophorectomy alone, only when the reproductive status
        of the woman has been confirmed by follow up hormone level assessment is she considered not
        of child bearing potential. 17 Sexually active males unless they use a condom during
