    <textblock>
      He-Mu-point combination（ST36 and CV12） is one of the most commonly used acupoints combination
      with synergistic effect for functional dyspepsia(FD). The investigators design the trial to
      identify the efficacy and explore the central integrated mechanism of puncturing at
      He-Mu-point combination on FD with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI).

    <textblock>
      105 participants with functional dyspepsia will be allocated into three groups: Low-He point
      group, Mu point group and He-Mu-point combination group.Every participant will receive 20
      sessions of manual acupuncture treatment during 4 weeks. Clinical evaluations will be
      assessed three times, as measured after randomization, 10 and 20 sessions of treatment.The
      fMRI scans will be conducted twice, after randomization and treatment completion.
