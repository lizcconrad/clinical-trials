      This prospective, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical study,
      into the group of children in the hospital that use clinical antibiotics from one month to
      three years old，by observing the given antibiotics at the same time with the whole bowel raw
      or placebo, prevent the happening of the antibiotic associated diarrhea, evaluate the whole
      bowel prevention clinical efficacy and safety of AAD.

      Outcome measures

        1. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The incidence of diarrhea (stool frequency and character daily
           rates), the duration of diarrhea, the degree of diarrhea occur.

        2. Secondary outcomes: intestinal flora and relevant metabolites, micro-environmental
           changes.
