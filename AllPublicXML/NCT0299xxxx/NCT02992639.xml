  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To investigate weight loss effect with mild calorie restriction on circulating levels of
      liver enzymes in nondiabetic and overweight subjects with high visceral fat area [visceral
      fat area (VFA) at L4 ≥ 100 cm²].

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A 12-week randomized, placebo-controlled study was conducted on 80 nondiabetic and overweight
      subjects with high VFA. The participants divided into two groups: 12-week mild calorie
      restriction (a 300 kcal/day intake reduction, n=40) or no treatment (control, n=40). The
      randomization was according to computer-generated block randomization (placebo:test = 1:1).
      Before and after intervention period, venous blood samples were obtained from the subjects,
      and biochemical parameters including circulating liver enzymes were measured.
