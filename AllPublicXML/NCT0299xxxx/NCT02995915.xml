      Alcohol misuse and smoking constitute two of the three leading preventable causes of death in

    <textblock>
      Alcohol misuse and smoking constitute two of the three leading preventable causes of death in
      the United States. Reluctance to treat tobacco dependence among those with AUD is misguided
      as recent research suggests smoking cessation treatment can be effective, does not increase
      risk of relapse to alcohol, and may even improve rates of sobriety. There is strong evidence
      for the short-term efficacy for alcohol misuse and smoking of contingency management (CM). It
      is an intensive behavioral therapy that provides incentives (vouchers, money) to individuals
      misusing substances contingent upon objective evidence from drug use. Implementation of CM
      has been limited because of the need to verify abstinence multiple times daily using clinic
      based monitoring. The investigators recently developed a smart-phone application which allows
      a patient to video themselves several times daily while using a small CO monitor and to
      transmit the data to a secure server which has made the use of CM for outpatient smoking
      cessation portable and feasible. This mobile CM (mCM) approach paired with
      cognitive-behavioral counseling and pharmacological smoking cessation aids has been effective
      in reducing smoking.

      Thus, the purpose of this project is to develop a combined alcohol and smoking mCM
      intervention. Participants in the study will be 10 men and/or women smokers with alcohol use
      disorders. The long term goal is to develop mCM procedures that will be used as part of a
      multi-component intervention to concurrently and effectively treat both alcohol misuse and
      smoking. As part of this project, the investigators will develop a multi-component telehealth
      alcohol and smoking mCM intervention. It will include mCM, cognitive-behavioral phone
      counseling, and standard smoking cessation pharmacotherapy. The work proposed in these aims
      will provide the first step toward implementation of an innovative approach that builds upon
      the power of mHealth technology to reduce the prevalence of both alcohol misuse and smoking.
      Funding will be sought to pilot test the developed intervention.
