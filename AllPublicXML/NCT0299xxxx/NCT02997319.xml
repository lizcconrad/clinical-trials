  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether night time eating that coincides with
      elevated endogenous melatonin impairs glucose tolerance, particularly in carriers of the
      MTNR1B risk allele.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Preliminary observations suggest that food intake coincident with high melatonin levels leads
      to impaired glucose toleranceâ€”particularly in MTNR1B risk allele carriers. Our objectives are
      to determine the effect of concurrent food intake and melatonin on glucose tolerance; and to
      assess the role of MTNR1B single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)*melatonin interaction in this
      deleterious effect. Our central hypothesis is that concurrent high melatonin levels and food
      intake, commonly experienced in night shift workers, cause long-term impairment of glucose
      tolerance and that this effect is worse in carriers of the MTNR1B type 2 diabetes (T2D) risk
      SNP than in non-carriers. The results of this proposal will help to clarify an ongoing
      controversy about the role of melatonin in glucose tolerance, and will help to develop novel
      strategies in the prevention and treatment of T2D, especially in shift workers, night eaters,
      and MTNR1B risk allele carriers.
