  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Participants who train at The Micheli Center for Sports Injury Prevention, will undergo
      testing of muscular strength, range of motion, flexibility, aerobic capacity and muscular
      endurance. They will complete training with a certified trainer and injury prevention
      specialist until their specific goals are meet. Upon completion of training, they will fill
      out an injury questionnaire every three months for five to ten years.

    <time_frame>After a subject undergoes training at The Micheli Center for Sports Injury Prevention, they will complete a survey every 3 months for the next 10 years.</time_frame>
    <description>For purposes of our study, an injury is one that:
occurred as a result of participation in sport AND
required medical attention by a team athletic trainer or a physician AND
resulted in restriction of the student-athlete's participation for one or more days beyond the day of injury OR
resulted in any fracture, concussion, or dental injury regardless of whether or not it resulted in restriction of the student-athlete's participation</description>
