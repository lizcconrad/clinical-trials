  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      One of the major challenges faced by researchers working in the field of rehabilitation
      science is the ability to provide integrative approaches to the use of clinical practice. In
      this context it becomes increasingly necessary to construct investigative approaches, so that
      they can reach clinical practice in a shorter period of time,since the large volume of
      information produced globally does not impact in the short or medium term on new therapeutic
      recommendations. Among the various chronic painful entities, there is chikungunya fever as a
      highlight for having a rich clinical chronology in relation to pain. Its therapy is used done
      by drugs in almost all national and international consensuses, therefore therapy against pain
      in chikungunya fever is limited during the rehabilitation process. It is very important that
      the science of rehabilitation enhances methods of noninvasive brain modulation that enable,
      through the excitation or inhibition of specific cortical areas to produce pain inhibiting
      effects, providing a simple and low cost treatment to the clinical routine.Technological
      advances and non-invasive techniques to modulate brain function have been developed, for
      instance, Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS).

      The objective of the present project is to present the tDCS as a new modality of physical
      rehabilitation for the patient with chronic pain resulting from chikungunya fever. The
      purpose of the study is to present physical, behavioral and social results of the application
      of tDCS in chikungunya fever, suggesting an improvement in the quality of life and functional
      status of the individual.
