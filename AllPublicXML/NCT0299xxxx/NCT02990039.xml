    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study was (i) to develop a brief counseling letter intervention aiming to
      reduce sedentary time and to increase physical activity during leisure time among adults aged
      42 to 64 years and (ii) to provide information on the feasibility.

      The study aimed to assess the feasibility of a brief counseling letter intervention to
      increase physical activity and to reduce sedentary time in leisure time.

      Following the Intervention Mapping Protocol we developed the counseling letter intervention.
      The intervention is based on the Health Action Process Approach, comprising 3 tailored
      letters based on separate assessments, delivered over 6 month.

      All participants consented (i) to participate in an examination at the university hospital
      including standardized measurements of blood pressure, waist and hip circumference, body
      height and weight as well as blood sample taking, (ii) to fill in a paper-pencil
      questionnaire, and (iii) to wear an accelerometer for 7 days at baseline and at 12-month
      follow-up.

      A general population sample of cardiovascular healthy adults was randomly allocated to a
      control and an intervention group. At 5 time points (baseline, 3-month, 6-month, 7-month, and
      12-month follow-up) participants of both study groups completed standardized questionnaires.

    <description>The intervention is based on the Health Action Process Approach. The first letter provides information on knowledge regarding sedentary time and physical activity as well as intervenes on self-efficacy depending on the mindset of participants (non-intender, intender, actor). The second letter focuses on benefits and barriers of physical activity as well as the role of social support for physical activity. In case of actional stage, the third letter intervenes on self-efficacy again and suggests action and coping planning. Otherwise, the letter includes ipsative feedback according to the second letter.</description>
