  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Research has shown that mental health care (MHC) providers differ significantly in their
      ability to help patients. In addition, providers demonstrate different patterns of
      effectiveness across symptom and functioning domains. For example, some providers are
      reliably effective in treating numerous patients and problem domains, others are reliably
      effective in some domains (e.g., depression, substance abuse) yet appear to struggle in
      others (e.g., anxiety, social functioning), and some are reliably ineffective, or even
      harmful, across patients and domains. Knowledge of these provider differences is based
      largely on patient-reported outcomes collected in routine MHC settings.

      Unfortunately, provider performance information is not systematically used to refer or assign
      a particular patient to a scientifically based best-matched provider. MHC systems continue to
      rely on random or purely pragmatic case assignment and referral, which significantly &quot;waters
      down&quot; the odds of a patient being assigned/referred to a high performing provider in the
      patient's area(s) of need, and increases the risk of being assigned/referred to a provider
      who may have a track record of ineffectiveness. This research aims to solve the existing
      non-patient-centered provider-matching problem.

      Specifically, the investigators aim to demonstrate the comparative effectiveness of a
      scientifically-based patient-provider match system compared to status quo pragmatic case
      assignment. The investigators expect in the scientific match group significantly better
      treatment outcomes (e.g., symptoms, quality of life) and higher patient satisfaction with
      treatment. The investigators also expect to demonstrate feasibility of implementing a
      scientific match process in a community MHC system and broad dissemination of the easily
      replicated scientific match technology in diverse health care settings. The importance of
      this work for patients cannot be understated. Far too many patients struggle to find the
      right provider, which unnecessarily prolongs suffering and promotes health care system
      inefficiency. A scientific match system based on routine outcome data uses patient-generated
      information to direct this patient to this provider in this setting. In addition, when based
      on multidimensional assessment, it allows a wide variety of patient-centered outcomes to be
      represented (e.g., symptom domains, functioning domains, quality of life).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Background and Significance:

      Mental illness is an extraordinary and highly burdensome public health problem.
      Unfortunately, even for individuals who access mental health care (MHC), the care is too
      often substandard. Research has consistently demonstrated that approximately 10-15% of
      patients will deteriorate or experience harm during treatment. Further, when these rates are
      combined with no-change rates, only 40% or less of patients meaningfully recover.
      Importantly, treatment research has illuminated substantial variability in providers'
      outcomes. Simply put, the MHC provider impacts treatment outcomes, and stakeholders lack
      systematic access to valid and actionable information to optimize effective patient-provider
      matches. Without collecting and disseminating performance data, stakeholders lack vital
      information on which to base health care choices and personalize treatment. Conversely, there
      potentially is immense advantage to matching patients to providers based on scientific
      outcome data. Patients, stakeholders, researchers, and clinicians have all endorsed such
      applied knowledge transfer as a high priority. In response, the investigators have developed
      and piloted a technology to test this match concept and patient-centered health model.

      Prominent health care agencies have placed outcome/performance measurement at the center of
      core initiatives. The Institute of Medicine specifically recommends integrating provider
      performance data in treatment decision-making. Despite this rhetoric, 2 Cochrane Reviews
      combined could only identify 4 studies that addressed this question with minimal methodology
      standards; the results were mixed. Importantly, none involved a targeted dissemination
      intervention, and none involved MHC. Previous research, including our own, has empirically
      demonstrated substantial differences in projected treatment effect sizes depending on to
      which therapist a patient is referred. The key evidence gap is the need for a rigorous test
      of the effectiveness of a targeted MHC provider-performance dissemination intervention
      compared to standard/pragmatic referral and case assignment. Relatedly, PCORI has called for
      increased &quot;precision&quot; or &quot;personalized&quot; treatment, with a focus on tailoring. The match
      algorithm responds directly to this high priority call to customize care in a personal and
      evidence-based way.

      Study Aims:

      The aim of this CER is to test the effectiveness of an innovative, scientifically informed
      patient-therapist referral match algorithm based on MHC provider outcome data. The
      investigators will employ a randomized controlled trial (RCT) to compare the match algorithm
      with the commonplace pragmatic referral matching (based on provider availability,
      convenience, or self-reported specialty). Psychosocial treatment itself will remain
      naturalistically administered by varied providers (e.g., psychologists, social workers) to
      patients with complex mental health concerns within a partner clinic network, Psychological
      and Behavioral Consultants (PsychBC). The investigators hypothesize that the scientific match
      group will outperform the pragmatic match group in decreasing patient symptoms and treatment
      dropout, and in promoting patient functional outcomes, outcome expectations, and care
      satisfaction, as well as patient-therapist alliance quality. Doing so will establish the
      match algorithm as a mechanism of effective patient-centered MHC.

      Study Description:

      The investigators will compare the effectiveness of naturalistic MHC either with or without
      the scientific matching aid with a double blind, individual level RCT. The investigators will
      first conduct a baseline assessment of PsychBC therapists' (N=44) performance (across at
      least 15 cases) to determine their strengths in treating 12 behavioral health domains
      measured by the primary outcome measure on which our match algorithm is based: the Treatment
      Outcome Package (TOP). TOP is already administered routinely in our partner network. Based on
      years of predictive analytic research, this tool classifies therapists as &quot;effective,&quot;
      &quot;unclassifiable/ineffective,&quot; or &quot;harmful&quot; for each TOP domain. The blinded therapists will
      be crossed over conditions.

      A research assistant will assess at baseline new adult patients (N = 264, 6 per therapist,
      based on our power analysis) referred from mental health or primary care providers. The only
      patient exclusion criterion will be people who are not the primary decision-maker for their
      care. Thus, patients will present with a multitude of problems across a spectrum of
      diagnoses. In addition to a diagnostic interview and relevant measures of the dependent
      variables and demographic characteristics, the baseline assessment will include risk-adjusted
      TOP scores that will inform experimental group matching. Next, patients will be randomly
      assigned to the match group or the no scientific match group. Treatment outcome will be
      assessed regularly through mutual termination or up to 16 weeks. Ancillary assessments will
      include self- and clinician-rated global distress, therapeutic alliance quality, patient
      outcome expectations, treatment dropout, and patient satisfaction. Primary analyses will
      involve hierarchical linear modeling to examine comparative rates and patterns of change on
      the outcomes.

      Although performance measurement has existed for decades and some research has begun to
      explore the impact of disseminating provider performance data on health care outcomes, it has
      (a) rarely employed a RCT design, (b) typically focused on correlating passive dissemination
      with distal systems-level outcomes, and (c) only been conducted outside of MHC. This research
      will address these limitations by investigating the comparative effectiveness of using MHC
      provider outcomes to inform the assignment/referral of this patient to this scientifically
      matched psychotherapist. This comparator is ideal because it represents the status quo where
      virtually no attempt is made to use scientific data to match specific patients with specific
      therapists who have a proven track record in the patient's area(s) of need.

    <measure>Treatment Outcome Package (TOP; Kraus, Seligman, &amp; Jordan, 2005)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 36 months</time_frame>
    <description>The TOP-CS consists of 58 items assessing 12 symptom and functional (including strengths) domains (risk-adjusted for case mix variables assessed via 37 items on the companion TOP-CM, such as divorce, job loss, comorbidity): work functioning, sexual functioning, social conflict, depression, panic (somatic anxiety), psychosis, suicidal ideation, violence, mania, sleep, substance abuse, and quality of life. Global symptom severity is assessed by summing all items or by averaging the z-scores (i.e., standard deviation units relative to the general population mean) across each of the 12 clinical scales. Domain-specific symptom severity is quantified as the individual z-scores for each clinical scale using general population means and standard deviations for the conversion.</description>

    <time_frame>Up to 36 months</time_frame>
    <description>To evaluate outcome with an index separate from the TOP (to test convergence and enhance the validity of any between condition effects), we will also assess global distress with the Symptom Checklist-10 (SCL-10; Rosen, Drescher, Moos, &amp; Gusman, 1999), a 10-item, well validated and widely used self-report inventory that assesses psychological wellbeing.</description>

    <measure>Existential Isolation Scale (EIS; Pinel et al., 2014).</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 36 months</time_frame>
    <description>To assess this isolation subtype, participants will complete the EIS, a six-item scale that requires participants to rate the extent to which they agree with items such as &quot;I often have the same reactions to things as other people around me do&quot; (reverse-coded) and &quot;Other people usually do not understand my experiences&quot; and &quot;People often have the same 'take' or perspective on things that I do&quot; (reverse-coded). Participants respond using a 7-point scale. The EIS has high internal consistency, and has been validated extensively (Pinel et al., 2014).</description>

    <measure>Inventory of Interpersonal Problems-32 (IIP-32; Horowitz, Alden, Wiggins, &amp; Pincus, 2000)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 36 months</time_frame>
    <description>To assess interpersonal problems, participants will complete the 32-item circumplex version of the Inventory of Interpersonal Problems (IIP-32). This widely used instrument reflects interpersonal inhibitions and excesses, with each item rated on a 5-point scale. Higher total scores indicate more interpersonal problems. The IIP-32 also has 8 subscales (Domineering, Vindictive, Intrusive, Cold, Socially Inhibited, Nonassertive, Overly Accommodating, and Self-Sacrificing) that comprise a circumplex of problematic interpersonal behavior around the main interpersonal dimensions of affiliation and control. Like the original measure (Horowitz, Rosenberg, Baer, Ureno, &amp; Villansenor, 1988), the IIP-32 has evidenced good psychometric properties.</description>

    <measure>Working Alliance Inventory—Short Form, patient version (WAI-SF-P; Tracey, &amp; Kokotovic, 1989)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 36 months</time_frame>
    <description>The WAI is the most widely used alliance measure, assessing patient-therapist agreement on the goals and tasks of treatment, and the quality of their relational bond. This 12-item short form, assessing these dimensions from the patient's perspective, has demonstrated sound psychometric properties.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Credibility/Expectancy Scale (CEQ; Devilly, &amp; Borkovec, 2000)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 36 months</time_frame>
    <description>The CEQ is the most widely used and psychometrically sound measure of the patient's perceived logicalness of a given treatment and expectation for the personal efficacy of that treatment. Scales range from 1-9 or 0-100%, with higher ratings indicating greater confidence in the treatment.</description>

    <description>Consecutive consenting patients at each site will be randomly assigned to condition. The project coordinator, unaware of therapist baseline performance, will generate the randomization sequences using an online random generator. Therapists will be crossed—that is, some of their cases will be matched, while others will be non-matched. Within condition, patients will be assigned sequentially to the site-specific therapists until therapists reach their study quota. In the low probability event that there is no therapist meeting minimal match criteria for a patient in the match condition, that patient will be removed from the study protocol (though will, of course, still receive treatment) and replaced with the next patient where a match does exist (this will also be carefully tracked).</description>
