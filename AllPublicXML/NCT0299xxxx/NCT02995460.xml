  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Psoriatic arthritis is a chronical inflammatory disease characterized by pain and reduced
      physical function. Patients have a higher risk of cardiovascular disease and a higher body
      mass index.

      A pilot study in patients with rheumatoid arthritis has shown positive effect on inflammation
      after 12 weeks of high-intensity interval training.

      The primary aim of this study is to determine whether high-intensity interval training
      affects the disease activity in psoriatic arthritis. This intervention is believed to result
      in benefits in terms of inflammation, body composition and risk factors for cardiovascular
      disease.
