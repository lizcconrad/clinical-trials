  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the proportion of patients who could withdraw from
      prednisone and hydrocortisone one year after a progressive decrease of GC (GC tapering) or a
      hydrocortisone replacement therapy in rheumatoid arthritis in remission or low disease
      activity.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      French multicenter double-blind controlled parallel-group randomized clinical trial Phase IV
      assessing whether a hydrocortisone replacement therapy could increase the success rate of GC
      withdrawal at one year, in patients with Rheumatoid Arthritis in low disease activity or
      remission, in comparison to progressive decrease of GC (GC tapering).

    <description>&quot;GC tapering group&quot;: patients will be asked to taper prednisone taken every morning at 8.00 AM by decreasing the daily dose by 1 mg every month as soon as they are in remission or Low Disease Activity (LDA). In addition they will receive a placebo of 20 mg/day of hydrocortisone (10 mg at 8.00 AM, 10 mg at 12.00 AM) for 3 months then 10 mg/day (at 8.00 AM) of hydrocortisone placebo for 3 months before discontinuing the hydrocortisone placebo.</description>

    <description>After inclusion in the study, the first part is an open follow-up period where all patients will receive 5 mg of prednisone daily for one month. After one month, if patients still have a DAS28 ≤3.2, they will be randomized into two arms: Group 1: &quot;GC tapering group&quot; / Group 2: &quot;Hydrocortisone replacement group&quot;.
After randomisation, there are four scheduled visits: M4, M7, M9 and M12. Patients withdrawing from GC therapy will be instructed, that if they start feeling unwell during or after the GC tapering protocol they should not taper the steroid dose any further, but contact the centre responsible for the protocol. If GC induced adrenal insufficiency is confirmed or strongly suspected, GC replacement will be secured using hydrocortisone.</description>
