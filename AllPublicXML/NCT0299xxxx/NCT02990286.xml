    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to evaluate the efficacy on lung function 6 months after one
      course of rituximab (2 infusions) and mycophénolate mofétil (MMF) treatment compared to one
      course of placebo and 6 months of MMF treatment in a broad range of patients with
      Interstitial Lung Diseases (ILD) non-responders to a first line immunosuppressive treatment.

    <measure>Change in FVC in % of predicted</measure>
    <time_frame>From baseline to 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Change in FVC (in % of predicted) since declines in FVC correlates with increased risk of subsequent mortality in ILD patients and FVC is one of the core set of outcomes defined in interstitial lung diseases. Data obtained from the two groups of patients (rituximab and placebo) will be compared to each other. FVC will be performed in each study center in a standardized manner according to the ATS/ERS recommendations and ECCS reference equations</description>

    <measure>Progression Free Survival (PFS).</measure>
    <time_frame>PFS measured at 3, 6 and 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>PFS is defined as the time 1) to the first acute exacerbation, or 2) to an absolute decline of 10 % points in the percentage of the predicted FVC, or 3) to the necessity to withdraw the MMF with/without a new immunosuppressive treatment (except corticoids), or 4) to death or 5) registration to a lung transplantation list. An acute exacerbation is defined by (1) progressive dyspnea over 1 month or less; (2) new pulmonary infiltrates on chest radiography or computed tomography, and (3) the absence of an overt underlying cause of rapid deterioration</description>
