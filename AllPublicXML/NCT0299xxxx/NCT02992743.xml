  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is for men and women who have a type of sarcoma that has returned after being
      treated, or that cannot be surgically removed. The specific type of sarcoma is Myxoid / Round
      Cell Liposarcoma, also known as High Grade Myxoid Liposarcoma.

      In addition to this disease patients must also have the tissue type HLA-A*02:01, HLA-A*02:05
      or HLA-A*02:06, and a sample of tumor tissue must test positive for the NY-ESO-1 protein.

      The study treatment is made from some of the patient's own white blood cells called T cells.
      T cells are collected from the patient and sent to a laboratory to be genetically modified,
      with the aim that they will be able to destroy the cancer cells.

      Manufacturing the T cells takes about 1 month to complete. The T cells will be given back to
      the patient by an intravenous infusion. The purpose of this study is to test whether the T
      cells have an effect on the cancer and to test whether the treatment can be given safely to
      patients with this disease.

    <textblock>
      This is an open label pilot study of gene modified autologous T cells for the treatment of
      advanced myxoid/ round cell liposarcoma or high-grade myxoid liposarcoma.

      Subjects with the HLA-A*02:01, HLA-A*02:05 and/or HLA-A*02:06 allele, whose tumor expresses
      the NY-ESO-1 antigen and who meet study entry criteria will be eligible for enrollment.
      Following enrollment, subjects will undergo leukapheresis for collection of autologous cells
      for processing and manufacture into the NY-ESO-1ᶜ²⁵⁹T cell investigational product.

      Once the NY-ESO-1ᶜ²⁵⁹T cells have been manufactured subjects will receive lymphodepleting
      chemotherapy with fludarabine and cyclophosphamide on Days -7 to -5 and NY-ESO-1ᶜ²⁵⁹T cells
      by a single intravenous infusion on Day 1. Dose range is 1 x 10⁹ - 8 x 10⁹ transduced cells.
      Subjects will complete the interventional phase of the study upon confirmation of disease
      progression.
