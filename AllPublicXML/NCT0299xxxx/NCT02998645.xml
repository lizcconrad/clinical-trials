  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a two-part study, interventional Phase II, single-arm, multicenter, open-label study
      to investigate the efficacy and safety of a combination regimen of eltrombopag and
      cyclosporine in patients with severe aplastic anemia (SAA) as first line therapy and an
      extension with up to 60-months follow-up. All patients will receive eltrombopag for 6 months
      with cyclosporine. Patients who respond (who had overall hematologic response by 6 months)
      will continue tapering down cyclosporine for up to 30 months and will be followed up for a
      post-treatment follow-up up to 60 months by regular clinic visits. Patients who do not have
      an overall hematologic response (non-responders) by the end of 6 month time point will be
      discontinued from the treatment and will be followed up for non-responder post-treatment
      follow-up up to 60 months.

      The usage of eltrombopag and cyclosporine combines two therapies with different modes of
      action. Cyclosporine acts as an immunosuppressant and eltrombopag acts as a stimulator of
      bone marrow progenitor cells. Given that SAA is currently viewed as having an autoimmune
      pathogenesis resulting in bone marrow progenitor cell destruction, the combination of
      eltrombopag and cyclosporine is attractive. Preliminary experience with their combined use
      appears favorable, with no untoward toxicity observed to date.
