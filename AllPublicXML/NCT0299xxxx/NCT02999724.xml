    <textblock>
      Gabapentin is a medication used primarily to treat seizures and pain. Studies have shown that
      this medication can help reduce pain after surgery, including hysterectomy, where the uterus
      or &quot;womb&quot; is removed. Opioids are the first choice for pain medication administered after
      surgery, but carry significant side effects. Several studies have demonstrated that if
      patients are given gabapentin before surgery, they require less opioids after surgery.
      However, there have not been any studies examining gabapentin's effects on post-operative
      pain in urogynecologic surgery, which treats pelvic organ prolapse and urinary incontinence.
      Pelvic organ prolapse occurs when female pelvic floor supports have weakened and therefore
      patients experience a &quot;bulge&quot; or &quot;pressure&quot; in the vagina. Patients with these conditions are
      typically offered medical treatments, but some may require surgery, and this usually consists
      of vaginal hysterectomy, pelvic floor repair, and a mid-urethral sling to treat any
      concurrent urinary incontinence. Our study aims to look at the effect of gabapentin given to
      patients undergoing urogynecologic surgery on their pain levels after surgery, including the
      amount of opioid pain medication required. We hypothesize that the patients who receive
      gabapentin before surgery will require significantly less opioids.

      Over a six-month period, patients seen in Urogynecology clinics will be invited to
      participate in the study. Women who are already on gabapentin for other reasons, have an
      allergy to gabapentin, have a reason they cannot take gabapentin, or who cannot understand
      spoken English will be excluded from the study. After providing informed consent, they will
      be randomized to either receive gabapentin or a placebo pill. They will receive the standard
      surgical care, including the usual anesthesia for surgery and routine pain medications
      available after surgery. We will then compare the differences in opioid consumption in the
      first 24 hours after surgery as well as the time from the end of surgery to leaving to the
      recovery room and the length of recovery room stay between the gabapentin and placebo groups.
      We will also analyze the differences in anxiety, drowsiness, pain, and nausea as rated by the
      patients in each group.

      This study will be a randomized double blinded placebo controlled trial. All women presenting
      to Mount Sinai Hospital eligible for surgery with pelvic organ prolapse symptoms requiring
      hysterectomy with other pelvic reconstruction (repair of cystocele and/or rectocele, with or
      without TVT) will be provided with a written informed consent to be randomized to either
      receiving pre-operative gabapentin single dose or placebo 2 hours prior to surgery. The
      single dose of gabapentin will be 600 mg for patients under 65 years old and 300 mg for those
      65 years old and above. All patients will have pre-operative assessment according to the
      usual routine that will include urogynecological history taking, physical examination,
      urodynamic testing and blood work. Urodynamic testing will include measurement of the
      post-void residual by urethral catheterization or bladder scan, uroflowmetry, a filling
      cystometrogram and urethral pressure profilometry. Medication and placebo will be prepared by
      the hospital pharmacy to look alike to blind staff and patients. Medication or placebo will
      be given with other pre-anesthesia medications such as celecoxib and acetaminophen according
      to usual protocol. Routine peri-operative surgical/anesthesia management will be unchanged
      from the usual care. Post-operative pain score will be measured using a visual analogue scale
      (VAS) from 1 to 10. Total Opioids use during the first 24 hours after surgery will be
      calculated from patients' paper and electronic chart, and conversion will be made to morphine
      equivalents.
