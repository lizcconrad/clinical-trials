  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the proposed pilot study is to assess the implementation of IPP-HPV
      immunization at Yale New Haven Hospital (YNHH) and to identify potential barriers to and
      facilitators of this intervention to optimize its feasibility and effectiveness. It is
      imperative that innovative interventions be developed to achieve comprehensive utilization of
      this highly effective vaccine to reduce rates of HPV infection, lower rates of cervical and
      other HPV associated cancers, and address cancer disparities.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Administration of the HPV vaccine during the inpatient postpartum hospital stay has the
      potential to be an innovative intervention to improve HPV immunization rates. Following onset
      of pregnancy, the postpartum period becomes the next available opportunity to immunize with
      the HPV vaccine, which is safe in breastfeeding women. The benefits of such an intervention
      include a focus on women engaged with the health care system who are often highly motivated
      to invest in their personal health.

      Specific Aims Aim 1: To evaluate receptivity and concerns of postpartum women with receiving
      the HPV vaccine during the inpatient postpartum admission as part of the Inpatient Postpartum
      HPV Immunization Quality Improvement Program (IPP-HPV).

      Aim 2: To evaluate receptivity and concerns of healthcare providers with inpatient postpartum
      HPV immunization as part of IPP-HPV and to identify facilitators of and barriers to its
      implementation.

      Aim 3: To assess the uptake and effectiveness of a Pilot Quality Improvement Program to
      increase HPV vaccine uptake (IPP-HPV) for Yale New Haven Hospital (YNHH) Women's Center and
      Center for Women's Health and Midwifery (CWHM) postpartum patients ≤ 26 years of age who
      deliver at YNHH York Street Campus (YSC) or Saint Raphael Campus (SRC).

    <description>We will conduct in-person, in-depth interviews prior to discharge home from the postpartum hospitalization. If an in-person interview prior to discharge is not possible, we will conduct an in-person interview at the 6-week postpartum visit. We will conduct interviews using a semi-structured guide with questions based on Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR) constructs. We will analyze transcripts and determine common themes and priority domains. Standard analytic methods for qualitative data will be employed. A codebook will be developed based on deductive (theory-driven) constructs from the interview guide and applied to a subset of transcripts.</description>

    <description>The program coordinator (PC) will screen electronic medical records of Women's Center patients admitted to the inpatient postpartum service for IPP-HPV eligibility: women ≤ 26 years of age who have not received all 3 doses.
Nurses and providers in the Women's Center will be encouraged to discuss the HPV vaccine during prenatal care and recommend postpartum immunization to vaccine eligible women.
All patients will be provided with a Vaccine Information Sheet as is required by law. A postpartum nurse will then administer the HPV vaccine as routine care prior to discharge (unless the patient refuses). A postpartum provider will be available to answer any questions or concerns as needed.</description>
