      Asthma exacerbations account for a significant morbidity and disproportionate health care
      costs. However, there is no currently available biomarker or lung function parameter that can
      accurately predict the risk of future exacerbations. The current work aims at evaluating the
      resting ventilatory flow by applying a new technique called anharmonic morphological analysis
      of the respiratory signals (AMARS). We hypothesize that monitoring AMARS is potentially able
      to detect an increased risk of asthma exacerbations.

    <textblock>
      Asthma exacerbations represent an acute or sub-acute worsening in symptoms and lung function
      from the patient's usual status. Early detection of exacerbations is a major public health
      issue. In clinic, management of asthma involves asthma control questionnaires and pulmonary
      function tests (Forced Expiratory Volume (FEV1), Fractional exhaled nitric oxide or FeNO). At
      home, the peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR) measured by the peak flow meter is an aid to
      monitor asthma but its ability to predict asthma exacerbations remains controversial.
      Anharmonic morphological analysis of the respiratory signals (AMARS) is a new
      morpho-mathematic biomarker that produces objective and accurate measures of the shape of the
      ventilatory flow. The current study aims at monitoring the resting spontaneous breathing at
      home in asthmatics. Changes in AMARS may be a predictor of early symptoms of asthma
      exacerbations. We will recruit 120 asthmatic patients. Patients will be given a portable
      device for telemonitoring. Resting spontaneous breathing will be measured during 2-3 min in
      the morning and in the evening, twice a week at least for 12 months. Three visits will be
      scheduled in Clinical Investigation Center before (V1), after 6-month (V2) and 12-month (V3)
      telemonitoring period.
