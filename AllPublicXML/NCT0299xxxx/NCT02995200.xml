      A pilot study, the purpose of which is to use accelerometers to quantify UE use (1 and two
      hand use) in healthy controls and people post-stroke from which the investigators will
      develop use-based feedback to improve recovery in the home setting. The objectives of this
      pilot study are to:

      i.) determine the feasibility of using accelerometers to quantify amount of UE use in the
      home setting in healthy individuals and individuals chronic post-stroke,

      ii.) quantify and compare the unilateral activity of the weaker (paretic) versus stronger
      (non-paretic) UEs,

      iii.) quantify and compare amount of UE use in healthy controls to that of people chronic
      post-stroke (side matched unimanual use for each arm and bilateral use) in the home, and

      iv.) assess the effect of a few sessions of in-home accelerometer used-based feedback on
      unilateral and bilateral UE use.

      v.) assess kinematic, kinetic, and EMG data during UE movements bilaterally and between
      healthy controls and subjects post-chronic stroke pre and post feedback (for the people after
      stroke).

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Healthy Adults: 40-100 years old, able to follow 2-step commands, able to comply with
             experimental protocol, living in a home setting, full active range of motion (AROM) in
             both shoulders and elbows for their age group.

          -  Individuals Post-stroke: Able to follow 2-step commands, 40 - 100 years old, community
             dwelling with or without assistance, no upper extremity (UE) injury within the last 3
             months, at least 30 degrees of flexion AROM (with or without assistance) and PROM in
             shoulder and elbow in or out of synergy, intact superficial light touch sensation in
             both UEs, and at least 6 months post ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke that is either
             cortical, subcortical or in the cerebellum. It does not need to be their first and
             only stroke.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Healthy Adults: Injury of either UE within the last 3 months and unable to follow
             commands related to the accelerometer use/protocol.

          -  Individuals Post-stroke: Unable to follow 2 step commands, inability to adhere to
             study requirements, any neurological diagnosis other than stroke (i.e. Parkinson's
             Disease, Multiple Sclerosis, etc.), and aphasia limiting their ability to complete the
             MoCA and Stroke Impact Scale (SIS) questions.
