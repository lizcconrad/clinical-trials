      The objective of LMS04 study is to better define the treatment strategy for patients with
      metastatic leiomyosarcoma (uterine or soft tissue), as well as identifying the best first
      line therapeutic option for these patients. LMS04 will test a new strategy for first line
      therapy LMS sarcoma compare to the reference therapy (6 cycles of doxorubicin alone): the
      interest of the association of trabectedin to doxorubicin in first line treatment followed by
      trabectedin alone for non-progressive patients after 6 cycles of the association of
      trabectedin and doxorubicin (the LMS02 design).

      LMS04 will be the first phase III randomized study specifically dedicated to soft tissue
      leiomyosarcoma in first line metastatic disease.

      It is planned to compare a new doxorubicin combination (including trabectedin) with very
      encouraging results followed by trabectedin maintenance therapy for non-progressive patients
      to doxorubicin alone. Prospective ancillary translational studies will attempt to define
      profiles of patients who could benefit from this new chemotherapy in an exploratory way.

      The validation of a new first line option specific for LMS, identifying clinical factors that
      characterize aggressiveness and responsiveness to treatment aims to have an important in the
      spirit of personalized medicine in this rare and deadly disease.
