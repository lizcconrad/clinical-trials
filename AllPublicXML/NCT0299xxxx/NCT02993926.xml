  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the long-term safety and efficacy of leuprorelin in
      the treatment of CPP (of at least 9 months of ENANTONE) in Chinese participants.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The drug being evaluated in this study is called leuprorelin. Leuprorelin is used to treat
      children who have CPP. This study will look at long term safety and efficacy of leuprorelin
      in the treatment of Chinese participants with CPP.

      The study will enroll approximately 300 participants.

      All participants who have received leuprorelin 30 mcg/kg to &lt;90 mcg/kg or 90 mcg/kg to 180
      mcg/kg per body weight, injection, subcutaneously, every 4 weeks up to at least 9 continuous
      months during the index period from September 1st 1998 to September 30th 2018 will be
      observed.

      This multi-center trial will be conducted in China. Data will be collected over period of 20
      months.

    <description>An Adverse Event (AE) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation participant administered a drug; it does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (example, a clinically significant abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a drug, whether or not it is considered related to the drug. A TEAE is defined as an adverse event with an onset that occurs after receiving study drug. An SAE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence or effect that at any dose results in death, is life-threatening, requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity, is a congenital anomaly/birth defect or is medically important due to other reasons than the above mentioned criteria.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Has diagnosis of idiopathic CPP.

          2. Has been treated with leuprorelin acetate (Enantone) for at least 9 continuous months
             of therapy with either a stable dose of high dose (greater than or equal to [&gt;=] 90
             mcg/kg up to 180 mcg/kg) or low dose (&lt; 90 mcg/kg down to 30 mcg/kg).

          3. Has initiated and completed treatment during the index period from September 1st 1998
             to September 30th 2018.

          4. Have the following information prior to initiation of enantone and at least one record
             of each of the following parameters at the end of enantone treatment in the medical
             records: Tanner staging, estradiol or testosterone level, and FSH and LH level. The
             participant should have at least one record of bone age prior to the intitiation
             gonadotropin releasing hormone analogs (GnRHa) therapy with enantone to support the
             diagnosis of CPP. In addition, should have at least one record of bone age during
             treatment with enantone.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Has been treated with leuprorelin acetate or any other GnRHa for conditions other than
             CPP.

          2. Has used any other GnRHa products for CPP treatment prior to initiation of enantone
             therapy.

          3. CPP participants with identified etiology, such as brain tumor or cranial irradiation.
