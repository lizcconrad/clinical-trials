  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The effectiveness of thalidomide in treating inflammatory bowel disease has been widely
      recognized. Meanwhile, many serious adverse drug reactions were notified， but no reports on
      ovarian reserve function.Therefore, this study was to investigate the influence of
      thalidomide on function of ovarian reserve.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      It will be divided two groups of patients according to the treatment itself . One group was
      treated by thalidomide, the other was other treatment excluding. It will detect the function
      of ovarian reserve before and after treatment in both two groups, to investigate the
      influence of thalidomide on function of ovarian reserve.

    <description>Anti-mullerian hormone（AMH）, as an important index to monitor the function of ovarian reserve, is majorly secreted by preantral follicles and antral follicles without fluctuation during menstrual cycle, not affected by hormone, and its change is earlier than sex hormone.</description>
