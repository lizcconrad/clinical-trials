  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      RSA is a multifactorial disorder resulting from genetic factors, anatomic factors, autoimmune
      disorders, endocrine dysfunction, thrombophilia, life style factors, and maternal infections.
      However, the underlying causes remain undetermined in up to 50% of cases. In this clinical
      cohort study, we intended to get an epidemiological evidence for patients with recurrent
      spontaneous abortion associated with thrombophilla.
