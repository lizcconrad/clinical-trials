  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The KAPPa project has the aim to create an international database in which information about
      clinical features, therapeutic management, burden of illness and costs of severe and moderate
      haemophilia A patients from different countries and sites is collected. The aim of this
      project is to analyse the influence of such different characteristics on medical,
      psychosocial and economic outcomes in patients over the long-term.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      1000 patients with hemophilia A will be enrolled using a webbased registry. Key quality
      factors that will be registered are : hemophilia joint Health score (HJHS), annual bleed
      rate, quality of Life (EQ5D), as well as dosing of replacement therapy.
