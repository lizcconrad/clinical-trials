  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In recent years in the U.S., problems associated with opioid prescriptions, including
      non-medical use and overdose, increased to historically unprecedented levels and represent a
      public health crisis. Emergency departments (EDs) play an important role in opioid
      prescribing, particularly to individuals at high risk for adverse opioid-related outcomes.
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether a new mobile health (mhealth) intervention
      can assist people in the safe use of opioid analgesic (OA) medications after leaving the
      emergency department (ED).

      The specific aims of this project are to: (1) adapt and enhance an existing motivational
      intervention to decrease non-medical opioid use after an ED visit by optimizing intervention
      intensity and duration through reinforcement learning (RL); (2) examine the impact of an
      RL-supported intervention on non-medical opioid use level during the six months post-ED
      visit; and (3) examine the impact of the RL intervention on the opioid-related behaviors and
      adverse outcomes of driving after opioid use, overdose risk behaviors, and subsequent
      opioid-related ED visits. The secondary aims of this project are to: (SA1) examine whether
      baseline level of non-medical opioid use moderates the effects of the intervention; and (SA2)
      understand barriers and facilitators of implementation of the intervention based on
      qualitative interviews with ED patients.

      The proposed study will test the efficacy of an interactive voice response (IVR) and
      reinforcement learning (RL) supported motivational intervention delivered after an emergency
      department (ED) visit to participants with recent non-medical OA use who receive an OA in the
      ED or who are prescribed an OA at ED discharge, compared to enhanced usual care (EUC). In the
      intervention condition, IVR calls will ask participants to report information about their
      health and medications using their touch-tone phone, and based on their responses they may
      receive brief or extended motivational messages during the IVR call, or they may be assigned
      to receive a 20 minute motivational enhancement session with a study therapist over the
      phone. Because the most helpful intensity of intervention is unknown and likely to vary
      between patients, the project will use an artificial intelligence strategy called
      reinforcement learning (RL). The RL system will continuously &quot;learn&quot; from the success of
      prior actions in similar situations with similar patients in order to select the action most
      likely to reduce non-medical opioid use for each participant during each call.

      The proposed study will screen ~ 5,600 ED patients to enroll 600 ED participants in the
      randomized controlled trial (RCT). Participants will be randomized to the intervention
      condition (n=300) or to EUC (n=300). All participants will be re-assessed at 1, 3 and 6
      months post-ED visit for level of non-medical OA use and related outcomes. The RCT will be
      complemented by qualitative interviews to inform later implementation.
