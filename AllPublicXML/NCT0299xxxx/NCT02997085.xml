  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Virtual Reality (VR) is one non-pharmacological method that has shown promise as an effective
      means of decreasing pain levels following treatment, and for significant periods of time.
      Additionally, neurobiology studies of VR have demonstrated a decrease in brain activity
      associated with pain. While VR is clearly a promising, drug-free option for pain treatment,
      existing VR systems are expensive and use unconvincing graphics. Recent advances in VR
      technology (i.e., improved realism and immersion using 360-degree 3D technology and more
      affordable delivery systems) allow the development of more realistic and more cost-effective
      applications. Capitalizing on these advances and the investigators' experiences with VR
      intervention development and evaluation, the current study will test a state-of-the-art VR
      experience in pain management intervention (Live-Action 360° Video Virtual Reality(VVR)) and
      compare it to established standard computer generated imagery (CGI) 360° VVR content for pain
      management intervention in a medical setting. The participant's participation will help the
      investigators determine which VR intervention is most effective in reducing acute pain in
      hospital patients.

    <description>360° Video Virtual Reality (VVR) is made by filming with multiple HD cameras carefully arranged to capture all angles in a 360° area of a live action event. Then those angles are stitched together in post-production into a 360-degree texture sphere and the sphere is then mapped to the head tracker on the users head mounted display (HMD). Leading to the effect that when a user turns his head, the user's view of the live action video footage turns with them in real time allowing the user to look around anywhere in the 360 degrees of filmed footage of the live action event. Participants randomized to the Live-Action 360° VVR group will be outfitted with a Samsung Gear VR HMD and will view a 9-minute live-action 360° VVR video. The 9 minutes of footage will be alternating 30 second clips of central Texas locations.</description>

    <description>Participants randomized to the CGI 360° VVR condition will also be outfitted with a Samsung Gear VR head mounted display. Participants will view the same content for the same duration as in the Live-Action 360° VVR condition, but the footage will be animated instead of live-action footage.</description>
