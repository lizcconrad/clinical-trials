      -  The investigators evaluated the role of allopurinol in prevention of post-ERCP
           pancreatitis.

        -  100 Egyptian patients who were candidates for ERCP were included and divided into two
           groups. Group 1 (study group) included 50 patients who received two doses of allopurinol
           300 mg each, 15 hours and 3 hours before ERCP and Group 2 (control group) included 50
           patients who did not receive allopurinol prophylaxis.

      A diagnosis of procedure-related pancreatitis was based on an increased serum amylase level
      greater than three times the upper normal limits, associated with abdominal pain requiring
      analgesics and persisting for at least 24 hours after the procedure.
