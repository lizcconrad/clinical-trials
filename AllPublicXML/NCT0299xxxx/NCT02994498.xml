      The primary study objectives are

        1. to evaluate the safety and tolerability profiles of DCB-BO1301 and to determine the
           maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of DCB-BO1301 as add-on therapy to dacarbazine in subjects
           with advanced melanoma (Phase I)

        2. to evaluate the efficacy profile of DCB-BO1301 at MTD or lower dose level as add-on
           therapy to dacarbazine in subjects with advanced melanoma in terms of progression free
           survival (Phase IIa)
