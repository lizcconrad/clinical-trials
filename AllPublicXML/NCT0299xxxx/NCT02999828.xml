  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Enterovirus 71 (EV71), a major pathogen causing hand-foot-and-mouth disease (HFMD) worldwide,
      is a member of the Human Enterovirus species A, family Picornaviridae. Its infection
      occasionally leads to severe diseases and death, with central nervous system (CNS) damage.

      Recently, except of inactivated vaccine, several EV71 vaccine candidates have been evaluated
      in animals but no final results of clinical trials, such as attenuated vaccine, subunit
      vaccine.

      A formalin-inactivated EV71 vaccine (Human Diploid cell, KMB-17 Cell) has been finished phase
      I, II and III clinical trials and licensed by SFDA in China at Dec. 3, 2015. Based on the
      results of clinical trials, the protective efficacy of inactivated EV71 vaccine is 97%
      against HFMD caused by EV71. The phase IV clinical trial has been carried out from July 2016.
      The purpose of phase IV is to evaluated the safety and efficacy of the inactive EV71 vaccine
      in large scale population of Chinese children (from 6 to 71 months old).

      The purpose of phase IV is to evaluated the safety and efficacy of the inactive EV71 vaccine
      in large scale population of Chinese children (from 6 to 71 months old).

      There are three parts of phase IV clinical trials have been performed. First, to evaluate the
      safety of the inactive EV71 vaccine in large scale population of Chinese children (from 6 to
      71 months old).

      Second, to evaluate the immune persistence of the inactive EV71 vaccine in large scale
      population of Chinese children (from 6 to 71 months old).

      Third, to evaluate the efficacy of the inactive EV71 vaccine in large scale population of
      Chinese children (from 6 to 71 months old).
