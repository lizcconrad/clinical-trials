  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: Women Veterans are the fastest growing segment of Veterans Health Administration
      (VHA) users. This dramatic growth has created challenges for VHA. Gender disparities persist
      in cardiovascular (CV) and diabetes risk factor control, and rates of depression, anxiety,
      and mental health comorbidity are disproportionately high among women Veterans. Furthermore,
      a high rate of women Veterans' attrition from VA care, along with organizational barriers to
      care, substantiate that organizational changes are needed in order to engage and retain women
      Veteran VHA users in evidence-based, patient-centered care.

      Objectives: The Enhancing Mental and Physical health of Women through Engagement and
      Retention (EMPOWER) QUERI addresses VHA Blueprint for Excellence Strategy 6, by advancing
      &quot;personalized, proactive, patient-centered&quot; care models, and Transformational Strategy 7.2.g
      by implementation of innovative care models in women Veterans' health care.&quot; The EMPOWER
      QUERI Program is designed to improve women Veterans' engagement and retention in
      evidence-based care for three high priority health conditions, i.e., prediabetes,
      cardiovascular, and mental health. To achieve this impact goal, we propose a cohesive
      portfolio of projects with the following aims: (1) To use an evidence-based implementation
      strategy that emphasizes local tailoring of care models, multilevel stakeholder engagement,
      and systematic evaluation of complex implementation processes in order to enrich
      organizational capacity for innovations in women Veterans' VHA health care; (2) To implement
      personalized, proactive, patient-centered innovations in VHA women's health that are
      acceptable, feasible, satisfactory, relevant, and effective for both providers and patients,
      thereby encouraging women Veterans' engagement and retention and sustainability of the
      innovations; and, (3) To generate implementation &quot;playbooks&quot; for our partners that are
      scalable and serve as guidance for future implementation of a broader array of evidence-based
      women's health programs and policy.

      Methods: Three projects will be conducted by an experienced multidisciplinary team.
      &quot;Tailoring VA's Diabetes Prevention Program to Women Veterans' Needs&quot; is a one-year QI
      project to be conducted in VA Greater Los Angeles women's health clinics. Women Veterans with
      prediabetes will select an in-person, peer-led or online gender-specific, evidence-based
      diabetes prevention program to address their risk behaviors and health conditions.
      &quot;Facilitating Cardiovascular Risk Screening and Risk Reduction in Women Veterans&quot; will
      increase identification of CV risk among women Veterans, enhance patient/provider
      communication and shared decision-making about CV risk, and provide a supportive, coordinated
      health coaching intervention to facilitate women Veterans' engagement and retention in
      appropriate health services. &quot;Implementation of Tailored Collaborative Care for Women
      Veterans&quot; will evaluate implementation of an evidence-based collaborative care model tailored
      to enhance provider- and system-level capabilities to address women Veterans' anxiety and
      depression treatment needs, thereby improving organizational primary care-mental health
      integration (PC-MHI) effectiveness and women Veterans' engagement and retention in PC-MHI.
      Both implementation research studies will use a modified stepped wedge design and will apply
      the evidence-based Replicating Effective Programs (REP) implementation strategy. Mixed
      methods implementation evaluations will focus on investigating primary implementation
      outcomes of adoption, acceptability, feasibility, and reach. Multilevel stakeholder
      engagement will be prioritized. Program-wide organizational-, provider-, and patient-level
      measures and tools will be utilized to enhance synergy, productivity, and impact. As a
      coherent program of women's health implementation research and quality improvement, the
      proposed EMPOWER QUERI will constitute a major milestone in achieving BPE strategies and
      realizing women Veterans' engagement and, ultimately, empowerment in our VHA system.

    <description>The investigators will use a nonrandomized stepped wedge design to evaluate the implementation in four VA Women's Practice Based Research Network (PBRN) sites. In this nonrandomized stepped wedge design, the intervention is &quot;turned on&quot; when a primary care provider (PCP) uses a CV screening template which maps to the patient CV self-screener. This design relies on sequential roll-out to participating sites over time, while using other sites as controls until they begin implementation. The investigators will use nonrandomized stepped wedges (rather than randomized) given their suitability for studying implementation. The design explicitly considers the timing of implementation spread and addresses the statistical issues introduced by lack of randomization in implementation starts and processes. The investigators will analytically compensate for the design by collecting patient-, provider-, and site-level data that may be associated with timing of the adoption of each intervention.</description>
