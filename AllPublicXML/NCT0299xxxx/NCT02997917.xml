    <textblock>
      The effect of education on the responses to a probe meal (250 mL vegetable soup cooked at low
      temperature and 25 g bread) will be studied in a parallel design. The effects of education
      will be tested in two different groups in random order: real versus sham education. In each
      group the responses to a probe meal will be tested on 2 different days before and after the
      intervention. Participants will be instructed to eat a standard dinner the day before, to
      consume a standard breakfast at home after overnight fast, and to report to the laboratory,
      where the probe meal will be administered 3 h after breakfast. Studies will be conducted in a
      quiet, isolated room with participants sitting on a chair. Perception will be measured at 5
      min intervals 10 min before and 20 min after ingestion and at 10 min intervals up to 60 min
      after the probe meal.

    <description>Solutions of the five basic tastes (sweet, salty, sour, bitter and umami) and the 3 main components of the probe soup (onion, leek and carrot) will be given every 10 min with a mouthwash after each test. In the real education group, solutions at suprathreshold concentration for detection will be given with a subsequent comment on the flavor and an explanation of the components and preparation of the soup (low temperature cooking to preserve flavors).</description>
