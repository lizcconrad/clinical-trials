  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      NIL-2 is a clinical trial designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of low doses of
      Interleukin2 in the treatment of recently diagnosed, steroid dependent idiopathic nephrotic
      syndrome in children. Recent data suggest that Interleukin 2 could be an effective therapy
      via an increased production of regulatory T cells.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will include 10 children (age: 3-15 years old). Patients will receive low doses of
      Interleukin 2 (0.5 million UI/m²/ injection, subcutaneously).

      The treatment will be initiated with an induction phase of one injection per day for 5
      consecutive days, followed by a maintenance phase in which patients will receive one
      injection every 14 days for 6 months.

The treatment is initiated with an induction phase of one injection per day for 5 consecutive days, followed by a maintenance phase in which patients will receive one injection every 14 days for 6 months.
At the same time, corticoid treatment will be tapered until its complete withdrawal no later than 3 months from the first injection</description>
