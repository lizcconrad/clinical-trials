  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to confirm safety and tolerability of incremental doses of HAL-MPE1
      subcutaneous immunotherapy (SCIT) in peanut allergic adults, and subsequently assess the
      safety and tolerability in adolescents and children with peanut allergy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Currently, there is no effective treatment for peanut allergy other than avoidance of peanut
      allergens. There is high unmet medical need for a disease modifying treatment for peanut
      allergy, especially for peanut allergic children, since this age group is at highest risk of
      peanut-related anaphylaxis requiring hospitalization. A chemically modified, aluminum
      hydroxide adsorbed peanut extract (HAL-MPE1) for subcutaneous administration has been
      developed. The safety and tolerability of HAL-MPE1 have been established in a First-in-human
      (FIH) study in adults.
