  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This trial is being performed in two parts: Dose Escalation and Dose Expansion.

      The primary objective for the Dose Escalation part is to determine the safety and
      tolerability at different doses of DS-8273a administered in combination with nivolumab and to
      identify the dose combination for the Dose Expansion cohort in subjects with mismatch repair
      (MMR)-proficient advanced colorectal cancer.

      The primary objectives for the Dose Expansion part are:

        -  To further evaluate the safety and tolerability of DS-8273a administered at the selected
           dose in combination with nivolumab in subjects with MMR-proficient advanced colorectal
           cancer

        -  To evaluate preliminary anti-tumor activity of DS-8273a plus nivolumab administered at
           the selected dose in subjects with MMR-proficient advanced colorectal cancer

    <measure>Dose Escalation Part: Number of Participants with Dose-Limiting Toxicities (DLT)</measure>
    <time_frame>During the first treatment cycle (28 days)</time_frame>
    <description>A DLT is defined as a study drug-related ≥ Grade 3 Adverse Event (AE) occurring during the first cycle (28 days) of treatment, with specific exceptions for hematologic events, elevations in hepatic function enzymes, and adverse events that are pre-identified as not being DLTs.</description>

    <measure>Dose Escalation and Dose Expansion Parts: Number of Participants with Clinically Significant Safety Parameters</measure>
    <time_frame>2 years</time_frame>
    <description>Safety parameters will include adverse events that are serious (SAEs), treatment emergent (TEAEs), dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs), physical examination findings (including Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group [ECOG] Performance Status), vital sign measurements, clinical laboratory parameters (serum chemistry, hematology, and urinalysis), immune-related (ir) adverse events (irAEs), anti-drug antibody (ADA), and electrocardiogram (ECG) parameters.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Dose Escalation Part: Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD)</measure>
    <time_frame>2 years</time_frame>
    <description>The MTD is defined as the highest dose of DS-8273a in combination with the tested dose of nivolumab that results in a DLT in less than one-third of the subjects enrolled at that dose level of at least 6 evaluable subjects. However, AEs that meet the definition of DLT appearing at later cycles will also be considered for the determination of MTD and selection of the Dose Expansion dose. If the MTD is not reached at 1200 mg of DS-8273a IV Q2W, this highest tested dose may be selected as the maximum administered dose (MAD).</description>

          2. Is unresectable or metastatic

          3. Has undergone ≥ 2 prior standard therapies

          4. Is MMR-proficient [selected by the site based on microsatellite instability assay
             (MSI) and/or immunohistochemistry (IHC) for MMR proteins]

          9. Able to comply with protocol visits and procedures

         10. Agree to use a highly effective form of contraception or avoid intercourse during and
             upon completion of the study (women for 23 weeks and men for 31 weeks after the last
             dose of study drug)

         11. Are fully informed about their illness and the investigational nature of the study
             protocol (including foreseeable risks and possible side effects) and must sign and
             date an Institutional Review Board (IRB)-approved informed consent form (ICF),
             including Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act authorization, if
             applicable, before performance of any study-specific procedures or tests

         12. Are willing to provide available pre-existing diagnostic or resected tumor samples.
             Providing fresh tumor biopsies are optional for all subjects in Dose Escalation
             cohorts. In the Dose Expansion cohort, up to 6 subjects may be requested to provide
             pre- and post-treatment tumor biopsies based on eligibility for the procedure. For
             those subjects who do not have an MMR status, inclusion in the Dose Escalation and
             Dose Expansion can be achieved by providing a fresh tumor biopsy for MMR testing.

         13. Subjects with asthma who require intermittent use of bronchodilators (such as
             albuterol) will not be excluded from this study. Inhaled steroids and intra-articular
             steroid injections are permitted in this study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Active infection or chronic comorbidity that would interfere with therapy

          2. History of other malignancy(ies), except adequately treated non-melanoma skin cancer,

             or other immunosuppressive medications, except for subjects with vitiligo, treated
             thyroiditis or resolved asthma/atopy.

             T-lymphocyte-associated protein-4 (CTLA-4) antibody (or any other antibody targeting
             T-cell co-stimulation pathways).

          6. Tested positive for hepatitis B or C serological markers (hepatitis B surface antigen
             or antibodies to hepatitis C virus) or human immunodeficiency virus.

          8. Requires daily supplemental oxygen.

          9. Recipient of a stem cell or bone marrow transplant.

         10. A concomitant medical condition that would increase the risk of toxicity, in the
             opinion of the Investigator or Sponsor.

         11. Clinically active brain metastases, defined as untreated and symptomatic, or requiring
             therapy with steroids or anticonvulsants to control associated symptoms.

             Subjects with treated brain metastases that are no longer symptomatic and who require
             no treatment with steroids may be included in the study if they have recovered from
             the acute toxic effect of radiotherapy. A minimum of 4 weeks must have elapsed between
             the end of whole brain radiotherapy and study enrollment (2 weeks for stereotactic
             radiotherapy).

         12. Unresolved toxicities from previous anticancer therapy, defined as toxicities (other
             than alopecia) not yet resolved to Grade ≤ 1 or baseline. Subjects with chronic Grade
             2 toxicities may be eligible per the discretion of the Investigator after consultation
             with the Sponsor Medical Monitor or designee (eg, Grade 2 chemotherapy-induced
             neuropathy).

         13. Systemic treatment with anticancer therapy, antibody-based therapy, retinoid therapy,
             or hormonal therapy within 3 weeks before study drug treatment; or treatment with
             nitrosoureas or mitomycin C within 6 weeks before study drug treatment; or treatment
             with small-molecule targeted agents within 2 weeks, or 5 half-lives before study drug
             treatment, whichever is longer.

             treatment or palliative radiation therapy within 2 weeks before study drug treatment.

         15. Participation in a therapeutic clinical study within 3 weeks before study drug
             treatment (for small-molecule targeted agents, this non-participation period is 2
             weeks or 5 half-lives, whichever is longer), or current participation in other
             investigational procedures.

         16. Pregnant or breastfeeding, or planning to become pregnant.

         17. Substance abuse or medical conditions such as clinically significant cardiac or
             pulmonary diseases or psychological conditions, that may, in the opinion of the
             Investigator, interfere with the subject's participation in the clinical study or
             evaluation of the clinical study results.

         18. Life expectancy &lt; 3 months, in the opinion of the Investigator.
