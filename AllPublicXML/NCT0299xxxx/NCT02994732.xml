  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to characterize the metabolic disposition,
      pharmacokinetics (PK), and routes of elimination of [14C]‑labeled BVD‑523 after
      administration of a single, oral dose to healthy male subjects.

      The secondary objective of this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of a single
      oral dose of [14C]‑labeled BVD‑523 in healthy male subjects.
