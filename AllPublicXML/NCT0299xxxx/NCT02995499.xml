  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The ASA-PS classification, a subjective classification system of the patients' preoperative
      health status, contains a certain problem concerning its interrater reliability. A comparison
      between anesthesiologic and surgical assessment of the preoperative patient condition has not
      yet been extensively investigated. The aim of this study is to examine the latter in a
      prospective, monocentric, observational study.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Included will be prospectively all patients undergoing an operation under anesthesiologic
      treatment in the one-period-time from the study-beginning at the Department of General and
      Visceral Surgery of the University Clinic Frankfurt. The ASA-PS classification will be twice
      conducted and documented during the informed consent process: once by the consulting surgeon
      and once by the consulting anesthesiologist. The assigned class and the training status of
      the involved physician are anonymously documented on the study case report form. The pre-,
      peri- and postoperative patient data, in particular the demographic data (age, height,
      weight, BMI), comorbidities, type and duration of operation, as well as perioperative
      complications in a follow-up period of 90 days will be extracted from the electronic patient
      record. The patient data documentation concludes with a contact and, if necessary,
      examination of the patient (in hospital or by the family doctor) after the 90th postoperative
      day. Subsequently two study cooperation partners, a senior surgeon and a senior
      anesthesiologist, will assign a &quot;recommended&quot;-ASA-PS class to every pseudonymized patient
      based only on the documented preoperative examination, demographics and comorbidities without
      insight into the preoperative documented ASA-PS classifications or the postoperative course.

      Primary Hypothesis:

      The assessments of the preoperative state of health of general-surgical patients by means of
      the ASA-PS classification carried out independently by members of different disciplines
      result in a moderate interrater reliability of the latter.

      Secondary Hypothesis:

      The discrepancy between the abovementioned ASA-PS classification and that recommended by an
      interdisciplinary committee decreases with increasing professional experience.
