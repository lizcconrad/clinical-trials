      This is a Phase 1 Window of Opportunity study to evaluate the pharmacodynamic and immune
      effects of pre-operative therapy with Mocetinostat and Durvalumab on patients with squamous
      cell carcinoma of the oral cavity.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single center, open-label, non-randomized, pre-operative window of opportunity
      study for patients with resectable squamous cell carcinoma of the oral cavity who are
      considered suitable for curative-intent surgical resection, with pre-operative Mocetinostat
      and Durvalumab.

      This study will involve treatment with Mocetinostat and Durvalumab, tests and procedures done
      for safety and the collection of blood samples for biomarker research. Tissue samples (fresh
      biopsy or archival tissue) will also be collected for biomarker research and evaluation.
