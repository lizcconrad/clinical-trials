    <textblock>
      Post-dural puncture headache (PDPH) is seen more frequently in pregnant women due to stress,
      dehydration, intra-abdominal pressure, and insufficient fluid replacement after delivery.
      Obesity protects against PDPH in pregnant women; increased intra-abdominal fat tissue reduced
      cerebrospinal fluid leakage by increasing the pressure in the epidural space. Therefore, this
      study investigated the influence of body mass index (BMI) on PDPH in elective caesarean
      section patients in whom 27G spinal needles were used.

      The study included 420 women with American Society of Anesthesiology physical status I-II who
      underwent elective caesarean section under spinal anesthesia. The patients with a BMI less
      than 30 were accepted as normal weight (Group I) and those with a BMI above 30 were accepted
      as obese (Group II). Dural puncture performed with a 27G Quincke spinal needle at the L3-4 or
      L4-5 intervertebral space and given 12.5 mg hyperbaric bupivacaine intrathecally. The
      patients were questioned regarding headache and low back pain 6, 12, 24, and 48 hours after
      the procedure, and by phone calls on days 3 and 7.
