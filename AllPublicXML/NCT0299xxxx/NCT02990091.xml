  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 2 clinical trial designed to obtain data on relationships between potentially
      therapeutic doses of n-3 HUFA (highly unsaturated fatty acids) and their bioactive molecular
      derivatives, synaptamide, 17-hydroxy-DHA, and D-series resolvins, on clinical outcomes after
      TBI.

    <measure>Relationship of varying doses of n-3 HUFAs on blood levels of the following bioactive metabolites</measure>
    <time_frame>14 days consecutively</time_frame>
    <description>Bioactive metabolites being looked at are: synaptamide (n-docosahexaenoylethanolamine), 17-hydroxy-DHA, and D-series resolvins and determine relationship of n-3 HUFAs on blood levels of indicators of neuroinflammatory damage including Brain Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF) in humans over 14 days after TBI.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Relationship of n-3 HUFA blood levels and clinical outcomes measured by the Glasgow Outcome Scale-Extended (GOSE)</measure>
    <time_frame>14 days consecutively</time_frame>
    <description>Clinical outcomes will include functional outcomes and will be assessed by using the TBI Common Data Elements Outcome battery. The analysis will focus on the Glasgow Outcome Scale-Extended (GOS-E) an ordinal scale based on a structured questionnaire which is universally used in TBI clinical studies.</description>

    <description>LOVAZA is an FDA approved drug that is lawfully marketed in the United States by GlaxoSmithKline. There is no intent to use the results of this study to support a change in the labeling or the advertising of the drug. The highest dose administered for the study is the recommended prescribed dose of LOVAZA, therefore not creating greater risk. The patient population and route of administration will not significantly increase the risk associated with the use of the product. We will be using this drug under an IND exemption.</description>

    <description>Safflower seed oil is a commonly used dietary supplement. It has been chosen to be used as a comparative to the LOVAZA because of its non-omega-3 fats. There will be no increased risk due to dosage, route of administration, or patient population.</description>
