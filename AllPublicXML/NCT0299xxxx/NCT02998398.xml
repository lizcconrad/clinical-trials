    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of the switch from the original
      infliximab ( REMICADE®) to its biosimilar (INFLECTRA®) in all the patients at Cochin hospital
      receiving REMICADE® for either a rheumatic, gastro-enterologic or ophthalmic condition

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All patients managed in one of the departments of cochin Hospital who are receiving the
      original infliximab ( REMICADE®) from at least 4 months will be invited to continue to
      receive infliximab but using its biosimilar (INFLECTRA®)) at the same regimen (identical dose
      per infusion and interval between two infusions) than the previous one while receiving
      REMICADE®. The tolerability of the infusion will be recorded as well as the percentage of
      patients continuing INFLECTRA® after at least six months of its initiation.

      Moreover, the infliximab serum level will be evaluated after the last infusion of REMICADE®
      and after the third infusion of INFLECTRA®. At the same time, anti-drug antibodies will be
      tested.

      Finally for each of the underlying disease (e.g. rheumatoid arthritis, spondyloarthritis,
      Crohn's disease, uveitis,..), the maintenance of the efficacy of Infliximab will be evaluated
      according to the usual outcome measures of the activity of the disease
