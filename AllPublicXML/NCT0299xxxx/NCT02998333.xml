  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Rationale: Lateral ankle ligament injuries may be a result of ankle sprains. In 10-30% of
      patients with lateral ankle ligament injuries, chronic lateral ankle instability may be
      present. If conservative treatment fails, instability is treated surgically. Anatomic repair
      (also known as the Bröstrom procedure) is the current golden standard for surgical treatment
      of chronic ankle instability. The Bröstrom started out as an open technique and is now also
      performed arthroscopically. Both approaches are considered standard care and provide good
      results. Which approach is best, has not yet been researched. In this study it is
      hypothesized arthroscopic repair provides better functional outcome compared to open repair
      during short term follow-up.

      Objective: The main objective of this study is to compare the functional outcome after
      arthroscopic and open anatomic repair in patients with chronic lateral ankle instability, and
      secondly to assess ankle stability and ankle Range of Motion (ROM) after arthroscopic and
      open ligament repair.

      Study design: A Non-Blinded Prospective Randomized Controlled Trial Study population: All
      patients willing to participate, from an age of 18 years old, with persisting ankle
      instability for at least 6 months, eligible for anatomic repair.

      Intervention: Both groups of patients are surgically treated with anatomic repair of the
      anterior talofibular ligament (ATFL). One group is treated arthroscopically and the other by
      the open approach.

      Main study parameters/endpoints: The primary outcome measure is functional outcome 6 months
      after surgery measured using the Foot and Ankle Outcome Score. The main study parameter is a
      difference of ≥10 2 points per FAOS subscale between both treatment groups (Minimal Important
      Change = 10 points; 2 per subscale).
