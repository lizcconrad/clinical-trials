  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Healthy ageing and pathological ageing in the context of a neurodegenerative disease are both
      associated with changes in brain network integrity. Episodic memory is especially affected in
      Alzheimer's disease, but is also decreased in healthy ageing. Consequently, the
      memory-relevant brain networks are especially altered. Transcranial direct current
      stimulation (tDCS) has previously been implemented in different clinical- and non-clinical
      settings and has shown to beneficially influence network connectivity. The neural correlates
      of single-session tDCS have been investigated, however, the neural effects of repeated tDCS
      remain unknown. Furthermore, knowledge about the (long-term) neural mechanisms of repeated
      tDCS can give valuable insights and possibly pave the ground for exploring tDCS as a
      treatment option in future studies.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Patients

          -  Diagnosis of MCI based on the latest research criteria (clinical assessment at the
             memory clinic (prof. Frans RJ Verhey): presence of at least a memory impairment,
             memory complaints expressed by the patient or informant, no problems in daily life
             functioning, no dementia and presence of biomarkers (Albert et al., 2011)

          -  Clinical Dementia Rating score of 0.5 (CDR distinguishes a stage of questionable
             dementia (CDR 0.5) from people termed healthy (CDR 0) and those with mild dementia
             (CDR 1)

          -  Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) 23 and being mentally competent (in general,
             individuals with a MMSE 18 are considered mentally competent)
