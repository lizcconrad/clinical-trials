    <textblock>
      This research study is exploring chemotherapy in combination with immunotherapy (a therapy
      that uses the body's own immune system to control cancer) as a possible treatment for hormone
      receptor positive breast cancer.

      The interventions involved in this study are:

        -  Pembrolizumab (MK-3475; Keytruda™)

        -  Nab-Paclitaxel (Abraxane
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>

      This research study is a Pilot Study, which is the first time investigators are examining
      this study intervention.

      In this research study, the investigators are looking at how the participants body and tumor
      respond to the combination of Nab-paclitaxel and Pembrolizumab. Also, the investigators will
      be examining the participants tumor tissue to learn more about the disease.

      The FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has not approved Pembrolizumab for this
      specific disease; but it has been approved in the United States for the treatment of other
      diseases.

      The FDA has not approved Nab-paclitaxel as a treatment option for this type of breast cancer;
      but it has been approved in the United States for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer
      (breast cancer that has spread to other parts of the body).

      Pembrolizumab is a medicine that may treat cancer by working with the participant's immune
      system. The immune system is the body's natural defense against disease. The immune system
      sends types of cells called &quot;T cells&quot; throughout the body to detect and fight infections and
      diseases, including cancer. For some types of cancer, the T cells do not work as they should
      and are prevented from attacking the tumors. Pembrolizumab is thought to work by blocking a
      protein in the T cells called PD-1 (&quot;programmed death 1&quot;), which then allows these cells and
      other parts of the immune system to attack tumors.

      Nab-paclitaxel (Abraxane) is part of a class of medications called antimicrotubule agents. It
      works by stopping the growth and spread of cancer cells by blocking the action of proteins
      called microtubules.

      The combination of Pembrolizumab and Nab-paclitaxel is investigational. &quot;Investigational&quot;
      means that the combination of study drugs is being studied. The study drugs, when given
      separately, work in different ways to stop the cancer cells from growing and spreading.
      However, it is not known if giving the two study drugs at the same time will have a better
      anti-cancer effect than giving each treatment on its own.

          -  The participant must be willing to undergo the three required research biopsies over
             the course of protocol therapy. Participants who undergo an attempted research biopsy
             procedure for the purpose of this protocol, and in whom inadequate tissue is obtained,
             are not required to undergo a repeat biopsy in order to continue on protocol.

          -  The effects of pembrolizumab on the developing human fetus are unknown. For this
             reason, both women and men of child-bearing potential must agree to use adequate
             contraception (Section 5.5.2) starting with the first dose of study therapy and for
             the duration of study participation, through 120 days after the last dose of study
             medication.

        Note: Abstinence is acceptable if this is the usual lifestyle and preferred contraception
        for the subject. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while she or her
        partner is participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician
        immediately. While on the study, women may not breast-feed. Women of childbearing potential
        are defined as those who have not been surgically sterilized or have not been free from
        menses for &gt; 1 year.

          -  Female subject of childbearing potential should have a negative urine or serum
             pregnancy test within 72 hours prior to receiving the first dose of study medication.
             If the urine test is positive or cannot be confirmed as negative, a serum pregnancy
             test will be required.

          -  Participants on bisphosphonates may continue receiving bisphosphonate therapy during
             study treatment.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  The participant has received prior pembrolizumab or any other anti-PD-1, anti-PD-L1,
             or anti-PD-L2 therapy, or has participated in any prior studies involving
             pembrolizumab

          -  Hypersensitivity to pembrolizumab or any of its excipients.

          -  The participant has any history or evidence of active, non-infectious pneumonitis or
             interstitial lung disease.

          -  The participant has an uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited
             to, uncontrolled hypertension, unstable angina pectoris, uncontrolled cardiac
             arrhythmia, congestive heart failure (New York Heart Association Class III or IV; see
             Appendix B), active ischemic heart disease, myocardial infarction within the previous
             six months, uncontrolled diabetes mellitus, chronic liver or renal disease, or severe
             malnutrition.

          -  Concurrent use of potent CYP3A4 inhibitors (see Appendix C), such as ketoconazole and
             erythromycin, should be avoided during the study treatment with nab-paclitaxel.

          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because pembrolizumab has the potential
             for teratogenic or abortifacient effects. Because there is an unknown but potential
             risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with
             pembrolizumab, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated with
             pembrolizumab.

          -  Active infection requiring intravenous antibiotics at week 1 day 1.

          -  Individuals with a history of a second malignancy are ineligible except for the
             following circumstances. Individuals with a history of other malignancies are eligible
             if they have been disease-free for at least 5 years and are deemed by the investigator
             to be at low risk for recurrence of that malignancy. Individuals with the following
             cancers are eligible if diagnosed and treated within the past 5 years: cervical cancer
             in situ, and non-melanoma cancer of the skin. Participants with other cancers
             diagnosed within the past 5 years and felt to be at low risk of recurrence should be
             discussed with the study sponsor to determine eligibility.

          -  The participant has a medical condition that requires chronic systemic steroid therapy
             or any other form of immunosuppressive medication including disease modifying agents,
             or has required such therapy in the last 2 years. Replacement therapy (eg., thyroxine,
             insulin, or physiologic corticosteroid replacement therapy for adrenal or pituitary
             insufficiency, etc.) is not considered a form of systemic treatment.

          -  The participant has an active autoimmune disease or a documented history of autoimmune
             disease or syndrome that requires systemic steroids or immunosuppressive agents.

          -  The participant is positive for Hepatitis B surface antigen, or Hepatitis C RNA.

          -  Known HIV-positive participants. HIV-positive patients on combination antiretroviral
             therapy are ineligible because of the potential for pharmacokinetic interactions with
             pembrolizumab. In addition, these participants are at increased risk of lethal
             infections with bone marrow suppressive therapy, i.e. nab-paclitaxel. Appropriate
             studies will be undertaken in participants receiving combination antiretroviral
             therapy when indicated.

          -  The participant has received a live vaccine within 28 days of planned start of study
             therapy.

          -  Seasonal influenza vaccines for infection are generally inactivated flu vaccines and
             are allowed; however intranasal influenza vaccines (i.e. Flu-Mist ®) are live
             attenuated vaccines, and are not allowed.
