      This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of ropidoxuridine when given
      together with whole brain radiation therapy in treating patients with cancer that has spread
      to the brain. Ropidoxuridine may help whole brain radiation therapy work better by making
      cancer cells more sensitive to the radiation therapy.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To conduct a phase 1 dose escalation trial in patients with brain metastases to determine
      the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of ropidoxuridine (5-iodo-2-pyrimidinone-2'-deoxyribose
      [IPdR]) when administered alone orally once daily for 7 consecutive days and then
      concurrently with conventionally fractionated whole brain radiation therapy (WBRT) for
      additional 21 days.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To observe and record anti-tumor activity to IPdR-mediated radiosensitization.

      II. To estimate 6 month intracranial progression-free survival (PFS) in brain metastasis
      cancer patients who receive daily oral IPdR x 28 days and WBRT.

      III. To establish the pharmacokinetics of daily oral dosing of IPdR times 8 days.

      IV. To evaluate safety and tolerability of oral IPdR x 28 days and WBRT. V. To estimate the
      incidence of delayed neurological toxicity at 2, 4, and 6 months (+/-1 week) post-completion
      of WBRT (for patients without intracranial progression) including delayed-recall through
      Hopkins Verbal Learning Test Revised (HVLT-R) and quality of life as measured by the
      Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Brain (FACT-BR).

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess for biochemical evidence of IPdR effect in normal tissues (circulating
      granulocytes) by measuring %IUdR-deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) cellular incorporation by flow
      cytometry and high-pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) analyses as an exploratory biomarker
      for the %IUdR-DNA tumor cell incorporation from day 8 extracranial tumor biopsies in brain
      metastasis cancer patients receiving MTD doses of IPdR as an exploratory biomarker of tumor
      radiosensitization using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) criteria.

      II. To assess for biochemical evidence of IPdR effect in normal tissues (circulating
      granulocytes) by measuring %IUdR-deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) cellular incorporation by flow
      cytometry and high-pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) analyses as an exploratory biomarker
      for the %IUdR-DNA cellular incorporation in patients' circulating granulocytes taken weekly
      during the 28-day IPdR MTD dose, on day 29, and week 8 as an exploratory biomarker of IPdR
      systemic toxicities to bone marrow as measured by serial complete blood count
      (CBC)/differential values.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study of ropidoxuridine.

      Patients receive ropidoxuridine orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-28 and undergo WBRT
      daily for not more than 5 days per week beginning on day 8 for a total of 15 fractions.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 2 months for 6 months,
      every 3-4 months for 6 months, and every 6 months for 1 year.

             medically necessary; this increased need for dose should be communicated to the
             study's principal investigator, Dr Mohindra at the University of Maryland
