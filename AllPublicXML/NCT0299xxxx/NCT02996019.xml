  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, 2-part, 2-arm, open-label, parallel-group, multi-center study to
      compare the PK of etrolizumab administered subcutaneously by an AI (test device) or a PFS-NSD
      (reference device) in healthy participants. The study will comprise a pilot cohort (Part 1)
      to estimate the geometric mean ratio (GMR) and variability of the maximum observed
      concentration (Cmax) and area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) to confirm or
      determine the sample size for the pivotal cohort (Part 2). The pivotal cohort will
      demonstrate exposure comparability of Cmax, AUC from Hour 0 to the last measurable
      concentration (AUClast), and AUC from Hour 0 to extrapolated infinite time (AUC0-inf), values
      for a single dose of etrolizumab administered subcutaneously either by the AI or the PFS-NSD.
