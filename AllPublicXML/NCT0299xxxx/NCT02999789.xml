      To conduct a pilot test to estimate the effect of a novel reminder system in improving daily
      asthma controller medication adherence rates in children with monolingual Spanish-speaking
      guardians who have limited English Proficiency (LEP).

      The primary hypothesis is to conduct a pilot test to estimate the effect of the SmartInhaler
      device in improving daily asthma controller medication adherence rates in children with
      monolingual Spanish- speaking guardians who have LEP during a six-week intervention period
      when compared to baseline medication adherence rates in a preceding six-week run-in period.
      The secondary hypothesis is to determine whether the patient reminder system can improve
      asthma symptom control during the same six-week intervention period. The third hypothesis is
      to assess if there are specific, patient behavior characteristics which are associated with
      the success of a novel asthma medication reminder system.

    <description>After an initial six week run-in period, participants will be randomized to either the intervention group or placebo group. The intervention group will have SMS reminder and audiovisual reminder functions turned on. SMS reminders will be sent twice daily to child's caregiver's cell phone reminding them to administer daily asthma medication. SmartInhaler with reminder function turned on that is attached to Inhaler medication will remind child's caregiver twice daily to administer daily asthma medication.</description>

    <description>After an initial six week run-in period, participants will be randomized to either the intervention group or placebo group. The placebo group will have SMS reminder and audiovisual reminder functions turned off. The SmartInhaler will only function to measure daily adherence.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. The investigators will recruit 30 participants ages 5 to 17 years with a diagnosis of
             persistent asthma who require a daily inhaled corticosteroid metered dose inhaler and
             whose guardian is the person responsible for administering their daily asthma
             medication.

          2. The investigators will recruit only participants who have received or receive care at
             San Francisco General Hospital's 6M Children's Health Center.

          3. The investigators will recruit participants whose daily inhaled corticosteroid are
             metered dose inhalers (MDI) of either Flovent (fluticasone propionate) HFA
             (Hydrofluoroalkane) or Qvar (beclamethasone dipropionate) HFA.

          4. The Investigators will recruit only participants whose guardian responsible for
             administering their daily asthma medication has Limited English Proficiency (LEP) and
             whose primary language is Spanish.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. The Investigators will exclude participants whose guardian responsible for
             administering their daily asthma medication does not have a Bluetooth enabled cell
             phone capable of receiving text messages.

          2. The Investigators will exclude participants whose guardian responsible for
             administering their daily asthma medication does not have an available reliable power
             outlet where they can recharge the battery of their SmartInhaler.

          3. The Investigators will exclude participants whose guardian responsible for
             administering their daily asthma medication is unable to demonstrate correct
             medication technique based on standard evaluation (Press, 2011) after completion of a
             standard teaching protocol.

          4. The Investigators will exclude participants with chronic lung disease.

          5. The Investigators will exclude participants who do not have an operating system of iOS
             or Android on their cell phone and who have no data plan with their cellular phone
             plan.

          6. The Investigators will exclude participants whose asthma medication regimen is being
             managed by an asthma subspecialist or health provider outside of the 6M Children's
             Health Center at San Francisco General Hospital.

          7. The Investigators will exclude participants who are using an inhaled long acting
             beta-agonist (LABA) as part of their asthma management plan.
