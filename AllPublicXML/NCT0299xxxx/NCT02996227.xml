      Comparison of Bilateral Transversus Abdominis Plane Block with Exparel versus Continuous
      Epidural Analgesia With Bupivacaine
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigator goal is to compare the analgesic efficacy of TAP blocks with liposomal
      bupivacaine (Exparel) and continuous epidural blocks in patients who are scheduled for major
      lower abdominal surgery. To assess whether TAP block with Exparel is noninferior to
      continuous epidural analgesia on pain management, defined as noninferior for both pain
      control and total opioid consumption for 72 hours, in patients who had major lower abdominal
      surgery.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>VRS Pain score</measure>
    <time_frame>Discharge from PACU until 72 hours after the end of surgery</time_frame>
    <description>Pain scores will be measured using a Verbal Response Scale (VRS). VRS is a scale from 0 to 10 where 0 signifies no pain and 10 signifies worst pain ever experienced. The VRS will be recorded every 30 minutes in the recovery area for the first 2 hours, then every 4 hours thereafter while awake for 72 hours.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Total opioid consumption</measure>
    <time_frame>Discharge from PACU until 72 hours after the end of surgery</time_frame>
    <description>Opioid consumption will be measured as the total amount of opioids (converted to morphine sulfate equivalents) used during the 72 hours after the end of surgery.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Activity after surgery</measure>
    <time_frame>Discharge from PACU until 72 hours after the end of surgery</time_frame>
    <description>ViSi mobile (Sotera Wireless) patient monitoring system, a platform for comprehensive vital sign monitoring will be used to quantify patient activity over the initial 72 postoperative hours. This system continuously measures position (lying versus sitting) and activity.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Opioid related side effect</measure>
    <time_frame>The first, second and third postoperative mornings</time_frame>
    <description>We will use 4-point Opioid-Related Symptom Distress Scale (ORSDS) to evaluate opioid-related side effect. ORSDS questionnaires will be administered by a trained research fellow.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Blood pressure</measure>
    <time_frame>Discharge from PACU until 72 hours after the end of surgery</time_frame>
    <description>Visi mobile patient monitoring system will be used to obtain blood pressure of the patient for 72 hours.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Quality of recovery after anesthesia</measure>
    <time_frame>The first and third postoperative mornings</time_frame>
    <description>Quality of recovery will be measured using QoR scale. Patients will be questioned on morning of POD1 and 3.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Length of hospital stay</measure>
    <time_frame>From date of hospital admission until the date of hospital discharge or date of death from any cause, whichever came first, assessed up to 100 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The length of hospital stay will be measured as days.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Total cost of care</measure>
    <time_frame>From date of hospital admission until the date of hospital discharge or date of death from any cause, whichever came first, assessed up to 100 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The total cost of hospital stay will be collected at hospital discharge day or date of death from any cause, which comes first, assessed up to 100 weeks.</description>
