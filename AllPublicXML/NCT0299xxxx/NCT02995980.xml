    <textblock>
      This is a feasibility study to evaluate dual-energy (DE) contrast-enhanced (CE) digital
      mammography to detect breast cancer in patients with increased breast density (BI-RADS
      category c or d). Eligible patients will be invited to have full-field digital mammography
      and dual-energy (DE) contrast-enhanced (CE) digital mammography to compare accuracy of the
      imaging methods for the detection of breast cancer.
