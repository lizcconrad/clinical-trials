  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to determine if speech therapy can be enhanced by Aerobic
      Exercise (AE). Investigators will use a single subject design to determine if aphasia therapy
      result in greater gains when combined with aerobic exercise.

      Aim 1: To test the feasibility of a research study that combines speech therapy with aerobic
      exercise (AE). Participants will be alternately assigned to receiving AE during during a 30
      minute break from speech therapy.

      Aim 2: To test the preliminary efficacy of combining speech therapy with AE to promote
      language improvements in aphasia. These data will inform the design of a large, controlled
      clinical trial

    <description>The examiner begins with Item 1 and continues through Item 60, unless the patient is in distress or refuses to continue. The patient is told to tell the examiner the name of each picture and is given about 20 seconds to respond for each trial. The examiner writes down the patient's responses in detail, using codes. If the patient fails to give the correct response, the examiner at her or his discretion may give the patient a phonemic cue, which is the initial sound of the target word. After the patient completes the test, the examiner scores each item + or - according to the response coding and scoring procedures</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Aphasia based on Western Aphasia Battery (WAB) severity quotient=mild-moderate
             aphasia.

          -  English is primary language (patient report).

          -  At least 12 months post CVA (patient report and confirmed by medical records review).

          -  Able to participate in AE based on MD screening.

          -  Have a history of only one stroke.

          -  Independent in walking (with or without assistive device).

          -  Medically stable.

          -  No previous myocardial infarction.

          -  No significant musculo-skeletal problems from conditions other than stroke.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  MD considers participant unable to comply with study requirements. Stroke due to
             intracranial hemorrhage primarily due to bleeding from ruptured aneurysm or
             arteriovenous malformation.

        Progressive stroke.

          -  Comorbid neurological diagnosis (e.g. MS, PD, dementia)

          -  Unable to perform the required exercises due to a) medical, b) musculo-skeletal, or c)
             neurological problems (for details see below, a-c)

               1. medical problems: unstable cardiovascular condition, or other serious cardiac
                  conditions (for example, anyone meeting New York Heart Association Class IV
                  criteria, hospitalization for myocardial infarction or heart surgery within 120
                  days, severe cardiomyopathy or documented serious and unstable cardiac
                  arrhythmias)

               2. musculo-skeletal problems: restricted passive range of motion in the major lower
                  limb joints (that is, an extension deficit of &gt;20° for the affected hip or knee
                  joints, or a dorsiflexion deficit of &gt;20° for the affected ankle)

               3. neurological problems: severity of stroke-related deficits Required help of at
                  least 1 person to walk before stroke due to neurological (for example, advanced
                  Parkinson's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, multiple sclerosis) or
                  non-neurological (for example, heart failure, orthopaedic problems)
                  co-morbidities with life expectancy of less than 1 year as determined by
                  physician.

          -  Drug or alcohol addiction within the last 6 months.

          -  Significant current psychiatric illness defined as affective disorder unresponsive to
             medication or bipolar affective disorder, psychosis, schizophrenia or suicidality.

          -  Current participation in another interventional trial.
