      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and immune response to an HIV clade C DNA
      vaccine and to an MF59-adjuvanted clade C Env protein in healthy, HIV-uninfected adults.

    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity to DNA-HIV-PT123 (an
      HIV clade C DNA vaccine) and to Bivalent Subtype C gp120/MF59 in healthy, HIV-uninfected
      adults.

      The study will enroll healthy, HIV-uninfected participants aged 18 to 40 years. Participants
      will be randomly assigned to one of 6 groups. Each group will receive experimental vaccine
      and protein and/or placebo at 4 study visits. Participants in Groups 1-3 will receive all
      injections via needle and syringe. Participants in Groups 4-6 will receive the DNA vaccine
      via Biojector, and protein and/or placebo via needle and syringe.

      Participants in Groups 1 and 4 will receive the DNA vaccine at months 0, 1, 3, and 6 and the
      protein at months 3 and 6. Participants in Groups 2 and 5 will receive the DNA vaccine and
      the protein at months 0, 1, and 6 and placebo at month 3. Participants in Groups 3 and 6 will
      receive placebo at months 0, 1, 3, and 6.

      Study visits will include a physical examination, an interview and/or questionnaire, HIV
      testing and HIV risk-reduction counseling, and urine and blood collection. Participants may
      optionally choose to provide rectal fluid, cervical fluid, or semen samples.

               -  If a person has been found to have elevated blood pressure or hypertension during
                  screening or previously, exclude for blood pressure that is not well controlled.
                  Well-controlled blood pressure is defined as consistently ≤ 140 mm Hg systolic
                  and ≤ 90 mm Hg diastolic, with or without medication, with only isolated, brief
                  instances of higher readings, which must be ≤ 150 mm Hg systolic and ≤ 100 mm Hg
                  diastolic. For these volunteers, blood pressure must be ≤ 140 mm Hg systolic and
                  ≤ 90 mm Hg diastolic at enrollment.

               -  If a person has NOT been found to have elevated blood pressure or hypertension
                  during screening or previously, exclude for systolic blood pressure ≥ 150 mm Hg
                  at enrollment or diastolic blood pressure ≥ 100 mm Hg at enrollment.

          -  Bleeding disorder diagnosed by a doctor (eg, factor deficiency, coagulopathy, or
             platelet disorder requiring special precautions)

          -  Malignancy (Not excluded: Volunteer who has had malignancy excised surgically and who,
             in the investigator's estimation, has a reasonable assurance of sustained cure. or who
             is unlikely to experience recurrence of malignancy during the period of the study)

          -  Seizure disorder: History of seizure(s) within past three years. Also exclude if
             volunteer has used medications in order to prevent or treat seizure(s) at any time
             within the past 3 years.

          -  Asplenia: any condition resulting in the absence of a functional spleen

          -  History of hereditary angioedema, acquired angioedema, or idiopathic angioedema.
