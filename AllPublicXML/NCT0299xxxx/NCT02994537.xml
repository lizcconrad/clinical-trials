    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to explore the pathogenes, clinical characteristics, laboratory
      and histological examination results, treatment and prognosis of autoimmune hepatitis(AIH).
      At phase 1, the investigators focus on studying of the clinical characteristics of acute
      autoimmune hepatitis, and then will study the difference about treatment effects between
      acute autoimmune hepatitis and chronic AIH. Morever, the investigators have noticed that drug
      induced AIH have some special characteristics that may be beneficial to distinguish it with
      durg induced liver disease. Therefore the investigators will do some studies about drug
      induced AIH or other disease which maybe related to the onset of AIH.

      Now this study has been researched at phase 1, the investigators focus on studying the
      difference between acute AIH and chronic AIH. In this phase, the investigators analysed the
      serum biochemical results such as ALT,AST,IgG,PT,INR and so on, and also compared the
      histological performance. Finally, we compared the percentages of biochemical remission in
      the two groups, and the time from initial treatment to biochemical remission has also been
      put into the analysis. Now, the investigators are preparing for submitting the manuscript of
      phase 1.

    <description>This study is now in the phase 1, and the outcome at phase 1 is the biochemical remission of AIH patients. In details, if the participants' serum ALT,AST and IgG returned to normal, that means this participant reached the biochemical remission.</description>

    <description>Patients diagnosed autoimmune hepatitis(AIH) are divided into acute cohort or chronic cohort by biochemical results, such as liver function and coagulation, then the investigators will compare the histological results, treatment effects and prognosis between the two groups. Further more, the investigators will study the pathogenesis of different forms of autoimmune hepatitis. Even more, the investigators want to explore drug induced AIH and viral hepatitis related AIH.</description>
