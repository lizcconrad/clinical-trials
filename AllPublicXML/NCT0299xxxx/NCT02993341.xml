  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Mechanisms by which to reduce exposure to allogeneic blood are of financial and clinical
      benefit in the hip fracture population. Tranexamic acid (TXA) is an inexpensive medication
      with low complication risk. Its use in the hip fracture population is unproven. The purpose
      of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of topical tranexamic acid in reduction
      of peri-operative blood loss in hip fracture surgery.

      The results of this study may dramatically alter the manner in which surgeons manage hip
      fracture patients in Canada. The use of topical TXA in operatively-treated hip fracture
      patients has the potential to reduce perioperative blood loss and consequently reduce
      exposure to allogeneic blood transfusion. This will positively influence post-operative
      morbidity and mortality, while at the same time substantially reduce hospital length of stay
      and overall health care costs. The proposed study is felt to have minimal risk, and is a
      relatively inexpensive study.
