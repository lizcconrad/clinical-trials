      To study safety and efficacy of apatinib in combination of radiotherapy in patients with
      symptomatic bony disease prostate cancer (SBPC), based on the potential synergistic antitumor
      activity between Apatinib and Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy (SBRT).

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Histologic diagnosis of adenocarcinoma of the prostate

          -  Metastatic and symptomatic prostate cancer (positive bone scan or measurable disease)

          -  Patients must stop using any herbal product known to decrease PSA levels (eg., saw
             palmetto and PC-SPES) or any systemic or topical corticosteroid at least 4 weeks prior
             to screening. Progressive disease must be documented after discontinuation of these
             products.

          -  Progressive disease after androgen deprivation (or hormone therapy). For patients with
             measurable disease, progression will be defined by Response Evaluation Criteria in
             Solid Tumors (RECIST) criteria. For patients with progression in, or without any
             measurable disease, a positive bone scan and elevated PSA will be required.

          -  Patients receiving bisphosphate therapy must have been on stable doses for at least 4
             weeks with stable symptoms prior to enrollment.

          -  No prior chemotherapy or immunotherapy (tumor vaccine, cytokine, or growth factor
             given to control prostate cancer).

          -  Prior radiation therapy completed at least 4 weeks prior to enrollment. No prior
             radiopharmaceuticals (strontium, samarium) within 8 weeks prior to enrollment.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  History of severe hypersensitivity reactions to drugs formulated with polysorbate 80.

          -  Patients with active autoimmune disease or a history of autoimmune disease that
             required systemic steroids or immunosuppressive medications, except for patients with
             vitiligo.

          -  Prior therapy with any anti-cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen 4 (anti-CTLA-4) antibody.

          -  Active infection requiring therapy.

          -  Concurrent medical condition requiring the use of systemic or topical corticosteroids;
             systemic or topical corticosteroids must be discontinued at least 4 weeks prior to
             enrollment. The use of inhaled corticosteroids is acceptable.
