    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of complementary and alternative
      therapies, specifically alternate nostril breathing and foot reflexology, on intraocular
      pressure in patients with ocular hypertension.

      11 patients were recruited from Temple Ophthalmology between 2014 and 2016. Patients had
      ocular hypertension and were between the ages of 48-74. Patients were excluded if they
      currently performed ANB or FR, were unable to perform the task, had previous eye surgery or
      laser, were receiving other CAM for ocular hypertension, or were unable to complete a washout
      period. After a 30-day drug washout, patients completed either ANB or FR. After instruction,
      the assigned task was performed for 5 minutes. FR was done on a commercially available foot
      reflexology board (JAPAN TSUBO HH-700) focused at the base of the second and third toes of
      both feet. Two weeks later, patients completed the alternate task. IOP was measured before
      the task, immediately after the task and then every 30 minutes for two hours. Sign rank tests
      were used to evaluate IOP changes within and between each group.

    <description>The procedure for ANB begins by bringing the right hand up to the nose; with the ring finger over the left nostril and the thumb over the right nostril, so that the nostrils may be closed by the fingers. The first step in the cycle is to hold the right nostril closed with the thumb, and exhale completely through the left nostril in a slow and controlled fashion, free from exertion and jerkiness. At the end of the exhalation, the patient will inhale slowly and completely back through the left nostril. At this point the patient will close the left nostril with the ring finger, open the right nostril by releasing the thumb, and repeat the exhale-inhale process through the right nostril, completing one cycle. Then the patient will switch back to the left nostril and begin the cycle again. This cycle will be performed for one session lasting approximately 5 minutes.</description>

    <description>The procedure for FR focuses on activating specific reflex areas on the foot linked with the eye and eye disease, via massage. Although in the interest of repeatable precision, we have decided to use a FR board (fig.1) to conduct the procedure. This board has two foot shaped pieces of wood mounted on a flat board with springs. On top of these wooden feet are small wooden nodes, which are organized at precise locations to activate the reflexology of the foot by stimulation certain pressure points. The patient will be instructed to rest their feet on these boards with a comfortable pressure for a period of 5 minutes.</description>
