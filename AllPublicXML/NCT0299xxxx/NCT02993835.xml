      This single center trial will be single-blind to the subject, controlled, fully randomized
      with crossover design in 22 healthy females aged 18-40 years old.

      Subjects will attend 8 visits. At screening (V0), 3 consecutive feeding days (V1-V3), 14 days
      after last stable isotope intake again 3 consecutive feeding days (V4-V6), and 14 days after
      last stable isotope intake blood sampling (V7).

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Relative iron bioavailability (RBV) of 58Fe salt to 54Fe salt (i.e. FIA of 58Fe salt divided by FIA of 54Fe salt), RBV of 57Fe salt to 54Fe salt and RBV of 58Fe salt to 57Fe salt. The determination of FIA is a prerequisite for this calculation.</measure>
    <time_frame>14 days after last stable isotope adminstration</time_frame>
    <description>FIA will be calculated based on the measured shift of iron isotope ratios in the blood 14 days after the test meal administrations. The amounts of 57Fe, 54Fe and 58Fe in the blood will be calculated on the principle of isotope dilution by considering that iron isotopic labels are not mono-isotopic (Walczyk et al., 1997; Cercamondi, 2013). Circulating iron will be calculated based on blood volume and hemoglobin concentration (Kastenmayer et al., 1994). Blood volume will be indirectly measured based on height and weight and calculated using the formula proposed by Brown et al (1962). For calculations of fractional absorption, 80% incorporation of the absorbed iron into red blood cells is assumed.</description>

          3. Normal BMI for age (18.5-25.0 kg/m2)

          4. Weight less than 65 kg

          5. Able to understand and to sign written informed consent prior to trial entry

          6. Informed consent signed

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Anemia or polycythemia respectively evidenced by one of the following criteria from a
             standard blood formula: number of erythrocytes 4.0 - 5.8 1012/l or Hb 120-160 g/l or
             Ht 35-55%. Subjects outside of this range will be excluded.

         16. Subject who cannot be expected to comply with treatment or study procedure.

         17. Currently participating or having participated in another clinical trial during the
             past month prior to the beginning of this study.

         18. Subjects not willing and/or not able to comply with scheduled visits and the
             requirements of the study protocol.
