  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Prostate cancer is the most common malignancy in men and nearly 30,000 deaths occur from the
      disease each year. Not only is there significant mortality, there is also considerable
      morbidity from primary and salvage therapies. Understanding which patients require
      intensified treatment, as well as those who might not require treatment, would improve
      outcomes on multiple levels. The cohort to be investigated will be comprised of men with
      intermediate to high risk prostate cancer who are candidates for radiotherapy (RT). The
      overarching objective of the CoMBINe trial is to identify pretreatment and post-treatment
      prognostic and predictive factors derived from quantitative imaging prostate features, tumor
      tissue gene expression signatures, and circulating tumor cells (CTCs). The CoMBINe trial is a
      sister trial to another study, termed BLaStM (IRB# 20140627), in men who are candidates for
      radiotherapy. CoMBINe also allows for men with oligometastasis who are sometimes treated with
      RT to the prostate and limited metastatic sites.

      Primary objective -To investigate the relationship of quantitative imaging parameters
      (multiparametric MRI) pretreatment (pre-Tx) and post-treatment to changes in circulating
      tumor cells (CTCs) over time in prostate cancer patients who receive treatment with
      radiotherapy ± androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) per standard of care at the Department of
      Radiation Oncology at the University of Miami.

      Secondary objectives

        -  To evaluate whether CTC changes and/or quantitative imaging parameter changes are
           associated with patient outcome (biochemical and clinical disease failure).

        -  To evaluate whether ADT will affect quantitative imaging features and/or CTC levels in
           patients receiving therapy.

        -  To investigate the relationship of quantitative imaging characteristics and/or
           circulating tumor cell (CTC) changes with other tissue biomarkers (e.g., gene expression
           signatures) obtained from the pre-treatment MRI ultrasound (US) fusion guided prostate
           biopsy.

        -  In patients who have undergone the MRI-US fusion guided biopsy (MUFgBx) at 2-2.5 years
           after all planned treatment, to investigate the relationship of quantitative imaging
           characteristics, circulating tumor cell (CTC) changes, and/or pretreatment biopsy tissue
           gene expression patterns with the endpoint prostate research biopsy status.

      Treatment

      -Radiotherapy technique and dose, as well as the use of androgen deprivation therapy (ADT),
      are per the standard of care at the University of Miami, and are not specified in this
      protocol.

    <description>Pre-Treatment and Post-Treatment quantitative imaging parameters will be associated with circulating tumor cell (CTC) changes over time in prostate cancer (PCa) patients who receive treatment with RT ± androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) per standard of care. CTC and quantitative imaging changes will be determined at each of the planned research acquisition time points (8 days prior to completion of radiation therapy (RT), 3 months post-RT, 9 months post-RT, and 2-2.5 years post-treatment) comparing to the Baseline.</description>
