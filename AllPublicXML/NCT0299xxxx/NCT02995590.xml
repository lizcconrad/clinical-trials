    <textblock>
      Recently, the investigators have demonstrated a novel hyperpolarized helium tagging Magnetic
      Resonance Image (MRI) technique that is capable of directly, in vivo, and non-invasively
      measuring physiological lung deformation on a regional basis. This unique imaging technique
      holds great promise for assessing, validating, and improving the use of Deformable image
      Registration (DIR) algorithms in the lung. Our long term aim is to apply hyperpolarized gas
      tagging MRI to study lung biomechanics, develop more physiologically sound DIR algorithms for
      the lungs, and eventually improve radiotherapy of lung cancer. The overall aim of this
      application is to optimize the hyperpolarized helium tagging MRI technology and establish its
      usefulness for DIR assessment.

      Our first objective is to develop and optimize a methodology based on 3 Dimensional (3D)
      hyperpolarized helium tagging MRI of healthy subjects, for directly measuring lung
      deformation between inhalation and exhalation. Our second objective is to develop
      physiologically sound digital thorax phantoms based on helium-3 tagging MRI of healthy
      subjects and demonstrate their use for DIR assessment in the lung. These phantoms will be
      used to evaluate a range different DIR algorithms, by comparing the errors between the
      DIR-derived deformation vector fields and the ground truth represented in the digital
      phantom. Successful completion of these aims will yield a novel methodology for DIR
      assessment in the lung for radiotherapy.

    <description>A medical history will be obtained defining any present and past history of respiratory illnesses, medications, and hospitalizations and the ability to have MR imaging.
A urine pregnancy test will be done for women of childbearing potential, who report the possibility that they might be pregnant.
Before and after MR imaging, a physical exam, spirometry, and a baseline %PO2 will be performed.
During the MR imaging procedure, the subject's heart rate and blood oxygen saturation will be monitored using an MR compatible pulse oximeter.
Once positioned in the MR scanner, conventional proton images of the thorax will be obtained to define the lung boundaries for subsequent image alignment. -Free breathing conventional MR imaging will be performed.
Hyperpolarized helium 3 imaging will be performed at breath hold.</description>
