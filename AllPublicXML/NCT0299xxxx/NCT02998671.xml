  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is designed primarily to assess preliminary efficacy and safety of CJM112 in
      patients with moderate to severe inflammatory acne and to determine if CJM112 has an adequate
      clinical profile for further clinical development. In addition, sustainability of response
      and dose relationship will be explored.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Male and female subjects aged 18 to 45 years of age included, and otherwise in good
             health as determined by medical history, physical examination, vital signs, ECGs and
             laboratory tests at screening.

          -  Body weight between 50 and 120 kg, inclusive at screening.

          -  Patients with papulo-pustular acne vulgaris with between 25 and 100 facial
             inflammatory lesions (papules, pustules and nodules), and presence of non-inflammatory

             failed systemic therapy for inflammatory acne.

          -  No more than 5 facial inflammatory nodules at screening and baseline.

          -  Investigator's Global assessment (IGA) score of at least moderate (3) acne severity on

             Patients with evidence of tuberculosis may enter the trial afteradequate treatment has
             been started according to local regulations.

          -  Patients with known active Crohn's disease

          -  History of immunodeficiency diseases, including a positive HIV (ELISA and Western
