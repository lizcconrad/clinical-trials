      Prospective study design among subjects with MGD and qualifying for IPL therapy.

      Study testing done at baseline visit when subjects are scheduled for IPL therapy.
      Measurements will be made on day 15 (prior to second IPL sitting), Day 45 (prior to third IPL
      setting), Day 75 (fourth IPL setting) and Day 105 as needed (30 days after IPL setting 4).

      Subjects willing to come for follow up visits as scheduled and may not have instilled any
      artificial tears 2 hours prior to study measurements.

      No history of ocular infection or corneal degeneration/dystrophy No history of corneal
      refractive surgery and/or change in ocular medications in the last 2 months
