  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pediatric emergency department (PED) physicians frequently encounter children with symptoms
      that warrant evaluation of the optic disc for suspected increased intracranial pressure (ICP)
      such as headache, blurred vision, recurrent vomiting etc. Fundoscopic examination, by the PED
      physician, is considered an essential modality for assessment of the optic disc and the
      diagnosis of papilledema. Obtaining good visualization of the optic disc requires patient
      compliance, the ability to open the eyelids, the absence of opacities in the ocular media and
      a sufficiently large pupillary aperture. Hence, different levels of PED physician training,
      lack of cooperation, significant ocular or periorbital trauma, contraindications to mydriasis
      and severe photophobia may hinder direct fundoscopic evaluation.

      In the investigators' PED, children requiring fundoscopy are sent to a formal ophthalmologic
      examination. The investigators aim to evaluate the yield of optic disc height as measured
      with ocular point of care ultrasound to detect optic disc swelling in comparison to
      ophthalmologic examination as the gold standard.
