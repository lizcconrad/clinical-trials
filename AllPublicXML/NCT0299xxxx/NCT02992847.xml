  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Several recent studies have shown an increase in the signal intensity of the unenhanced
      T1-weighted magnetic resonance images in the brain of patients with normal renal functions
      and a breakdown of the blood-brain barrier. This hyper-intensity was specifically related to
      an accumulation of gadolinium based contrast agent. These studies were mainly conducted in
      patients with primary or secondary brain tumor. Multiple sclerosis is a particular model
      since it involves patients with a break of the blood-brain barrier, a long life expectancy,
      and who received many injections of contrast enhancing agents. In this context, it appears
      fundamental to know whether contrast agents accumulate in the brain for this disease. The
      French Observatory of Multiple Sclerosis is particularly suited to test this hypothesis, with
      homogeneous MRI data over several centers in France, and optimized sequences of 3D-T1 without
      injection. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the accumulation of two commonly used
      gadolinium based contrast materials (Dotarem and Multihance) in patients with multiple
      sclerosis, who received at least 5 injection of exclusively one of these contrast material.
