    <textblock>
      Researchers now know that treating chronic kidney disease (CKD) in its early stages can
      prevent dialysis and reduce heart problems that go along with kidney disease. Computerized
      tools may help primary care doctors to diagnose the disease earlier and computer reminders
      may help doctors to prescribe the best treatments. In this project the investigators will
      test computer reminders in primary care clinics to see if they improve treatment of early
      chronic kidney disease and to see if it can promote referral to nephrology.

      The investigators are conducting a randomized trial to determine the effect of a health
      information technology (HIT) application to calculate risk progression of end stage renal
      disease (ESRD). The primary outcome is the completion of the necessary tests for the risk
      prediction model (urine albumin to creatinine ratio, serum calcium, serum phosphate, serum
      albumin, and serum bicarbonate) for CKD patients in primary care. Secondary outcomes will
      include nephrology referrals, doubling of serum creatinine, initiation of hemodialysis, and
      primary care provider (PCP) satisfaction. In the analysis, all patients over the age of 18
      who have a visit with one of physicians involved in the trial during the intervention period
      will be eligible and patients with stage 3-5 CKD will be included. Physicians are the
      subjects in this study, as the intervention is a behavioral intervention for physicians. The
      physicians' patients will not actively be recruited and will only indirectly be affected by
      the study. The application creates blocks of patient appointments for each physician and
      randomly assigns patients to intervention and control arms within these blocks.
