  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a trial to investigate the pharmacokinetics (PK) and the safety of talazoparib in
      patients with advanced solid tumors and impaired hepatic function.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      At the end of the study, patients with no clinically significant toxicities, no
      contraindications to continue treatment with talazoparib, and no disease progression
      (underlying cancer progression) may be eligible to continue talazoparib treatment in a
      separate open-label extension study. The decision to allow the patient to continue dosing
      with talazoparib in an open-label extension (OLE) study will be based on potential overall
      benefit-risk and patient meeting eligibility criteria for OLE.

          5. Expected life expectancy of ≥ 3 months.

          6. Able to swallow the study drug (no contraindication to oral agents).

          7. Hepatic function at screening and enrollment as defined by the NCI organ dysfunction

          8. Adequate other organ function at screening and enrollment.

          9. Female patients of childbearing potential must have a negative serum pregnancy test at
             screening and must agree to use a highly effective form of contraception from the time
             of the first dose of study drug through 45 days after the last dose of study drug.

         10. Male patients must agree to use a condom when having sex with a pregnant woman or with
             a non-pregnant female partner of childbearing potential, from 21 days before the first

         11. Female patients must not be breastfeeding at screening nor during the study
             participation until 45 days after the last dose of the study drug.

             tests, and other trial procedures.

             of previous anticancer standard or investigational therapy, except treatment-related
             alopecia or laboratory abnormalities otherwise meeting eligibility requirements.

          3. Major surgery within 28 days prior to enrollment.
