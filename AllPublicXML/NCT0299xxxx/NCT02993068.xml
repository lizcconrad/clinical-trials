  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this research study is to test the effects of online genetic education alone or
      in combination with telephone genetic counseling in order to compare the two methods and the
      stress a person feels about their risk of cancer.

      Researchers also want to learn how these strategies may improve your understanding of
      genetics, your ability to complete a quiz about genetics, and your quality of life.

      This is an investigational study. The saliva-testing kit and genetic testing done in this
      study is FDA approved and will be processed in a Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments
      (CLIA) certified laboratory.

      Up to 3000 participants will be enrolled in this study.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Support and education about genetic testing is usually given before and after genetic testing
      is done. Researchers in this study will look at how combining different interventions before
      and after testing may help participants improve understanding.

      If you are eligible to take part in this study and you agree to take part in this study, you
      will be randomly assigned (as in the roll of the dice) to 1 of 4 study groups:

        -  Participants in Group A will watch an online educational video before the testing, and
           receive an online test results report after the testing.

        -  Participants in Group B will watch an online educational video before the testing, and
           receive an online test results report with telephone genetic counseling after the
           testing.

        -  Participants in Group C will watch an online educational video with telephone genetic
           counseling before the testing, and receive an online test results report with telephone
           genetic counseling after the testing.

        -  Participants in Group D will watch an online educational video with telephone genetic
           counseling before the testing, and receive an online test results report after the
           testing.

      Please note that if you test positive for a genetic mutation, you will be prompted to speak
      to a genetic counselor, no matter which group you are assigned. A study genetic counselor
      will be available to speak to you if you desire, regardless of the study group you are in.

      Informed Consent Comprehension Questions:

      After reading this informed consent, you will be asked 5 questions about the information in
      this informed consent to help ensure that you have understood this information. You must
      answer those questions correctly in order to electronically sign this consent and begin the
      study.

      Baseline Questionnaire:

      If you are approved to sign this informed consent based on the results of the above informed
      consent questions, you will receive an e-mail with a link to complete the baseline
      questionnaire. All questionnaires will be completed through REDCap, a secure, web-based
      application used to collect data for research studies that you can access from your phone,
      tablet, or computer. These will include questions about decision-making, stress and anxiety,
      your well-being, and your genetic and cancer- risk knowledge. The questionnaires will take
      about 20 minutes to complete. You must complete these questionnaires in order to move on to
      the next part of the study.

      The Genetic Testing and Counseling/Education Process:

        -  After completing the baseline questionnaires, you will receive an e-mail to connect you
           to the website for Color Genomics, the company that will provide the genetic testing
           services for this study.

        -  You will watch a welcome video, which will provide information about genetics, the genes
           and genetic mutations that will be tested, and possible test results.

        -  After watching the welcome video, you will be directed to create a personal Color
           Genomics account that will allow you to enter your personal and family history
           information, keep track of your genetic testing kit, and receive your genetic test
           results. You will provide your contact information (including shipping address), as well
           as the name and contact information for your local doctor. Any and all information you
           provide to Color Genomics will be shared with the MD Anderson research team.

        -  Participants in Group C and Group D will then make an appointment with a genetic
           counselor before beginning the genetic testing process. Participants in Groups A and B
           will be provided with the option to speak to a genetic counselor if they want to, but
           will not be required to do so for this study.

        -  You will be mailed an FDA-approved saliva collection kit from Color Genomics, which will
           be ordered by Dr. Elizabeth Swisher (a gynecologic oncologist at the University of
           Washington and study co-investigator) or Dr. Douglas Levine (a gynecologic oncologist at
           NYU Langone Health and study collaborator). When you receive it in the mail, you will
           use the kit's unique barcode number to activate it and link it to your online account. A
           video on the website will show you how to provide a large enough saliva sample. It will
           also contain instructions for how to properly package and mail your kit back to Color
           Genomics, using a pre-paid shipping package.

      Getting the Test Results:

      It usually takes about 6-8 weeks to get the results back from this genetic test. You will
      receive an email, letting you know that your results are available for review through your
      Color Genomics account.

      Genetic Counseling:

      Participants in Groups B and C will need to make an appointment with a genetic counselor
      before viewing the genetic test results. Participants in Groups A and D will be able to view
      their results online without speaking to a genetic counselor, but you will be given the
      option to speak to a genetic counselor if you would like. You may be given contact
      information for a local genetic counselor.

      Depending on the results of your genetic testing, the study staff may attempt to schedule a
      post-test telephone genetic counseling call 3 times. If you do not respond to the study staff
      to schedule the call within 1 week after the third attempt, the study staff will deliver the
      results online with a note to please call and schedule a counseling session. You will also be
      given the option to schedule a phone call with a genetic counselor on the Color Genomics
      website if you want to speak to a genetic counselor at any point during the study. Your
      genetic test results will be shared with the MD Anderson research team.

      Follow-up Questionnaires:

      You will be contacted by e-mail to complete quality-of-life questionnaires at 3 time- points.
      You will be asked to complete the questionnaires through the REDCap online database at 3
      months, 1 year, and 2 years after having received your genetic test results. The
      questionnaires should be completed within 1 month (for the first one) or 3 months (for the
      other two) after you receive the email. You will be sent reminder emails if these
      questionnaires have not been completed in time. It should take you no more than 20 minutes to
      complete each questionnaire.

      Other Information Color Genomics (referred to as &quot;Color&quot; throughout this paragraph) offers
      the option of consenting to storing your sample and DNA (genetic material), commonly referred
      to as DNA bio-banking, at Color's expense to allow you to have additional testing through
      Color in the future. If you choose to allow Color to store your sample, Color may store your
      sample indefinitely (forever), but you may remove your sample from storage by updating your
      own account settings. Your participation in Color Genomics' DNA storage will not affect your
      participation in this research study, and your decision for this option will be decided when
      you consent to genetic testing with Color Genomics (the testing laboratory). Data involving
      this optional procedure will not be shared with MD Anderson. MD Anderson will not have
      oversight over your samples stored at Color Genomics.

      Length of Study:

      Your total participation on this study will last about 2 years, including follow-up. You may
      be contacted regarding participation in future studies.
