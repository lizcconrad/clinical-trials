      The purpose of the study is to evaluate the effect of changes in the care environment in
      pediatric radiotherapy. The definitions of the changes is a part of the study, and is
      constructed in collaboration with the institute of design at Umeå University. The
      implementation is however not part of the study, but done as part of Clinical routine.

      The study consist of two parts, where the first 1.5 years are a Control phase where the
      changes are designed and also function as a baseline period. The following 1.5 years are the
      case period where the Changes that are accepted for Clinical implementation are implemented.

      The impact of the changes are evaluated using surveys and interviews of both parents and
      children
