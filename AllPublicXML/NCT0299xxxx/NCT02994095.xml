      This was a pilot study to assess the feasibility and acceptability of training Community
      Health Agents in Motivational Interviewing in real-life primary care centers.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Rates of noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) such as type 2 diabetes are escalating in low and
      middle-income countries such as Brazil. Scalable primary care-based interventions are needed
      to improve self-management and clinical outcomes of adults with diabetes. This pilot study
      examines the feasibility, acceptability, and outcomes of training community health agents
      (CHAs) in Motivational Interviewing (MI)-based counseling for patients with poorly controlled
      diabetes in a primary care center in São Paulo, Brazil.

      Nineteen salaried CHAs participated in 32 hours of training in MI and behavioral action
      planning. With support from booster training sessions, they used these skills in their
      regular monthly home visits over a 6 month period with 57 diabetes patients with baseline
      HbA1cs &gt; 7.0%. The primary outcome was patients' reports of the quality of diabetes care as
      measured by the Portuguese version of the Patient Assessment of Chronic Illness Care (PACIC)
      scale. Secondary outcomes included changes in patients' reported diabetes self-management
      behaviors and in A1c, blood pressure, cholesterol and triglycerides. CHAs' fidelity to and
      experiences with the intervention were also assessed.
