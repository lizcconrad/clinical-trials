  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study primary objective is to assess the concordance of T790M resistance mutation testing
      from hospital-based laboratories with T790M resistance mutation testing from a central
      laboratory.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center testing study. 800 patients from 80 different hospital sites will have
      local T790M testing by different molecular testing platforms and have central testing by
      Cobas platform. These two sets of data (local T790M testing and central T790M testing) will
      be analysed and compared to assess the concordance of these T790M testing platforms.
