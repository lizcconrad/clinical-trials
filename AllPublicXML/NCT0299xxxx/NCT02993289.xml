  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Medication-overuse headache (MOH) is a disabling condition, yet treatable. According to
      European guidelines and based on evidence, multidisciplinary detoxification is the first
      choice of treatment for MOH. However, consensus about the details in such detoxification
      programs is lacking. Contrary, other headache specialists believe more in treating chronic
      headache with medication overuse with single-therapy of prophylaxis and no withdrawal of
      acute medication, based on randomized controlled double-blinded placebo trial with
      prophylaxes. Only a single RCT has compared single-therapy with prophylaxis to
      detoxification. However there was no significant difference.

      AIM:

        1. To compare three different treatment protocols in order to improve the therapy of MOH.

        2. To test several baseline variables for being potential predictors for good treatment
           outcome.

        3. To examine the role of epigenetics in MOH.
