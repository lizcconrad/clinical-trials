  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is the first clinical trial with ADRECIZUMAB. The purpose of this clinical trial to
      identify safety and tolerability of different doses of ADRECIZUMAB in healthy volunteers.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Adrenomedullin (ADM) is a natural occurring 52 amino acid peptide which is mainly expressed
      in endothelial and smooth muscle cells. ADM plasma levels are increased in patients with
      sepsis and related with severity of disease. ADM is a key regulator of vasotonus and of
      endothelial integrity in sepsis.

      ADRECIZUMAB is an antibody against the N-terminus of ADM which only partially inhibits the
      bioactivity of ADM. Several septic animal studies have shown that administration of
      ADRECIZUMAB leads to reduced catecholamine demand, improved renal function, improved fluid
      balance and improved survival.

      The administration of ADRECIZUMAB to rodents and non-human primates (NHP) has been tolerated
      very well. Single dose and repeated administrations over 14 days to rats and NHP in the GLP
      toxicology and safety study have not shown any clinical side-effects or histopathological
      findings.

      Based on these data the starting dose for human beings should be 0.5 mg/kg ADRECIZUMAB as
      single infusion over 1 hour and should be increased up to 8 mg/kg.
