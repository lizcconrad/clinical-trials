  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if there is a difference in patient outcomes with
      general anesthesia versus spinal anesthesia when given in addition to popliteal and adductor
      canal nerve blocks for foot and ankle surgery. Popliteal and adductor canal nerve blocks are
      injections of local anesthetic agents near nerves in the back and front of the knee going to
      the foot and ankle that provide numbness during and after surgery. These peripheral nerve
      blocks offer good pain control and reduce the need for opioids (opioids are pain medications
      such as morphine, Dilaudid, and oxycodone). General anesthesia involves the flow of oxygen
      and anesthesia gas through a tube which, along with additional intravenous medications,
      causes unconsciousness and unawareness of sensations during surgery. Spinal anesthesia
      involves an injection of local anesthetic in the lower back, which causes numbness below the
      waist. In addition to spinal anesthesia, a sedative is typically given intravenously to cause
      relaxation and sleepiness throughout surgery.

      General, spinal, and nerve block anesthesia are all routinely used for surgery at the
      Hospital for Special Surgery. General or spinal anesthesia is typically used in addition to
      peripheral nerve blocks during foot and ankle surgery to 1) allow the surgeons to use a thigh
      tourniquet to reduce bleeding, 2) provide anesthesia earlier, and 3) prevent unwanted
      movement. However, it is unclear whether general or spinal anesthesia provides better patient
      outcomes when given with peripheral nerve blocks. Some reports show that on its own, spinal
      anesthesia has advantages over general anesthesia in terms of side effects such as nausea and
      pain. However, these advantages may also be gained from combining peripheral nerve blocks
      with general anesthesia. Spinal anesthesia can be associated with headache and backache,
      although headache and backache can also happen after operations performed with general
      anesthesia. A previous study at the Hospital for Special Surgery showed low rates of nausea
      among patients who received nerve blocks with spinal anesthesia, and no nausea among patients
      who received a nerve block with general anesthesia. Therefore, the primary aim of this study
      is to determine if, as a treatment, either general or spinal anesthesia has advantages over
      the other treatment in terms of readiness for discharge, side effects, pain and patient
      satisfaction in an ambulatory foot and ankle population.
