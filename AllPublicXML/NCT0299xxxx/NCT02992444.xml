    <description>This is a sub-study testing the effect of real output applied under two adhesive strips on the skin after 8 hours.
There is one visit:
Two adhesive strips (standard adhesive strip and Experimental adhesive strip)are applied on the peristomal skin and allowed to sit for 8hours before being removed.</description>
