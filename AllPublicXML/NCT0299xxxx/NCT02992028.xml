      1. Treatment of rotator cuff tear The rotator cuff tear is the most demanding part of the
           shoulder surgery. Rotator cuff degeneration is thought to be the largest cause of
           rotator cuff tear.

           As the field of shoulder surgery evolves, the diagnosis and surgical treatment of the
           rotator cuff tear was increased. Repair and reconstruction of the rotator cuff tear
           annually more than 300,000 have been performed according to US statistics.

           Rotator cuff repair is a successful procedure, both objectively and subjectively, with
           regard to pain relief and functional outcome.

        2. postoperative pain management after rotator cuff repair Shoulder surgeries are
           associated with a level of postoperative pain requiring opioid use for several days. The
           opioid requirements after shoulder surgery have been reported to be similar to those
           required after gastrectomy or thoracotomy, which might cause several opioid-related side
           effects, such as nausea and vomiting, pruritus, urinary distention, and constipation.
           Although the introduction of arthroscopy has reduced postoperative pain, a considerable
           proportion of patients suffer from moderate to severe acute postoperative pain, as its
           benefit is typically apparent after a few days. Consequently, proactive pain control is
           also required during the first 24-48 h after arthroscopic shoulder surgeries, just like
           in open surgeries. Adequate pain management during the immediate postoperative period is
           not only important for patient satisfaction and well-being, but also for facilitating
           postoperative rehabilitation and preventing persistent postsurgical pain.

      Recently preoperative intravenous vitamin C has shown to increase the analgesic effect after
      otorhinolaryngologic surgery and thoracic surgery. Vitamin C is a water-soluble and known to
      have anti oxidant action, and fewer side effects.

      However, there is no report about the analgesic effect of vitamin C after arthroscopic
      rotator cuff repair.

      The purpose of this trial was to compare the effects of a intravenous vitamin C injection on
      postoperative pain and opioid consumption versus non-treated group after arthroscopic rotator
      cuff repair.
