      Hospital physicians are increasingly facing budgetary constraints that might have an impact
      on individual medical decisions (i.e. diagnostic or therapeutic decisions). This might
      translate into role conflict and ambiguity. We explore the medical decision-makingprocess of
      physicians usingfunctional MRI. Twenty hospital physicians will be asked to make simulated
      medical decisions during fMRI acquisitions, with and without explicit budgetary constraints.
      We will compare the fMRI data between the 2 modalities.
