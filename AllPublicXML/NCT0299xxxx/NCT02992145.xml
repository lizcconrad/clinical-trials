      This study aims to compare between androgens level (serum total and free testosterone) in
      women with preeclampsia and normal ones in the third trimester of pregnancy (28-40 weeks).

      Methodology:

      All women in this study will be subjected to:

        -  All women are candidates for this study according to inclusion and exclusion criteria.

        -  History taking with special emphases on last menstrual period to determine the exact
           Gestational age.

        -  A reliable date is defined as the occurrence of regular menstrual cycles (28±7 days) in
           patients who have not taken oral contraceptives during the three months before
           conception and have no irregular bleeding.

        -  General and abdominal examination for each patient to determine those patients matching
           with the inclusion criteria.

        -  Preeclampsia refers to the new onset of hypertension (systolic blood pressure ≥140 mmHg
           ,or diastolic blood pressure≥ 90 mmHg ,or both, measured on two occasions &gt; 6 hours
           apart) and either proteinuria or end organ dysfunction after 20 weeks of gestation in a
           previously normotensive woman.

        -  At Ain Shams University Hospitals, the investigator will use ELISA based test system
           intended for the quantitative measurement of total and free testosterone for patients of
           both groups.
