    <textblock>
      The primary objectives of this study are to evaluate the efficacy, safety, and tolerability
      of the treatment with sofosbuvir velpatasvir (SOF/VEL) fixed-dose combination (FDC) with
      ribavirin (RBV) for 12 weeks in participants with chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection
      and Child-Pugh-Turcotte (CPT) class C cirrhosis.
