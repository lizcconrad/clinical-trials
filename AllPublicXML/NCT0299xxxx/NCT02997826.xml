  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      From birth to 5 months, milk is the essential and unique food of the newborn. The French
      National Nutrition Program (PNNS) recommends exclusive breastfeeding &quot;up to 6 months and at
      least 4 months for a healthy benefit&quot;. However, only 36% of infants 0-6 months of age are
      exclusively breastfed worldwide. Some mothers choose to give infant formula to their baby in
      the first few months of life. This decision may be a personal choice or be imposed by
      pathophysiological situations.

      The nutritional requirements of the infant are specific, which implies adequate nutrition.
      Infant formulas and follow-up formulas are therefore complex products, specially developed
      for a group of vulnerable consumers. In fact, the compositional and information requirements
      for infant formula are highly regulated.

      Even clinical studies are not required to market an infant formula, it is important to obtain
      objective date on infant growth. Therefore, this study proposes to evaluate the effect of the
      consumption of an infant formula on the growth of infants from 0 to 6 months in comparison
      with the growth curves of the World Health Organization (WHO).
