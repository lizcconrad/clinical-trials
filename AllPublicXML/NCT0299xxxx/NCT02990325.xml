      The purpose of the ABX464-005 study is to characterize the systemic and mucosal immunological
      sequelae associated with exposure to ABX464 and to explore selected immunological endpoints,
      compartmental pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics.

      The purpose of the ABX464-005 study is to characterize the systemic and mucosal immunological
      sequelae associated with exposure to ABX464 and to explore selected immunological endpoints,
      compartmental pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics. The site will screen and enroll 12
      HIV-infected subjects who will receive 150 mg ABX464 orally once daily for 28 days (Cohort
      1). Following completion of this cohort a further 24 subjects will be enrolled: 12
      HIV-uninfected subjects will receive 50 mg ABX464 orally once daily for 28 days (Cohort 2)
      and 12 HIV-infected subjects (Cohort 3) who will 50 mg ABX464 orally once daily for 84 days.

             to viral hepatitis such as hepatitis B, hepatitis C, active tuberculosis, active
             syphilis [i.e. currently treated], HTLV-1, HTLV-2).

          -  Acute, chronic or history of clinically relevant pulmonary, cardiovascular,

             neuropathy or unstable CNS pathology, angina or cardiac arrhythmias, or any other
             clinically significant medical problems as determined by physical examination and/or
             laboratory screening tests and/or medical history;

          -  Severe hepatic impairment;

          -  Acute, chronic or history of immunodeficiency or autoimmune disease other than HIV
             infection;
