  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to prospectively validate treatment benefit of an individualized
      treatment concept based on molecular profiling (MP) from paraffin-embedded tumor tissue
      sections obtained before the start of treatment (real time biopsy).
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The treatment concept will be considered to be of clinical benefit for the individual patient
      if a progression-free survival (PFS) ratio (PFS on MP-based therapy / best PFS achieved by
      prior therapy) will be &gt; 1.0 thus generating a patient cohort with this very property.
      Thereby, the null hypothesis (that â‰¤ 40 % of this patient population would have a PFS ratio
      of &gt; 1.0) will be evaluated with each patient being his own control. For tumor types with
      high numbers of patients per cohort, the overall response rate (ORR) will be evaluated.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

        Consenting patients of &gt;19 years with advanced cancer fulfilling the criteria of having:

          -  an advanced malignancy with metastatic spread refractory to conventional treatment

          -  a life expectancy of &gt;4 months,

          -  the possibility to access and biopsy tumour material within 4 weeks before onset of
             individualized treatment,

          -  a malignancy amenable to further treatment options with either cytotoxic drugs,
             tyrosine kinase inhibitors, monoclonal antibodies or related molecules with
             anti-proliferative potential to cancer cells, as assessed by the ex vivo analysis and
             a likelihood of treatment response according to the mathematical model (all outlined
             in detail above),

          -  agreed to participate by their signature on an informed consent form are eligible.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Presence of further treatment options, as defined by NCCN guidelines which are
             available in Austria representing a possible further treatment-related response by
             conventional therapies according to generally accepted medical evidence.

          -  No fresh and viable tumor material available.

          -  Current use of therapeutic warfarin.

          -  Unresolved toxicity of National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for
             Adverse Events, version 4.0 (NCI CTCAE v4.0) Grade 2 or higher from previous
             anti-cancer therapy, except alopecia.

          -  Presence of active gastrointestinal disease or other condition that will interfere
             significantly with the absorption of drugs.

          -  A history of known Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV), Hepatitis B Virus (HBV), or
             Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) infection.

          -  A history of known glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency.

          -  History of other malignancy. Subjects who have been disease-free for 5 years or those
             with a history of completely resected non-melanoma skin cancer or successfully treated
             in situ carcinoma are eligible.

          -  Uncontrolled medical conditions (i.e, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, etc),
             psychological, familial, sociological, or geographical conditions that do not permit
             compliance with the protocol)

          -  unwillingness or inability to follow the procedures required in the protocol.

          -  pregnant or lactating females.

          -  History of alcohol or drug abuse within 6 months prior to screening.

          -  No informed consent available.
