    <textblock>
      The principal objective is to assess the diagnostic accuracy of the PoC assay (Genedrive,
      Epistem) to detect HCV RNA against the reference standard of commercial real-time polymerase
      chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay (RealTime HCV, Abbott) using stored heparinized plasma from
      patients with chronic hepatitis C and non-infected controls.
