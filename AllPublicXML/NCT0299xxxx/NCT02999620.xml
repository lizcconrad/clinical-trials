  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This clinical investigation will determine the fat losses in stool associated with alpha-CD
      use as compared to placebo when ingested with a standardized liquid breakfast (100 microCi of
      [3H]triolein) and 20 microCi of [14C]tripalmitin). The ingested dose will be 2 g of α-CD at
      each of three meals per day for 2 days.

      Eight subjects will be recruited in a two-way crossover design consisting of two treatment
      periods.

      Treatment 1 requires all subjects to receive α-CD and a meal containing the fatty acid
      radiotracers Treatment 2 requires all subjects to receive placebo and a meal containing the
      fatty acid radiotracers All subjects will be observed for 48 hours as an in-patient, and a
      further 24 hours as an out-patient following the meal containing the radiotracer and will
      then undergo at least a further ≥ 14 day washout period before crossing over to the alternate
      treatment.

      All subjects randomized to the α-CD treatment arm will receive 2 g of α-CD (2 x 1 g tablets),
      at each of three meals per day for 2 days. During the placebo phase, all subjects will
      receive two identical-looking placebo tablets.

    <description>All subjects randomized to receive Alpha-cycoldextrin will orally ingest two tablets containing Alpha-cyclodextrin, with their standardized liquid breakfast (100 micro Ci of [3H]triolein and 20 micro Ci of [14C]tripalmitin). The tablets will be consumed with 150 ml of still water immediately prior to consuming each meal. Subjects will be observed for a period of 48 hours as an in-patient, and then an additional 24 hours as an out-patient. During this time they will undergo a meal fatty acid metabolism study, through blood and fecal sampling, to assess meal fatty acid oxidation and storage.</description>

    <description>Alpha-cyclodextrin (α-CD) is a soluble dietary fiber that has a history of use in foods and as a pharmaceutical excipient. Recently the ability of the fiber to bind to dietary fat has led to further investigation of the possible health benefits of dietary supplementation with this fiber.</description>
