  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Adequate quality of bowel preparation(BP) is important for colonoscopy. Several guidelines
      recommend that split-dose of 4L PEG should be used as a standard regime for BP. However, the
      high-volume PEG still results in lower compliance to the regime and increased cost.

      Some high risk factors for inadequate BP have been identified, including old age,
      constipation, diabetes, the use of narcotics and prior history of inadequate BP. For
      average-risk patients without the high risk factors, the procedure of BP could be easier. In
      the previous study, with the use of single dose of 2L PEG, more than 90% of average-risk
      patients achieved adequate BP. Here investigators hypothesized that compared with the
      standard split dose of 4L PEG, single dose of 2L PEG may be not inferior in BP quality while
      may be accompanied with better tolerability.

    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>The adequacy of bowel preparation is defined as Boston Bowel Preparation Scale (BBPS), a 4-point scoring system applied to each of 3 broad regions of the colon: the right side, the transverse section, and the left side. They were summed to give the total BBPS score, which ranged from 0 to 9.The withdrawal procedure was recorded by vedios. The BBPS and segmental scores in each segment were judged by one endoscopist who was familiar with the criteria of BBPS and blinded to group allocation.</description>

    <description>All patients at average risk for inadequate BP were given instructions for bowel preparation through phone call a day before scheduled colonoscopy. the participants began to drink the first 2 L of PEG at 7:00-9:00 PM on the day before colonoscopy at a rate of 250 mL every 15 minutes. On the day of the procedure, patients took the remaining 2 L 4-6 hours before colonoscopy.</description>
