      The aim of the study is to retrospectively evaluate the outcome of adjuvant concurrent
      chemoradiation delivered to patients with high grade non-metastatic soft tissue sarcomas of
      the extremities at the investigators institution paired with patients treated by adjuvant
      radiation therapy

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  All patients consecutive enrolled from 1990 to 2004 with soft tissue sarcomas located
             either in the limbs or girdles, superficial or deep, grade 2 or 3 (FNCLCC), who were
             first treated with radical conservative surgery and adjuvant RT atto a minimum
             biologically equivalent dose of 45 Gy, with or without concurrent adjuvant
             chemotherapy.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  A patient record captured outside the time frame from 1990 to 2004 with trunk,
             retro-peritoneum, and head and neck localisations, grade 1 histology and, PS≥3, were
             excluded as well as and those plus patients who had received neoadjuvant treatment.
             Differentiated liposarcomas, dermatofibrosarcomas protuberans, extraskeletal Ewing's
             sarcomas, primitive neuroectodermal tumors and osteosarcomas were also excluded due to
             specific treatment strategies.
