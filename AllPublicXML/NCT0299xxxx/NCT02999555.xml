      A molecular study of follicular fluid aspirated from ovarian follicles during routine in
      vitro fertilization treatment, after the eggs were identified and separated.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Ovarian stimulation is a routine part of in vitro fertilization treatment: this process
      involves an inflammatory response in the developing follicles. We still do not completely
      understand the complex interactions leading to the maturation of the egg and the multiple
      interactions of the egg with its supporting cells. In this study we will assess follicular
      fluid, letf over after the eggs were identified and separated, for the presence of
      inflammatory mediators, dendritic cells , vasorin and soluble Flt1. The presence and
      quantification of these factors, as well as their correlation with the size of the aspirated
      follicle is the focus of this study.
