      The pilot study is intended to show the efficacy of intravesical electrical stimulation in
      treating overactive bladder with or without frequency and/or urgency urinary incontinence.

      The EMED Technologies detrusetTM intravesical electrical stimulation (IVES) catheter is
      indicated for use with the EMED detrusanTM 500 electrical generator for the treatment of
      overactive bladder and urge urinary incontinence (UI) in women who are not satisfied with or
      cannot tolerate other conservative treatments. EMED is interested in conducting a prospective
      randomized multi-center study of IVES therapy vs conventional UI treatments. In order to gain
      sufficient knowledge of the treatment effect and variability of IVES therapy to power an RCT,
      a pilot study will be initially conducted.

      The pilot study is intended to show the efficacy of IVES in treating overactive bladder with
      or without frequency and/or urgency urinary incontinence with safety profile of IVES being no
      worse than with standard urological catheters.

      A primary endpoint at 3 months showing reduction in incontinence events via a 7-level patient
      global impression of improvement will be established. Secondary endpoints will include PCI
      for subsets of symptoms, 3 day voiding diary, and patient satisfaction questionnaires.

      Follow up at end of therapy and 3 months from the first therapy session will be conducted.
      6-month, 9-month, and 12-month follow up can be conducted to establish durability of IVES
      therapy if it is found to be effective at 3 months after the first treatment

    <description>This pilot study group is a prospective observational study. It is not blinded and there is no control. This is a single arm study (treatment group) which will receive intravesical electrical stimulation with a total of 8 therapy sessions, each lasting 15 minutes. The sessions will be done in a serial fashion, 2 per week for 4 consecutive weeks.</description>

    <description>There will be a total of 8 therapy sessions, each lasting 15 minutes. The sessions will be done in a serial fashion, 2 per week for 4 consecutive weeks. The electrical parameters utilized will be those previously determined to be appropriate for OAB and UUI. As the beneficial effect of electrical stimulation is dependent on a &quot;maximal&quot; level of stimulation, the stimulation voltage will be increased during the first minute of treatment until the maximum tolerated by the patient is established and then backed-off by 1-2 Volts. The therapy will continue for 15 minutes in total for each session. The VAS will be marked by the patient before each treatment session throughout the therapy period, and other questionnaires will be administered.</description>
