  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this randomized controlled field trial is to determine whether a liquefied
      petroleum gas (LPG) stove and fuel distribution intervention reduces personal and kitchen
      exposure to household air pollutants and improves cardiopulmonary health outcomes when
      compared to usual cooking practices with open-fire biomass-burning stoves in adult women aged
      25-64 years.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Randomized, controlled field trial of an LPG stove and fuel distribution intervention
      compared to standard cooking practices with open-fire biomass-burning stoves in the homes of
      participating adult women aged 25-64 years. The aim is to determine whether provision of
      cleaner fuels will result in important reductions in household air pollutants and
      consequently in an improvement in cardiopulmonary health outcomes over a one-year period.
      Participants randomly assigned to the intervention arm will receive a free LPG stove and fuel
      delivered to their homes during the one-year intervention period. Participants randomly
      assigned to the control arm will receive a free LPG stove and vouchers that can be used to
      obtain free fuel for an entire year at LPG fuel distribution centers at the end of the
      one-year intervention period. All participants will be followed for a second year to assess
      patterns and impacts of sustained use (intervention arm) and initial adoption (control arm).
