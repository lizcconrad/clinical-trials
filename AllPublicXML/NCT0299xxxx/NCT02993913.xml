  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Phase I dose escalating trial. Primary objectives of this study are to assess the safety and
      tolerability of Simmiparib following single and multiple oral doses in patients with advanced
      solid malignancies, to determine the maximum tolerance dose (MTD) and dose limiting toxicity
      (DLT), and pharmacokinetic profile.

      The Secondary objective is to observe the preliminary antitumor effect of Simmiparib.
