      The data registry will increase the knowledge of outcomes for treatment of focal cartilage
      defects of the patella treated with the BioPoly RS Patella Implant and will allow monitoring
      of the clinical safety and performance of the device and surgical implantation kit

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Age 21 years and older

          -  Cartilage lesion(s) located in the facets of the patella that have failed prior
             therapy (conservative or surgical)

          -  Symptomatic lesions classified as ICRS grade 2, 3, or 4

          -  Lesion size may not exceed 3.1 cm2 and must be circumscribed by a 15 mm or 20 mm
             circle of normal or nearly normal (ICRS Grade 0 or 1) cartilage, with an overall depth
             less than 4 mm from the articulating surface

          -  Subchondral bone quality sufficient to support the implant

          -  Understanding and willingness to comply with the post-operative rehabilitation
             instructions and follow-up visits.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Body mass index (BMI) ≥ 35

          -  Generalized degenerative or autoimmune arthritis

          -  Gout

          -  Uncorrected chronic malalignment of the patella (may be corrected at the same time as
             the implantation of the BioPoly device).

          -  Uncorrected ligamentous instability (may be corrected at the same time as the
             implantation of the BioPoly device).

          -  Kissing lesion on femur

          -  More than one implant required to accommodate lesion

          -  Allergy to ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene (UHMWPE), or hyaluronan/
             hyaluronic acid (HA)

          -  Use with opposing articulating femoral components

          -  Any concomitant painful or disabling disease of the spine, hips, or lower limbs that
             would interfere with evaluation of the afflicted knee

          -  Pregnant, prisoner, vulnerable population, or unable to provide informed consent.
