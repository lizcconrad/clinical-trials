  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Based on the efficacy of immunotherapies in advanced disease with a reasonable safety
      profile/tolerability we could hypothetisize that, immunotherapy should work best in the
      situation of minimal residual disease, Two clinical trials are ongoing to test the role of
      immunotherapeutic agents in the adjuvant setting: PEARLS trial, a randomized phase III trial
      with anti-PD1 monoclonal antibody pembrolizumab (MK-3475 or pembrolizumab) versus placebo for
      patients with early stage NSCLC after resection and completion of standard adjuvant therapy,
      and the second randomized phase III trial (NCT02273375) will evaluate the efficacy of an
      anti-PD-L1 (MEDI 4736) for a maximum of 12 months versus placebo as adjuvant therapy in
      completed resected stage IB-IIIA NSCLC and completed standard ACT.

      The role of immunotherapeutic approaches for NSCLC in the neoadjuvant setting is currently
      unknown. However, based on the survival efficacy of immunotherapeutic strategies in advanced
      NSCLC where the tumor has not been removed which could produce higher immunogenicity and
      based on the efficacy of neoadjuvant treatments in NSCLC, we propose to test the safety and
      efficacy of atezolizumab as neoadjuvant therapy in subjects diagnosed with stage IB, II, or
      IIIA (non N2) NSCLC and who are deemed suitable for surgical resection.

      Clinical staging of NSCLC is based on computed tomography (CT) of the chest and upper
      abdomen, brain CT or magnetic resonance imaging and 18F-FDG PETscan to rule out metastatic
      disease and assess the potential for curative-intent resection. Adjuvant chemotherapy will be
      performed according the standard clinical guidelines.
