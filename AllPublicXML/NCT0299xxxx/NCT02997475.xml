  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate areas of the brain responsible for
      self-regulation in adult women who have never had an eating disorder with women who have
      bulimia nervosa. More specifically, investigators are interested in changes in brain
      activation (e.g., changes in blood flow and oxygen use) when inhibiting responses and
      regulating emotions. Data collection will rely on a technology called functional magnetic
      resonance imaging (fMRI).
