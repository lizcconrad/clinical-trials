  <brief_title>3-Month Home-based Training With Whole Body Vibration Device in Patients With PAH (GALILEO-PAH-HOME)</brief_title>
  <acronym>GALILEOHOME</acronym>
  <official_title>Influence of Training With Whole Body Vibration Device on Quality of Life (QoL), Exercise Capacity, as Well as on the Effects of Muscle Power and Muscle Function in Patients With Pulmonal Arterial Hypertension (PAH) in an Extended 3-month Home Based Training. Background and Rationale for the Proposal: Capacity and the Ability to Exercise, in Patients With PAH is Limited. Primary Scientific Question Addressed:Changes in Muscle Power, Changes in 6-Minute Walk Distance (6MWD) and Changes in QoL Are to be Evaluated.</official_title>

  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In order to evaluate Long term effects of whole Body Vibration (wbv) in patients with PAH and
      CTEPH patients will get a training device to use at home for 3 months. Patients in the
      Intervention group will be introduced in the training program on the wbv-device in the study
      center 3-4 times and baseline Parameters will be collected before start of the home based
      training. Patients randomized into the placebo arm be introduced into the training program
      according to the interventional arm but not perfoming the exercises on the wbv-device but on
      the floor.

      Screening (day -21 until day -7): Subjects will be evaluated according to In- and Exclusion
      critera

      Randomization (day -7): Subjects will be randomized to either Intervention Group (training on
      wbv platform) or non-Intervention Group (training without wbv).
