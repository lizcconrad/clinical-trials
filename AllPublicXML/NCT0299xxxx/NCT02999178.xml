      The aim of the current study is to investigate the efficacy and safety of nintedanib over 52
      weeks in patients with Progressive Fibrosing Interstitial Lung Disease (PF-ILD) defined as
      patients who present with features of diffuse fibrosing lung disease of &gt;10% extent on
      high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) and whose lung function and respiratory symptoms
      or chest imaging have worsened despite treatment with unapproved medications used in clinical
      practice to treat ILD. There is currently no efficacious treatment available for PF-ILD.
      Based on its efficacy and safety in Idiopatic Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF), it is anticipated
      that Nintedanib will be a new treatment option for patients with PF-ILD.

                  changes on chest imaging [Note: Changes attributable to comorbidities e.g.
                  infection, heart failure must be excluded. Unapproved medications used in the
                  clinical practice to treat ILD include but are not limited to corticosteroid,
                  azathioprine, mycophenolate mofetil (MMF), n-acetylcysteine (NAC), rituximab,

             study drug. The justification for decision needs to be documented. Laboratory
             parameters that are found to be abnormal at Visit 1 are allowed to be re-tested (once)
             if it is thought to be a measurement error (i.e. there was no abnormal result of this
             test in the recent history of the patient and there is no related clinical sign) or
