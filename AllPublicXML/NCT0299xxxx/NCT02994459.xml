  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      People who are obese often have insulin resistance (inability of insulin to properly control
      blood sugar) and high blood sugar. However, not all people with obesity have this problem.
      About one third of people with obesity have normal sugar metabolism (the way your body uses
      sugar). The reasons why some people with obesity have a problem with blood sugar control and
      others do not are not entirely clear. It is thought that impaired muscle sugar uptake is the
      main problem related to high blood sugar in people with obesity. However, adipose tissue (fat
      tissue) also consumes a substantial amount of blood sugar. Therefore, it is unclear whether
      muscle or adipose tissue (fat tissue) are primarily responsible for altered blood sugar
      concentrations in persons with metabolically abnormal obesity (MAO) (those with insulin
      resistance and high blood sugar), compared to those with metabolically normal (healthy)
      obesity (MNO), or whether &quot;healthy&quot; adipose tissue (fat tissue) expansion in MNO people
      compared with lean people provides a vessel for blood sugar removal that helps maintain
      normal blood sugar concentration.

      Accordingly, the investigators will determine the amount of sugar that is taken up by the
      body and in the cells of adipose tissue (fat tissue) and muscle by infusing labeled sugar
      into the blood and looking at its disappearance from blood and appearance in adipose tissue
      (fat tissue) and muscle. The investigators will also determine how well insulin, a hormone
      that controls blood sugar, turns on signals that stimulate sugar uptake in fat and muscle
      cells. These studies will be done after an overnight fast and during an infusion of sugar and
      insulin (hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp), in sex- and age-matched MNO and MAO people and a
      group of sex- and age-matched healthy lean people.

        The investigators plan to study a total of 45 men and women of all races and ethnic groups:
        15 pre-diabetic MAO (metabolically abnormal obese), 15 MNO (metabolically normal obese),
        and 15 lean. All three groups will be balanced with regards to sex and race/ethnicity
        distribution, and the two obese groups will also be matched on percent total body fat.
