  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to evaluate short term effect of triticale, mung bean and adzuki bean
      intervention for health improvement in patients with type 2 diabetes.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will evaluate the effect of triticale, mung bean and adzuki bean on metabolic and
      nutritional status of patients with type 2 diabetes after 30 days of intervention. Patients
      will be assigned to control or intervention group (A diet including triticale and mung bean;
      B diet including adzuki bean). Blood and urine samples will be collected at baseline and
      after 30 days of intervention.
