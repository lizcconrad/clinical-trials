      This study investigates the effects of valaciclovir treatment to individuals with Alzheimer's
      disease (AD) or Mild Cognitive Impairment of Alzheimer's Disease Type. It is an open pilot
      trial where 36 participants will receive 4 weeks of oral valaciclovir treatment. To find 36
      persons fulfilling inclusion criteria, up to 120 persons will be screened. Important
      inclusion criteria are Herpes Simplex Virus (HSV) Immunoglobulin G (IgG)-positivity (HSV
      carriage), Apolipoprotein E allele 4 carriage and sufficient kidney function (estimated
      glomerular filtration rate above 30 ml/min). All participants must give their informed
      consent to participation.

      The valaciclovir dose will be 500 mg three times daily the first week and 1000 mg three times
      daily week 2-4.

      Participants will be investigated using different measures before and after the treatment
      period: Mini Mental State Examination to assess cognitive function, Cerebrospinal fluid
      biomarkers of Alzheimer's disease and [18F]-FHBG-PET/CT
      (9-[4-[18F]fluoro-3-(hydroxymethyl)butyl]guanine positron emission tomography/computed
      tomography)) to possibly indicate active HSV infection within the central nervous system.

          -  Ability to take a stand and to make and to sign an informed consent to participate in
             the study. This implies that a person with MMSE (Mini Mental State Examination) &lt; 18

             disease. At least one brain imaging examination should have been done (CT, MR, SPECT
             or PET/CT) and at least one objective finding should support the diagnosis beyond
             specific medical history. Reduced perfusion or reduced metabolism bilaterally
             temporally, hippocampal atrophy or pathological markers for Alzheimer's disease in
             cerebrospinal fluid is such findings. Persons with vascular brain disorders e.g.
             severe white matter changes or previous brain infarction will not be included but
             those with white matter changes considered normal for their age can be included.

          -  Positive for anti-HSV (Herpes Simplex Virus) Immunoglobulin G (IgG) in plasma, i.e.
             carrier of HSV.

          -  Hetero or Homozygote for allele 4 of gene Apolipoprotein E.

          -  Stable over all medication including medication for Alzheimer's disease (rivastigmine,
             galantamin, donepezil or memantin) for at least one month.

             study drug.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Renal insufficiency with estimated GFR (Glomerular Filtration Rate) ≤ 30 ml/min/1.73m2

          -  Ongoing treatment with anticoagulants (Warfarin, low molecular heparin or other
             anticoagulant agents). Antiplatelet agents in recommended dose are accepted (i.e.
             Acetylsalicylic acid 75 mgx1)

          -  Life expectancy &lt; 1 year due to other comorbidity

          -  Ongoing severe somatic condition that might interfere with the patients participation
             in the study (i.e. ongoing cancer treatment)

          -  Ongoing illness that makes exams in a supine position impossible (i.e. severe heart
             failure, severe back pain).

          -  Dementia diagnosis other than Alzheimer's disease, including Vascular dementia.

          -  Other known neurological/neurodegenerative disorder (i.e. brain tumor, MS (Multiple
             sclerosis), ALS (amyotrophic lateral sclerosis))

          -  Claustrophobia or other contraindication for doing a PET/CT scanning.

          -  Dementia or cognitive dysfunction to such extent that an informed consent is
             impossible to obtain, corresponding to about MMSE-SR (Mini Mental State
             Examination-Swedish revision) &lt;18.

          -  History of substance abuse (i.e. central nervous system stimulants or alcohol).
             Nicotine use is accepted.
