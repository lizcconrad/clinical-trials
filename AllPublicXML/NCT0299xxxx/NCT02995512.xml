  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to determine the immuno-modulatory mechanistic effects of colchicine
      in patients with myocardial infarction (MI). Investigators hypothesize that colchicine exerts
      its anti-inflammatory properties by switching the metabolism of neutrophils, thereby reducing
      the expression of adhesion molecules responsible for their recruitment in MI.

    <textblock>
      This is a pilot study to explore the mechanistic effects of colchicine in patients with MI.
      The study will be conducted sequentially in 3 parts:

        1. Blood will be collected from up to 10 healthy volunteers for protocol development.
           (Group 1).

        2. Blood will be collected from 20 MI patients within 24 hours of presentation at New York
           University (NYU) Langone Medical Center and Bellevue Hospital Center (BHC). Neutrophil
           adhesion to human aortic endothelial cells, quantitative expression of adhesion
           molecules on the surface of neutrophils, quantitative levels of adhesion molecules on
           neutrophils and endothelial cells, and neutrophil metabolism, using a Seahorse Analyzer
           will be evaluated pre- and post-addition of in vitro colchicine. (Group 2)

        3. The standard low-dose loading regimen of colchicine (1.2 mg followed by 0.6 mg one hour
           later) will be administered to 20 patients with MI at BHC. Blood will be collected prior
           to drug administration, 2 to 3 hours after completion of the colchicine load, and 23 to
           24 hours after the completion of the colchicine load. Neutrophil adhesion to human
           aortic endothelial cells, quantitative expression of adhesion molecules on the surface
           of neutrophils, quantitative levels of adhesion molecules on neutrophils and endothelial
           cells, and neutrophil metabolism will be evaluated pre- and post-addition of in vitro
           colchicine (exact markers will be determined based on the results of in viro studies
           above). (Group 3)
