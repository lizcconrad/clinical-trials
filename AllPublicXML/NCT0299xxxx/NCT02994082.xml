  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a pilot study designed in an effort to develop and improve access to effective
      treatments for tobacco use in rural Veterans using a tailored intervention approach.
      Specifically, we will evaluate a combined behavioral and pharmacological smokeless tobacco
      cessation which concomitantly addresses comorbid issues commonly experienced by rural tobacco
      users including elevated depressive symptoms, risky alcohol use, and concerns about weight
      gain. The objectives are to:

        1. Evaluate the feasibility of an individually-tailored telephone intervention for rural
           smokeless tobacco users

        2. Examine the impact of the intervention on treatment utilization, patient satisfaction,
           and smokeless tobacco cessation.

    <description>The tailored behavioral intervention includes both behavioral and pharmacological components. The behavioral component will consist of six sessions of cognitive behavioral therapy and coping skills training delivered over the telephone. In addition, participants will be screened for conditions commonly associated with tobacco use (depressive symptoms, risky alcohol use, weight concerns) and offered supplementary behavioral treatment modules to address these issues. Participants will also be offered pharmacotherapy for tobacco cessation, with decisions regarding specific medication(s) based on patients' medical history, contraindications, prior experiences, and preferences.</description>
