  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The pharmacokinetics of flucloxacillin are expected to be different in ICU patients compared
      to non-ICU patients. The investigators will determine total and free flucloxacillin
      concentrations in 30 ICU patients, who will get continuous (n=10) or intermittent infusion
      (n=20) of flucloxacillin as standard care.

      Full pharmacokinetic curves will be taken for individual patients on the intermittent dosing
      regimen and limited sampling will be taken for individual patients on the continuous dosing
      regimen on day 2 and 4.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The pharmacokinetics of flucloxacillin are expected to be different in ICU patients compared
      to non-ICU patients. There is a substantial risk that present standard dosing regimens of
      antibiotics lead to suboptimal outcomes for patients on the ICU. To prevent the risk of
      inadequate dosing in critically ill patients, it is important to optimize dosing regimens in
      ICU patients.

      With this study the investigators will define pharmacokinetics of flucloxacillin in ICU
      patients and search for variables influencing pharmacokinetics. By using population modeling
      the investigators will simulate different dosing regimens, intermittent and continuous, and
      compare probability of target attainment between continuous and intermittent infusion.

      To be able to include 30 patients within the study duration, a multi-centre approach is
      necessary.

      Patients will receive standard care, as stated in the product characteristics or according to
      local protocols. Minimally invasive blood sampling for pharmacokinetic analysis will be
      retrieved through a central venous catheter or an arterial line. Full pharmacokinetic curves
      will be taken for individual patients on the intermittent dosing regimen and limited sampling
      will be taken for individual patients on the continuous dosing regimen on day 2 and 4.
