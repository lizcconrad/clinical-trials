  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study will evaluate a stable, dry-powder formulation of oxytocin, with the goal of
      reducing post-partum hemorrhage morbidity and mortality in resource poor settings. This study
      is being conducted to further assess safety and tolerability of inhaled oxytocin, and to
      characterize the drug levels of inhaled (IH) oxytocin when compared to oxytocin administered
      as standard of care. Two groups of subjects will be enrolled. Group 1 will enroll pregnant
      women, who will be randomized to receive either IH or intramuscular (IM) oxytocin as active
      management of the third stage of labour (after the baby is born). Group 2 will enroll
      non-pregnant women of childbearing potential, who will receive IH oxytocin and intravenous
      (IV) oxytocin in a cross over design over two dosing sessions This group will evaluate the
      safety and tolerability of IH and IV oxytocin.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        All Groups:

          -  Between 18 and 40 years of age inclusive, at the time of signing the informed consent.

          -  Healthy as determined by the investigator or medically qualified designee based on a
             medical evaluation including medical history, physical examination, and laboratory
             tests as required per protocol.

          -  Subject clinical chemistry and haematology values within an acceptable range for the
             population recruited and not of abnormal clinical significance. A subject with a
             clinical abnormality or laboratory parameter(s) which is/are not specifically listed
             in the inclusion or exclusion criteria, outside the reference range for the population
             being studied may be included only if the investigator in consultation with the
             Medical Monitor (if required) agree and document that the finding is unlikely to
             introduce additional risk factors and will not interfere with the study procedures.

          -  Adequate peripheral venous access for cannulation.

        Group 1 Only:

          -  Currently pregnant, with an uncomplicated pregnancy as determined by the investigator
             or designee.

          -  Estimated date of delivery within 24 weeks of screening.

          -  Planned spontaneous vaginal birth and considered by investigator at low risk for post
             partum hemorrhage (PPH).

          -  Planned birth in between the 37th and 42nd week of pregnancy.

          -  Women who qualify for oxytocin as appropriate for active management of TSL and who
             agree to have active management.

        Group 2 Only:

          -  ECG normal, or abnormal and not clinically significant.

          -  FEV1 &gt;80% of predicted.

          -  Systolic blood pressure &gt;=90 millimeters of mercury (mmHg).

          -  Body mass index (BMI) within the range 18 - 32 Kilogram (kg)/square meter (m^2)
             (inclusive).

          -  Sex-Female.

          -  Group 2, Cohort A Only:

        A female subject is eligible to participate if she is confirmed to be not pregnant at
        screening and on Day 1 (as confirmed by a negative serum or urine human chorionic
        gonadotrophin [hCG] test), not lactating, and the following condition applies:

        Is of reproductive potential and agrees to use the same combined estrogen and progestogen
        oral contraceptive from 3 months prior to the first dose of study medication and until the
        follow-up contact.

        This method of contraception is only effective when used consistently, correctly and in
        accordance with the product label. The investigator is responsible for ensuring that
        subjects understand how to properly use their method of contraception

          -  Group 2, Cohort B Only:

        A female subject is eligible to participate if she is confirmed to be not pregnant at
        screening and on Day 1 (as confirmed by a negative serum or urine hCG test), not lactating,
        and one of the following conditions applies:

        Is of reproductive potential and has been using the same non-hormonal contraceptive method
        from 3 months prior to the first dose of study medication and until the follow-up contact.

        Would be of reproductive potential, but has undergone bilateral tubal ligation or occlusion
        or bilateral salpingectomy at least 12 months prior to first dose of study medication.

        Is of reproductive potential with only same sex partners or who are and will continue to be
        abstinent from penile-vaginal intercourse on a long term and persistent basis, when this is
        their preferred and usual lifestyle. Periodic abstinence (e.g. calendar, ovulation,
        symptothermal, post-ovulation methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of
        contraception.

        These methods of contraception are only effective when used consistently, correctly and in
        accordance with the product label. The investigator is responsible for ensuring that
        subjects understand how to properly use their method(s) of contraception.

        Of Note: Group 2, Cohort B will enrol women of reproductive potential if they agree to use
        a nonhormonal contraceptive method from at least one month prior to receiving study drug
        and until the follow-up assessment. Although condoms with spermicide are not considered a
        highly effective method of contraception, the risk of receiving study drug during pregnancy
        is minimal for the following reasons:

        Pregnancy testing must be negative at screening and on the first day of dosing. Dosing is
        completed no greater than 14 days from the start of dosing. Oxytocin has a well established
        rapid half-life. If a patient happened to conceive during the time of dosing, study drug

             product (whichever is longer).

          -  Exposure to more than four new chemical entities within 12 months prior to the first
