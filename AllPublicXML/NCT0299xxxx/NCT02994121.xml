  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this longitudinal prospective natural history study of multiple sclerosis (MS), the
      overarching goal is to understand the factors that influence individual variation in disease
      trajectory and treatment response and pave the way for realizing precision medicine in MS.
      Because MS is a chronic neurological disorder, this observational cohort study will span a
      30-year time frame.
