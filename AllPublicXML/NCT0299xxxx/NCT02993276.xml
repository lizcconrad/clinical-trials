      PROSPECTIVE COHORT EVALUATION OF NEUROCAP® In the Treatment of symptomatic Neuroma (PROTECT
      Neuro)

      This post-market surveillance study is conducted to provide post market surveillance
      information regarding long-term performance and ease of use of the Polyganics nerve capping
      device (NEUROCAP®) for reduction of the development of peripheral symptomatic end-neuroma.

      1. Device description NEUROCAP®, a bioresorbable nerve capping device based upon the
           NEUROLAC® nerve guide, is indicated to protect a peripheral nerve end and to separate
           the nerve from surrounding environment to reduce the development of a symptomatic
           neuroma. NEUROCAP® is composed of the same biocompatible, bioresorbable copolyester
           composing the NEUROLAC® nerve guide, Poly(68/32[15/85 D/L] Lactide-Ԑ-Caprolactone)
           (PLCL).

        2. Objective This post-market surveillance study is conducted to provide post market
           surveillance information regarding long-term performance and ease of use of the
           Polyganics nerve capping device (NEUROCAP®) for reduction of the development of
           peripheral symptomatic end-neuroma.

        3. Study design This post-market surveillance study consists of a cohort study to provide
           post market surveillance information regarding long-term performance and ease of use of
           the NEUROCAP® for reduction of the development of peripheral symptomatic end-neuroma in
           the upper and lower extremity. Sub analyses will be performed regarding demographics and
           medical background.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Subjects who are able to provide a written informed consent prior to participating in
             the clinical investigation.

          2. Subjects who are able to comply with the follow-up or other requirements.

          3. Subjects who are ≥ 18 years old.

          4. Subjects with a diagnosis of peripheral symptomatic (end-) neuroma in the upper limb.

          5. Subjects with a positive Tinel's sign.

          6. Symptomatic neuroma confirmed by pain relief following a 10min ± 2min nerve block with
             Xylocaine (Lidocaine) - Pain relief defined as minimally 50% reduction in VAS
             questionnaire score.

          7. Subjects that are indicated for surgery to treat symptomatic neuroma.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Subjects who do not complete the informed consent.

          2. Subjects who are not willing to follow post-surgery protocols (e.g. avoiding pressure
             on the implant zone or immobilization).

          3. Subjects who are unable to comply with the follow-up or other requirements and/or have
             a life expectancy of less than 24 months.

          5. Insufficient amount of soft tissue to cover the investigational device, as assessed by
             the surgeon. Use of the device over a joint is advised against.

          6. Subjects who have had historical radiotherapy in the area of the (end-) neuroma.

          7. Subjects who have a known allergy to anesthetic agent or bioresorbable copolyester
             Poly(68/32[15/85 D/L] Lactide-ε-Caprolactone) (PLCL).

          8. Proximal nerve end &gt; 8mm.
