        2. Establish overall response rate (ORR) where ORR = CR + sCR+ VGPR+PR)

        3. Confirm the safety profile of the treatment regimen

        4. Determine changes in plasmocyte, T-cell and MDSC cell populations

        5. Estimate progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival

      The study is a multicenter, open label Phase I trial. Phase 1, dose-escalation : This study
      uses a 3+3 design to estimate the maximum tolerated dose (MTD).

      There will be 2 escalating dose levels in the trial (0.5 μCi/kg and 1 μCi/kg,). Each dose can
      be administered in up to 4-8 cycles providing that the total dose received per patient does
      not exceed 4 μCi/kg.

      De-escalation (decrease dose level to 0.25 μCi/kg) is planned if at the first dose level of
      0.5 μCi/kg, after expanding the cohort to a maximum of 6 patients, ≥1/3 patients have M
      protein decrease &gt;10% AND ≥2 patient have DLTs. At the dose level of 0.25 μCi/kg, if eligible
      to continue receiving additional doses of the study drug, patients will receive up to 8 doses
      in total, with the total administered activity being 2 μCi/kg.

      The starting dose level will be 0.5 μCi/kg of 225Ac-Lintuzumab administered on day 1 of each
      cycle. If this dose level is safe, the second dose level of 1 μCi/kg will be explored. If the
      starting dose level results in DLTs in ≥2 patients and ≥1/3 patients have M protein decrease
      &gt;10%, the dose level of 0.25 μCi/kg will be explored.

      Subjects will receive the investigational drug as a single infusion at the prescribed dose
      level.

      Intra cohort dose escalation/ decrease is not allowed.

      Minimum three to maximum six patients will be treated at each dose level, and dose escalation
      will proceed as follows:

        1. if 1/3 patients have M protein decrease &gt;10% on Day 42 AND no patients have DLTs, redose
           at the same dose level by Day 60 if ANC and PLT counts allow;

        2. if 1 patient at the given dose level has DLTs, expand the cohort by adding 3 more
           patients at that dose level.

        3. if 1/3 of patients in the expanded cohort exhibit DLTs, proceed to the next dose level.

        4. if at the first dose level,after expanding the cohort to a maximum of 6 patients .1/3
           patients have M protein decrease &gt;10% AND .2 patient has DLTs, decrease dose level to
           0.25 uCi/kg

        5. if no patients at the reduced dose level of 0.25 uCi/kg have M protein decrease &gt;10% AND
           1 patient has DLTs terminate trial

        6. if none of the patients have DLTs at the given dose level, escalate to the next dose
           level.

        7. if 2 or more patient exhibit DLTs at any given dose level, the previous dose level will
           be considered MTD.

        8. if 2/3 patients respond with PR or better and &lt;1/3 patients have DLTs, complete Phase 1
           portion at that dose level (no further dose escalation).

        9. if patients who have at least stable disease are eligible to receive an additional cycle
           of treatment by Day 60 and their response status remains worse than CR, they will
           continue receiving repeated doses of study drug every 60 days after cycle 2 until they
           have received a cumulative dose of up to 4 ìCi/kg or until they achieve CR, whichever is
           sooner.

      All patients will receive GCSF support starting on Day 9 and continuing until ANC&gt;1,000.

      After the dose escalation portion is completed, treat 3 additional patients at the highest
      established dose level to confirm MTD and establish that dose level as MTD.
