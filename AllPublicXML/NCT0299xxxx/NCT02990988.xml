      The goal of this pilot study is to test whether the microbiome is affected by intravenous
      iron repletion.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The colonic microbiome, the community of bacteria living in our gut, is essential in human
      health and disease. Iron is an essential nutrient for both bacteria and humans. In the United
      States, of the donors who provided the ~15 million units of red blood cells that were
      collected for transfusion, 69% were repeat donors. Although iron deficiency is surprisingly
      prevalent in first-time donors, its prevalence is even higher in these particularly
      altruistic frequent donors, (i.e., up to 49% and 66% of male and female repeat donors,
      respectively), manifested as iron depletion or iron-deficient erythropoiesis. Iron deficiency
      from blood donation is associated with fatigue, restless leg syndrome, decreased physical
      endurance and work capacity, and impaired concentration, attention, and other neurocognitive
      functions; however, these conclusions are not based on definitive studies and have not yet
      changed blood donation policy. The goal is to conduct a prospective, double-blind, randomized
      controlled trial, recruiting 60 healthy regular donors who meet donation standards, while
      exhibiting iron-deficient erythropoiesis by laboratory test criteria. In this ancillary
      study, we will determine what effect donor iron deficiency and IV iron repletion have on the
      gut microbiome.

    <description>Calculation of Bray-Curtis index will determine the relative abundance of specific taxa (e.g., Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, Proteobacteria) for each subject. Means (of the differences in %) and standard deviations will be calculated for all comparisons, and a multivariable generalized estimating equations (GEE) model will be used to test for significance.</description>
