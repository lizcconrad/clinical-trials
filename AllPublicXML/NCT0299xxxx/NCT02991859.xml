  <brief_title>Phase 2a, AMP Challenge, Dose Escalation Study to Assess the Dose Response for Topical Efficacy and Systemic Activity in Asthmatic Subjects</brief_title>
  <official_title>An Escalating Dose, Randomized, Placebo-controlled, Incomplete-block, 2-period Cross-over Study to Assess the Dose Response for Topical Efficacy Via Airway Responsiveness to Adenosine-5'-Monophosphate (AMP) Challenge and the Dose Response for Systemic Activity Via 24 Hour (h) Plasma Cortisol Suppression and Thereby the Relative Therapeutic Index for Fluticasone Furoate (FF), Fluticasone Propionate (FP) and Budesonide (BUD) in Asthmatic Subjects</official_title>

  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, placebo-controlled, 2-period crossover, escalating repeat dose study,
      aiming to investigate whether higher potency of different inhaled corticosteroid confers an
      improvement in the topical efficacy to systemic activity ratio in asthmatic subjects. It will
      compare the dose response for topical efficacy via airway responsiveness (to
      adenosine-5'-monophosphate [AMP] challenge), and the dose response for systemic activity via
      24 hour plasma cortisol suppression, and thereby compare the relative therapeutic index, for
      the following inhaled corticosteroids: fluticasone furoate (FF), fluticasone propionate (FP)
      and budesonide (BUD).

      There will be a screening visit 7-28 days before the first dose of study treatment, and a
      minimum 4-day run-in period before the first dose of study treatment. Subjects will be
      randomized to one of 12 treatment sequences, and will have two treatment periods, each
      comprising 5 consecutive 7-day phases of escalating doses of either FF, FP, BUD or placebo.
      There will be a 25- to 42-day washout period between treatment periods. The study duration
      for each subject will be approximately 22 weeks including the follow-up period.
