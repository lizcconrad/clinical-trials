  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In a previous study by the researchers' group, the researchers' investigate the duration of
      yellow fever post-vaccination immunity in vaccinated children between 9 and 23 months of age.
      However, in this study, samples of children in the pre-vaccine period, also known as
      unvaccinated children samples (NV) have not been investigated. It is believed that to seek
      evidence about the immune status in the medium and long term after vaccination against yellow
      fever is necessary to investigate paired samples of children not vaccinated (NV), with
      re-evaluation 30-45 days after primary vaccination. The proposed study is to consolidate
      aspects of humoral (neutralizing antibodies) and cellular (phenotypic and functional
      parameters of T cells and memory B) by means of complementary longitudinal investigation
      children, 9-23 months old, unvaccinated (NV) and 30-45 days after primary vaccination.

    <textblock>
      A sample of 60 children aged 9 to 23 months paired in the pre-vaccine period (NV) and 30-45
      post-primary vaccination days will be selected at health facilities in the metropolitan
      region of Belo Horizonte.

      Children whose mothers consent to participate in research, have collected blood and elements
      of past medical history recorded. Analyses of humoral and cellular biomarkers will be used in
      a comparative study with other post-vaccination periods previously analyzed in children
      during the first phase in study funded by the Ministry of Health.

      specific objectives:

        1. Estimate and compare the proportion of positivity and the geometric mean plasma titers
           of neutralizing antibodies against yellow fever;

        2. Assess lymphocyte frequency T and B memory induced in vitro by the vaccine antigen 17DD
           substrains, and...

        3. Quantify the lymphocytes T CD8 + producers of intracytoplasmic cytokines induced in
           vitro by the vaccine antigen 17DD substrains in unvaccinated children and primed aged
           between 9 and 23 months, categorized according to the vaccination time 30-45 days.

        The study provides immunoassays paired before and after anti-yellow fever vaccination in
        children of both sexes, of any color, class or social group. This will be necessary 60
        paired samples (pre-vaccine period and 30-45 days after primary vaccination) of children
        aged 9 to 23 months, living in areas where YF vaccine makes up the basic immunization
        calendar and will receive the vaccine in the routine of UBRs in the first two years of
        life. This study will be conducted with samples collected from children living in Ribeirão
        das Neves - Minas Gerais. It will be collected 7 mL of whole blood collected in Heparin
        Sodium. It will be allowed to make two attempts to collect only. These samples will be used
        for the realization of the humoral and cellular immunity study.
