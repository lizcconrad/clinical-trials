      This study aimed to explore the associations between constitutions of traditional Chinese
      medicine (TCM) and common disease (CD). A large-scale, community-based, cross-sectional study
      was performed to investigate the associations. A total of 3748 participants were available
      for analysis in this study. The assessment of constitution of TCM was based on
      recommendations of Association Chinese Medicine in China. In this study, the diagnosis of CD
      was based on self-reported medical history. The associations were analyzed using univariate
      and multivariable logistic regression (MLR).

        A risk-factor study for constitution of TCM and chronic disease was conducted in a random
        sample of the Chinese population. Participants aged 30-90 years were recruited from rural
        and urban communities in Shanghai. More than 4,000 participants were invited to a screening
        visit between 2011 and 2013. Written consent was obtained from all patients before the
        study, which was performed in accordance with the ethical standards in the Declaration of
        Helsinki, and approved by the Medicine Ethical Committee of the Huashan Hospital. The
        exclusion criteria were 1) severity renal and liver function abnormal and 2) pregnant
        woman. A total of 3748 participants were available to data analysis.
