  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators objective is to compare OASIS wound matrix with other commonly used
      dressings available for the donor site in split thickness skin grafting in order to determine
      which dressing provides the best outcome based on pain level, time to healing and aesthetic
      outcome.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Investigators seek to compare Oasis wound matrix with Tegaderm and Xeroform in order to
      determine whether advantages exist in one or more of the dressing types that are approved and
      currently used for split-thickness skin graft donor site dressings.

      Patients will be randomly assigned to one of the three treatment groups and followed up
      post-operatively and treated as per current standard of care.

      Data to be collected and analyzed includes: patient age, co-morbid illnesses, medication,
      skin-graft donor location, skin-graft donor area, STSG thickness, infection rate,
      complications involving the donor site, post-operative pain score every morning until
      hospital discharge, healing rate, photographs of the donor site immediately post-operatively
      and then at routine follow-up appointments.

    <description>OASIS wound matrix is a biologic extracellular matrix derived from porcine small intestine submucosa. Some components of OASIS wound matrix are similar to human dermis including types of collagens, elastin, glycoproteins and proteoglycans. In addition, OASIS wound matrix retains some growth factors that have been suggested to aid in the wound healing process. It is a FDA approved wound dressing indicated for use in a variety of ulcers, abrasions and surgical wounds.</description>

    <arm_group_type>Active Comparator</arm_group_type>
    <description>Transparent dressing allows for wound monitoring without changing the dressing Clear design takes the guesswork out of application over the wound Novel acrylic polymer pad technology designed to handle low to moderate wound drainage. No dressing breakdown in the wound. Low friction surface minimizes potential for friction and shear. Allows for gentle removal from skin. Barrier to external contaminants, body fluids, bacteria and viruses.</description>
