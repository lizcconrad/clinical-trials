  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The prognosis of patients with locally advanced SCCHN is poor. Results of recent randomized
      trials evaluating induction chemotherapy by docetaxel, cisplatin, 5 fluorouracil are
      conflicting, and benefit on overall survival is uncertain. Improve efficacy of induction
      chemotherapy is important without increase toxicities. Durvalumab is a promising agent in
      SSCHN. The safety of combination of docetaxel, cisplatin, 5 fluorouracil with durvalumab is
      unknown.

      The aim of the study is to evaluate the feasibility and the safety of the association of DCF
      (standard regimen for induction in SSCCHN) and durvalumab. The safety profile of DCF and
      durvalumab are different, so the expected toxicities should not be additive. The addition of
      durvalumab to DCF could improve the efficacy of induction chemotherapy and the prognostic of
      patients with SSCCHN.

      Concerning the translational research, the aim will be to explore the relationships between
      immune capacity, specificity, activation state and clinical outcome to help elucidate the
      determinants of response to immunotherapy.
