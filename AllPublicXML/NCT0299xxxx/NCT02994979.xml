  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Delirium is an acute confusion that occurs in one third of hospitalized older adults. As
      compared to those without delirium, hospitalized patients with delirium have longer hospital
      stays, higher mortality, and increased risk of nursing home utilization. Substantial
      attention has been paid to developing, testing, and disseminating interventions to prevent
      delirium in the hospital but, to date, not in the nursing home setting. In a previous study
      we used known information on delirium risk factors to develop an intervention that can be
      delivered at onset of acute illness in nursing home patients. The current study is designed
      to test the effect of this intervention in a single-site clinical trial. Objectives: 1) to
      determine, as compared to control, the effect of a multicomponent intervention targeting
      delirium risk factors on delirium frequency, delirium severity, cognitive and physical
      function decline, and hospitalization in nursing home patients with acute illness, and 2) to
      identify features of the intervention associated with occurrence of delirium and other
      outcomes. Approach: We will screen nursing home patients on 17 long-term care units at a
      large, urban nursing home who experience onset of a change in condition according to
      established criteria, and enroll and assign them to intervention or control in a 1:1 ratio.
      Those assigned to intervention will receive daily visits from an Elder Life Specialist, a
      mobile Certified Nursing Assistant trained to provide services to counter risks for delirium,
      including dehydration, immobility, cognitive impairment, undernutrition, and sleep problems,
      for the duration of the acute illness and for 1 week following. Patients assigned to control
      will receive usual care from the unit-based nurses and the patient's primary team. Delirium
      will be assessed 5 days a week by a research assistant. Cognitive and physical function
      decline and hospital transfer will be ascertained during a 1 month follow-up period. We will
      compare outcomes between intervention and control, as well as examine associations between
      outcomes and intervention features such as number and duration of visits.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Delirium is an acute cognitive disorder with features of inattention, disorganized thinking,
      and disordered consciousness that occurs in one third of hospitalized older adults. As
      compared to those without delirium, hospitalized patients with delirium have longer hospital
      stays, higher mortality, and increased risk of nursing home utilization. Substantial
      attention has been paid to developing, testing, and disseminating interventions to prevent
      delirium in the hospital but, to date, not in the nursing home setting. In a previous study
      we used known information on delirium risk factors to develop a multicomponent intervention
      that can be delivered at onset of acute illness in nursing home patients. We demonstrated the
      intervention's feasibility, adherence, and acceptance by patients and staff. The current
      study is designed to test the efficacy of this intervention in a single-site
      cluster-randomized trial. Objectives: 1) to determine, as compared to control, the effect of
      a multicomponent intervention targeting delirium risk factors (immobility, cognitive
      impairment, dehydration, undernutrition, sleep, and medication use) on the primary outcome of
      delirium frequency in nursing home patients with acute illness, and the secondary outcomes of
      delirium severity, cognitive and physical function decline, and hospitalization associated
      with acute illness, and 2) to identify features of the intervention, including &quot;dose&quot; and
      components, associated with occurrence of delirium and its severity, cognitive and physical
      function decline, and hospitalization associated with acute illness. Approach: We will screen
      nursing home patients on 17 long-term care units at a large, urban nursing home who
      experience onset of an acute change in condition according to established criteria, and
      enroll and assign them to intervention or control in a 1:1 ratio. Those assigned to
      intervention will receive daily visits from an Elder Life Specialist, a mobile Certified
      Nursing Assistant trained to provide services to counter risks for delirium, including
      dehydration, immobility, cognitive impairment, undernutrition, and sleep problems, for the
      duration of the acute illness and for 1 week following, in collaboration with the patient's
      primary medical and nursing team. Patients assigned to control will receive usual care from
      the unit-based nurses and the patient's primary team. Delirium will be assessed 5 days a week
      by a research assistant blinded to study hypotheses and group assignment. Cognitive and
      physical function decline and hospital transfer will be ascertained during a 1 month
      follow-up period. We will conduct analyses to compare outcomes between intervention and
      control, as well as examine associations between outcomes and intervention features such as
      number and duration of visits.

    <description>Patients will be seen by an intervention CNA at least once daily 7 days a week. The CNA will be English/Spanish bilingual and will provide intervention components guided by structured protocols and a daily visit form. A typical visit lasts 30 minutes and begins with an introduction and orientation activity followed by provision of water, a reminiscence activity or game, a physical exercise, and a snack and second cup of water. Patients may also receive a relaxation visit at night and given a warm drink, a hand or foot massage, and quiet music. Daily visits will last for the duration of the illness and 7 days following the illness end. Illness end is defined as the last day of illness treatment (e.g., last day of antibiotics) or monitoring (e.g., last day on nursing &quot;24-hour report&quot;). During weekly intervention staff meetings patients will be discussed with the primary medical and nursing team. The planned intervention group sample size results in a case load of 4-8 patients.</description>
