  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Repeated joint bleeding leads to hemophilic arthropathy (HA), which manifests with chronic
      synovitis, cartilage damage and bony destruction. Currently available treatments of HA,
      including analgesics, NSAIDs, and hyaluronic acid, are predominantly directed toward the
      symptomatic relief of pain and inflammation, with no or little effect on joint cartilage
      degeneration. AC201CR, a control released formulation of AC-201, demonstrates
      anti-inflammatory effects by reducing NLRP3 inflammasome assembly. AC-201 is also unique in
      that it influences both the anabolism and catabolism of chondrocytes in vitro and has shown
      cartilage-sparing properties in animal studies. The study is designed to evaluate the joint
      structure-modifying and symptom-relieving effects, safety, and tolerability of AC-201CR in
      subjects with HA.
