      The aim of this epidemiologic prospective study is to determine the prevalence of CPSP
      defined as pain occurring 4 months after scoliosis and thoracic surgery and rated &gt; 3 on a 10
      point visual analogue scale or FLACC scale, in children aged from 6 to 18 years.

      The main objective : prevalence of chronic post surgical pain 4 months after scoliosis ant
      thoracic surgery in children aged 6 to 18 years.

      The secondary objectives: the intensity of chronic post surgical pain, the prevalence of
      neuropathic syndrome and the predictive risk factors.
