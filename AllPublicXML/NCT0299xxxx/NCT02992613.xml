  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Numerous studies have echoed the superior clinical outcomes of posterior-stabilized (PS)
      total knee arthroplasty compared to posterior cruciate-retaining (CR) total knee
      arthroplasty. The post-cam mechanism of posterior-stabilized (PS) total knee arthroplasty has
      been postulated to provide reproducible femoral rollback and increased flexion. However,
      posterior-stabilized (PS) total knee arthroplasty systems are purportedly limited due to
      several post-cam related problems, including post-cam dislocation, wear and breakage of post,
      and patellar clunk syndrome. Moreover, the post-cam mechanism requires additional bone
      resection and poses a risk for intercondylar fracture of the distal femur during box
      preparation. To overcome these issues, a fixed-bearing highly conforming ultra-congruent (UC)
      total knee arthroplasty was introduced.

      This study aims to compare the clinical results of Ultra-Congruent(UC) and
      posterior-stabilized(PS) insert in bilateral total knee arthroplasty.

      The objective of this work was to compare pain, stiffness, function and accuracy between
      groups at minimum 2 year postoperatively. The investigators hypothesized that the
      Ultra-Congruent(UC) insert would provide similar functional outcomes without increasing the
      incidence of adverse events.

      The study design is a double-blind randomized controlled trial. Fifty patients planed to
      undergo simultaneously bilateral total knee arthroplasty are randomised to be used
      Ultra-Congruent(UC) insert on one leg and posterior-stabilized(PS) insert on the other. The
      clinical outcome is comparative preoperative, postoperative 6weeks, 3months, 6months and
      1years. And clinical score consists of Range of Motion (ROM), WOMAC (Western Ontario and
      McMaster University Arthritis Index ) pain scale, Knee Society Score, Anterior and posterior
      stress view on X-ray.
