      The primary objective of this study is to determine the normative range of brain volume and
      brain volume change in healthy control (HC) participants whose age, race, and gender
      distribution is approximately matched to the age, race, and gender distribution of patients
      with Multiple Sclerosis (MS) enrolled in Study 888MS001. The secondary objective is to use
      the results of the primary endpoint to ensure consistency of brain volume measurements across
      MS PATHS centers.

        Healthy control (HC) participants enrolled at each institution will be carefully selected
        to result in a group whose age, race, and gender distribution is approximately matched to
        the age, race, and gender distribution of patients with MS enrolled in MS PATHS at that
        center. Patients enrolled in MS PATHS at each center will be encouraged to enlist a friend
        or family member to participate in the study as an HC. Subsequently, on approximately
        quarterly review of participant participation, particular demographic groups will be
        targeted for recruitment, if needed, in order for the age, race, and gender distribution of
        a center's HC sample to be similar to their MS PATHS participant sample (within the study
        age range).

        Key Inclusion Criteria

          -  Ability to understand the purpose and risks of the study and provide signed and dated
             informed consent and authorization to use protected health information in accordance
             with national and local participant privacy regulations.

        Key Exclusion Criteria

          -  History of human immunodeficiency virus.

          -  Confirmed or suspected pregnancy.

          -  Diagnosis of migraine requiring medication or any other participant-reported diagnosis
             of a neurological disease or condition (e.g., stroke, transient ischemic attack,
             epilepsy, brain infection, brain surgery, prior head injury or concussion, or brain
             tumor).

          -  Any participant-reported diagnosis of an autoimmune disorder (e.g., rheumatoid
             arthritis, Sj√∂gren's syndrome, scleroderma, or systemic lupus erythematosus).

          -  Standard MRI exclusion criteria, including claustrophobia, inability to lay still in
             the magnet (e.g., tremor), or any type of implanted metal in the body that would be
             affected by the strong magnetic field.
