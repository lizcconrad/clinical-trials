  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research focuses on justice-involved youth with conduct disorder (CD) and a history of
      violence. CD is a youth-limited neurodevelopmental disorder that is commonly associated with
      criminality. Although psychosocial interventions that address impulsivity and self-control
      have been shown to be effective at helping promote prosocial behavior in patients with CD,
      the biological changes that occur as a result of treatment are not well understood. This
      study will explore changes in cortisol (a stress hormone) and the brain function of the
      anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) in response to a common psychosocial intervention (Stop, Now
      and Plan Youth Justice Model). This study will contribute to our understanding of biological
      mechanisms involved in therapeutic gains among youth offenders and thereby inform further
      development of treatment programs for justice-involved youth.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      CD is a youth-limited neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by impulsivity and
      dysfunctional social behavior. CD is associated with increased risks of mortality, lower
      educational and occupational achievement, criminal behavior and other psychosocial
      difficulties, and hence presents a significant burden to society. Impulsivity is a prominent
      predictor of violence in CD. Treatment programs targeting impulsivity in CD have been shown
      to be effective at increasing pro-social functioning in CD, but the biological mechanisms
      that underpin these therapeutic gains are not well understood. Past research suggests
      cortisol and the ACC play a role in CD and impulsivity. This study explores biological and
      behavioral changes in response to Stop, Now and Plan Youth Justice Model (SNAP YJ), a
      validated 13-week psychosocial intervention addressing impulsivity and self-control in youth
      offenders

      The main hypotheses are:

        1. CD youth who respond to SNAP YJ treatment will exhibit greater post-treatment ACC
           activation during an fMRI imaging task compared with their baseline, pre-treatment ACC
           activation.

        2. CD youth who respond to SNAP YJ treatment will exhibit a higher post-treatment cortisol
           awakening response (CAR) compared with their baseline, pre-treatment CAR.

      The secondary hypotheses are:

        1. CD youth will exhibit lower ACC activation at baseline during an fMRI imaging task
           compared with the baseline ACC activation exhibited by typically developing youth.

        2. CD youth will manifest a lower baseline CAR compared with the baseline CAR of typically
           developing youth.

    <description>Difference in ACC BOLD activation to commission errors (contrast of BOLD response during commission errors vs. BOLD response during correct hits) will be tested using a 2 (Session: pre-SNAP vs. post-SNAP) × 2 (Group: treatment responders vs. non-treatment responders) within subject, mixed model analysis of covariance (ANCOVA), controlling for the effect of age, to investigate the two-way interaction between session and group. (Note: Commission errors compose a measure produced by the Go/No-Go task.)</description>

    <measure>Change from baseline: Saliva-derived cortisol</measure>
    <time_frame>Measured before and after the 13-week program</time_frame>
    <description>Saliva-derived cortisol will be analyzed using a time-resolved fluorescence immunoassay, and quantification of cortisol data will be achieved by calculating the area under the curve with respect to ground (AUCG), which is a validated method of measuring basal cortisol level derived from repeated measurements. Difference in AUCG with respect to CAR will be tested using a 2 (Session: pre-SNAP vs. post-SNAP) × 2 (Group: treatment responders vs. non-treatment responders) within subject, mixed model ANCOVA, controlling for the effect of age, to investigate the two-way interaction between session and group.</description>

    <description>SNAP YJ is an adaptation and extension of the original SNAP program and was developed to target justice-involved youth (12 years and older) who have problems with aggression, CD, and/or gang affiliation. Using the SNAP strategy, the SNAP YJ program was adapted to use digitally-based iPad intervention modules that incorporate an interactive learning experience through the use of novel technology. These modules focus on engaging youth in interesting and creative learning modules by providing real life scenarios designed to improve self-control, impulsive behaviors, decision-making skills, and pro-social skills. SNAP YJ treatment is delivered over a 13-week period.</description>
