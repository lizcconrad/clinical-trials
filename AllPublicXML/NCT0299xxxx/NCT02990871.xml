  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      All the patients hospitalized in the neuro-rehabilitation after a severe acquired brain
      injury carrying a tracheal cannula will be retrospectively analyzed. Patients coming from
      emergency department started a rehabilitative treatment during their hospitalization in ICU.
      Patients transferred from an external ICU started the rehabilitation in neurorehabilitation
      department. Aim of the study is to evaluate if an early rehabilitation, started since the
      acute stage of the damage, is able to reduce the decannulation time in this group of
      patients.
