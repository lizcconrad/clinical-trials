    <textblock>
      Men with progressive metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer post first-line
      treatment with either androgen deprivation therapy alone or androgen deprivation therapy plus
      docetaxel who have an identified related female donor (mother sister, daughter, second degree
      relative such as granddaughter or niece) will undergo bone marrow transplantation followed by
      post-transplant Cytoxan (PT/Cy) and testosterone.

      Men will undergo pre-transplant screening evaluation and be enrolled in the study. Subjects
      will be treated with a standard non-myeloablative conditioning regimen consisting of
      Fludarabine 30 mg/m2 IV Days -6 to -2; Cy 14.5 mg/kg IV Days -6 and -5; Total body
      irradiation (TBI) 200 cGy Day -1. On Day 0, patients will be infused with non-T-cell depleted
      bone marrow from a related female donor. Patients will receive GVHD prophylaxis consisting
      of: Cy 50mg/kg IV on Days +3 and +4; tacrolimus (IV or PO) beginning on Day +5 [dose adjusted
      to maintain trough level of 5-15 ng/mL] through day+180; Mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) 15 mg/kg
      PO TID, with a maximum dose of 1g TID beginning on Day +5 through Day +35. Patients will
      receive filgrastim (G-CSF) 5 mcg/kg/day beginning on Day +5 and continued until ANC ≥
      1500/mm3. Lastly, to produce maintenance tumor antigen stimulation, patients will be
      maintained on continuous LHRH agonist/antagonist therapy (if not previously surgically
      castrated) to suppress endogenous testosterone production throughout the treatment period;
      testosterone cypionate 400 mg IM will be administered on Day +60, +90, and +120 (every 30
      days x 3 doses). Patients who achieve biochemical CR will stop LHRH agonist/antagonist
      treatment at day 180. Patients will be followed for 3 years post-BMT.
