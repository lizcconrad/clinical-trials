      Evaluation of ZP-025 vaginal gel in terms of efficacy and safety in the treatment of vaginal
      dryness in post-menopausal women with vaginal atrophy in comparison to a group of non-treated

      Evaluation of ZP-025 vaginal gel in terms of efficacy, tolerability and safety in the
      treatment of vaginal dryness in post-menopausal women with vaginal atrophy in comparison to a
      group of non-treated post-menopausal women with vaginal atrophy for 56 consecutive days.

      This trial will be conducted in compliance with last version of Declaration of Helsinki, with
      GCP as applicable to investigations with IMD, with the applicable regulatory requirements and
      with CRO and Sponsor's SOPs.

      This is a multi-centre, national, randomized, controlled vs. no-treatment, open label study
      The study will take place in 6 centers of menopause at public Hospitals/Universities. An
      ancillary study will be carried on for subjects randomized to ZP-025 group with a follow-up
      visit at 4 weeks
