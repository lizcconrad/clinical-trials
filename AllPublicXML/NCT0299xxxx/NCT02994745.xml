  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, open-label, single dose, 3x3 partial replicated crossover study to
      evaluate the pharmacokinetics and safety/tolerability. Within each period, randomized
      subjects will be 2 dosing regimens with a fixed dose combination of Fimasartan/Atorvastatin
      and co-administration of Fimasartan and Atorvastatin.
