      This study proposes an onco geriatric evaluation (Activities of Daily Living, Instrumental
      Activities Of Daily Living, Mini Mental State Examination, mini Geriatric Depression Scale,
      Mini Nutritional Assessment, Cumulative Illness Rating Scale-Geriatric, and &quot; timed get up
      and go &quot; tests) for elderly breast cancer patients. The score obtained at this evaluation
      will determine the radiotherapy scheme.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Breast cancer is the most frequent cancer for elderly women and represents the first
      mortality cause for them. Breast cancer incidence increases for elderly women and will become
      a major public health problem in the next years.

      The principal therapeutic solution is the partial mastectomy associated to radiotherapy.
      However, the radiotherapy scheme and its role are debated for elderly patients. Hypo
      fractionated radiotherapy could be considered as an advantageous option.

      The treatment duration (6,5 weeks) and direct and indirect fatigue (around 33 travels) are
      major cons. Thereby, for elderly patients, the selection of patients who will benefit from a
      shorter treatment could be really difficult. It would be interesting to define an objective
      scoring, predicting a bad or good tolerance and observance to the radiotherapy. Nowadays,
      onco geriatric evaluations are used to decide some treatment's decision, but no study
      compared different orientated radiotherapy schemes.

      The present study proposes an onco geriatric evaluation leading to a score according to seven
      tests (Activities of Daily Living, Instrumental Activities Of Daily Living, Mini Mental State
      Examination, mini Geriatric Depression Scale, Mini Nutritional Assessment, Cumulative Illness
      Rating Scale-Geriatric, and &quot; timed get up and go &quot; tests). The score will then determine an
      adapted radiotherapy scheme.

    <description>Tolerance is considered as &quot; bad &quot; if the score of the onco geriatric evaluation decreases of more than 20% from the initial evaluation to 6 months after the end of the rays. Tolerance is considered as &quot;correct&quot; in the other cases.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Radiotherapy compliance</measure>

    <description>According to the score obtained with the onco geriatric evaluation, patients with a score between 200 and 160 will receive a normo fractionated radiotherapy (66 Grays in 33 fractions). This scheme of radiotherapy is already used in the clinical practice, but not allocated according to a score obtained at an oncogeriatric evaluation.</description>

    <description>According to the score obtained with the onco geriatric evaluation, patients with a score between 159 and 120 will receive an hypo fractionated radiotherapy (42,56 Grays in 16 fractions). This scheme of radiotherapy is already used in the usual practice, but not allocated according to a score obtained at an oncogeriatric evaluation.</description>
