      This study aims to evaluate the safety, efficacy and duration of response of CD19 Chimeric
      Antigen Receptor (CAR) redirected allogeneic T-cells in patients with chemotherapy-resistant
      or refractory CD19+ B cell lymphoma.

      This is a single-centre, randomised, open label Phase I clinical trial of CD19 Chimeric
      Antigen Receptor (CAR) T-cells (CD19 CAR T-cells) in patients with chemotherapy-resistant or
      refractory CD19+ B cell lymphoma. Following informed consent and registration to the trial,
      Patients will receive the allogeneic CD19 CAR T-cells following lymphodepleting chemotherapy.
      The study will evaluate the safety, efficacy and duration of response of the CD19 CAR T-cells
      in patients with chemotherapy-resistant or refractory CD19+ B cell lymphoma.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Enrollment for enough male or female patients with CD19+ hematological malignancies,
        without regimens for cure (autologous or allogeneic stem cell transplantation), and having
        a poor prognosis (several months to 2 years) under current optional regimens

          1. Age ranges from 18 to 70 years old

          2. Expected survival time longer than 12 weeks

          3. Performance status score 0-2

          4. Pathologically confirmed CD19+ lymphoma (CD19+ follicular lymphoma, Mantle cell
             lymphoma, diffuse large B cell lymphoma) and meets at least one of follows:

               1. having received at least 2-4 cycles of combined chemotherapy (excluding
                  monoclonal antibody monotherapy, such as rituximab) but do not reach a complete
                  response; recurrent disease; not applicable for conventional stem cell
                  transplantation; being partial responsible or stable but not complete responsible
                  after the latest therapy

               2. recurrence develops after stem cell transplantation

         10. Medical history of mental diseases or abnormities of lab tests might increase the
             risks of participation in study or drug administration, or interfering the results

         11. Screening suggesting transfection efficiency of targeting cells lower than 30% or cell
             expansion deficiency under CD3/CD28 (cluster of differentiation 3,CD3)stimulation

             arterial/venous thromboembolism events develop in 30 days before the randomization. If
             anti-coagulation therapy is received, the treatment dose should reach stability before
             the randomization.

         13. Pregnancy or lactation, or pregnancy planned during the study or in 2 months after the
             study

         14. Reliable contraception not accepted during the study or in 2 months after the study.
             Female subjects are required to provide negative results from serum or urine pregnancy
             test 48 hours before therapy

         15. Systematic active or uncontrolled infection (excluding infection of urinary tract or
             upper respiratory tract infection) in 14 days before the randomization

         16. Informed consent not signed or study rules violated
