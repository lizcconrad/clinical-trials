    <textblock>
      Specialty mental health probation for offenders with severe mental illness has been widely
      disseminated; however, randomized studies are needed to determine its effectiveness. The
      purpose of the study is to test the feasibility and efficacy of specialty mental health
      probation (SMHP) for probationers with mental illness in North Carolina. 320 adult
      probationers with mental illness in will be randomly assigned to specialty mental health
      probation (experimental condition) or usual probation (control condition). Probationers
      assigned to the experimental condition will be supervised by specialty mental health
      probation officers, who will have reduced caseloads and advanced training in mental health
      and other topics. Probationers assigned to the control condition will receive standard
      probation. Criminal justice and mental health outcomes will be examined.
