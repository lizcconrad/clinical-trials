    <textblock>
      This study is to determine if self-discontinuation of transurethral foley catheters in
      patients diagnosed with postoperative urinary retention (POUR), which is defined as the
      continued need for catheterization, following impatient pelvic organ prolapse surgery is
      non-inferior to office-discontinuation.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Postoperative urinary retention (POUR) is a common issue following urogynecologic surgery,
      with incidence rates of 1.4-43%. The wide range of incidence is due to the lack of a
      standardized definition of POUR. Generally speaking, POUR can be characterized by any
      impairment in bladder emptying following surgery. While the gold standard for assessing
      voiding function remains measurement of a postvoid residual (PVR), there are many voiding
      trial (VT) methods being used across institutions.

      Historically, the most widely accepted postoperative VT for the assessment of voiding
      function was the backfill method. An alternative assessment of voiding function is the
      spontaneous VT, where the indwelling catheter is removed and a patient is asked to void
      spontaneously when a patient has the urge. It is controversial which of these methods are
      superior, and studies are conflicted. Nevertheless, both of these methods were studied in a
      clinical setting, and we lack information on self-discontinuation efficacy at home.

      Managing an indwelling urinary catheter and returning to the outpatient clinic only a week
      after discharge from the hospital can be overwhelming for patients and their involved
      caregivers. Given the low incidence of POUR at one-week postoperative and patient
      dissatisfaction with urinary catheter management, home self-removal of indwelling urinary
      catheters is an important topic of investigation.

      We are trying to compare the incidence of POUR between self-discontinuation and
      office-discontinuation of urinary catheters. The results of this study could impact on the
      decision regarding catheter use following inpatient pelvic organ prolapse surgery.
