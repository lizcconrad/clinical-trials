  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      For preterm infants, deferred cord clamping has been shown to improve both short term and
      long-term neonatal outcomes without an established harm for both the mother and her
      infant.The interference with resuscitative measures for the neonate or the mother is a risk
      that continued to hamper the implementation of delayed cord clamping in many centers around
      the world.For that reason, the evidence now is seeking a time-honored, yet not adopted method
      of placental transfusion that involves milking of the umbilical cord.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Contrary to delayed cord clamping, milking of the umbilical cord is done at a faster rate and
      in shorter time.Recent evidence has demonstrated the efficacy and safety of umbilical cord
      milking for both term and preterm infants.A newer evidence comparing delayed cord clamping to
      umbilical cord milking in preterm infants demonstrated a higher initial hemoglobin, blood
      pressure and systemic blood flow in preterm infants allocated to the umbilical cord milking
      arm.However, concerns have been raised with regard to rapid infusion of large volume of blood
      in relatively shorter time predisposing to hyperperfusion injury including intraventricular
      hemorrhage. This is particularly problematic for preterm neonates as they are at higher risk
      of neurological injury. It has, though, advantage of shorter timeframe allowing for effective
      resuscitation of preterm neonates to start as soon as possible. Thus, with countering
      advantages and disadvantages, the practice has not been adopted at most places. The authors
      planned to conduct a randomized clinical trail to compare the efficacy and safety of
      umbilical cord milking to deferred cord clamping in preterm infants less than 32 weeks
      gestation.
