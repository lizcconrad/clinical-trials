      The goal of the AIM Study is to examine the effectiveness of Mindfulness Based Relapse
      Prevention (MBRP) versus Relapse Prevention (RP) for the treatment of Alcohol Use Disorders
      (AUD) by implementing an 8-week long intervention and examining neurobiological,
      immunological, and epigenetic characteristics of AUD.

      This study was designed to evaluate the effect of two outpatient, individually-administered,
      psychosocial interventions (Relapse Prevention vs. Mindfulness-Based Relapse Prevention).
      Participants are recruited via mass media advertisements, flyers, and local outreach to
      clinical providers that do not address substance use. This sample size provides adequate
      statistical power for the research questions undertaken.

      Participants are screened over the telephone and invited into the laboratory for a baseline
      assessment. Immediately after the baseline assessment, participants are randomized to a
      therapist and then to a treatment condition. At the end of each year, the distribution of
      participants across conditions and therapists are evaluated for imbalances. If attrition has
      resulted in an imbalance across conditions, the randomization procedure will be adjusted to
      ensure equal numbers of participants in RP and MBRP.

      Within a week of completing the baseline assessments, participants are seen by each
      participant's individual therapist for a motivational interviewing, goal-setting session.
      After the goal-setting session, the eight-session MBRP or RP treatments are administered. To
      ensure that therapists adhere to treatment manuals, a checklist is provided consisting of the
      primary content addressed each session. Further, questionnaires assessing mindfulness
      practice and facets of mindfulness are administered at each assessment. At the most recent
      RPPR, these questionnaires validated that participants in the MBRP condition were increasing
      in some facets of mindfulness during treatment and up to three months after treatment (e.g.,
      being nonjudgmental, nonreactive).

      The investigators will conduct extensive analyses of any attrition encountered in the project
      to determine bias. However, the research team will have the capability of using modern
      approaches to the handling of missing data including full information maximum likelihood
      estimation of missing data within Proc Mixed in SAS and within EQS.

      The distributional properties of all continuously scaled variables will be examined for
      skewness and kurtosis to determine the need for normalizing transformations or for
      alternations to the analysis plan (i.e., generalized estimating equations or robust
      estimation) prior to the primary analyses.

      To confirm the validity of random assignment, pretest equivalence of the two treatment
      conditions across demographics, drinking history, smoking, and all other baseline measures
      will be assessed via t-tests on continuous items and chi-square tests of categorical items.
      The investigators will use the Bonferroni approach to correct for alpha inflation with a
      familywise alpha of .05. Any variables on which the two groups are unequal at pretest will be
      covariates in all further analyses.

      Attrition analyses will be conducted after each follow-up data collection effort to provide
      assurance that differential attrition by treatment condition has not occurred. Following
      previously published procedures, a series of ANOVAs of treatment (MBRP versus RP) X retention
      (retained, not retained) will be conducted on continuous baseline measures. Significant
      treatment X retention interactions identify measured variables on which differential
      attrition may have occurred. The logit model analog procedure will be applied to categorical
      baseline measures to test for differential attrition on categorical variables such as gender
      and ethnicity. The investigators will conduct these analyses to assure that differential
      attrition by treatment condition does not account for any of the effects of the treatments.
