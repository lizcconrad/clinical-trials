  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study was to evaluate the retention rates of a fissure sealant placed
      using different adhesive protocols over 24 months.Twenty-four subjects with no restoration
      and caries received fissure sealants (Clinpro™Sealant, 3M/ESPE) placed with different
      adhesive protocols. A total of 292 sealants (73 for each group) were placed. The sealants
      were placed as follows; a-without adhesive (acid-etch only), b-with an etch-and-rinse
      adhesive (SingleBondTM), c-with a self-etch adhesive (AdperTMEasyBond), d-with
      acid-etch+self-etch adhesive (AdperTMEasyBond) by two previously calibrated dentists using a
      table of random numbers. Two other calibrated examiners, independently evaluated the sealants
      at baseline and at 6-, 12-, 18-, and 24-month recalls. Each sealant was evaluated in terms of
      caries formation being present or absent and retention using the following criteria:
      1=completely retained, 2=partial loss, and 3=total loss. The Pearson χ2 test was used to
      evaluate differences in retention rates among the sealants for each evaluation period.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Dental caries, which can be encountered by individuals throughout their lives, is one of the
      most chronic diseases worldwide. Researches have mainly been focusing on the prevention of
      tooth caries with the awareness of this fact. The use of fluorides as well as pit-and-fissure
      sealants are the most common preventive applications against caries progression.Modern
      adhesives combine conventional conditioning, priming and bonding steps (etch-and-rinse
      adhesives) together into one or two bottle (self-etch adhesives) to ease adhesive protocols.
      However, it is still suspicious whether modern self-etch adhesives have equal bonding
      capacity to the conventional etch-and-rinse systems. Therefore, clinical trials are necessary
      to evaluate long-term adhesive performance of self-etch adhesives compared to the
      conventional etch-and-rinse ones.
