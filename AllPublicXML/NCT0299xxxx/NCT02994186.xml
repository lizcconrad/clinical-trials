  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Bariatric surgery is the most effective, long-term treatment for morbid obesity, and
      consistent with previous findings, individuals who lose significant weight after surgery also
      have improved cognition or &quot;brain function&quot;. The mechanisms behind these cognitive
      improvements are currently unknown, but are the focus of much research effort. The goal of
      this pilot study is to thoroughly describe these changes in surgical versus medical weight
      loss patients over time in a repeated measures fashion.

    <textblock>
      Recent studies have demonstrated that obesity is associated with decreased cognitive function
      and, interestingly, weight loss is associated with improved cognitive function. Bariatric
      surgery is the most effective, long-term treatment for morbid obesity, and consistent with
      these previous findings, individuals who lose significant weight after surgery appear to have
      improved cognition. Previous results have only reported the appearance of cognitive
      improvements starting at three months postoperatively, thus, the main focus of this study is
      to discover whether cognitive function improvements are seen as early as one month after
      bariatric surgery. An acceleration in the onset of cognitive function changes could provide
      insight towards the ambiguous underlying neural mechanisms. The benefits of bariatric surgery
      extend beyond reversible cognitive deficits. Many of the medical comorbid conditions that
      these patients have before surgery (e.g. high blood pressure, high cholesterol, diabetes)
      typically resolve prior to any significant weight loss. The mechanisms for these
      weight-independent improvements are also undetermined. A secondary focus of this study is to
      determine whether or not cognitive function following bariatric surgery also improves prior
      to significant weight loss. To test whether cognitive function changes following bariatric
      surgery, two cohorts of surgical patients will be recruited as well as another group of
      patients undergoing medical weight loss treatment. The goal of this pilot study is to
      reproduce and expand upon previous findings that demonstrate cognitive improvements following
      bariatric surgery.

    <description>Within group and between group longitudinal measurements will be made using longitudinal regression methods. Baseline as well as 1, 3 and 6 month measurements will be captured either from the time of bariatric surgery or initiation of a supervised medical weight loss program. The bariatric operation will be included (Roux-en-Y gastric bypass vs. Vertical Sleeve Gastrectomy) as a variable in the regression model for between and within subjects comparisons in the bariatric surgery group.</description>

    <description>There will be a group of patients that will crossover at 6 months from the medical weight loss group to the surgical weight loss group. The cognitive function score in these patients will be compared between treatment groups, as they will effectively be represented in each group.</description>
