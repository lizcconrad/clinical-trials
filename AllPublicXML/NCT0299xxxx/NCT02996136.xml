  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The ARROW-FLU Influenza A&amp;B Test is an in vitro diagnostic immuno-chromatographic assay
      intended for the qualitative detection of influenza A and influenza B viral nucleoprotein
      antigens from nasal or nasopharyngeal swab specimens in symptomatic patients. It is intended
      to aid in the rapid differential diagnosis of influenza A and/or B viral infections. This
      test is not intended for the detection of influenza C viruses. A negative test is presumptive
      and it is recommended these results be confirmed by cell culture of an FDA cleared molecular
      device. Negative results do not preclude influenza virus infection and should not be used as
      the sole basis for treatment or other management decisions.

      This multicenter prospective study will include nasal and nasopharyngeal swabs collected from
      patients who present with flu-like symptoms and have undergone routine testing for influenza
      virus strain types A or B. The ARROW-FLU Influenza A&amp;B Test System qualitative results will
      be compared to a reference method for identification of Influenza A or B to determine the
      clinical sensitivity and specificity of the device.

      The ARROW-FLU Influenza A&amp;B Test system will be performed at CLIA-waived and non-CLIA waived
      clinical sites. Device operators at CLIA-waived sites will be untrained intended users (e.g.
      nurses, physician assistants, medical assistants, etc).

      A subject's participation in this study will consist of a single visit. Following completion
      of the informed consent process and a review of Inclusion/Exclusion criteria to determine
      eligibility, each subject will receive a unique study identification number. After standard
      of care sampling, two (2) nasal or nasopharyngeal swabs will be obtained from each subject
      enrolled in the study. The swabs will be collected from the same nostril and alternated in
      their order of designation for testing (i.e. one for ARROW-FLU Influenza System testing and
      the other for reference testing. Any swab specimens required for standard of care testing
      will be collected prior to the specimens for this investigation. Investigational device
      operators will be blinded to standard of care testing results.

    <description>The primary objective of this study is the characterization of the performance of the ARROW-FLU Influenza Test to detect influenza virus strain type A or type B in symptomatic subjects. Qualitative results obtained using the ARROW-FLU Influenza Test will be compared to a reference method or &quot;Gold Standard&quot; (viral culture and/or an FDA cleared molecular assay). Performance data generated will support a 510k submission to FDA for clearance of the assay.</description>

    <description>The secondary objective of this study is to demonstrate the ability of untrained intended users to effectively perform the ARROW-FLU Influenza A&amp;B Test with insignificant risk of erroneous results. Qualitative results obtained using the ARROW-FLU Influenza Test System will be compared to the reference method for confirmation of results on specimens collected during this study.</description>

             suggestive of influenza virus infection. Subject should present with an influenza-like
             febrile respiratory illness defined as both

               -  Presentation within that last 48 hours of developing a subjective feeling of
                  being feverish and/or a temperature recorded at the clinic within the last 48
