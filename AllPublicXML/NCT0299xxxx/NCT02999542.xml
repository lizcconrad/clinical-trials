  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The researchers are conducting a research study to see whether listening to music during an
      operation will have a positive effect on the way that children wake up from
      surgery/anaesthetic. It is a common phenomenon where children wake up unhappy, irritated and
      screaming (known as emergence delirium). Research have shown that music decreases anxiety and
      pain. The researchers want to see whether music can also influence a child's behaviour after
      emerging from anaesthesia. In other words whether they will be more calm and cooperative
      after listening to music while they are asleep during surgery. Should music have a positive
      effect, anaesthesiologists may use it in future to improve care of patients coming for
      surgery.

      Children coming for certain elective surgeries, where pain has been excluded as a confounding
      factor, will have headphones placed on their ears after induction of anaesthesia. They will
      be randomised to two groups, one will receive music and the other just silence. The
      headphones will be removed just before waking the patient up. In the recovery room the
      child's behaviour will be observed and will be scored according to a validated score. The two
      groups will then be compared to see whether music makes a difference to the behaviour after
      anaesthesia.
