  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this study is to assess the acceptability of swallowing the
      darunavir/cobicistat (DRV/COBI) and darunavir/cobicistat/emtricitabine/tenofovir alafenamide
      (D/C/F/TAF) fixed-dose combination (FDC) tablets, using matching placebo tablets, in human
      immunodeficiency virus (HIV) -1 infected adolescent patients.

    <measure>Proportion of Acceptability of Swallowing Fixed-Dose Combination (FDC) Tablets in Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV)-1 Infected Adolescent Patients</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1</time_frame>
    <description>Swallowability will be assessed based on a 7-point questionnaire indicating how difficult/easy it was to swallow the tablet, ranging from &quot;very difficult&quot; to &quot;very easy&quot;. The acceptability proportion is obtained by a dichotomization of the acceptability/swallowability scale, i.e. 'slightly difficult' or worse versus 'neither difficult nor easy' or better.</description>

    <time_frame>Day 1</time_frame>
    <description>Acceptability for long term daily use will be assessed based on a 3-point questionnaire, 'not acceptable', 'acceptable', or 'good to take'.</description>
