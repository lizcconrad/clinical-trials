  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The 3D-CAM is a new 3-minute diagnostic assessment for Confusion Assessment Method-defined
      Delirium. The primary objective of this study is to translate the 3D-CAM into the German
      language, as well as to validate its use to detect postoperative delirium in the recovery
      room. The validation will be based on comparisons to the Nu-DESC (Nursing Delirium Screening
      Scale), CAM (Confusion Assessment Method), and DSM-5 criteria (Diagnostic and Statistical
      Manual of Mental Disorders).

      Approximately 200 patients will be enrolled in the study. They will followed up until the
      third postoperative day.

      Calculation and analysis of demographic and perioperative influencing factors on
      postoperative delirium according to routine parameters (age, sex, body height, body weight,
      diagnosis, physical status according to the American Society of Anaesthesiologists (ASA PS),
      duration of surgery, Physiological and Operative Severity Score (POSSUM), type of anesthesia,
      medication against pain and delirium) will be performed.
