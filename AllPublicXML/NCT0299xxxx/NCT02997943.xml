  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall objective of this study is to use an innovative experimental approach, the SMART
      (Sequential Multiple Assignment Randomized Trial), to determine the best way to sequence the
      delivery of mHealth tools and traditional treatment components in a stepped program of
      obesity treatments. The SMART approach is a highly efficient strategy for identifying and
      constructing efficacious adaptive interventions: it accommodates sequential decision-making
      based on the participant's response to early weight loss treatment components. The proposed
      treatment package begins with the least expensive components, and for participants identified
      as treatment non-responders, provides sequential step-up of additional treatment components.
      By sequentially delivering treatment components based on participant response, SMART permits
      achievement of the target outcome, weight loss, with least resource consumption and
      participant burden.

      The proposed study seeks to develop an effective, resource-sensitive strategy to manage
      weight loss treatment for obesity. During the 12-week active intervention phase, participants
      will be randomized to one of two first-line treatments: 1) mobile app alone (APP) or 2) app
      plus weekly telephone coaching sessions (APP+C). Beginning at week 2, those who are
      identified as treatment non-responders (did not lose an average of 0.5 lbs/week) will be
      re-randomized to one of two augmentation tactics: 1) Modest Step-up, operationalized as the
      addition of an additional mHealth component, or 2) Vigorous Step-up, operationalized as the
      addition of an additional mHealth component plus a traditional weight loss intervention
      component. Treatment responders will continue with the same first-line treatment. Treatment
      response be re-assessed at weeks 4 and 8. Those identified as treatment non-responders will
      be re-randomized at that time.

    <description>Participants will first be randomized to an optimal first line treatment in order to compare APP vs. APP + coaching. Participants assigned to Step 1 treatment &quot;APP&quot; will receive a study-specific smartphone application. Participants assigned to Step 1 treatment &quot;APP + coaching&quot; will receive a study-specific smartphone application plus 12 weekly telephone coaching sessions.</description>

    <description>Beginning at week 2, participants who are identified as treatment non-responders will be re-randomized in order to compare two strategies to address non-response: a modest step-up or vigorous step-up treatment augmentation tactic. Step 2 treatment strategy: modest step-up will include provision of an additional mHealth intervention component (push notifications). Step 2 treatment strategy vigorous step-up will include provision of an additional mHealth intervention component (push notifications), plus a traditional weight loss intervention component (coaching, meal replacements). Participants will continue to receive their first line treatment.</description>
