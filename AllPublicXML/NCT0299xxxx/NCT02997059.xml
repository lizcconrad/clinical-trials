    <textblock>
      This was prospective study randomized in two controlled parallel groups verum versus placebo.
      The objectives were to assess the influence of antifungal treatment with Fluconazole (FCZ) on
      the rate of ASCA and endoscopic recurrence at 6 months. The rational was based on our
      previous research having established i) a link between intestinal inflammation and the
      opportunistic fungal pathogen C. albicans -a yeast colonizing the human digestive tract- ii)
      the demonstration that this yeast species could be at the origin of ASCA, a prominent
      serological marker of CD. It was therefore hypothesized that the FCZ could lower the rate of
      ASCA and/or reduce the occurrence of recurrences.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Crohn disease patients with a small intestine localisation (ileum or ileocecal)

          2. Ileal or ileocecal resection in the month before inclusion (resection of all
             macroscopic lesions). If resection with temporary stoma, the patient may be included
             at the time of surgery to restore the continuity

          3. Patient with low risk of recurrence according to the following criteria:

             (i) Total length of the resection(s) of the small intestine less than 100 cm (ii)
             Segmental colectomy leaving in place at least another colonic segment as the rectum

          4. Preoperative rate of ASCA&gt; 70 arbitrary units (+/- 10%)

          5. Informed consent signed to be involved in the study

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Pregnant women or without adequate contraception

          2. Total length of the resection(s) of the small intestine more than 1 meter

          3. Subtotal colic resection

          4. Preoperative rate of ASCA&lt;63 arbitrary units (+/- 10%)

          5. Known hypersensitivity to fluconazole or other azoles

          6. Known liver disease or transaminase levels &gt;1.5 the normal rate

          7. Patient with renal failure

          8. Inability to read and sign the informed consent
