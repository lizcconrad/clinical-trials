  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is investigating the development of a social skills training program for adults
      with Asperger's Syndrome or high-functioning autism, ages 18 to 35 years. The Principal
      Investigator for this study is Dr. Michael Murray, the director of the Autism Studies
      Division at the Penn State Hershey Medical Center. The purpose of this study is to adapt a
      social skills training program to address and enhance the social skills of adults with
      Asperger's Syndrome and high-functioning autism.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      During group study visits, a group of six young adults with Asperger's Syndrome or
      high-functioning autism will meet weekly for about 90 minutes. The purpose of the group
      sessions is to work on everyday social skills such as initiating and maintaining
      conversations, establishing friendships, and dealing with situations such as job interviews
      and dating.

      A generalization session will be held every week after the group therapy session with
      same-age peers who have been screened to participate in the study. The purpose of including
      peers in the class is to give young adults with Asperger's syndrome and high-functioning
      autism a chance to practice the social skills learned in the group study visit with a peer
      group. Study participants will be paired with a typically developing peer for an outing in
      the community to a nearby restaurant or shop or an in-class exercise such as a mock job
      interview.

Each cohort will consist of 6 adolescents with Aspergers or high-functioning autism, who will be joined by 6 typically-developing peers for the peer generalization portion. During the group therapy session young adults will discuss and watch video clips addressing social skills topics relevant to their age group. They will have a chance to practice these skills when paired with typically developing peer volunteers.</description>
