      Between December 2016 and June 2017, 110 consecutive patients older than 18 years who are
      scheduled to undergo diagnostic or therapeutic ERCP at the Anhui Provincial Hospital will be
      recruited for the study. Patients were randomized using opaque, sealed envelopes containing
      random numbers assigning them to treat with pentoxifylline (pentoxifylline group) or Placebo
      (placebo group) for preventing ERCP pancreatitis.
