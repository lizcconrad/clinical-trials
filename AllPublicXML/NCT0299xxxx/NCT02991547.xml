      The purpose of this study is to find out more information about patients who have cancer
      (adenocarcinoma) of the esophagus or gastroesophageal junction (GEJ) who have been treated
      with chemotherapy and radiation but have not had surgery. The study will follow patients for
      5 years to monitor for their cancer and to see how the standard medical care affects the
      daily life of patients.

          -  Adequate bone marrow function (hemoglobulin ≥8 g/dl, neutrophil ≥1.5x109/L and
             platelet ( ≥100x109/L)

          -  Adequate liver function

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Age &lt; 18 years and &gt;80 years

          -  Contraindication for irradiation: complete obstruction of esophagus, deep esophageal
