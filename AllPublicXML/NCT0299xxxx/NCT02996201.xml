  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to determine whether the use of breast cancer patients' own
      electronic reporting of side effects to chemotherapy in a treatment setting has an impact on
      the handling of side effects and on the number of hospitalizations, febrile neutropenia and
      dose adjustments. We are using the Patient-Reported Outcomes version of the Common
      Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (PRO-CTCAE) for the patients' reporting of side
      effects.
