  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Parkinson's disease (PD) is typically associated with cognitive and movement related
      functional disabilities. One commonly described cognitive complaint is the ability to do
      several things simultaneously, defined as dual or multiple tasking. The Ronnie Gardiner
      Method (RGM) is a rhythm and music based rehabilitation intervention that includes components
      that will train this ability specifically in addition to postural control, motor learning,
      movement ability and general cognitive function. The aim with the present randomized
      controlled single-blinded trial is to evaluate the RGM with main focus on dual-task
      performance, compared to a control group, in individuals with PD. The control group will
      continue with everyday activities, including ordinary exercise activities, with no additional
      activity. Both groups will be evaluated pre-, post-, and after 3 months post intervention.
      Following outcome measures will be analyzed:

        1. dual task performance (motor-motor, and motor-cognitive)

        2. level of physical activity, motor function and balance

        3. cognitive function including memory and spatial function

        4. health-related quality of life, fear of falling, and freezing of gait

        5. qualitative interviews from focus group discussions

      Patients with Parkinson's disease at the neurological department of University Hospital of
      Link√∂ping are included and randomized to either the rhythm and music based rehabilitation
      method Ronnie Gardiner Method or to a control group with no other activity other than
      everyday activities including habitual exercise. Timed Up and Go (TUG) cognitive and TUG
      manual will be used to evaluate dual-task performance. The intervention will take place twice
      weekly for twelve weeks in a neurological rehabilitation facility, and will be led by a
      highly skilled physiotherapist with ten years of practice from the Ronnie Gardiner Method.

    <description>RGM includes functional exercises consisting of cognitively challenging multi-task exercises. The exercises are performed sitting down or standing up with weight shifting exercises. The practitioner projects unique symbols shaped as red or blue hands and feet on the wall in specific 'choreoscores' of 2-8 bars. Red symbolizes left side of the body, blue the right side. Each symbol is accompanied with a certain movement and sound code. To the sound of rhythmical music the participants follow the symbols beat by beat, performing the movements and pronouncing the word. The exercises are progressed by increasing the tempo of the music, or by using more symbols. The practitioner uses a shirt with the color red on one side, and blue on the other side, in order to facilitate for the participants.</description>
