      1. To obtain blood, urine, and breastmilk samples for pharmacokinetics calculations using a
      scheduled collection and analysis strategy. 2. To calculate distribution ratios for
      hydroxyurea across compartments, especially plasma to milk; and 3. To create population PK
      profiles for hydroxyurea to help calculate potential infant drug exposure

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Lactating females, â‰¥ 18.0 years of age, at the time of enrollment

          -  Willingness to limit the baby's exposure to hydroxyurea through breastmilk, such as
             healthy volunteers using the &quot;pump and dump&quot; technique or avoiding direct
             breastfeeding or collection of pumped milk for at least 8 hours after taking the
             hydroxyurea dose. This applies only to healthy controls or women with sickle cell who
             are not already taking hydroxyurea. Women with sickle cell already taking hydroxyurea
             may continue to breastfeed their infants.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Persons with known allergies to hydroxyurea

          -  Failure to sign informed consent, or inability to undergo informed consent process

          -  Persons for whom it is not feasible or medically advisable to obtain the specimens
             necessary for this study
