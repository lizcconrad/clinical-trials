      The aim of this study is to utilize neurophysiologic assessments, behavioral measures and
      clinical measures to assess how much deficits associated with Fragile X Syndrome from
      pre-dose to post-dose Acamprosate, lovastatin, minocycline and placebo.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects ages 15-55, with FXS who completed the study entitled &quot;Mechanisms and brain
             circuits underlying fragile X syndrome (IRB # 2015-8425). FXS is defined as full FMR1
             mutations (&gt;200 CGG repeats) confirmed by genetic testing.

          -  General good health as determined by physical exam, medical history and laboratory
             work up.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects with a history of intolerance to acamprosate, lovastatin, or minocycline will
             be excluded.

          -  Subjects will also be excluded if they have taken any investigational drug within 3
             months, have a history of substance abuse or dependence within 6 months, or
             significant psychiatric or CNS neurological disease unrelated to FXS.

          -  Uncontrolled seizures impact EEG data as do anticonvulsants, barbiturates, lithium and
             benzodiazepines and are exclusions (within 5 half-lives). Those taking other
             psychiatric medications must be on stable doses for 4 weeks before any testing.

          -  For female subjects of child bearing potential, a positive urine pregnancy test.

          -  Potential subjects with a creatinine clearance &lt; 50 mL/min will be excluded.

          -  Identified medical issues, inability to tolerate study procedures or study drug per
             the discretion of the Principal Investigator.
