    <textblock>
      The main purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of a combination
      treatment of AL-335, odalasvir (ODV), and simeprevir (SMV) for 8 weeks in Japanese
      participants with genotype 1 or 2 chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection without cirrhosis
      and for 12 weeks in direct-acting antiviral (DAA)‑naive Japanese participants with genotype 1
      or 2 chronic HCV infection with compensated cirrhosis.
