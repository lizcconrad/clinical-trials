      50 patients received LDLT at Ain Shams Centre for Organ Transplantation (ASCOT) over 1 year
      of whom data of 29 HCC patients were analyzed. Twenty patients met the Milan criteria
      (68.97%) &amp; 4 (13.8%) were beyond Milan but met UCSF criteria and 5 were exceeding UCSF
      criteria (17.2%).All patients underwent preoperative LRTs, The protocol of bridging/down
      staging, methods, duration of follow up, the number of the patients who were successfully
      down-staged before LT and their outcomes after LT were recorded.
