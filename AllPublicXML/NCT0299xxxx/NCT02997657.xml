  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Positive Psychotherapy for Smoking Cessation (PPT-S) addresses an array of risk factors for
      poor smoking outcomes (low positive affect, depressive symptoms, and cynical cognitions),
      while also providing skills that may buffer against stress and negative affect. The overall
      objective of this project is to conduct a randomized controlled trial to test the efficacy of
      PPT-S, enhanced with text messaging, compared to a time-matched behavioral smoking cessation
      treatment. Participants in both treatment conditions will receive nicotine replacement
      therapy and a validated text-messaging intervention for smoking cessation that monitors
      progress in quitting smoking and extends smoking counseling outside of the individual
      face-to-face context.
