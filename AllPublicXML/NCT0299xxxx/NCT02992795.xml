  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, non-blinded, matched control study of young athletes (ages 10-28 years
      old) in collegiate sports. The cohorts are defined in accordance to the athlete's exposure of
      injury. All subjects will complete a minimum of one recording based on their assigned cohort.
      Concussed athletes will complete an additional 3 weeks of follow-up recordings post injury.
      The symptomatic evaluation, physical examination, neurological baseline testing, and
      BrainPulse recordings will be entered in a database to determine clinical outcome and assess
      device utilization.

      Cohort I is defined as all enrolled athletes at the University of Wyoming and is divided into
      two sub-cohorts: Cohort Ia include all athletes participating in Division 1 Athletics; Cohort
      Ib are athletes subscribed to the Head Health Network. Cohort II is defined as all injured
      athletes participating in the teams and includes two sub-cohorts: Cohort IIa is defined as
      non- concussed injured athletes; Cohort IIb concussed athletes per reference standard.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Comparison of BrainPulse recordings of concussed subjects with BrainPulse recordings from their matched Controls</measure>
    <time_frame>Through study completion, expected to be 8 months</time_frame>
    <description>Collect BrainPulse data from at least 15 concussed athletes and matched controls to develop and improve algorithms that can aid in the diagnosis of concussion.
The specific signal patterns observed from confirmed concussed subjects' BrainPulse recordings will be evaluated against the BrainPulse recordings from the matched control subjects.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Correlate helmet sensor's force of impact measurements with BrainPulse data</measure>
    <time_frame>Through study completion, expected to be 8 months</time_frame>
    <description>Compare the magnitude of force measured by helmet sensors from subconcussive hits with consecutive BrainPulse recordings. As such, BrainPulse data on these athletes will be compared with helmet sensor data, baseline cognitive testing, and the initial BrainPulse recording.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Compare BrainPulse Data between Injured Athletes, Non-Injured athletes, and Concussed Athletes</measure>
    <time_frame>Through study completion, expected 8 months</time_frame>
    <description>Compare BrainPulse signals in subjects sustaining a non-concussive injury to subjects that have a confirmed diagnosis of concussion. Also compare BrainPulse signals from injured subjects in Cohort IIa with non-injured subjects in Cohort Ia.</description>

  <arm_group>
    <arm_group_label>Cohort Ia</arm_group_label>
    <description>Athletes in this cohort serve as control subjects participating in Division 1 Athletics at the University of Wyoming. They will be enrolled once they meet eligibility. Upon enrollment, all athletes will have an initial BrainPulse recording. Once a subject from this cohort sustains an injury, they crossover to Cohort II. Also, a matched control for every concussed subject will be selected from Cohort Ia.</description>
  </arm_group>
  <arm_group>
    <arm_group_label>Cohort Ib</arm_group_label>
    <description>Athletes in this cohort are subjects currently subscribed to the Head Health Network. They will have a BrainPulse recording completed every week through the entire season. Similarly, if subjects in this cohort sustain an injury, they will crossover to Cohort II.</description>
  </arm_group>
  <arm_group>
    <arm_group_label>Cohort IIa</arm_group_label>
    <description>Athletes from Cohort I will be assigned to cohort IIa once they sustain an injury other than concussion. They will have been pulled out of the game by the athletic trainer and removed from play until at least the end of the game. Once the subjects have been assigned to Cohort IIa, they will have a BrainPulse recording and a symptom evaluation within 3 days of their injury. After two weeks of recovery, subjects in this cohort will return to Cohort 1 and resume their participation in the study in their respective sub-cohort.</description>
  </arm_group>
  <arm_group>
    <arm_group_label>Cohort IIb</arm_group_label>
    <description>Athletes in this cohort are injured subjects who sustain a non-penetrating head injury and are confirmed to have had a concussion according to the protocol reference standard and by their physician. All subjects enrolled in this cohort are required to have a BrainPulse recording within 3 days of their injury. Each BrainPulse recording will be accompanied by a symptoms evaluation and medical data collection documented in the case report forms. Subjects will complete 3 weeks of follow-up visits post injury.</description>
