      When treating atrial fibrillation and targeting various areas in the left atrium,
      electrophysiologists have the choice to perform ablation with RF energy or cryoenergy.
      Esophageal ulceration and in more rare cases, esophageal fistulae, are known complications of
      this ablation procedure. Though rare (0.1-0.25% fistula rate and 15-20% esophageal ulceration
      rate according to the most recent Heart Rhythm Society EHRA ECA consensus statement)1, the
      investigators would very much like to understand how to completely prevent these occurrences.
      Cryoenergy has more recently been introduced as an energy source used in the PVI procedure;
      therefore, for this energy source, rates of esophageal ulceration are not yet well-defined.
      Nine esophageal fistulae have occurred in the first approximately 130,000 cryoballoon
      procedures.

    <description>To attempt to create recommendations for esophageal temperature-guided ablation in order to increase the safety profile of cryoballoon pulmonary vein isolation (PVI) by providing one center's experience. By trending cryoballoon ablation temperatures and subsequent esophageal temperatures, data trends may emerge and be predictive for esophageal ulceration formation. These trends may include:
Distance between esophagus and pulmonary vein in patients who developed post-ablation esophageal ulcerations
Intra-procedure esophageal temperatures in patients who developed post-ablation esophageal ulcerations
Intra-procedure cryoballoon temperatures in patients who developed post-ablation esophageal ulcerations</description>

    <intervention_name>Esophageal Temperature-Guided Ablation</intervention_name>
    <description>Esophageal temperature-guided ablation (if esophageal temperatures drop too low during cryoablation, the physician will stop the ablation) in order to increase the safety profile of cryoballoon pulmonary vein (a vein carrying blood from the participants lungs to the left side of the participants heart known as the left atrium) isolation (PVI [means a balloon shaped catheter will be placed at the opening of each pulmonary vein and tissue will be cooled in order to create an ablation line (line of scar tissue) between the left side of the participants heart and each pulmonary vein. This is done to prevent the triggers that typically cause intermittent atrial fibrillation (known as Paroxsymal Atrial Fibrillation) by providing one center's experience.</description>
