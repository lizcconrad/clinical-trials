  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to compare the impact of listening to frequency-modulated music vs.
      non-modulated music (both researcher-selected), and to test whether there are differential
      effects on pain and stress perception. Further, these two conditions will be compared to a
      third condition, in which participants will be exposed to self-selected non-modulated music.
      It is hypothesized that both researcher-selected frequency-modulated music and self-selected
      non-modulated music result in stronger decreases in stress and pain compared to
      researcher-selected non-modulated music, while it is expected that there will be no
      differences in researcher-selected frequency-modulated music and self-selected non-modulated
      music. The intervention consists of ten sessions of music listening in the course of three
      consecutive weeks.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to compare the impact of three different music listening interventions on
      stress and pain parameters. Participants will be assigned randomly to one of the conditions.
      In order to avoid expectancy-related effects, participants in both the researcher- and
      self-selected condition are told that they were allocated randomly to frequency-modulated or
      non-modulated music. Therefore, subjects are fully blinded with regards to
      frequency-modulation.

      The study design is as follows:

        -  Baseline measurement: assessment of resting state biological parameters and
           questionnaires, CPT

        -  Music listening sessions: ten sessions in three consecutive weeks including:

             1. 60 minutes of music listening

             2. CPT following music listening (sessions 1, 3, 6, 10 only)

             3. Assessments: biological and subjective pain and stress parameters; music and mood
                related parameters

        -  Post measurement: assessment of resting state biological parameters and questionnaires,
           CPT

        -  Follow-up measurement: 4 weeks after intervention, assessment of resting state
           biological parameters and questionnaires, CPT

      Participants respond to health-related questions (chronic stress, stress reactivity, sleep
      quality, fatigue, menstrual cycle phase) as well as mood and music-related questions at
      baseline, post-intervention, and follow-up which are assessed as potential outcome,
      moderator, and/or control variables. In addition, pain and stress parameters (both biological
      and subjective) are being assessed at baseline, post-intervention and follow-up as well as in
      the course of the ten music listening sessions. Furthermore, participants respond to specific
      music and mood related items following each music listening session (e.g. perceived valence,
      arousal, familiarity, liking, induced emotions, etc.).

      It is hypothesized that listening to researcher-selected frequency-modulated music and
      self-selected non-modulated music results in stronger increases in pain tolerance and
      stronger decreases in pain intensity from baseline to post compared to listening to
      researcher-selected non-modulated music. Furthermore, stronger increases in HRV from baseline
      to post are expected in the researcher-selected frequency-modulated music and self-selected
      non-modulated music than in the researcher-selected non-modulated music listening condition.
      Moreover, it is expected that there will be no differences in researcher-selected
      frequency-modulated music and self-selected non-modulated music with regards to pain and
      stress parameters. Additionally, it will be tested whether changes in pain parameters are
      being moderated by changes in heart rate variability indices.

      Finally, process analysis over the course of the music listening sessions sessions will be
      conducted with biological and subjective pain and stress indices as well as music and mood
      related parameters.
