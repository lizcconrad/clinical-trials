  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of substituting day +4
      cyclophosphamide with post-transplant bendamustine in myeloablative (MAC) or reduced
      intensity conditioning (RIC) haploidentical hematopoietic cell transplantation (HHCT) for
      advanced leukemia and lymphoma patients.

      The phase I component of the study is to evaluate the safety of completely substituting the
      second dose of post-transplant cyclophosphamide (PT-CY) given on day +4 with bendamustine
      (PT-BEN).

      The phase II component of the study will continue to evaluate the safety and efficacy of
      subjects who receive PT-CY on day +3 and PT-BEN on day +4.

      Approximately, a total of 32 subjects will be treated under this protocol. Approximately 12
      to 15 subjects will be used as control, subjects that receive no PT-BEN, for direct
      comparison.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will follow the standard-of-care bone marrow transplant (BMT), with the only
      exception being to gradually substitute post-transplant cyclophosphamide (on day +4 after
      BMT) with bendamustine. Three dose levels are planned for the phase I component of the study,
      consisting of a combination of sequentially reduced doses of cyclophosphamide and increased
      doses of bendamustine (on day +4 after BMT) with the full dose cyclophosphamide on day +3
      after BMT remaining unchanged.

      Control patients will be patients that have declined to participate in the main trial but
      will receive haploidentical BMT with the current standard of two days of PT-CY (and no
      PT-BEN) and will be consented for the immune monitoring studies only.
