  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In the surgical intensive care unit (SICU), goals of critical care are often discussed in
      long-term ventilated patients around the time of extubation. Muscle weakness predicts
      extubation failure but formal muscle strength assessment by the Medical Research Council
      scale is time-consuming and not part of the daily clinical exam. In this observational study,
      we hypothesize that COMA measurement, routinely used by the SICU nurses, is a reliable and
      valid predictor for patients' SICU outcomes. This prospective observational study is carried
      out within a consecutively enrolled cohort of adult patients who are extubated in two SICUs
      at Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston.
