    <textblock>
      Ultraviolet (UV) phototherapy is a standard treatment for many inflammatory dermatological
      diseases, including psoriasis. The systemic effects of UV phototherapy are still not well
      studied. There are several factors that may affect patient's cardiovascular (CV) risk during
      UV phototherapy. Atherosclerosis is now known to have an inflammatory origin and to be
      frequently associated with psoriasis. In this study the investigators aim at studying the
      effect of psoralen-UVA phototherapy on several biomarkers of CV risk in patients with
      psoriasis with or without atherosclerosis.
