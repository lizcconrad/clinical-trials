  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Phosphatase and TENsin homolog (PTEN) gene germline mutations are associated with a spectrum
      of clinical manifestations characterized by neurocognitive deficits, intellectual disability,
      autism symptomatology, skin lesions, macrocephaly, hamartomatous overgrowth of tissues, and
      an increased risk of cancers. Investigators are conducting research to evaluate the potential
      safety and efficacy of RAD001 (everolimus) in this patient population, and the potential
      neurocognitive benefits from treatment with RAD001 or placebo for a six month period. The
      investigators hope this trial will lead to a better understanding of PTEN and to new forms of
      treatment that may benefit children and adults with PTEN in the future.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a signal seeking Phase I/II 6-month, randomized, double-blind placebo-controlled
      trial of RAD001 in children and adolescents, ages 6 to 21 years with a PTEN mutation, with
      safety and neurocognition as the primary endpoints.

      Prior to enrolling in the study and undergoing a series of screening tests to confirm
      eligibility, the participant or a legal guardian will need to sign an informed consent. If
      determined to be eligible for the treatment phase of the trial, participants will be randomly
      assigned to take either the study drug or a placebo (pill with no medicine).

      The study involves about nine visits, six of which will occur at the study site, and three of
      which will be conducted over the phone. These visits will take place over a six month period.
      Study visits will vary in length. Baseline, three month and six month visits may last up to 8
      hours, while all other visits will be less than 2 hours. The study visits include blood
      draws, laboratory tests and neuropsychological assessments. The study will also include
      eye-tracking, the collection of EEG data, and the option to participate in microbiome sample
      collections. There is no fee to participate in this study. The study drug will be provided at
      no charge during the study.

      After the 6 month treatment phase, individuals who were randomly assigned to take placebo
      will be offered inclusion in a 6 month open label phase where the study drug will be provided
      at no charge and assessments will continue as they did in the initial 6 month period.

      After all study data has been analyzed, families will be informed of the overall results.
      Treatment on this study may or may not improve a child's learning skills (neurocognition).
      Future patients may benefit from what is learned.

      Specific Aims /Objectives Primary objective

      -To evaluate the safety of everolimus (RAD001) compared with placebo in patients with PTEN
      mutations focusing on NCI CTCAE Grade 3 and 4 adverse events, serious adverse events, and
      Grade 3 and 4 laboratory toxicities.

      Secondary objectives

      -To evaluate the efficacy of everolimus (RAD001) on neurocognition and behavior in children
      and adolescence with PTEN mutations compared to placebo as measured by standardized, direct
      and indirect neurocognitive tools and behavioral measures.
