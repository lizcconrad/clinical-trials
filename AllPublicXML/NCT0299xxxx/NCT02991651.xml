      Patient selection: a) Pathological confirmation of non-small cell lung cancer without
      activating EGFR mutations; b) Advanced stage disease (IV or IIIB with malignant effusion)
      with at least two prior chemotherapy regimens; c) No available curative therapy; d) Pregnant
      women are excluded; e) Informed consent.

      Pretreatment evaluation: a) Medical history and physical examination; b) Hepatic and renal
      function (bilirubin, aspartate aminotransaminase, creatinine); c) Preoperative staging
      evaluation including CT-chest or PET/CT scan;

      Treatment plan: Three dose levels of IRX4204 and erlotinib will be studied using
      intra-patient dose escalation for dose levels 1 and 2. These study agents will be
      administered orally until progression of disease, unacceptable toxicities, activation of a
      phase II study of the combination, or exhaustion of the IRX4204 drug supply.

      Evaluation on study: Adverse events will be graded on a scale of 0 to 5, using the Common
      Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) v. 4.0. Efficacy will be assessed using the
      RECIST v1.1 criteria based on CT-chest or PET/CT scan after 8 weeks of study treatment.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Numerous studies in pre-clinical models and in human clinical trials have clearly established
      the potential for the use of rexinoids in the treatment and prevention of cancer. IRX4204, a
      second generation rexinoid, is a highly potent and specific activator of RXRs. Because
      IRX4204 is significantly more potent and more selective for the RXRs relative to the RARs
      than a first generation approved RXR agonist drug, bexarotene, it potentially will be
      associated with fewer adverse events and greater activity in clinical use. Preclinical
      studies of the combination of IRX4204 plus erlotinib, and previous clinical studies of the
      combination of the bexarotene plus erlotinib indicated at least additive beneficial effects
      for treatment of NSCLC. This study seeks to investigate the safety and activity of IRX4204 in
      combination with erlotinib in patients with previously treated advanced NSCLC.
