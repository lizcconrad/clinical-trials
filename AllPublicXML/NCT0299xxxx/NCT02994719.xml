  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate whether speed-dependent measures of gait can be
      identified in patients with neurological conditions that affect gait, particularly in
      subjects with parkinsonian disorders.

      This study aims to determine whether the gait patterns in these subjects differ in
      predictable and quantifiable ways from those of age- and sex-matched healthy controls. This
      will be conducted by asking 40 Parkinsonian disorder subjects and 40 age-matched healthy
      control subjects to walk 9 trials over an 18 ft walkway embedded with pressure sensors at
      baseline, self-selected slower and faster speeds. In addition, the protocol aims to
      investigate whether clusters of gait patterns can be identified within subgroups of
      individuals with parkinsonian disorders with varying co-morbidities or treatment conditions.
      For this aim an additional 20 Parkinsonian disorder subjects need to be recruited. There is
      an optional second visit in the protocol during which approximately 20 subjects with
      Parkinsonian disorders, who are willing to come off antiparkinson medication and if
      applicable, off both medication and deep brain stimulation, are asked to walk an additional 9
      trials.

    <study_pop>
      <textblock>
        Subjects with Parkinsonism as defined by UK PD Brain Bank Criteria. The study population
        includes subjects with Parkinson's Disease and may also include subjects who may have
        indeterminate parkinsonism, when it is not clear whether they have idiopathic Parkinson's
        Disease versus one of the Atypical Parkinsonisms, such as Vascular Parkinsonism, Multiple
        System Atrophy, Progressive Supranuclear Palsy, Normal Pressure Hydrocephalus or
        Corticobasal Degeneration.
