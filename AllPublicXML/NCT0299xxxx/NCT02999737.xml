  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The injection of autologous platelet rich plasma (PRP) is a relatively novel therapy,
      generating interest across a wide variety of medical specialties, such as orthopedics,
      dentistry, ophthalmology, and dermatology. Several recently published studies have
      demonstrated efficacy in treating androgenetic alopecia (aka male or female patterned hair
      loss), but each varies in the treatment protocol, and there is no evidence-based data to date
      guiding the dosing parameters of and intervals between injection sessions. We propose a
      single-center, single-blinded randomized pilot trial to investigate the most beneficial
      number and frequency ('schedule') of necessary PRP injections in men and women with
      androgenetic alopecia.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Androgenetic alopecia is the most common form of hair loss, affecting up to 50% of men and 21
      million women in the US alone. Irrespective of gender, balding is known to influence social
      interactions and cause substantial emotional distress, especially for those who begin losing
      their hair at an early age. Topical minoxidil and oral finasteride are currently the only
      Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved therapies for androgenetic alopecia in men, and
      oral agents are used off-label in women but are contraindicated during pregnancy and
      lactation. Response to these therapies varies, and they require continued use to maintain the
      benefits. Hair transplantation surgery is a more permanent, yet costly, solution. All of
      these treatments carry a risk of undesirable side effects, so there is demand for innovative
      new therapeutic options. Autologous platelet rich plasma (PRP) injection is a novel therapy
      for the treatment of patterned hair loss, but no studies to date evaluate different treatment
      protocols head-to-head. Hence, the purpose of this study is to compare the efficacy of two
      different PRP treatment schedules (frequency and number of injection sessions) in men and
      women with androgenetic alopecia.
