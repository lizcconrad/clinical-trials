      The Copenhagen City Heart Study is an ongoing cardiovascular population study initiated in
      1976 which has examined approximately 25,000 individuals from the general population. The
      initial sample has been re-invited up to four times and supplemented by younger individuals.
      The study includes questionnaires, clinical assessment and biomarkers. The population have
      been followed in a number of outcome registries and more than 900 scientific papers have been
      published.

      The Copenhagen City Heart Study, also known as &quot;Østerbroundersøgelsen&quot;, is a large
      prospective cardio-vascular population study of 20,000 women and men that was launched in
      1975 by Dr Peter Schnohr and Dr Gorm Jensen together with statistician Jørgen Nyboe and Prof.
      A. Tybjærg Hansen.

      The original purpose of the study was to focus on prevention of coronary heart disease and
      stroke. During the years many other aspects have been added to the study: pulmonary diseases,
      heart failure, arrhythmia, alcohol, arthrosis, eye diseases, allergy, epilepsia, dementia,
      stress, vital exhaustion, social network, sleep-apnoe, ageing and genetics. In the fourth and
      fifth wave of the examination echocardiography was included.

      The Copenhagen City Heart Study has invited a random sample of the census population in an
      area of central Copenhagen in five waves. The primary population was a random sample of
      19,329 men and women 20-93 years old, drawn from a population of approximately 90,000
      inhabitants aged 20 years or older living in a central part of Copenhagen (Østerbro). Using
      the unique personal identification number (Central-Personal-Register-code), consisting of
      date of birth and a registration number, the sample was age-stratified within 5-year age
      groups, with the main emphasis on the age groups from 35 to 70 years. The total number of
      participants invited to the first four examinations was: 19,329+500+3,000+1,062 = 23,891 men
      and women. Of the original 14,223 examined at the first examination 3,092 (21.7%) have been
      examined in all four examinations.

      Follow-up of mortality and morbidity using the unique personal identification number is
      performed by linkage to a number of nation-wide disease registries. Follow-up completion rate
      is almost 100 percent (less than 0.1% have been lost to follow-up mainly through emigration),
      which is very uncommon for large population studies.

      Overview of the patients examined in the Copenhagen City Heart Study:

        1. st exam: 1976-78, 19,329 invited, 14,223 (73.6%) attended

        2. nd exam: 1981-83, 18,059 invited, 12,698 (71.2%) attended

        5. th exam: 2011-2014, approx 10,000 invited, approx 5000 (50%) attended

      The Copenhagen City Heart Study is governed by a Steering Committee. The data from the
      Copenhagen City Heart Study is made available to researchers upon application to and approval
      by the Steering Committee. The following constitute the Steering Committee:
