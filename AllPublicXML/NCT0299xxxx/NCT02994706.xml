  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cystic fibrosis (CF) is the most common fatal inherited condition in Caucasians, causing
      recurrent chest infections and premature death due to lung failure. When patients develop
      chest infections their symptoms usually slowly worsen over the course of several days to
      weeks. Due to this gradual onset, patients often seek medical attention several days or weeks
      after symptoms start to worsen. The Investigators believe that if they were able to monitor
      patients more closely they could diagnose and treat chest infections earlier and consequently
      improve health outcomes.

      The HOMECF study aims to investigate whether home monitoring is beneficial for adults with
      CF. 100 subjects will be randomly allocated, 50 to receive home monitoring and 50 to receive
      routine clinical care for 12 months. Subjects receiving home monitoring will measure their
      lung function and symptoms twice weekly and this data will be transmitted to the medical team
      by means of a modified mobile phone.

      the Investigators hypothesize that home monitoring will allow them to diagnose chest
      infections at an earlier stage and reduce hospital inpatient days. They will also assess the
      subjects' experience of receiving home monitoring, the impact on body weight and lung
      function and and conduct a full health economic analysis to assess value for money. They will
      also ask subjects to collect a urine sample once weekly to allow us to measure urinary levels
      of inflammatory markers.

      Subjects will be recruited at the West Midlands Adult CF Centre in Birmingham. The research
      team are well placed to carry out the study because it is a large regional adult CF centre
      with an excellent record of conducting clinical research.

      The principal question being answered by this research study is:

      1. Does home monitoring reduce the total number of inpatient hospital days in adults with
      cystic fibrosis (CF) compared to routine clinical care?

      The secondary objectives of this research study are to assess:

        1. The effect of home monitoring on lung function in adults with cystic fibrosis (CF)

        2. The effect of home monitoring on requirement for antibiotics in adults with CF

        3. The effect of home monitoring on nutritional status in adults with CF

        4. The effect of home monitoring on health related quality of life in adults with CF

        5. Costeffectiveness analysis comparing the home monitoring period with the routine
           clinical care period

        6. The patient experience of receiving home monitoring in adults with CF

        7. Whether urine levels of inflammatory markers correlate with symptoms and lung function
           in adults with CF

      The aim of this study is assess whether home monitoring is beneficial for adults with cystic
      fibrosis. Overall, 100 subjects will be recruited at the West Midlands Adult Centre and
      randomly allocated in a 1:1 ratio to receive home monitoring or routine clinical care for 12
      months.

    <description>The Cystic Fibrosis Questionnaire Revised version (CFQ-R) is a multiple choice and likert questionnaire split into two sections: Demographics and Quality of Life. Answers of 'Always' or similar are deemed a higher value than 'Never' or similar. The total score is gathered by calculating the amount of 'positive' and 'negative' answers - 'positive' answers are those that are lower values (e.g. never) than those that are higher values (e.g. 'always)</description>

    <description>The Euro Quality of Life (EQ5D) is a multiple choice questionnaire split onto sections including Mobility, Self-Care, Usual activities, Pain/Discomfort, and Anxiety/Depression. For each of these sections, it asks if a person always have issues, some issues or no issues (e.g. Mobility - I have no problems / I have some problems / I am confined to bed). The total score is gathered by calculating the amount of 'positive' and 'negative' answers - 'positive' answers are those that are lower values (e.g. I have no issues) than those that are higher values (e.g. I am confined to bed). There is also a scale, ranging from 0 (worst imaginable health) to 100 (best imaginable health) with 99 intervals in between whereby the patient marks where they feel their current health lays.</description>

For each of these sections, it asks whether a person has no problem, some problems, many problems or total problem with a certain area (e.g. Being Independent - I can achieve in all aspects of my life / I can achieve in many aspects of my life / I can achieve in some aspects of my life / I am unable to be at all independent). The total score is gathered by calculating the amount of 'positive' and 'negative' answers - 'positive' answers are those that are lower values (e.g. I can achieve in all aspects of my life) than those that are higher values (e.g. I am unable to be at all independent).</description>

    <description>Home monitoring will involve participants recording their symptoms twice weekly on a modified mobile phone and recording their lung function twice weekly using a digital spirometer. This data will be automatically transmitted to the CF team and we will contact patients on the mobile phone if symptoms and/or lung function decline below a set threshold, suggesting the onset of a pulmonary exacerbation. We will contact patients within 24 hours of symptoms and/or lung function falling below this set threshold.</description>
