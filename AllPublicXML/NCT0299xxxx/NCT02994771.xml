      Indicated for the Treatment of Secondary Lymphedema Associated with the Treatment of Breast
      Cancer.

      Primary objective is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of a single dose of Lymfactin®
      in patients with secondary lymphedema associated with the treatment of breast cancer.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open label, multi-center, uncontrolled first in human trial that uses a standard 3
      + 3 dose escalation scheme. Lymfactin® will be administered as a single dose by ex vivo
      perinodal injection into the fat pad of a flap of tissue containing lymph nodes from the
      abdominal wall. This flap of tissue will then be surgically implanted into the axillary
      region of the affected arm. This treatment with Lymfactin® may be performed in conjunction
      with or without breast reconstruction surgery.

      Up to two dose cohorts are planned to be included. Each dose of Lymfactin® will be
      administered as a single dose via perinodal injection in a volume of 2 mL:

        -  Cohort 1: Lymfactin® [1 x 10E10 vp]

        -  Cohort 2: Lymfactin® [1 x 10E11 vp]

      Should the dose escalation go up to Cohort 2 with initiation of a subsequent Extension Cohort
      a total of 15 - 21 patients may be treated in this study.

               1. A patient with childbearing potential should be using a reliable contraception
                  method: intrauterine device (hormonal or non-hormonal); oral combination pill or
                  hormonal contraception patch; or two of the following: intra-vaginal hormonal

             drug administration, that would affect the patient's ability to follow study-related
             procedures, or that may interfere with the interpretation of study results and, in the
             Investigator's opinion, would make the patient inappropriate for entry into this
