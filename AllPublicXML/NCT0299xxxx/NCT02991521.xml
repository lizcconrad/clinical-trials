      This research study aims to improve the standard exam called Focused Assessment with
      Sonography in Trauma (FAST). The FAST exam is an ultrasound test used to identify an
      abdominal bleed. The study will see if having patients roll on their right side improves the
      FAST exam. Making the FAST exam better can help trauma doctors save the lives of patients
      with bleeding.
