    <time_frame>3 years</time_frame>
    <description>EQ-5D™ is a standardized questionnaire as judged by the patients. This questionnaire consists of two parts:
Five dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression. Each dimension consists of 5 levels of grading: no problem, slight problem, moderate problem, severe problem and extreme problem. For youths, 3 levels of grading: no problem, some problems, and a lot of problems.
Visual analogue scale (VAS) is a vertical scale from 0 (worst) to 100 (best).</description>
