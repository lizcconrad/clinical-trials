      Primary objective To discover the efficacies of levonorgestrel-containing intrauterine device
      (LNG-IUS, Mirena®), with or without metformin, as fertility-preserving treatment for grade 1
      endometrioid adenocarcinoma of endometrium, cT1aN0M0 with presumed no myometrial invasion on
      image study (MRI preferred).

      Secondary objectives

        1. To discover the morphological and molecular change in the endometrium tumor before and
           after treatment

        2. To discover the effectiveness of adding oral progestin to subjects who show no good
           response to assigned

        3. To compare (1) the systemic effects, including body weight change, neuropsychiatric
           alternation, GI disturbance, skin disorder, change in serum metabolic and hepatic
           markers between the two study patient groups; (2) The rate of long-term success defined
           as (a) sustained remission of &gt;= 12 months starts from the histologic documentation of
           complete remission (b) rate of pregnancy and (c) alive baby delivery, based on
           time-to-event analysis.

        4. Molecular markers and their expression before, during and after treatment, including
           progesterone B receptor, progesterone A receptor, estrogen receptor, Ki67, PTEN and its
           related markers, Bcl2 and its related markers and other developing markers. This is to
           discover prediction markers to medical treatment.

    <description>The enrolled patient is allocated to either LNG-IUS only or LNG-IUS + metformin by central randomization with study site allocation. A 90-100 days of continuous treatment before first histologic assessment of treatment response is required. The patient will receive endometrial curettage or hysteroscopic evaluation and resection of suspected lesion after 90-100 days of treatment. Patients with good response to assigned treatment will continue the treatment for another 90-100 days and second histologic assessment will be performed. Patients with poor response to assigned treatment at first assessment will receive additive oral progestin therapy, along with the assigned regimen(s) as, Oral progestin, either medroxyprogesterone acetate 500 mg daily or oral megestrol acetate 160 mg daily After a total of at least 6 months treatment period, the patient with good response at first assessment is suggested to keep the Mirena for maintenance until plan to get pregnant</description>
