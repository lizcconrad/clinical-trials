    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of an intervention with a
      mobile adherence platform, compared to physician- or nurse-guided standard of care, to
      improve medication adherence to rivaroxaban in participants who have recently initiated
      treatment with rivaroxaban for stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation based on an
      assessment of the proportion of days covered (PDC) of rivaroxaban treatment.

    <description>Participant adherence will be monitored using a mobile application and platform which provides a real-time reminder that alerts the participant to take his or her medication. The application will also send an alert to the participant when a refill is needed based on calculated medication or pill supply.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  A history of atrial fibrillation

          -  Taking newly-prescribed rivaroxaban for atrial fibrillation for less than or equal to
             (&lt;=) 90 days or who are about to initiate therapy (with a prescription dated in the
             last 90 days)

          -  At least 1 of the 4 questions answered &quot;yes&quot; from the four-item Morisky Medication
             Adherence Scale (MMAS-4)

          -  Possession of a compatible smartphone with an active phone number, text and data plan.
             The smartphone must be in continued possession of the participant. It may not be a
             shared device and must exclusively remain in the possession of the participant during
             the study period. The smartphone must have an active cellular phone number and

             cellular data plan

          -  Willing to have the adherence application installed on a smartphone and use it every
             day during the entire study period

             pharmacy for oral anticoagulation medication and refill data

             medication adherence application

          -  Ability to read and understand English

             participant interview

          -  Prescribed rivaroxaban for indications other than atrial fibrillation (Prescriptions
             for concomitant conditions are allowed as long as 1 of the indications is atrial
             fibrillation)

          -  Current use of: specialized anticoagulation clinics for rivaroxaban medication
             management; specialized pharmacist-led adherence or refill monitoring; or enrollment
             in a medication adherence program even if that program is for medications other than
             rivaroxaban

          -  Current use of adherence tracking devices, hardware, smartphone or computer
             applications, including but not limited to smart pill bottles, pill timers,
             radiofrequency tagged medications or dispensers, mobile applications, or automated
             phone reminders. Pharmacy and health care plan automated refill reminders are
             permitted and are not exclusion. Pill organizers or containers that only
             compartmentalize a participant's medications based on days of the week are not
             exclusion. Pill organizers that remind participants when to take medicine with beeps
             or alerts are exclusion

          -  Cognitive, visual, hearing, voice, or motor impairment that would prevent completion
             of study procedures or use of mobile phone

          -  Employee of the investigator or study site, with direct involvement in the proposed
             study or other studies under the direction of that investigator or study site, as well
