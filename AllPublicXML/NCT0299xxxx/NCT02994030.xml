      Development of a new MS-based biomarker for the early and sensitive diagnosis of Duchenne
      disease from plasma

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a rare muscle disorder but it is one of the most
      frequent genetic conditions affecting approximately 1 in 3,500 male births worldwide.

      It is usually recognized between three and six years of age. DMD is characterized by weakness
      and wasting (atrophy) of the muscles of the pelvic area followed by the involvement of the
      shoulder muscles. As the disease progresses, muscle weakness and atrophy spread to affect the
      trunk and forearms and gradually progress to involve additional muscles of the body. In
      addition, the calves appear enlarged in most patients. The disease is progressive and most
      affected individuals require a wheelchair by the teenage years. Serious life-threatening
      complications may ultimately develop including disease of the heart muscle (cardiomyopathy)
      and breathing (respiratory) difficulties.

      New methods, like mass-spectrometry give a good chance to characterize specific metabolic
      alterations in the blood (plasma) of affected patients that allow diagnosing in the future
      the disease earlier, with a higher sensitivity and specificity. Therefore it is the goal of
      the study to identify and validate a new biochemical marker from the plasma of the affected
      patients helping to benefit other patients by an early diagnose and thereby with an earlier
      treatment.

      For the development of the new biomarkers using the technique of Mass-spectrometry 7, 5 ml
      EDTA blood and a dry blood spot filter card are taken. To proof the correct diagnosis of
      Duchenne disease in those patients where up to the enrollment in the study no genetic testing
      has been done, sequencing of Duchenne disease will be done.
