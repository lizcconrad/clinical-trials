  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will explore the potential of the circulating tumour DNA (ctDNA) as predictive
      factor of response/resistance to anticancer treatment. The project will involve the
      collection and study of the archived tumour tissue where available (mandatory), serial blood
      samples (mandatory) and fresh tumour biopsies (optional) from patients taking part in an
      early phase clinical trial.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Some patients respond to anti-cancer drugs whilst others do not, despite having tumours with,
      apparently, similar characteristics such as site of origin. This variability in response can
      in some cases be explained by the genetic profile of the tumour. Therefore, studying the
      relationship between the molecular profiles of individual cancers and the response to therapy
      over time is of crucial importance in drug development. However, this endeavour is hampered
      by the difficulty in accessing suitable tumour material for analysis. Many patients' tumours
      are at anatomical sites which make biopsy difficult / hazardous which is in addition to the
      discomfort of a biopsy procedure. Therefore, this study will explore the potential of the
      circulating tumour DNA as a predictive factor of response/resistance to anticancer treatment.

      For patients recruited to early phase clinical trials of experimental therapies, archival
      tumour tissue (mandatory), serial blood samples (mandatory) and fresh tumour biopsies
      (optional) will be collected according to the individual schedule of each clinical trial.

      Blood plasma samples will be tested for cell-free and ctDNA levels and genomic profiles,
      which may include analyses of mutational profiles, copy number variations, translocations,
      chromosomal rearrangements and/or epigenetic profiles.

      Molecular profiling of archival and fresh tumour biopsies will also be carried out to study
      the correlation with cell-free and ctDNA samples and investigate the potential predictor
      response/resistance to treatment.
