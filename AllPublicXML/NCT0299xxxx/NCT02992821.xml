  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Among patients admitted with cerebral ischemia (stroke and transitory ischemic attack (TIA))
      it is important to reveal the underlying cause of the disease. In special it is important to
      reveal if carotid artery stenosis is present as such a finding will directly influence on
      treatment and follow-up.

      For the diagnosis of carotid artery stenosis due to atherosclerosis ultrasound examinations
      is the cornerstone, but computer tomography and magnetic resonance imaging may be better in
      some cases. Development of high quality pocket-sized ultrasound scanners has allowed for semi
      quantitatively bed-side assessment of the carotid arteries and the heart.

      The investigators aim to study the feasibility and reliability of bed-side assessment of the
      carotid arteries by pocket-sized ultrasound scanners in inexperienced hands and the clinical
      influence of this examination when performed by experienced users.

      The investigators hypothesize that a significant proportion of this patient population can be
      clarified bed-side by junior doctors with no need of further imaging procedures for the
      assessment of the carotid arteries and the heart.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Population: Approximately 100 patients admitted to the Department of Medicine, Levanger
      Hospital and Stroke Department, St. Olavs Hospital with history and findings suspicious of
      stroke/transitory ischemic attack (TIA). Informed consent mandatory.

      Exclusion criteria: CT angiography of carotid vessels performed after index event, unless all
      participating clinicians are fully blinded to the results.

      Hypotheses:

      The carotid arteries can be assessed bed-side by pocket-size ultrasound scanners with high
      feasibility and reliability by junior doctors with limited training.

      Bed-side assessment of the carotid arteries by pocket-size ultrasound scanners may reduce the
      need for more advanced (higher cost) imaging procedures.

      New high frame rate tracking doppler can increase accuracy and reproducability of stenosis
      grading.

      Methods:

      Pocket-size imaging device from GE Ultrasound, commercial available. Approved for clinical
      use. High-end carotid Doppler ultrasound by high-end equipment (GE Vivid 9) and computer
      tomography and magnetic resonance imaging at the Department of Radiology, Levanger Hospital
      and St. Olavs Hospital Verasonics research scanner for high fram rate imaging
