    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to investigate the relative effectiveness of CCT on water
      versus on land in stroke patients. Additionally, the study will to determine if there are
      differences in the results obtained, between two CCT programs in the following parameters:
      gait, balance and dexterity

      This study is a randomized controlled trial of the effectiveness of a structured CCT program
      in water versus a structured CCT program on land in the rehabilitation of stroke survivors.

    <description>CCT on water. The intervention developed in this study will be through the realization of an exercise program in circuit (CCT). One of the groups will receive treatment in the water (intervention group), and the other on land (control group). In both groups, the intervention will be a 7-week class therapy, 3-times weekly, giving a total of 20 sessions.</description>

    <description>The circuit, the main part of the session, include a series of 10 different workstations, arranged to progress in complexity, in order to work several segments of the body, oriented towards a functional recovery objective. These stations will be made up of task-specific activities for gait, balance and dexterity. Time in each workstation will be 5 minutes divided as follows: 4 minutes work period and 1 minute rest period, of these, last 30 seconds will be change period for crossing from one workstation to the next. After 50 minutes, each patient will have covered the 10 workstations, thus working in all of the objectives pursued in the realization on this CCT: gait, balance and dexterity.</description>
