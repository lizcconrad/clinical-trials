  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the effects of qigong practice with fitness exercise
      on balance, fall-efficacy, physical functions, psychological wellbeing and quality of life of
      stroke survivors.

      Participants: A total of 58 stroke survivors 3 months after the current stroke will be
      recruited.

      Methodology: An assessor-blinded, randomized controlled trial will be conducted. Stroke
      survivors will be included in the study if they meet the inclusion criteria. Selected
      patients will be randomly allocated into either the experimental group or the control group.
      Participants allocated in the experimental group will receive qigong training while this
      qigong training will be replaced by a home fitness exercise in the control group. The
      experimental and control groups will be required to practice a total of 50 minutes of qigong
      and fitness training 3 times per week and for 16 weeks respectively. The main outcome measure
      is balance capacity with Mini-BESTest. The secondary outcomes are fall efficacy, number of
      falls, postural stability and control, depression, physical functions and quality of life.
      Assessments will be done at baseline, 8 weeks and 16 weeks follow-ups by blinded assessors.

      Data analysis: The results will be analyzed using two-way repeated measures analysis of
      variance with Statistical Package for Social Science version 21.0. Alpha will be set at 0.05.
