  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators will longitudinally measure cerebrovascular reactivity (CVR) by functional
      near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) in acute (≤3 days from injury), subacute, and chronic
      phases after TBI as a biomarker of TCVI as compared to healthy controls. CVR will be measured
      by fNIRS response to hypercapnia. The investigators hypothesize that CVR will be decreased
      after TBI and that these decreases will correlate with clinical outcomes. Furthermore, the
      investigators predict that administration of a vasodilatory medication (sildenafil) will
      augment CVR after TBI.

    <description>Subjects will be recruited from the neurointensive care unit within 72 hours of their injury. At the time of informed consent, the investigators will perform fNIRS testing with a hypercapnia challenge, fNIRS with hypercapnia challenge 60 minutes after a single oral dose of 50mg sildenafil citrate, outcome qustionaires and symptom checklists (including: Glasgow Outcomes Scale-Extended, Rivermead Post-Concussive Symptom Questionnaire, Brief Symptom Inventory, Alcohol Consumption Questionnaire, Patient Health Questionnaire, and Insomnia Severity Index). This will all be administered again at 14 days, 90 days, 180 days, 1 year, 2 years, 3 years, and 4 years after injury.</description>

  <arm_group>
    <arm_group_label>Sub-acute/Chronic TBI</arm_group_label>
    <description>Subjects who suffered a TBI previously and have now entered a subacute or chronic phase of their TBI will be approached by the research team at their clinic visit with a TBI specialist. In those subjects, study timing will be based on the time of their original injury, therefore will start study visits at the next possible time point.</description>

  <arm_group>
    <arm_group_label>Healthy Controls</arm_group_label>
    <description>The investigators will also enroll healthy &quot;peer controls&quot;. These control subjects will be family members and friends of TBI subjects. These peer controls are likely to have similar environmental and socioeconomic exposures/support which may impact recovery after TBI and may also impact CVR. These control subjects will meet the same inclusion/exclusion criteria as TBI subjects without the requirement for an injury or acute brain imaging. These subjects will be tested in the same way as both TBI groups, but will only have one visit.</description>

    <intervention_name>Sildenafil citrate</intervention_name>
    <description>Sildenafil is a potent and specific PDE5 inhibitor, which was initially developed for the treatment of hypertension and angina. Its effectiveness as a treatment for male erectile dysfunction became apparent during Phase I clinical trials, and the focus of drug development shifted to this indication. In patients with cerebrovascular dysfunction, a few preliminary studies have used sildenafil to increase CVR. Participants in the pilot study had CVR tested in response to hypercapnia measured twice, at baseline and then 1 hour after administration of sildenafil citrate, 50 mg by mouth. The investigators have an IND exemption for the uses in this study.</description>

    <description>Functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) will be used to measure regional cerebral blood flow and cerebrovascular reactivity. are connected to the scalp and surrounding detectors a few cm away detect the light as it scatters through the underlying tissues. The technique is able to detect changes in the absorption spectrum of the tissue corresponding to the concentrations of oxyhemoglobin (HbO2) and deoxyhemoglobin (HbR), and indicate local perfusion changes.</description>

    <description>The study device is a Douglas Bag that traditionally is designed to measure respiratory exchange. It consists of large bag attached to a mouthpiece utilized to hold either expired air from the subject or filled with different concentrations of air to be aspired. For the purposes of this study, the Douglas Bag will be utilized to induce hypercapnia in the subject. The bag is equipped with a switch that allows rapid shifting from room air to 5% CO2 each minute over 7 minutes.</description>
