    <textblock>
      Rationale: Accurate staging of lung cancer is important because it directs treatment and
      determines prognosis. The development of Stereotactic Ablative Radiotherapy (SABR), has
      revolutionized radiation therapy for early stage lung cancer and results demonstrate similar
      outcomes in comparison to surgical resection of the lung tumor. The staging work-up program
      for patients with a potentially resectable Non-Small-Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) includes at
      least a computed tomography (CT) scan of the chest and integrated Positron Emission
      Tomography - Computed Tomography (PET/CT) scans, and when indicated, invasive mediastinal
      staging. However, patients who are treated with SABR do not routinely undergo the same nodal
      staging work-up as do surgical candidates. As both surgery and SABR appear to achieve
      comparable rates of local and regional tumor control, it appears only logical to perform a
      similar staging work-up in all patients with early stage lung cancer who will be treated with
      either of the two curative local modalities. In the past, a lack of invasive nodal sampling
      before SABR was considered acceptable as invasive surgical staging (mediastinoscopy) was
      widely considered the preferred procedure. However, with minimally invasive and safe
      endosonography procedures now available, improved pre-treatment staging has become possible
      for patient groups who are eligible for SABR, including those with significant comorbidities.

      Hypothesis: Complete endosonographic (combined endobronchial and esophageal) staging of hilar
      and mediastinal lymph nodes in patients with (suspected) non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC)
      will result in change of loco-regional nodal status in 20% of patients, in comparison to
      staging by PET-CT alone.

      Study population: Patients with either established or suspected early-stage NSCLC who are
      medically inoperable, or who refuse surgery but are potential candidates for SABR with
      curative intent (provided no intrathoracic metastases are present). Patients will undergo a
      single scope complete mediastinal and hilar staging procedure (combined EndoBronchial
      UltraSound (EBUS) and Transesophageal Endoscopic Ultrasound with EBUS scope (EUS-B)).
