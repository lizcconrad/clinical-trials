      This study was to evaluate the effect of intraoperative intravenous lidocaine on
      postoperative pain management after laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Half of patients will
      receive intravenous lidocaine during procedure, the rest half of patients will receive
      regular anesthesia care and placebo treatment.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Postoperative pain and ileus are primary reasons for delayed patient recovery and longer
      hospital stays after abdominal surgery. Opioids have been widely used to treat pain in this
      patient population. However, opioid administration can exacerbate postoperative ileus and
      further delay patient recovery. Multimodal approaches and adjunctive therapies are therefore
      recommended for pain control after abdominal surgery to reduce opioid consumption and
      opioid-related adverse effects.

      Studies have reported that systemically administered lidocaine has analgesic,
      anti-inflammatory, and anti-hyperalgesic effects. Several clinical trials have been published
      that evaluated systemically administered lidocaine for postoperative pain management and
      recovery after surgery. However, the evidence for beneficial effects of systemic lidocaine
      for postoperative recovery remains controversial. Therefore, the investigators performed this
      study to evaluate the efficacy of systemic administration of lidocaine for postoperative
      analgesia and gastrointestinal recovery after laparoscopic cholecystectomy. The investigators
      primary hypothesis is that systemic lidocaine administration reduces pain intensity following
      surgery.
