  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to assess the safety and immunogenicity of the CYD dengue vaccine
      when administered concomitantly or sequentially with Gardasil® (Human Papillomavirus
      Quadrivalent [Types 6, 11, 16, and 18] Vaccine, Recombinant).

      Primary objectives:

        -  To demonstrate that the humoral immune response (in terms of geometric mean
           titers[GMTs]) to Gardasil after concomitant administration is non-inferior to sequential
           administration with the CYD dengue vaccine measured 28 days after the last dose of
           Gardasil.

        -  To demonstrate that the humoral immune response to the CYD dengue vaccine after
           concomitant administration is non-inferior to sequential administration with Gardasil
           measured 28 days after the last dose of the CYD dengue vaccine.

      Secondary Objectives:

        -  To demonstrate that the humoral immune response (in terms of seroconversion) to Gardasil
           after concomitant administration is non-inferior to sequential administration with the
           CYD dengue vaccine measured 28 days after the last dose of Gardasil

        -  To describe the humoral immune response to Gardasil at baseline and after each dose of
           Gardasil in each and any group

        -  To describe the humoral immune response to the CYD dengue vaccine at baseline and after
           each dose of the CYD dengue vaccine in each and any group

        -  To describe the safety of Gardasil and the CYD dengue vaccine after each and any dose in
           each group.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Participants were to receive 3 doses of CYD dengue vaccine and 2 doses of Gardasil
      administered either concomitantly or sequentially.

      Due to a protocol amendment, only previously dengue exposed participants (seropositive for
      dengue before vaccination) will be eligible to complete the vaccination schedule. Dengue
      unexposed participants (seronegative for dengue before vaccination) will not receive any
      additional CYD dengue vaccine injections, but will be followed for safety up to 6 months
      after the last injection.

      All participants will be assessed for immunogenicity and safety. Safety assessments include
      solicited reactions within 7 or 14 days after each injection, unsolicited adverse events
      within 28 days after each injection, and serious adverse events during the study period.
