  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Drugs used for managing chronic pain have not proven to be effective and chronic pain
      continues to cost Canadians $60 billion a year without truly helping those who suffer. The
      study proposes to investigate the factors related to a person that can enhance or reduce the
      effectiveness of pain treatments in people suffering with chronic pain. Treatment response to
      pain killers in a person may be related to their brain, genetics, social, and psychological
      makeup. The investigators aim to study these factors to identify and develop feasible and
      robust indicators based on a person's biological makeup (also called biomarkers). These
      biomarkers will allow doctors and researchers to predict more accurately which treatment and
      prevention strategies for a particular disease will work in which groups of people. These
      measures will offer new opportunities for improving treatment such as by tailoring treatment
      to meet the specific needs of each patient based on his/her biological and psychological
      makeup. Towards the specific aim, data will first be collected in several experimental
      domains for studying treatment expectations (cognitive, psychosocial, brain-related,
      genetic). These 'experimental' data will be compared between chronic back pain (CBP) and
      healthy participants to yield new understanding of the factors that govern treatment
      response. At the end of experimental data collection, the investigators will collect data in
      the 'clinical' domain. Hence, at the end of the experimental sessions, a subset of CBP
      participants will receive a mock drug (placebo disguised as an approved pain treatment) and
      another subset will provide pain ratings only and hence serve as a waiting list control for
      the placebo trial. Data will be studied in steps to understand factors that mediate treatment
      outcomes and finally the investigators will use advanced computational tools used for big
      data analysis and aim to identify factors that can be used as biomarkers and precision
      medicine tools.

    <description>Chronic Back Pain participants will enter an optional placebo trial. This phase of the study will test the clinical usefulness of the biomarkers. We will measure how expectation of starting a new treatment reduces 'clinical back pain' in each participant. Positive treatment expectations will be induced by giving them capsules containing inert material and telling them that the capsules contain an effective drug that has been approved for treating Chronic Back Pain. They will be requested to take two capsules twice a day and report their pain on paper forms organized as a calendar.</description>
