      A retrospective, quantitative study was carried out by analyzing the medical records of a
      reference ophthalmologic hospital in Goiás. Data from the pre and post YAG laser refractive
      index data were collected from 67 eyes of 66 patients analyzed in the period from May to
      November 2016.

      We studied 67 eyes of 66 patients , both men and women , and 32 ( 47,7%) underwent myopia
      after the capsulotomy procedure with YAG laser and 25 ( 37.3%) hypermetropization and 10
      (14.9%) maintained the refraction. The difference in refraction was found by the arithmetic
      mean of the spherical equivalent for the precapsulotomy procedure of -28.85D and
      post-capsulotomy of -31.75 D , giving a difference of -2.9 .

      It was concluded with this study that the use of posterior capsulotomy with YAG laser post
      facectomy caused changes in the refraction of the patients studied, presenting myopia with
      greater frequency in the results. With these data, we observed the need for other future
      studies with a large number of eyes to prove what happened in this study.
