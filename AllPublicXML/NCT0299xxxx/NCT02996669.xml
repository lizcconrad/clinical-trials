  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter longitudinal study that aims to identify, develop and validate a set of
      measures that can be used as stratification biomarkers and/or sensitive and reliable
      objective measures of social impairment in autism spectrum disorders (ASD) that could serve
      as markers of long term clinical outcome. The main study will include 275 individuals: 200
      ASD subjects between 6-11 years old, and 75 TD subjects roughly matched by age and sex to the
      ASD group.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The specified aims of this study are to accelerate the development of effective treatments
      for social impairment in ASD by validating outcome measures that will be sensitive and
      reliable assessments of response to treatment and electroencephalography (EEG) and
      eye-tracking (ET) biomarkers. These hypothesized outcomes could then be used to reduce the
      heterogeneity of samples via stratification, could possibly indicate early efficacy, and/or
      demonstrate target engagement. The consortium will conduct a naturalistic, longitudinal study
      of preschool and school-aged (6-11 years) children with ASD and typical development (TD) with
      intelligence quotient(s) (IQ) ranging from 50-150. Children will be assessed across three
      time points (Baseline, 6 weeks and 24 weeks) using clinician, caregiver and lab-based (LB)
      measures of social impairment, along with a battery of conceptually related EEG and ET tasks
      and independent ratings of clinical status.

    <measure>Video Tracking</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Video tracking of social behavior is an observational method involving automated tracking of children's movements using the Noldus EthoVision Computerized tracking system. Using computer vision, video recordings of children's movements assess proximity-seeking/approach behaviors. During one six-minute free-play session in the laboratory, children's movements will be recorded from a ceiling-mounted camera and two side cameras while a parent sits in a corner of the room. Software automatically tracks the child (via the ceiling mounted camera) as the child plays with a standardized set of toys and interacts with the parent, and computes the percentage of session spent near the parentlatency to approach the parent, percentage of time spent in the periphery and latency to approach the periphery. A subset of side camera recordings will be manually coded by reliable coders for social engagement behaviors to validate the automatically generated movement behaviors calculated by EthoVision.</description>

    <description>The Aberrant Behavior Checklist (ABC) is a symptom checklist for assessing problem behaviors of children and adults with neurodevelopmetnal disorder at home, in residential facilities, ICFs/MR, and work training centers. It is also useful for classifying problem behaviors of children and adolescents with neurodevelopmetnal disorder in educational settings, residential and community-based facilities, and developmental centers.

VEPs reflect excitatory (glutamatergic) and inhibitory (GABAergic) activity and may index subgroups of ASD with low-level visual impairments.

Color images depicting 12 different female faces with direct gaze and the same faces with averted gaze will be presented. Twelve different exemplars from each of five categories (alarm clocks, mobile phones, birds, cars, and shoes) will be used as distracters. Twelve different slides will each contain six images (one face and five distracters, one from each category) placed at an equal distance from the center of the screen. Each slide contains a different set of six images, each image being shown only once in the experiment. This measure examines scanning patterns towards arrays of objects, synthetic stimuli, and faces as well as towards more complex naturalistic (static) scenes.

             is preferred that the child and both biological parents participate in the blood draw
             procedure, but the inability to obtain blood samples from trios will not be
             exclusionary.

        Exclusion Criteria:

             are not eligible.

          -  Medication is not exclusionary. Children taking neurological or psychiatric

          -  History of significant prenatal/perinatal/birth injury (birth &lt;36 weeks AND weight
             &lt;2000 grams (approximately 4.5lbs)).

          -  History of neonatal brain damage. (e.g., with diagnoses hypoxic or ischemic event)

          -  Any other factor that the investigator feels would make assessment or measurement
             performance invalid.

             treatment (medication or other treatment) for a psychiatric condition. Participants
             will be screened using the Child/Adolescent Symptom Inventory (CASI-5). Due to the
             measurements sensitivity, any score in the clinical range will be reviewed by research
             staff for determination of eligibility.
