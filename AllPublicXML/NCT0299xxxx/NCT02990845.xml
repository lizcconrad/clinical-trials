    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, single-arm, multicenter, pilot study of pembrolizumab, exemestane, and
      leuprolide for subjects being resistant for front-line hormonal therapy for inoperable
      locally advanced or metastatic hormonal receptor positive (HR+)/ Human epidermal growth
      factor receptor 2 (HER2) negative breast cancer. All the patients will be included in the
      final tolerability and preliminary efficacy analysis. The efficacy objectives including PFS,
      overall response rate (ORR), clinical benefit rate (CBR), and duration of response (DOR).
      Adverse effects will be recorded according to CTCAE v4.0.
