    <measure>Assessment of oral hygiene .</measure>
    <time_frame>12 month</time_frame>
    <description>using a Questionnaire (binary' yes or no questions'):-
record child brushing habits(once or twice)
consumption of fluoridated water (yes/no).
visits to dentists (yes/no)
Also using a dental mirror and a probe to detect presence of plaque (plaque index) and presence of caries (dmf score).</description>

    <measure>Assessment of dietary habits</measure>
    <time_frame>12 month</time_frame>
    <description>questionnaire (binary &quot;yes/no questions&quot;)about the past and current feeding habits:-
initial feeding of the child (breast or bottle answered yes/no)
length of the breast feeding ( normal '0-2 years&quot; or prolonged &quot;&gt;2years&quot;)
usage of bottle after weaning (yes/no). number of meals per day (one,two or three, answered in yes/no manner)
number of snacks per day (one,two or three in yes/no answers).
Also using a dental mirror and a probe to detect caries presence (dmf score), higher scores indicates faulty dietary habits.</description>
