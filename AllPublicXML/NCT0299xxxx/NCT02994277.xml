      The purpose of this study is to use closed-loop systems with the algorithms designed by the
      University of Virginia and by the Instituto Tecnologico de Buenos Aires (ITBA)/ Universidad
      Nacional de La Plata (UNLP)/ Universidad Nacional de Quilmes (UNQ) to determine the infusion
      of insulin in a prolonged period of time in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM).

      Aims:

        1. To test University of Virginia closed-loop algorithm with meal announcement for 36 hours
           at our facilities.

        2. To test the ability of the closed-loopInstituto Tecnologico de Buenos Aires (ITBA)/
           Universidad Nacional de La Plata (UNLP)/ Universidad Nacional de Quilmes (UNQ) algorithm
           without meal announcement to maintain glucose control for 2 periods of 12 hours

      In both cases, the adequate operation of the system will be considered verified if the system
      works properly at least 80% of the total connection time .

    <description>The UVa algorithm is an already established mathematical model that can be programmed in DiAs software to manage glycaemia in T1DM through a subcutaneous insulin pump and a continous glucose monitoring. This algorthm works on a meal announcement basis and will be tested during the first phase of the trial. The ITBA/UNLP algorithm is a new development with safety mechanisms improved and without need of meal anouncement. This algorithm will be tested during the second phase of the trial.</description>
