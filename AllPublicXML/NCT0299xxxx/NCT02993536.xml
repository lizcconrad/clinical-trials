      The purpose of the study is to assess the evolution of B cells at a genetic and
      surface-marker level in high-risk CLL after idelalisib-rituximab treatment. The targeted
      population includes 20 subjects ages 18 or older diagnosed with high-risk CLL. This will
      include patients with relapsed or refractory disease who require therapy with idelalisib and
      rituximab as per FDA label. This is an observational study for peripheral blood samples of
      these patients collected at pre-determined time points.
