  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will assess the impact on nasopharyngeal carriage, safety and immunogenicity of
      GSK Biologicals' pneumococcal vaccine 2189242A given as a 3-dose vaccination course and
      co-administered with other routine paediatric vaccines in infants in The Gambia. Two
      formulations containing different doses of pneumococcal antigen and two different schedules
      will be tested in infants.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There will be two cohorts in the study: Cohort 1 (children aged 2-4 years) and Cohort 2
      (infants aged 8-10 weeks), and two steps in the study, Step 1 and Step 2. Step 1 will consist
      in a safety evaluation of the GSK Biologicals' pneumococcal vaccine 2189242A (GSK 2189242A or
      10PP vaccine). Before evaluating the two formulations of the 10PP vaccine in infants (Cohort
      2), safety and reactogenicity of the highest dose formulation of this vaccine will be
      evaluated in children (Cohort 1). Prevnar 13™ will be used as a control. In the second step
      of the study, Step 2, two investigational formulations of the 10PP vaccine will be tested in
      infants (Cohort 2) as regards immunogenicity, reactogenicity and safety. Both formulations of
      the 10PP vaccine will be evaluated according to the Expanded Programme on Immunization (EPI)
      schedule i.e. a 2, 3, 4 months vaccination schedule, using licensed Synflorix™ and Prevnar
      13™ vaccines as comparators. The higher dose (HD) formulation of the 10PP vaccine will be
      also evaluated according to the 2, 4, 9 months vaccination schedule using licensed Synflorix™
      vaccine as comparator. The study in infants will also assess the immune responses to routine
      vaccines when co-administered with the candidate pneumococcal vaccine, using licensed
      Synflorix™ and Prevnar 13™ vaccines as comparators.

    <description>An unsolicited AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation subject, temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product. An AE can therefore be any unfavourable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product. For marketed medicinal products, this also includes failure to produce expected benefits (i.e. lack of efficacy), abuse or misuse. Any = Occurrence of AE, regardless of intensity or relationship to vaccination. Grade 3 = Occurrence of AE which prevented normal activities. Related = Occurrence of AE assessed by the investigator as causally related to vaccination. Primary results correspond to results for occurrences of Grade 3 unsolicited AE(s) assessed as related to vaccination. This outcome concerns subjects enrolled in Cohort 1/Step 1.</description>

        <description>Assessed local symptoms were pain, redness and swelling. Any = Occurrence of the specified solicited local symptom, regardless of intensity. Grade 3 Pain = Crying when limb was moved/spontaneously painful. Grade 3 Redness/Swelling = Redness/swelling at injection site larger than (&gt;) 30 millimeters (mm). All solicited local symptoms were systematically considered by the investigators as causally related to vaccination. Primary results correspond to results for occurrences of Grade 3 symptoms. This outcome concerns subjects enrolled in Cohort 1/Step 1.</description>

        <title>Number of Subjects With Any and Grade 3 Unsolicited Adverse Events (AEs) With and Without Relationship to Vaccination - In Step 1/Cohort 1 Subjects</title>
        <description>An unsolicited AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation subject, temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product. An AE can therefore be any unfavourable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product. For marketed medicinal products, this also includes failure to produce expected benefits (i.e. lack of efficacy), abuse or misuse. Any = Occurrence of AE, regardless of intensity or relationship to vaccination. Grade 3 = Occurrence of AE which prevented normal activities. Related = Occurrence of AE assessed by the investigator as causally related to vaccination. Primary results correspond to results for occurrences of Grade 3 unsolicited AE(s) assessed as related to vaccination. This outcome concerns subjects enrolled in Cohort 1/Step 1.</description>

That is, subjects received 2 doses of the 10PP vaccine, HD formulation co-administered with Tritanrix™-Hep B/Hib and Polio Sabin™ at 2-4 months of age (at Day 0 and Month 2), followed by a third dose of the same formulation co-administered with M-Vac™, Stamaril™ and Polio Sabin™ at approximately 9 months of age.. The 2nd doses of Tritanrix™-Hep B/Hib and Polio Sabin™ in EPI vaccines were administered without any pneumococcal vaccine at 3 months of age. The 10PP vaccine was administered intramuscularly into the right thigh; Tritanrix™-HepB/Hib, M-Vac™ and Stamaril™ were administered intramuscularly into the left thigh; Polio Sabin™ was administered orally.</description>

        <description>Anti-Ply and anti-PhtD antibody concentrations were measured by Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) immunoassay and expressed as geometric mean concentrations (GMCs), in ELISA Units per milliliter (EL.U/mL).
Cut-off of the assay were concentrations higher than or equal to (≥) 12 EL.U/mL for anti-Ply antibodies and ≥ 17 EL.U/mL for anti-PhtD antibodies. This outcome concerns subjects enrolled in Cohort 2/Step 2 who received the 2+1 Schedule.</description>

            <description>This group consisted in infants aged 8-10 weeks at first vaccination enrolled as part the Cohort 2/Step 2 of the study who received the GSK 2189242A (or 10PP) vaccine, in its high-dose (HD) formulation, and EPI vaccines according to a 2+1 Schedule. That is, subjects received 2 doses of the 10PP vaccine, HD formulation co-administered with Tritanrix™-Hep B/Hib and Polio Sabin™ at 2-4 months of age (at Day 0 and Month 2), followed by a third dose of the same formulation co-administered with M-Vac™, Stamaril™ and Polio Sabin™ at approximately 9 months of age.. The 2nd doses of Tritanrix™-Hep B/Hib and Polio Sabin™ in EPI vaccines were administered without any pneumococcal vaccine at 3 months of age. The 10PP vaccine was administered intramuscularly into the right thigh; Tritanrix™-HepB/Hib, M-Vac™ and Stamaril™ were administered intramuscularly into the left thigh; Polio Sabin™ was administered orally.</description>

            <description>This group consisted in infants aged 8-10 weeks at first vaccination enrolled as part the Cohort 2/Step 2 of the study who received the GSK 2189242A (or 10PP) vaccine, in its high-dose (HD) formulation, and EPI vaccines according to a 2+1 Schedule. That is, subjects received 2 doses of the 10PP vaccine, HD formulation co-administered with Tritanrix™-Hep B/Hib and Polio Sabin™ at 2-4 months of age (at Day 0 and Month 2), followed by a third dose of the same formulation co-administered with M-Vac™, Stamaril™ and Polio Sabin™ at approximately 9 months of age.. The 2nd doses of Tritanrix™-Hep B/Hib and Polio Sabin™ in EPI vaccines were administered without any pneumococcal vaccine at 3 months of age. The 10PP vaccine was administered intramuscularly into the right thigh; Tritanrix™-HepB/Hib, M-Vac™ and Stamaril™ were administered intramuscularly into the left thigh; Polio Sabin™ was administered orally.</description>

That is, subjects received 2 doses of the 10PP vaccine, HD formulation co-administered with Tritanrix™-Hep B/Hib and Polio Sabin™ at 2-4 months of age (at Day 0 and Month 2), followed by a third dose of the same formulation co-administered with M-Vac™, Stamaril™ and Polio Sabin™ at approximately 9 months of age. The 2nd doses of Tritanrix™-Hep B/Hib and Polio Sabin™ in EPI vaccines were administered without any pneumococcal vaccine at 3 months of age. The 10PP vaccine was administered intramuscularly into the right thigh; Tritanrix™-HepB/Hib, M-Vac™ and Stamaril™ were administered intramuscularly into the left thigh; Polio Sabin™ was administered orally.</description>

That is, subjects received 2 doses of the 10PP vaccine, HD formulation co-administered with Tritanrix™-Hep B/Hib and Polio Sabin™ at 2-4 months of age (at Day 0 and Month 2), followed by a third dose of the same formulation co-administered with M-Vac™, Stamaril™ and Polio Sabin™ at approximately 9 months of age. The 2nd doses of Tritanrix™-Hep B/Hib and Polio Sabin™ in EPI vaccines were administered without any pneumococcal vaccine at 3 months of age. The 10PP vaccine was administered intramuscularly into the right thigh; Tritanrix™-HepB/Hib, M-Vac™ and Stamaril™ were administered intramuscularly into the left thigh; Polio Sabin™ was administered orally.</description>

        <title>Number of Subjects With Any Unsolicited Adverse Events (AEs) – For Step 2/Cohort 2 Subjects Receiving the 3+0 Schedule</title>
        <description>An unsolicited AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation subject, temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product. An AE can therefore be any unfavourable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product. For marketed medicinal products, this also includes failure to produce expected benefits (i.e. lack of efficacy), abuse or misuse. Any = Occurrence of an unsolicited AE, regardless of intensity or relationship to vaccination. This outcome concerns Step 2/Cohort 2 subjects receiving the 3+0 Schedule.</description>

These should also be considered serious: invasive or malignant cancers, intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in hospitalisation. Any = Occurrence of an SAE, regardless of relationship to vaccination. This outcome concerns subjects enrolled in Cohort 2/Step 2 receiving the 3+0 Schedule.</description>
          <population>The analysis was performed on the Total Vaccinated cohort, which included all vaccinated subjects with at least one vaccine administration documented.</population>

            <description>This group consisted in infants aged 8-10 weeks at first vaccination enrolled as part the Cohort 2/Step 2 of the study who received the GSK 2189242A (or 10PP) vaccine, in its high-dose (HD) formulation, and EPI vaccines according to a 2+1 Schedule. That is, subjects received 2 doses of the 10PP vaccine, HD formulation co-administered with Tritanrix™-Hep B/Hib and Polio Sabin™ at 2-4 months of age (at Day 0 and Month 2), followed by a third dose of the same formulation co-administered with M-Vac™, Stamaril™ and Polio Sabin™ at approximately 9 months of age. The 2nd doses of Tritanrix™-Hep B/Hib and Polio Sabin™ in EPI vaccines were administered without any pneumococcal vaccine at 3 months of age. The 10PP vaccine was administered intramuscularly into the right thigh; Tritanrix™-HepB/Hib, M-Vac™ and Stamaril™ were administered intramuscularly into the left thigh; Polio Sabin™ was administered orally.</description>

        <description>Because of high variants heterogeneity in each group (no major variant), the impact of vaccination on variant prevalence was not analysed.
PhtD sequences were detected in some samples but no consensus sequence could be obtained they were defined as mixed sequences (Mix).
The samples without gene detected were considered as negative for PhtD (PhtD negative).</description>

          <title>Number of Samples With PhtD Protein Variants in a Subset of Non-Vaccine-Type S.Pneumoniae Isolates From Nasopharyngeal Swabs – Cohort 2</title>
          <description>Because of high variants heterogeneity in each group (no major variant), the impact of vaccination on variant prevalence was not analysed.
PhtD sequences were detected in some samples but no consensus sequence could be obtained they were defined as mixed sequences (Mix).
The samples without gene detected were considered as negative for PhtD (PhtD negative).</description>
          <population>The analysis was performed on vaccinated subjects with at least one vaccine administration documented for which S. pneumoniae isolates samples were selected for ply and phtD gene sequencing.</population>
