    <textblock>
      We will test the hypothesis that bovine lactoferrin supplementation prevents serious
      infections in preterm infants. We will conduct a randomized placebo-controlled double blind
      study in 190 premature infants &lt;2500 gm in 5 Neonatal Intermediate and Intensive Care Units
      in Lima, Peru to determine whether bovine lactoferrin prevents the first episode of
      late-onset sepsis.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Lactoferrin is an iron chelating protein with multiple physiological functions
      (anti-microbial, anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory) and is one of the most important
      proteins present in mammalian milk. We hypothesize that lactoferrin as an oral supplement
      given daily to low birth weight will improve their health by mimicking their protective role
      in milk. There is extensive literature showing in vitro and in animal models the benefits of
      lactoferrin. However, there are few clinical trials designed to translate this knowledge into
      patient care.

      We will conduct a pilot randomized, double-blinded placebo-controlled trial comparing daily
      supplementation with bovine lactoferrin versus placebo in neonates to reduce the incidence of
      sepsis in the first month of life. We will enroll 190 neonates with a birth weight less than
      2,500 g, younger than 3 days of age in the neonatal intensive care unit of 5 pediatric
      hospitals in Lima, after informed consent of both parents. Infants will be followed in the
      hospital until death or discharge and then at home up to 1 month of age. Bovine lactoferrin
      will be used in this trial (200 mg/Kg per day). Although bovine and human lactoferrin are not
      identical, their bioactivity is quite comparable. Maltodextrin (an inert sugar) will be used
      for controls. The primary study outcome will be the number of first late-onset sepsis
      episodes (occurring &gt;72h after birth with isolation of any pathogen in blood or cerebrospinal
      fluid).

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Neonates with a birth weight between 500g and 2500g

          2. Neonates born in, or referred to the Neonatal Intermediate and Intensive Care Units of
             one of the participating hospitals in the first 72 hours of life.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Neonates with underlying gastrointestinal problems that prevent oral intake.

          2. Neonates with predisposing conditions that profoundly affect growth and development
             (chromosomal abnormalities, structural brain anomalies, severe congenital
             abnormalities)

          3. Neonates with a family background of cow milk allergy

          4. Neonates that, according to the investigator criteria, will not have the chance to
             complete the subsequent study visits (patients that before one month old would not be
             living in Lima).

          5. Neonates whose parents decline to participate.
