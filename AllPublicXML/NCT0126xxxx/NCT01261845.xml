      BACKGROUND: A proper understanding of the attitudes towards its own health status and concise
      estimates concerning the health seeking behavior of the different subgroups of a population
      are highly desirable. The structure of the Austrian population with regard to its age
      distribution and the proportion of people with immigrant backgrounds have been rapidly
      changing in recent years. Questions of allocating limited resources and meeting the needs of
      under-served populations have become increasingly important. However, data that could
      illuminate these issues are sparse and therefore obtaining them will be important for making
      sensible policy decisions.

      METHODS: A telephone survey of the Austrian population for the assessment of the occurrence
      of any health complaint and the subsequent help seeking behavior with special emphasize on
      under-served minority groups - migrant population, elder people, and female gender.

      AIMS: Our analysis of the data obtained should help to clarify some hitherto undocumented
      aspects and should provide the evidence for building a better health care infrastructure with
      equality of access and efficient coordination. We also hope that this information can help to
      allocate resources strategically according to needs and cost-efficiency in health care.
