      The objective of this prospective study is to evaluate short-term, mid-term, and long-term
      clinical outcomes associated with the use of Permacol™ Biological Implant in the treatment of
      complex abdominal wall defects
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This will be a prospective, multi-centre, non-randomized study to collect post-market
      clinical data on Permacol™ Biological Implant following complex abdominal wall repair
      (including abdominal wall defects and fascial dehiscence). The subjects will have baseline
      and day of surgery visits performed, and then subjects will return to the investigator for
      evaluation of defect and safety related morbidities at follow up visits scheduled at 1 month,
      6 months, 12 months, 24 months, and 36 months post-surgery.

      The study will enroll up to 200 subjects at up to 20 sites. Enrollment is anticipated to take
      between 18 and 24 months.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Subjects who meet all of the following criteria will be eligible for study enrollment:

          1. Subjects who are 18 years of age and older

          2. Subjects of either sex

          3. Subjects who require complex abdominal repair using Permacol™ Biological Implant.

          4. Subjects who are willing and able to adhere to protocol requirements and provide
             written informed consent

        Exclusion Criteria:

        All subjects who meet any of the following criteria should not be enrolled into the study:

          1. Subjects who are pregnant

          2. Subjects with a medical condition that in the opinion of the investigator may preclude
             participation (e.g. Ehlers Danlos Syndrome) or interfere with completion of study
             follow-up

          3. Subjects may not participate in any other clinical study that clinically interferes
             with this study while enrolled

          4. Concomitant use of a synthetic or another biologic mesh

          5. Subjects who require use of Permacol™ as only temporary closure with planned
             reoperation, or Permacol™ used as a temporary dressing in an open abdomen

          6. Subject who has systemic sepsis at the time of Permacol™ implantation

          7. Subject with ongoing necrotizing pancreatitis

          8. Subject who requires use of Permacol™ in parastomal hernia repair alone, where there
             is no other anterior wall repair

          9. Subject who requires prophylactic use of Permacol™ in the formation of stoma with
             anterior wall repair

         10. Permacol™ used in pelvic floor reconstruction
