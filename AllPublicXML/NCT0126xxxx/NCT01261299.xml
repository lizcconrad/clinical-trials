  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Carboplatin kills cancer cells mainly through induction of DNA damage (drug-DNA adducts). The
      goal of this clinical trial is to determine if chemoresistance to carboplatin can be
      identified by measuring carboplatin-induced DNA monoadducts, the precursor of Pt-DNA
      diadducts or crosslinks, from subtherapeutic drug doses given prior to the initiation of
      chemotherapy. We hypothesize that low levels of carboplatin-DNA monoadducts and rapid
      drug-DNA adduct repair correlate with chemoresistance. A highly sensitive technology, called
      accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS), will be used to measure carboplatin-DNA monoadducts from
      patient samples. AMS can measure C-14 at the attomole level in specimens of milligram size.
      In this study, patients will receive one non-toxic &quot;microdose&quot; (defined as 1/100th the
      therapeutic dose) of C-14-labeled carboplatin. Blood specimens will be drawn for
      determination of carboplatin-DNA monoadduct formation and repair in peripheral blood
      mononuclear cells (PBMC), and pharmacokinetics (PK) will be determined from serum
      ultrafiltrate. In patients microdosed prior to providing tumor samples, a few milligrams of
      leftover tumor biopsy/resection specimens will be analyzed for formation of carboplatin-DNA
      monoadducts. Patients will subsequently receive carboplatin-based chemotherapy. The levels of
      microdose-induced carboplatin-DNA monoadducts will be correlated with response to
      chemotherapy. Some blood and biopsy samples will be assayed by RT-PCR for several putative
      resistance markers at the mRNA level. Side effects will also be monitored and compared to the
      AMS data. This trial will also utilize PK, DNA repair and pharmacogenomics data in order to
      determine some of the underlying chemoresistance mechanisms.

    <description>Imaging studies (including CT, MRI, PET/CT and CXR) and cystoscopy will be performed to evaluate the response. The RECIST 1.1 will be used to determine the cancer response. Tumor response, including complete response (CR, or complete disappearance) or partial response (PR, at least a 30% decrease of target lesion) will be correlated with the patient's carboplatin-DNA monoadduct levels.</description>

    <time_frame>The chemoresistance mechanisms will be determined from the time of this microdosing study to the time patients receive 2 to 3 cycles of chemo that is about 6-9 weeks after treatment is started.</time_frame>
    <description>The half-life of carboplatin and the repair rate of DNA monoadducts (decrease of DNA monoadducts over 24 hours) in PBMC and tumor tissue will be determined and calculated. The ERCC1 expression levels will be determined with quantitative RT-PCR using beta-actin as the internal control. These parameters will be correlated with tumor response (CR or PR) to chemotherapy.</description>

One blood draw and a few milligrams of leftover tumor tissue will be taken for analysis of carboplatin-DNA adduct levels.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Participants must have clinical diagnosis of lung or bladder cancer. The term
             &quot;clinical diagnosis&quot; means that patients are diagnosed with NSCLC or bladder
             transitional cell carcinoma (TCC) based on imaging studies, but will need further
             biopsy/resection to obtain tissue in order to confirm the diagnosis. However, some
             patients may not have cancer as determined by pathology examination of the tissue, or
             may have a different cancer after biopsy/resection is performed. If the diagnosis of
             NSCLC or bladder cancer is confirmed, platinum-based chemotherapy must be planned
             either for neoadjuvant chemotherapy for Stage II or above bladder cancer, or
             palliative therapy for stage III or IV lung or bladder cancer regardless of patient
             participation in this study. Stage II or above TCC patients and stage IV NSCLC
             patients that will receive platinum-based chemotherapy will be eligible for this
             study. Patients with Stage III or IV lung or bladder cancer must have measurable
             lesion(s).

          -  Prior radiation or surgery is allowed, but should be finished at least 2 weeks prior
             to study enrollment. If a participant has prior radiation therapy, at least one
             measurable lesion outside of the radiation field should be available for the
             evaluation of response to chemotherapy.

          -  Participants must be 18 years or older. We do not see any patients with NSCLC or
             bladder TCC are diagnosed under the age of 18 years.

          -  ECOG performance status equal or less than to 2 (Karnofsky equal to or greater than
             50%).

          -  Life expectancy of at least 3 months.

          -  Participants must have normal organ and marrow function as defined below: Absolute
             neutrophil count greater than/equal to 1,500/microL; Platelet count greater than/equal
             to 100,000/microL; Total bilirubin less than 1.5 X ULN; AST (SGOT) less than/equal to
             2.5 X ULN; Creatinine less than 1.5 X ULN

          -  Women of child-bearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception
             (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry and for
             30 days after study participation.

          -  Ability to understand and willing to sign a written informed consent document.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients must not receive concomitant radiation with chemotherapy if they do not have
             any measurable lesions outside of the radiation field.

          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac
             arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with
             study requirements.

          -  Participants who are pregnant or nursing.

          -  Participants who are allergic to platinum agents.

          -  Participants who receive chemotherapy before that includes cisplatin, carboplatin or
             oxaliplatin.
