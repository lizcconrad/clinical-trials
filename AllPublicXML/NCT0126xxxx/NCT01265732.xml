    <textblock>
      This study investigates the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of PF-04191834 when
      respectively given orally as a single dispersion dose and a single dose of a suspension. The
      suspension is the test formulation and the dispersion is the formulation with which the novel
      preparation will be compared.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Healthy male and/or female subjects of non-childbearing potential between the ages of
             18 and 55 years, inclusive. Healthy is defined as no clinically relevant abnormalities
             identified by a detailed medical history, full physical examination, including blood
             pressure and pulse rate measurement, 12-lead ECG or clinical laboratory tests.

          -  Body Mass Index (BMI) of 17.5 to 30.5 kg/m2; and a total body weight &gt;50 kg(110 lbs).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Evidence or history of clinically significant hematological, renal, endocrine,
             pulmonary, gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, hepatic, psychiatric, neurologic, or
             allergic disease (including drug allergies, but excluding untreated, asymptomatic,
             seasonal allergies at the time of dosing).

          -  Clinical evidence of existing hepatic disease or a medical history of such a condition
             in the last year. Subjects with AST or ALT &gt;ULN. Subjects with total bilirubin &gt;ULN
             (except those with a documented history of Gilbert's Syndrome). Subjects with
             AST/ALT/total bilirubin &gt;ULN and &lt;1.5X ULN may be retested once.

          -  Treatment with an investigational drug within 30 days or 5 half-lives (whichever is
             longer) preceding the first dose of study medication;

          -  Use of tobacco- or nicotine-containing products in excess of the equivalent of 5
             cigarettes per day;

          -  Females of childbearing potential.

          -  Subjects with positive responses (score 1) for suicidality on the Sheehan Suicidality
             Tracking Scale (S-STS) (specifically items 1a, 1b, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, or 9).
