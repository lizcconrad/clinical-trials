      1. Laparoscopic appendectomy may not be a superior procedure when compared with open
      appendectomy; 2. Various modifications in laparoscopic appendectomy procedure may reduce the
      technical diffuculty and overall costs.

      The study will be a prospective randomized clinical trial. Totally 150 patients who are
      diagnosed to have acute appendicitis will be randomly divided into 3 equal groups (n=50 for
      each group). First group will have traditional open appendectomy procedure; second group will
      have laparoscopic appendectomy procedure in which appendiceal stump is secured by metal
      endoclips; and third group will have laparoscopic appendectomy procedure in which appendiceal
      stump is secured by intracorporeal suture ligation. The preoperative parameters that will be
      obtained for all patients are: detailed information for communication, patient history, age,
      gender, the presence of spesific symptoms (nausea, vomiting, loss of appetite, right lower
      quadrant pain), the presence of clinical signs, laboratory findings, and radiological
      findings. The peroperative parameters that will be recorded are: operative time, the type and
      the length of incisions, the number of trocars, operative findings, details of laparoscopic
      technique, generic name of prophylactic antibiotic, and the presence of additional findings.
      All of the patients will undergo a clinical evaluation by attending surgeon on the 5th, the
      15th, and the 30th postoperative day. The postoperative clinical evaluation will include the
      examination of the patient for surgical site infection and other wound complications, and the
      performance of a spesific quality-of-life index questionnaire. In the end of the study, all
      parameters and quality-of-life scores will undergo statistical analysis.
