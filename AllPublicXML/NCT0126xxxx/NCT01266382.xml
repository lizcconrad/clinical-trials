    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to examine the effect of a new biomechanical device and treatment
      methodology (AposTherapy) on gait patterns, pain, function and quality of life of patients
      with musculoskeletal and neurological disorders. Based on previous reports the investigators
      hypothesis that this therapy will have a positive effect on these measurements.
