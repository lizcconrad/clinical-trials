    <textblock>
      The overall goal of the present application is to test the hypothesis that shift workers, who
      are chronically exposed to circadian misalignment and sleep loss, have a higher
      cardio-metabolic risk than day workers, and that the accumulated sleep debt and the degree of
      circadian misalignment both predict their elevated cardio-metabolic risk.

        We will enroll 44-46 regular day workers (work hours between 7:00 a.m. and 7:00 p.m. on all
        work days) and 44-46 shift workers on rotating schedules (changing shift at lease once a
        week and having work hours between 7:00 p.m. and 7:00 a.m. on at least 10 days per month).
        Both groups of subjects will work at least 30 hours per week at the University of Chicago,
        University of Chicago Medical Center, or other Chicago area medical center and have
        maintained their work schedule for at least 6 months.

             less than 6 months.
