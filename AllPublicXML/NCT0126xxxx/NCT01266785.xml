  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Crohn's disease is an inflammatory (swelling and soreness) disorder of the digestive tract.
      Affected patients suffer from abdominal pains, diarrhea (sometimes bloody), weight loss. It
      is a lifelong disease with frequent flares during the course of the disease. Crohn's disease
      is mostly treated with medications, sometimes surgery is needed. Infliximab is a medication
      for treating severe Crohn's disease. This medicine is effective by blocking special substance
      (tumor necrosis factor) released from certain white blood cells in the body. Infliximab is
      given via a vessel at week 0, 2, 6 initially, then every 2 monthly for maintenance. However,
      some of patients with Crohn's disease do not respond infliximab. Currently there is no test
      to reveal which patients will respond to treatment. This study aims to analyze and compare
      particular subgroup of white cells and its products during and after infliximab treatment
      which may determine the responsiveness to infliximab treatment.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All patients will have chest x-ray and pregnancy test (if female) prior to infliximab
      treatment.

      There will be total 5 study visits. At each visit, body weight will be measured, abdominal
      exam will be performed , 2 tablespoonful of blood will be drawn, stool will be collected, a
      questionnaire will be completed.
