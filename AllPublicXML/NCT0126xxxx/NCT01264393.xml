  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Behavioral weight loss programs can successfully reduce body weight, but these programs are
      available to limited numbers of overweight and obese individuals. This project evaluates a
      unique weight loss approach that combines a self-sustaining weight loss campaign (for
      outreach) with training in behavioral weight loss strategies and strategies to increase
      accountability (to improve weight loss success). This innovative combination has the
      potential to be a cost-effective model for disseminating weight control interventions.

      Participants will be randomly assigned to 1 of 3 treatment arms: Shape Up Rhode Island (SURI;
      a community-based weight loss campaign), SURI plus an Internet-based behavioral weight loss
      program (SURI + IBWL), or SURI + IBWL + optional group sessions (SURI + IBWL + Group).
      Primary outcome is weight loss at 12-weeks.
