  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if autologous plasma (ACP) is beneficial for better
      and faster healing following an arthroscopic repair of the rotator cuff.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The shoulder joint, specially the rotator cuff, is one of the most complicated joints of the
      human body. If the tendon has to be fixed at the bone during surgery, the weak point in
      obtaining a successful surgery is the fixation of the tendon at the bone insertion site.
      Tendon belongs to the bradytrophic tissue conditional on the reduced blood flow, deep mitosis
      rate and lowered healing potential. We can boost the healing process with a selective use of
      PRP (platelet rich plasma). In this process, the healing site is delivered with an elevated
      concentration of thrombocytes and also growth factors which are constituent parts of them.

      In this study, we will test the Arthrex® Double Syringe System. With this system it is
      possible to obtain ACP (Autologous conditioned plasma) in one centrifugation step. The
      supernatant contains a concentration of thrombocytes which is twice as high as in the native
      blood. The concentration of the growth factors is 5-25x higher according to this.

      We also want to test if one application of ACP is enough to get a short- and long-term
      benefit in healing following a rotator cuff tear.
