      In some patients with cancer there are also cancer cells in the abdominal cavity or between
      the lung membranes. These cancer cells create too much moisture in the abdominal cavity or
      between the lung membranes. If there is fluid in the abdominal cavity (ascites fluid) this
      can bring on abdominal distension, abdominal pain, loss of appetite, fatigue, bloating and
      sometimes wheezing. Too much fluid between the lung membranes (we call this pleural fluid)
      gives breathlessness, chest pain and coughing. The use of diuretics may offer a small group
      of patients symptom reduction. Additionally, the fluid can be drained through a needle
      puncture or fluid collection (through a biopsy). But usually, the moisture quickly returns.

      Previous research done in this hospital with cediranib showed that with some patients with
      cancer who suffered from fluid in the abdominal cavity or between the lung membranes, this
      moisture reduces while using this drug. It also reduced the symptoms caused by this excessive
      moisture.

      The current study is conducted to see whether patients with cancer and fluid in the abdominal
      cavity or fluid between the lung blades benefit from using cediranib. This involves not only
      whether the amount moisture reduces, but also if the complains decrease. In addition, we will
      carefully consider the possible side effects of cediranib.

      Malignant ascites is a difficult clinical problem. Increasing intra-abdominal pressure
      resulting from fluid accumulation may cause anorexia, sleep disturbance, pain, dyspnoea,
      abdominal distension, fatigue, nausea vomiting and reduced mobility. The main complaints of
      pleural effusion are dyspnoea and cough. Paracentesis and thoracentesis provide relief for a
      very limited period.

      Studies have shown high concentrations of VEGF in malignant ascites and pleural effusion.
      Beneficial effects of treatment with an intravenous or intraperitoneal antibody against VEGF
      on malignant ascites have been reported. In the recent past we have treated two patients with
      symptomatic malignant ascites (colorectal cancer and ovarian cancer, respectively) in a phase
      I study with cediranib. Shortly after start of cediranib, within a couple of days, the
      ascites disappeared. However, after stopping cediranib for progressive disease on other sites
      the ascites reappeared within days. Therefore, one of those patients was treated with
      cediranib as palliative treatment until two days before his death, which was beneficial for
      this patient.

      In this phase II study we would like to investigate the effects of treatment with cediranib
      as palliative treatment on malignant ascites or pleural effusion.
