    <textblock>
      Early metabolic response evaluation may predict clinical and histopathological response after
      neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Its value in neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (CRT) is unknown. Our
      aim was to assess the value of early metabolic response after one cycle of chemotherapy using
      18-FDG-PET-CT to predict pathological response and outcome in cT2-4 N0/+ esophageal cancer
      treated by neoadjuvant CRT and esophagectomy.
