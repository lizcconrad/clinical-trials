  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate if lifespan integration (LI) therapy reduces
      posttraumatic stress symptoms following a motor vehicle accident (MVA) trauma
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Studies estimate a substantial proportion of MVA survivors, ranging from 9.4% to 59.9%, will
      develop PTSD following an accident (Blanchard &amp; Hickling, 2004). Based on conservative
      estimates, past research, indicates that MVA-related PTSD may affect 2.5 to 7 million persons
      in the United States (Blanchard &amp; Hickling). Furthermore, two seminal epidemiological studies
      (Kessler et al., 1995; Norris, 1992) that focused on causes of adult PTSD identified MVAs as
      the most frequent trauma resulting in PTSD. For these reasons, MVA-resultant PTSD represents
      a significant public health problem that needs not only to be thoroughly understood, but
      addressed with successful mental health treatment options (Beck &amp; Coffey, 2007; Blanchard &amp;
      Hickling, 1997, 2004; Bryant et al., 1998; Taylor et al., 1999; Taylor et al., 2001).
      Although there is empirical literature on the treatment of PTSD following an MVA, additional
      efficacious and rigorously conducted studies with statistical underpinnings are required to
      determine the results that can be expected from alternative models of care (Beck &amp; Coffey;
      Blanchard &amp; Hickling, 1997, 2004).

    <description>LI treatment guides the client to imaginally visit past memories, and then leads her or him forward through time to the present using a concept referred to as the time line. Beginning with the individual's memories from the traumatic experience, the time line first follows memories from the days and weeks after the trauma, then season by season to the present, and is reviewed in ongoing sessions as increasing details of the traumatic event are uncovered.</description>
