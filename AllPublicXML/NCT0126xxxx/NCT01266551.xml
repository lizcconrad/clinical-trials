      What's known? Prone position is no longer a treatment option for GERD because of the
      association with SIDS. Originally, positioning in an infant seat was recommended for infants
      with GERD. However, Orenstein proved this position has a detrimental effect on GER, compared
      to prone positioning.

      What's new? Positioning in an infant seat caused no increase in GER, compared with the supine
      15 degrees anti-Trendelenburg position. Except for the number of long reflux episodes, which
      was significantly higher in the car safety seat. Larger trials are needed for decisive
      conclusions.

      OBJECTIVE - Over the past few decades, an increase in gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD)
      has been seen in infants. This increase may be due to a continuous growth in the use of car
      safety seats. The objective of this study was to evaluate this hypothesis by comparing
      positioning in a car safety seat with the supine 15 degrees anti-Trendelenburg position.

      PATIENTS AND METHODS - From October 2008 till August 2010 a crossover, randomized, controlled
      trial was performed on 31 infants, aged two weeks to six months old, who were suspected to
      have GERD. Twenty hour continuous esophageal pH monitoring was used to compare both
      positions.

      RESULTS - The results of this trial demonstrated no differences between positioning in a car
      safety seat and in supine 15 degrees anti-Trendelenburg position for the reflux index, the
      duration of the longest reflux episode and number of reflux episodes (PRI = NS; PLRE = NS
      respectively PNRE = NS). Only the difference between the number of reflux episodes lasting
      longer than five minutes was significant (PNRE5 = 0,05).

      CONCLUSIONS - The results of this study suggest that an increase in GERD is not caused by a
      growing use of car safety seats in infants. As the sample size was limited, larger trials are
      needed.

    <description>The positions in the car safety seat and in supine 15 degrees anti-Trendelenburg are compared on the basis of a 20 hour pH monitoring. In one group the infants were first continuously positioned at 45 degrees elevation in a car safety seat (car safety seat type Maxi cosi Citi for infants from 0-13kg). During the next period the infants were kept in a supine 15 degrees anti-Trendelenburg position (hospital infant bed), and vice versa for the other group.</description>
