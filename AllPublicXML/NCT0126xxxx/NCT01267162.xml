    <textblock>
      This is a Phase IV, open-label, single-arm, 96 week community-based observational study
      evaluating the antiviral efficacy, safety, and tolerability of TDF in HBV mono-infected
      Asian-American adults who had completed 48 week treatment with Tenofovir in Gilead 174-0123
      study. The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the long-term antiviral efficacy of
      tenofovir DF 300 mg once daily in these patients. The secondary objectives are to evaluate
      the safety and tolerability of TDF including the biochemical and virological responses to
      TDF, the incidence of drug resistance mutations in these patients The duration of treatment
      in this study is total of three Years (144 weeks) on TDF.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Male or female, Asian-American, who have participated and completed the study, qualify
             the following criteria, and remain on TDF treatment without severe treatment-related
             AEs, and with available retrospective lab results as summarized in Appendix 2.

          -  18 through 75 years of age, inclusive

          -  Willing to participate in the present study and able to provide written informed
             consent

          -  Continuation of HBV treatment is indicated. That is for HBeAg-positive subjects, HBeAg
             remain positive or HBeAg becomes negative but still has detectable DNA by the PCR
             method; and for HBeAg-negative subjects, HBV DNA is either detectable or undetectable
             by the PCR method

          -  No clinical or virologic evidence of anti-HBV resistance to TDF treatment at the time
             of entering tests (i.e., TDF treatment week 48 lab tests by the 123 study)

          -  Estimated glomerular filtration rate (creatinine clearance) ≥ 60 mL/min/1.73m2 by the

        Cockcroft-Gault equation:

        (140-age in years) (body weight [kg]) (72) (serum creatinine [mg/dl]) [Note: multiply
        estimated rate 0. by 85 for women; use actual body weight]

        • Adequate hematologic function (absolute neutrophil count ≥ 1,500/mm3; hemoglobin ≥ 10.0
        g/dL)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Pregnant women, and women who are breast feeding or who believe they may wish to
             become pregnant during the course of the study.

          -  Males and females of reproductive potential who are not willing to use an effective
             method of contraception during the study. For males, condoms should be used and for
             females, a barrier contraception method should be used in combination with one other
             form of contraception.

          -  Willing and able to provide written informed consent

          -  Decompensated liver disease defined as direct (conjugated) bilirubin ≥ 1.2 ULN; PT ≥
             1.2 ULN, platelets ≤ 150,000/mm3, or serum albumin ≤ 3.5 g/dL
