  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      During alveolar hypoxia, for example at high altitude or in patients with respiratory
      disease, there is evidence to suggest that hypoxia-induced pulmonary hypertension might limit
      exercise performance. Intravenous iron supplementation has recently been shown to reverse
      pulmonary hypertension in healthy humans at high altitude, and to prevent pulmonary
      hypertension in volunteers exposed to hypoxia at sea level. The investigators hypothesized
      that intravenous iron supplementation would enhance exercise capacity during alveolar
      hypoxia.

    <measure>Maximal exercise capacity during hypoxia, assessed by maximal oxygen consumption.</measure>
    <time_frame>After 8-h exposure to alveolar hypoxia.</time_frame>
    <description>Volunteers will receive either intravenous iron or saline placebo, before exposure to 8 hours of alveolar hypoxia. They will then undergo an exercise test while breathing an hypoxic gas mixture. The primary outcome measure will be exercise capacity as determined by maximal oxygen consumption during this test. Volunteers will receive both interventions, via a crossover design. Due to uncertainty about the duration of action of iron at a cellular level, all volunteers will receive saline infusion on the first study day, and iron sucrose infusion on a second study day, at least one week later.</description>
