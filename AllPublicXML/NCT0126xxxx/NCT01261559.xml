  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary hypothesis of this study is that breast displacement out of the direct plane of
      imaging during computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen will reduce effective radiation dose
      to the female breast. Secondary hypotheses are that image noise and artifacts will also be
      decreased.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Computed tomography (CT) is a significant source of medical-related radiation, and
      radiation-related cancer risk is increasingly recognized in the medical and lay community.
      One of the groups at greatest risk for radiation-induced malignancies is young females due to
      the radiosensitivity of female breast tissue. Breast tissue frequently lies within the
      imaging plane for CT of the abdomen with limited gain in diagnostic information. We propose
      displacing this breast tissue out of the direct imaging plane will decrease unnecessary
      radiation exposure and may also indirectly improve image quality.

      A device called Chrysalis has been designed and received FDA approval for the purposes of
      displacing female breast tissue during CT.

    <measure>Skin Entrance Radiation Dose During Computed Tomography (CT)</measure>
    <time_frame>from time potential subject approached about possible enrollment to time device and TLDs were removed, on average 1 hour</time_frame>
    <description>Skin entrance radiation doses will be measured with Thermoluminescent dosimeters (TLDs) affixed to the subject's chest and breast during CT of the abdomen. TLD #1 is at the inframammary fold, serving as internal control for each subject. Three additional TLDs (#2-4) are affixed to the subject's breast at 3 pre-ascribed locations. The same is done for the right and left breasts (8 TLDs total). TLDs will then be submitted to Landaeur for measurement.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Relative Skin Entrance Radiation Dose in % During Computed Tomography (CT)</measure>
    <time_frame>from time potential subject approached about possible enrollment to time device and TLDs were removed, on average 1 hour</time_frame>
    <description>Relative skin entrance dose at the breast (group mean of patient's average skin entrance dose at TLDs 2-4) divided by skin entrance dose at the inframammary TLD (TLD 1) in %. For each patient, doses at TLDs 2-4 were averaged, and then the group mean of this was divided by the group mean at the inframammary TLD, then multiplied by 100 to get % dose. A relative dose of 20% means that the skin entrance dose at the breast was 20% of the skin entrance dose at the inframammary fold.</description>

        <title>Skin Entrance Radiation Dose During Computed Tomography (CT)</title>
        <description>Skin entrance radiation doses will be measured with Thermoluminescent dosimeters (TLDs) affixed to the subject's chest and breast during CT of the abdomen. TLD #1 is at the inframammary fold, serving as internal control for each subject. Three additional TLDs (#2-4) are affixed to the subject's breast at 3 pre-ascribed locations. The same is done for the right and left breasts (8 TLDs total). TLDs will then be submitted to Landaeur for measurement.</description>
        <time_frame>from time potential subject approached about possible enrollment to time device and TLDs were removed, on average 1 hour</time_frame>

        <description>Relative skin entrance dose at the breast (group mean of patient's average skin entrance dose at TLDs 2-4) divided by skin entrance dose at the inframammary TLD (TLD 1) in %. For each patient, doses at TLDs 2-4 were averaged, and then the group mean of this was divided by the group mean at the inframammary TLD, then multiplied by 100 to get % dose. A relative dose of 20% means that the skin entrance dose at the breast was 20% of the skin entrance dose at the inframammary fold.</description>
