  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to test the hypothesis that postoperative daily hyperbaric oxygen therapy
      (HBOT) decreases soft-tissue complication rate during the operative handling of
      intra-articular calcaneal fractures. Minor motivations: 1. To evaluate microcirculatory
      criteria of cutaneous tissue predicting emerging wound healing defects, 2. To identify
      patients at risk for soft-tissue complication after calcaneal plate osteosynthesis and to
      determine the optimal time point for operative intervention using these microcirculatory
      criteria preoperatively, 3. To evaluate the effect of HBOT on postoperative microcirculation,
      4. To collect preliminary data to evaluate the economical impact of wound complications, with
      and without HBOT, 5. To identify a correlation between HBOT with expected limited soft-tissue
      complication rate and the clinical and radiographic outcome two years after surgery.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Wound complication remains an important problem in calcaneal fractures, with some plate
      series quoting up to a 27% infection rate. The original hypothesis stimulating this study is
      that HBOT after calcaneal plating can decrease such high rates of infection. Validation of
      this hypothesis would not only alter guidelines for standard procedure (plate
      osteosynthesis), but would also help to avoid difficult follow-up operations and improve
      functional outcome after calcaneal fracture. To date, this therapeutic approach has not been
      systematically tested in the existing literature. As further motivation for this study, the
      assessment of the existent microcirculation as a potential screening parameter will be
      analysed. In order to do so, it is assumed that wound infection partially develops due to
      disruptions in the microcirculation. This leads to the hypotheses, that by measuring the
      microcirculation, patients at high risk for post operative infections could be identified
      before operation, planning a different less invasive approach or conservative treatment.
