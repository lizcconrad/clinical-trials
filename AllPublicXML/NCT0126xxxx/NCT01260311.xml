    <measure>Number of Participants With Adverse Events (AEs) by Seriousness, Severity and Relationship to Treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline up to 28 days after last dose</time_frame>
    <description>Counts of participants who had treatment-emergent AEs (TEAEs), defined as newly occurring or worsening after first dose. Relatedness to fesoterodine fumarate (Toviaz) was assessed by the investigator. Participants with multiple occurrences of an AE within a category were counted once within the category. Seriousness of an AE was assessed under the criteria of serious adverse event (SAE). AE was assessed according to severity; mild (not causing any significant problem, dose adjustment not required), moderate (caused problem that does not interfere significantly with usual activities or the clinical status, dose adjustment needed due to AE) and severe (caused problem that interferes significantly with usual activities or the clinical status, study drug stopped due to AE).</description>

    <measure>Number of Micturitions Per 24 Hours at Week 4 and Week 8</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 4 and Week 8</time_frame>
    <description>Micturitions include episodes of voluntary micturition and episodes of Urgency Urinary Incontinence (UUI). UUI episodes were defined as those micturitions with Urinary Sensation Scale (USS) rating of 5 in the diary in participants with UUI at baseline. USS rating 5: Unable to hold; leak urine.</description>

    <measure>Number of Urgency Episodes Per 24 Hours at Week 4 and Week 8</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 4 and Week 8</time_frame>
    <description>Urgency episodes were defined as micturitions with USS rating of greater than or equal to (&gt;=) 3. USS total range 1 to 5: 1. No feeling of urgency, 2. Mild feeling of urgency, 3. Moderate feeling of urgency, 4. Severe feeling of urgency, 5. Unable to hold; leak urine.</description>

    <measure>Patient Perception of Bladder Condition (PPBC) at Week 4 and Week 8</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 4 and Week 8</time_frame>
    <description>PPBC: a self-administered, single-item, questionnaire that asks participants to describe their perception of their bladder-related problems. The PPBC assessment is rated on a 6-point scale: 1=no problems at all, 2=some very minor problems, 3=some minor problems, 4=moderate problems, 5=severe problems, 6=many severe problems. Improvement is defined as negative change from baseline.</description>
