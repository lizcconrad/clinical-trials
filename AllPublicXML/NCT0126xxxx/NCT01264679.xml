      Study AMAG-FER-CKD-253 is an extension study of the combined AMAG-FER-CKD-251 (NCT01155375)
      and AMAG-FER-CKD-252 (NCT01155388) studies to evaluate the efficacy and safety of episodic
      treatment of iron deficiency anemia (IDA) with ferumoxytol.

    <textblock>
      Study AMAG-FER-CKD-251 was a study evaluating the efficacy and safety of intravenous (IV)
      ferumoxytol in pediatric participants with dialysis-dependent chronic kidney disease (CKD).
      Study AMAG-FER-CKD-252 was a study evaluating the efficacy and safety of IV ferumoxytol in
      pediatric participants with nondialysis-dependent chronic kidney disease.

      Due to significant challenges with enrollment for both studies, Study AMAG-FER-CKD-252 was
      combined with Study AMAG-FER-CKD-251 and enrollment continued under Study AMAG-FER-CKD-251.

      Participants were enrolled by age cohorts in a stepwise manner following a safety review by
      the Data Safety Monitoring Board of 1 age cohort prior to enrollment of a subsequent age
      cohort, with progression from oldest to youngest: Randomization was stratified by the
      following age cohorts: 12 to &lt;18 years, 6 to &lt;12 years, 2 to &lt;6 years, and 6 months to &lt;2
      years.

      Participants who completed the combined AMAG-FER-CKD-251 and AMAG-FER-CKD-252 studies had the
      option of participating in this extension study.

    <measure>Mean Change In Hemoglobin From Baseline To Week 5</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 5</time_frame>
    <description>Mean changes in hemoglobin following the first course of ferumoxytol from Baseline to Week 5 were to be presented. Despite efforts to complete the studies as designed, several factors contributed to significant challenges in enrollment and led the Sponsor to discontinue the combined AMAG-FER-CKD-251 and AMAG-FER-CKD-252 studies, and the AMAG-FER-CKD-253 study. Blood samples were collected, but not run through an analysis to obtain outcome measure data. As such, the data set for this primary outcome measure cannot be summarized nor can the statistical analysis, as described in the protocol, be provided in a way that will provide any significant data based upon the limited study datasets.</description>

    <description>The proportion of participants with an increase hemoglobin to ≥1.0 g/dL or to ≥12.0 g/dL during the period from Baseline to Week 5 and to Week 7 following each course of ferumoxytol was to be presented. However, despite efforts to complete the studies as designed, several factors contributed to significant challenges in enrollment and led the Sponsor to discontinue the combined AMAG-FER-CKD-251 and AMAG-FER-CKD-252 studies, and the AMAG-FER-CKD-253 study.

        <description>Mean changes in hemoglobin following the first course of ferumoxytol from Baseline to Week 5 were to be presented. Despite efforts to complete the studies as designed, several factors contributed to significant challenges in enrollment and led the Sponsor to discontinue the combined AMAG-FER-CKD-251 and AMAG-FER-CKD-252 studies, and the AMAG-FER-CKD-253 study. Blood samples were collected, but not run through an analysis to obtain outcome measure data. As such, the data set for this primary outcome measure cannot be summarized nor can the statistical analysis, as described in the protocol, be provided in a way that will provide any significant data based upon the limited study datasets.</description>
