      The goal of this research is to evaluate whether Tai Chi merits further investigation as a
      non-pharmacological therapy in the treatment of Major Depressive Disorder (MDD).
      Specifically, this waitlist-controlled study will gather preliminary data evaluating the
      effectiveness of Tai Chi training as treatment for patients with MDD or a history of MDD,
      including patients who continue to be depressed despite taking antidepressants and patients
      who choose not to take antidepressants due to fear of side effects and/or for personal
      reasons. To test this hypothesis the investigators will compare physical and psychological
      parameters of a control group and an intervention group, at baseline (Week 0), at the
      midpoint (Week 6), and at the end of 12 weeks of Tai Chi training.

    <textblock>
      When a first line treatment for depression fails, clinicians often choose to increase the
      dosage, or augment with a second agent, prior to considering switching agents altogether
      (Rosenbaum et al, 1995). Combination of an SSRI/SNRI with other agents such as tricyclic
      antidepressants (TCAs) or lithium are examples of popular strategies (Fava et al, 1994). In
      many instances, augmentation with multiple psychotropic agents may not be desirable, because
      of risk of side effects or drug-drug interactions.

      In view of their benign adverse effect profiles, non-pharmacological interventions such as
      psychotherapy and mind-body intervention have been used to augment treatment for treatment
      resistant depressed patients. Preliminary studies have shown that meditation is beneficial
      for the treatment of depression (Smith et al., 2007; Sephton et al., 2007; Finucane and
      Mercer, 2006; Astin et al., 2003; Speca et al., 2000).

      Tai Chi training consists of a sequence of slow, soft, and graceful movements derived from
      the martial arts. It is considered as a moving form of yoga and meditation combined. Tai Chi
      has been considered as one form of oriental healing arts, like acupuncture, which fosters the
      circulation of this 'chi' or energy within the body. By doing so, the health and vitality of
      the person are enhanced. Tai Chi, with its slow movement synchronized to the person's
      breathing, has been known to lead to a calm and tranquil mind when the person is focused on
      the precise execution of these exercises.

          -  Satisfy DSM-IV criteria for current Major Depressive Disorder (MDD), or have a history

             intervention in the past 3 months.

        General Exclusion criteria

          -  Patients with primary diagnosis other than MDD and/or do not have a history of MDD;

          -  Conditions that may make it difficult to conclusively determine that depressive
             symptoms are the result of MDD or having a history of MDD and not some other
             condition, including any form of substance abuse or dependence within the last 6
             months, relevant medical conditions that may be the medical basis of a depression
             including epilepsy, history of an abnormal EEG, severe head trauma, or stroke;

          -  Medical conditions that would preclude entry into a clinical trial, including serious

             3 months);

          -  Confounding treatments, such as current ongoing treatment other than what is provided
             by South Cove for depression; plans to receive confounding treatments.
