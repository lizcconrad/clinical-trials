  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Depressive symptoms of Parkinson's disease (PD) patients are major predictors of their
      prognosis and quality of life. Using subthalamic nucleus (STN) deep brain stimulation (DBS)
      as an antidepressant could be a promising new direction. Existing methods of adjustment of
      DBS parameters aim at amelioration of the motor signs and therefore with inactivation of the
      STN motor territory only. Although the DBS parameter setting is believed to influence the
      mental state, there is no data that correlates stimulation parameters with mental state. The
      investigators hypothesize that the emotional territories of the STN have distinct
      electrophysiological properties and that specific stimulation of these emotional territories
      can influence the mental state and thus treatment with emotionally-adjusted DBS can improve
      the psychiatric symptoms of PD. In this project, the investigators intend to map the
      emotional territories of the STN using neuronal (single units) responses to emotional voices
      and to identify the emotional spectral signature of the STN single unit activity using
      spectral analysis and neuronal responses to emotional voices. The investigators also intend
      to investigate the emotional processing of PD patients by manipulating the stimulation of the
      subthalamic area. The proposed study will combine neural recording, stimulation and
      psychological tests to shed new light on emotional processing in the basal ganglia, as well
      as to provide better treatment for PD emotional disorders,

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Clinically definite PD treated / candidates for treatment with DBS (patients with
             advanced idiopathic PD who are deemed appropriate for DBS surgery).

          2. Patients will be included in the study irrespective of whether a diagnosis of major
             depression (MDD) (mild to moderate but not severe MDD) is fulfilled at baseline.
             Patients without depression will be monitored in the study for evidence of treatment
             emergent depression. Patients with depression will be monitored for antidepressant
             effects of stimulation change.

          3. Age 40-75 years

          4. Male or female.

          5. Competent and willing to give written informed consent

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Significant suicidal risk [Hamilton Depression scale item 3 (suicide) &gt;2].

          2. Comorbidity with any Psychotic Disorder, Bipolar Disorder, Post Traumatic Stress
             Disorder (PTSD), Eating Disorder.

          3. Lifetime history of substance or alcohol dependence or of abuse in the preceding 12
             months

          4. Significant cognitive decline, as measured by Addenbrooke's Cognitive Examination
             (ACE) and the Frontal Assessment Battery (FAB).
