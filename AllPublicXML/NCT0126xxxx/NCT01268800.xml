  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Personalization of AML therapy, require a reliable mechanism for accurate characterization of
      patient specific leukemia phenotype and genotype. Patient's specific leukemic phenotype or in
      practical clinical term, patient's leukemia sensitivity to induction therapy, should best
      investigated in-vivo during induction. Elimination of circulating leukemic blasts from
      peripheral blood by day 5 was shown to discriminate between good responders with superior
      long term survival and poor responders with poor outcome. However, many AML patients have no
      circulating blasts at diagnosis and even in those who have, elimination rate of it from
      peripheral blood was never correlated with actual response in bone marrow.

      Currently, the only available source for patient's specific leukemia profile, is the bone
      marrow sample at diagnosis. Since leukemic blasts are heterogeneous and come from multiple
      different clones, &quot;on diagnosis&quot; marrow consist a spectrum of chemotherapy sensitive and
      resistance clones. Clones may vary by their molecular abnormalities and results from &quot;on
      diagnosis&quot; marrow may overlook minor resistant but existing clones. Long term prognosis is
      determined by those resistant clones and though our interests should be focused into the
      abnormalities of these clones. Residual blasts on day 5 marrow may better represent the
      profile of patient's leukemic resistant clones.
