  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Juvenile drug courts were developed in response to a perceived need to intervene more
      effectively with youth with substance abuse problems. Close collaboration between the court
      and substance abuse treatment provider is a defining component of the drug court model and is
      critical to helping youth achieve positive outcomes. Despite the proliferation of juvenile
      drug courts in recent years, however, evaluation of their capacity to reduce offender
      substance use and criminal activity has lagged. Moreover, the Institute of Medicine (IOM,
      1998) and leading experts (McLellan, Carise, &amp; Kleber, 2003) have presented a bleak picture
      of the nation's capacity to meet the treatment needs of substance abusing individuals.
      Although community-based programs provide the backbone of substance abuse treatment in the
      nation, their capabilities have not kept up with major scientific advances in the development
      and validation of evidence-based substance abuse interventions.

      Building on our research findings and experience regarding juvenile drug court outcomes as
      well as the transport of evidence-based practices to community treatment settings, the
      purpose of this study is to develop and test a relatively flexible and low cost strategy for
      enhancing the outcomes of juvenile drug courts by integrating components of evidence-based
      treatments into existing substance abuse services.

      Specifically, this project aims to:

      Aim 1: Adapt existing intervention and training protocols from evidence-based practices
      (i.e., Contingency Management for adolescent substance abuse; family engagement strategies
      from evidence-based treatments of juvenile offenders) for integration into juvenile drug
      court sites.

      Aim 2: Conduct a study to examine youth (e.g., substance use and criminal behavior) and
      system level (e.g., intervention adherence, feasibility, retention and completion rates,
      consumer satisfaction, cost estimates) effects of implementing the intervention protocols in
      juvenile drug courts.

      Aim 3: Revise the intervention and training protocols in preparation for a Stage II study if
      findings are supportive.
