      The purpose of this study is to describe participants 6 months to &lt;18 years of age with
      hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection in a prospective cohort in the United States (US) and
      Canada and identify predictors of disease activation and progression.

      •Primary Aim:

      o To describe participants 6 months to &lt;18 years of age with hepatitis B virus (HBV)
      infection in a prospective cohort in the United States (US) and Canada and identify
      predictors of disease activation and progression

      Secondary Aims:

        -  To describe clinical, virological, and immunological characteristics of participants
           with HBV in the US and Canada.

        -  To evaluate changes in HBV infection status and hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg)
           levels and factors associated with those changes.

        -  To verify whether a baseline HBsAg below 1,000 IU/mL and HBV DNA below 1,000 IU/mL is an
           accurate predictor of people who are, or who will become, inactive carriers, defined as
           people who are HBsAg positive, hepatitis B &quot;e&quot; antigen (HBeAg) negative, have normal
           alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and HBV DNA under 1,000 IU/mL on at least two occasions
           over a period of at least 6 months with HBV DNA under 1,000 IU/mL.

        -  To assess the health related quality of life (HRQOL) of treatment naïve hepatitis B
           surface antigen (HBsAg) positive children and adolescents

        -  To develop a bank of biospecimens (e.g., serum, plasma, DNA, liver tissue) obtained from
           participants with HBV infection.

        -  To identify pediatric participants from 2 years to &lt;18 years of age with chronic HBV
           infection for potential participation in treatment study to be conducted by the
           Hepatitis B Research Network (HBRN).

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Antigen loss: e and s</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 288 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Loss of these viral markers may be associated with appearance of corresponding antibodies in serum (anti-HBe or anti-HBs). HBsAg loss appears to represent a &quot;cure&quot; of HBV infection and is associated with reduction, but not necessarily elimination, of the risk of future complications, such as Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) which may occur, particularly in those who lose HBsAg at an older age (after 50 years) or after the development of cirrhosis. When HBeAg or HBsAg loss occurs, participants will be followed more closely initially and then return to the regular follow-up schedule.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Hepatitis exacerbation marked by alanine aminotransferase (ALT) Flare</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 288 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>A flare is defined as serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) greater than or equal to 10 times the upper limit of normal which corresponds to (1 550 IU/L in females and 600 IU/L in males for 6 months - 18 months of age and 2) 350 IU/L in females and 400 IU/L in males for &gt;18 months - &lt; 18 years of age (12). Once a flare is detected, participants will be followed more closely until its resolution.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Cirrhosis</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 288 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The diagnosis of cirrhosis will be made by (1) liver histology, when available or In the absence of histological diagnosis, cirrhosis is defined as any one of the following
Presence of ascites or hepatic hydrothorax
Variceal or portal hypertensive bleeding
Hepatic encephalopathy
Child-Turcotte-Pugh (CTP) score of 7 or above
or in the absence of hepatic decompensation (any two of the following):
Splenomegaly
Nodular liver
Platelet count below 120,000/mm3
Once cirrhosis is diagnosed, patient follow-up should include Hepatocellular carcinoma(HCC)surveillance</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Hepatic Decompensation</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 288 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>It is likely that the development of cirrhosis and subsequent hepatic decompensation will be preceded and foreseen by the progression of fibrosis. Development of hepatic decompensation will be defined by any of the following events:
Ascites or hepatic hydrothorax
Variceal bleeding or portal hypertensive bleeding
Hepatic encephalopathy
Child-Turcotte-Pugh (CTP) score of 7 or above
It is anticipated that there will be a small number of patients that will develop decompensation during the follow-up.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC)</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 288 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>HCC may be detected by routine surveillance or may become clinically apparent. The diagnosis of HCC will be made using the American Association for the Study of Liver Disease criteria.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Death</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 288 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Death may occur related to liver disease (typically hepatic decompensation or HCC) or may occur unrelated to hepatitis B or liver disease. Date and cause of death will be recorded.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Liver transplantation</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 288 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Liver transplantation will be recorded upon notification. Date of transplantation, indication for transplantation, and occurrence of incidental HCC will be recorded. Follow-up ends with liver transplantation.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Reaching 18 years of Age</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 288 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Patients who reach 18 years of age and are within an adult HBRN clinical center will be offered participation in the adult cohort study and re-consented for the adult protocol.</description>
