  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with multiple myeloma have seen their survival rate strongly improved with the use
      of new anti angiogenic agents. Among them, the new chemotherapy with thalidomide or
      lenalinomide are frequently successfully suggested in therapeutic protocol such as MPT
      however they can strongly increase the risk of venous thrombo embolic disease (DVT and PTE)
      up to 20%. In these conditions, a prevention of this risk can be proposed by physician with
      either low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) anticoagulants or antiplatelets agents. Pending
      the new recommendations on the management of VTED, the purpose of this study is to describe
      in real life conditions the management by oncologists of the thrombo embolic risk for such
      patients
