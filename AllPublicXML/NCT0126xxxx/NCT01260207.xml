  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether interactive voice response (IVR) technology
      can be used to bring post discharge care for acute coronary syndrome (ACS) closer to best
      practice guidelines (BPGs).

      The study hypothesis is that ACS patients who are contacted by IVR technology will be more
      likely to receive care as recommended in the BPGs than those followed by usual care.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Acute coronary syndrome (ACS) is a significant public-health problem in Canada and worldwide
      with 20,000 Canadians dying of myocardial infarction and 42,000 dying of coronary artery
      disease in 1999. Large clinical trials have provided evidence for the development of
      standardized best practice guidelines (BPG) and compliance with these guidelines have
      significantly improved survival. Despite the development and dissemination of BPG, their
      application in patients with ACS is suboptimal. This randomized control trial will use 2
      groups: IVR and usual care. Patients in the IVR group will receive 5 automated calls at
      1,3,6,9 and 12 months consisting of predetermined questions related to medication management,
      smoking cessation, diet, exercise and education as recommended by the ACC/AHA BPG for ACS.
      Responses are captured in a database allowing for interventions to maintain patients on BPG
      as needed.
