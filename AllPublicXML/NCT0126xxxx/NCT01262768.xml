    <textblock>
      Portion size measurement aids (PSMAs) are tools that facilitate the estimation of food
      servings. The objectives of this study are to determine (a) if food portion size estimation
      accuracy differs when using a two dimensional (2D) PSMA (actual-size photos called Portion
      Size Cards) compared to a 3D PSMA (Portion Size Kit) and (b) whether differences exist in the
      short-term usefulness of and satisfaction with these PSMAs in a sample of parents of
      overweight children and youth. We hypothesize that the group that receives the 3D PSMAs will
      be more accurate in food portion size estimation and will be more satisfied with the tool
      compared to the group that receives the 2D PSMAs.

      Forty primary caregivers of overweight children and youth attending the Pediatric Centre for
      Weight and Health (Edmonton, AB) will be recruited. Participants will be randomly assigned to
      one of the two groups (2D PSMAs versus 3D PSMAs). After a brief explanation of the respective
      tool, participants will estimate the volumes of pre-measured rubber food portion models on a
      test plate. Participants will then be given the 2D or 3D PSMAs to take home with them to use
      in the real-world. After 2-4 weeks, participants will be telephoned by the research team to
      complete a brief survey to evaluate their usefulness of and satisfaction with the 2D or 3D
      PSMAs at home.

    <description>Subjects are randomly assigned to receive either 2D or 3D PSMAs to examine accuracy, acceptability and usefulness of the models. Both groups receive brief instructions on the use of the respective PSMAs, complete an accuracy estimation task, and are given the 2D or 3D PSMAs to take home with them to use for 2-4 weeks, after which the researchers telephone parents to complete a brief satisfaction and usefulness survey.</description>
