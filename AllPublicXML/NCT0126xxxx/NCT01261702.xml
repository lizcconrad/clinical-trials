      All patients were premedicated with oral midazolam 5-15 mg. one hour before surgery. General
      anesthesia with double lumen endobronchial tube was given. Patient was induced by propofol
      and fentanyl. Cisatracurium was given to facilitate intubation. Patient was ventilated with
      50% oxygen in air. Anesthesia was maintained with propofol and fentanyl in order to keep
      blood pressure and heart rate within 20% of the baseline. Cisatracurium was given every 30
      minutes in order to control ventilation. At the end of surgery, neuromuscular blockade was
      reversed.In PACU, the I.V. PCA machine was connected to the patient. The setting of PCA was
      basal infusion of morphine 1 mg/hr bolus of morphine 1 mg with lockout interval 5 minutes and
      4-hour limit 30 mg.The patient's mean arterial blood pressure, heart rate were recorded
      before induction, before intubation, at 15, 15, 30, 60, 90 and 120 minutes after intubation,
      and at 4, 8,16 and 24 h after surgery. The total amounts of fentanyl, propofol and magnesium
      sulphate were recorded. The time between the cessation of magnesium sulphate and extubation
      was recorded. The amounts of morphine usage at 4, 8, 16 and 24 hours after surgery were
      recorded. Pain score was evaluated at rest and deep breath and sedation score at 1, 2, 3, 4,
      8, 16 and 24 hours after surgery using numeric rating scale (NRS). Sedation score was graded
      as 0 = fully awake, 1 = somnolence, responds to call, 2 = somnolence, responds to tactile
      stimulation, 3 = asleep, responds to painful stimulation. The times that the patient first
      sipping, taking food, sitting at the edge of bed and walk with help were also recorded. The
      side effects such as nausea, vomiting, pruritus and respiratory depression were recorded.
      Cost effective analysis was also evaluated.

      All patients were premedicated with oral midazolam 5-15 mg. one hour before surgery. In the
      operating room, each patient was monitored with noninvasive blood pressure, ECG and pulse
      oximetry. After the patient was anesthetized, direct blood pressure, end-tidal carbon dioxide
      tension (ETCO2) and esophageal temperature were monitored. Choice of anesthesia was general
      anesthesia with double lumen endobronchial tube (Bronchocath). Patient was induced by
      propofol 1.5-2.5 mg/kg and fentanyl 2 μg/kg. After the patient was unconscious, cisatracurium
      0.2 mg/kg was given to facilitate intubation. Patient was ventilated with 50% oxygen in air.
      Anesthesia was maintained with propofol 6 -12 mg/kg/hr and 1 μg/kg of fentanyl was given
      intermittently every 1-1.5 hour in order to keep blood pressure and heart rate within 20% of
      the baseline. Cisatracurium (0.03 mg/kg) was given every 30 minutes in order to control
      ventilation. The patient was ventilated with volume controlled ventilator. Throughout the
      surgery, the ETCO2 was kept between 30-35 mmHg. During two lung ventilation, the airway
      pressure was kept within 20 cmH2O and respiratory rate 10-12 beats/minute. One lung
      ventilation was achieved with airway pressure less than 30 cmH2O and respiratory rate 12-20
      beats/minute. During the surgery, the lower part of the patient was warmed with forced air
      warmer (Bier Hugger) At the end of surgery, neuromuscular blockade was reversed by
      prostigmine 2.5 mg and atropine 1.2 mg.

      In the post anesthesia care unit, the I.V. PCA machine was connected to the patient. The
      setting of PCA was basal infusion of morphine 1 mg/hr bolus of morphine 1 mg with lockout
      interval 5 minutes and 4-hour limit 30 mg. The patient's mean arterial blood pressure, heart
      rate were recorded before induction, before intubation, at 15, 15, 30, 60, 90 and 120 minutes
      after intubation, and at 4, 8 , 16 and 24 hour after surgery. The total amounts of fentanyl,
      propofol and magnesium sulphate were recorded. The time between the cessation of magnesium
      sulphate and extubation was recorded. The amounts of morphine usage at 4, 8, 16 and 24 hours
      after surgery were recorded. Pain score was evaluated at rest and deep breath and sedation
      score at 1, 2, 3, 4, 8, 16 and 24 hours after surgery using numeric rating scale (NRS).
      Sedation score was graded as 0 = fully awake, 1 = somnolence, responds to call, 2 =
      somnolence, responds to tactile stimulation, 3 = asleep, responds to painful stimulation. The
      times that the patient first sipping, taking food, sitting at the edge of bed and walk with
      help were also recorded. The side effects such as nausea, vomiting, pruritus and respiratory
      depression were recorded. Cost effective analysis was also evaluated.
