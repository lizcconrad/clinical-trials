      Study of the modification of the fixation(binding) of Fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (FDG),
      fluoro-misonidazole (FMISO) and 3'deoxy-3-fluoro-thymidine deoxy-3-fluoro-thymidine (FLT)
      measured in tomography by broadcast(emission,issue) of positrons (PET) at patients before and
      in the course of exclusive radiotherapy or concomitant radiochemotherapy for primitive
      bronchial cancer.

      This protocle allows to study the simultaneous variations of the metabolism, the hypoxie and
      the cellular proliferation by PET SCAN at 5 patients reached(affected) by a primitive
      bronchial cancer in the course of exclusive radiotherapy for primitive bronchial cancer not
      small cell lung.

      The investigators are also going to study several scenarii of optimization of the
      radiotherapy according to the variations of the tumoral metabolism, the hypoxie and the
      cellular proliferation measured in the course of radiotherapy (theoretical study on console
      using the scanner and the various examinations).
