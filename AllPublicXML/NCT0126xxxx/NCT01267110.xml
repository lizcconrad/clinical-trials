  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Breast cancer is the second most common cause of cancer death in the U.S.1 in spite of being
      preventable, easily detectable, and curable.2-11 Breast screening continues to be
      underutilized by the general population and especially by traditionally underserved minority
      populations. Two of the least screened minority groups are American Indians/Alaska Natives
      (AI/AN) and Latinas. American Indian/Alaska Native women have the poorest recorded 5-year
      cancer survival rates of any ethnic group and the lowest (or near-lowest) screening rates for
      major cancers.12 Furthermore, breast cancer is the number one cause of cancer mortality among
      Latina women.13 While breast cancer screening rates have increased nationally, there has been
      an increase in the gap in breast cancer screening utilization between individuals from
      minority versus majority racial/ethnic groups.

      If you decide to participate in the program, your participation will last 4 months. You will
      complete the Healthy Living Kansas-Breast Health survey by computer. The survey will take
      about 20 minutes to complete. You will be randomly assigned (like flipping a coin) to one of
      two groups. The groups will receive different breast health information. After completing the
      survey, you agree to be contacted by telephone in 4 months to answer questions. You will be
      asked for your name, home address, and phone number.

      You will be given information about breast cancer and mammography. You may or may not benefit
      from the information provided. Care will be taken to safeguard the information you provide
      but under rare circumstances confidentiality breaches may occur.
