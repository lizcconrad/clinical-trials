  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      An isolation-limited segmental antral approach to pulmonary vein isolation is as effective in
      achieving long-term freedom from atrial fibrillation as the standard anatomic,
      circumferential antral ablation.

      This is a randomized controlled non-inferiority designed trial.

      Follow up:

      Patients will stop their anti-arrhythmic drugs 2 months post procedure. Follow-ups will
      involve clinical assessment, holter and/or loop recorders at 3, 6, 9, and 12 month intervals.

    <description>The goal is to complete ablation in all segments around the pulmonary veins until a circle of ablation lesions is created in the antrum with at least 30 seconds of ablation, 25W on the posterior surface, 30W on the anterior surface at each site, and change in the local electrogram. Entry and Exit block will be confirmed in each vein. The left superior pulmonary vein and left inferior pulmonary vein will be isolated with one circle, and the right superior and right inferior pulmonary veins will be isolated with one circle.</description>

    <intervention_name>Segmental Antral ablation</intervention_name>
    <description>If the patient is in atrial fibrillation, ablation will begin in the segment with the highest frequency signals in the pulmonary vein antrum. If the patient is in sinus rhythm, mapping and ablation will occur during coronary sinus pacing. Segments with the earliest signals in the Lasso catheter will be targeted, and reassessed after each ablation lesion. This will continue in a segmental fashion on the antrum until pulmonary vein isolation is achieved. Lasso should be moved between veins between lesions to assess the earliest electrogram. Entry and exit block will be confirmed at each vein.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Paroxysmal Atrial Fibrillation (PAF) for at least 6 months with at least 1 symptomatic
             episode during the previous 6 moths

          -  Patient must be felt to be candidates for Atrial Fibrillation (AF) ablation based on
             AF that is symptomatic and refractory or intolerant to at least one class 1 or 3
             anti-arrhythmic agent

          -  Documentation of at least one episode of AF on 12 lead ECG, TTM or Holter monitor
             within 12 months of randomization in the trial

          -  Patient must be on continuous anti-coagulation with warfarin (INR 2-3) or fractionated
             subcutaneous heparin for &gt;4 weeks prior to the ablation or they have undergone a
             recent (less than 48 hours before planned ablation) transoesphageal echocardiogram to
             exclude left atrial thrombus.

          -  Patient must provide written informed consent to participate in the clinical trial

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Contraindications to oral anticoagulants

          -  History of any previous ablation for AF

          -  Intracardiac thrombus

          -  AF due to reversible causes

          -  Pregnancy

          -  atriotomy scar (typically, MV or TV repair/replacement, ASD surgery, transplants)(CABG
             are okay)
