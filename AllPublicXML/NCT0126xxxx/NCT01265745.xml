      Valortim is the name of the experimental drug that volunteers will receive in this study.
      Valortim may also be called MDX-1303. Experimental means that the drug is not yet approved by
      the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Valortim is a monoclonal antibody (laboratory-made
      immune system molecule) for the treatment of inhalation anthrax (when the infection starts in
      the lungs). Valortim works by attaching itself to part of the anthrax toxin preventing the
      toxin from doing damage to cells. This study is being conducted to see if Valortim given over
      120 minutes is safe and tolerable. This study will take place in five parts: Screening Phase,
      Check-in Phase (the day you arrive at Quintiles to start the study), Treatment Phase (the
      time when you receive the study medication), Follow-up Phase (the time after you receive the
      study medication) and Final Visit.

      Twenty-eight subjects will be recruited and entered into one of three dose groups 1mg/kg,
      5mg/kg, 10mg/kg or placebo. Subjects will be stagger dosed into one of the three groups and
      randomly assigned to receive Valortim or saline. Subjects will reside in the clinical trial
      Phase I Unit from Day -1 through Day 2. After discharge on Day 2, all subjects will return to
      the Phase I unit 7 times at specified time points over an additional 130 days post-dosing
      (133 days total participation from check-in on Day -1)or placebo.
