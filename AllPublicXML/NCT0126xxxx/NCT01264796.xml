      The primary aims are to test the effectiveness of the self-help DM intervention (SHIP-DM), a
      comprehensive, culturally tailored DM management intervention, in improving glucose outcomes;
      To determine the effectiveness of the SHIP-DM in KAI with type 2 DM in improving self-care
      skills and psycho-behavioral outcomes related to DM control, to develop tangible
      infrastructures for the dissemination of valid and effective education materials to a wider
      population of KAI with type 2 DM in the US (e.g., audio-visual education materials, web-based
      intervention materials, mobile telephone-based intervention materials) and to explore the
      feasibility and acceptability of each dissemination module, utilizing the delayed
      intervention group participants. The secondary aims are to obtain preliminary
      cost-effectiveness data related to the proposed intervention, including cost estimates for
      this type of DM intervention, and to establish a systematic, long-term dissemination plan,
      including documenting effective methodologies, to facilitate faster translation of research
      findings and products to direct consumers in non-research settings.
