      1. Primary Objective:

             -  To evaluate safety and tolerability of single and multiple oral dosing of PAC-14028
                in healthy male volunteers.

        2. Secondary Objective:

             -  To evaluate pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of single and multiple oral
                dosing of PAC-14028 in healthy male volunteers.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Healthy men aged 20 to 45 years at the time of screening

          2. Whose weight is 50kg or more, but less than 90 kg, and whose body mass index(BMI) is
             19.0 kg/m^2 or more but less than 27 kg/m^2

             -BMI (kg/m^2) = weight(kg) /{height(m)}^2

          3. Who voluntarily decides study participation after receiving detailed explanation about
             the study and fully understanding it and who provides written consent for compliance
             with study requirement including proper contraception.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Who has clinically significant medical history or diseases involving liver, kidney,
             neurological system, respiratory system, endocrine system, urinary system,
             cardiovascular system, psychical disorders or blood tumor

          2. Who has gastrointestinal diseases or operation history which may interfere study drug
             absorption (however, except simple appendectomy and hernioplasty )

          3. Who has a history of hypersensitivity or allergies to any drug (aspirin, antibiotics,
             etc)

          4. Who has taken any prescribed drugs, herbal agents or crude drugs within 2 weeks before
             study drug administration, or who has taken any over-the-counter (OTC) drugs or
             vitamins (Investigators will determine his eligibility by considering the effect of
             the drug on his safety or pharmacokinetic results in case other inclusion/exclusion
             criteria is satisfied.)

          5. Who has drug abuse history or positive result at urine screening tests (cannabinoid,
             opioid, amphetamine, cocaine, barbiturate, benzodiazepine)

          6. Smoker or who has stopped smoking within previous 1 month or shows positive result at
             cotinine test.

          7. Who has confirmed positive at serological tests (HBs antigen, HCV antibody and HIV
             antibody)

          8. Who consistently consumes alcohol (over 21 units/week, 1 unit = 10 g of pure alcohol)

          9. Who has participated in other clinical study within 12 weeks before study drug
             administration (however, the last dosing day is considered as the end of clinical
             study.)

         10. Who has had bleeding or blood collection and donation over 400 mL within 12 weeks
             before study drug administration

         11. Whose vital sign measured at sitting position after resting at least 5 minutes is as
             following

               -  Low blood pressure (Systolic pressure: 90 mmHg or less, Diastolic pressure: 50
                  mmHg or less)

               -  High blood pressure (Systolic pressure: 140 mmHg or higher, Diastolic pressure:
                  90 mmHg or less)

         12. Who is determined ineligible for study participation by investigators for any reason
             including clinical lab test and ECG results.
