    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the study is to assess the safety and efficacy of 2 dose groups
      (PDA001 versus vehicle control) in subjects with active rheumatoid Arthritis. The secondary
      objectives of the study are to determine the clinical response at defined visit intervals,
      determine the time to flare of RA symptoms and to quantify changes in inflammatory markers
      including C-reactive protein (CRP), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), serum amyloid A
      (SAA), and IL-6.

    <description>A subject is considered a responder based on the Clinical Disease Activity Index (CDAI): A composite index where CDAI = SJC+TJC+SGA+PGA. SJC and TJC are the numbers of swollen and tender joints based on 28-joint counts; SGA and PGA represent the subject's and physician's global assessment of disease activity. The CDAI score ranges from 0-76. Clinical disease activity is defined according to CDAI scores where Remission is ≤ 2.8, Low Disease Activity &gt; 2.8 and ≤ 10, Moderate Disease Activity &gt; 10 and ≤ 22, and High Disease Activity &gt; 22</description>

    <description>A subject is considered a responder based on EULAR response: The EULAR response criteria classify each subject as a good, moderate or non-responder to treatment based on the degree of improvement from baseline and the level of disease activity at the endpoint. EULAR response is derived using the individual subject's DAS28 as the measure of severity of disease. Good or moderate response is defined as follows: Good response: DAS28 at the time point ≤ 3.2 and improvement from baseline &gt; 1.2 Moderate response: DAS28 at the time point &gt; 3.2 and improvement from baseline &gt; 1.2, or DAS28 at the time point ≤ 5.1 and improvement from baseline &gt; 0.6 and ≤ 1.2</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline and at each scheduled visit through Month 12 following the initial dose of study drug</time_frame>
    <description>The Health Assessment Questionnaire - Disability Index (HAQ-DI) was a patient-reported questionnaire consisting of 20 questions referring to eight domains: dressing/grooming, arising, eating, walking, hygiene, reach, grip, and usual activities. Participants assessed their ability to do each task over the past week using the following response categories: without any difficulty (0); with some difficulty (1); with much difficulty (2); and unable to do (3). Scores on each task are summed and averaged to provide an overall score ranging from 0 to 3, where zero represents no disability and three very severe, high-dependency disability. Negative mean changes from baseline in the overall score indicate improvement in functional ability.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline and at each scheduled visit through Month 12 following the initial dose of study drug</time_frame>
    <description>The erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) is a blood test that can reveal inflammatory activity. The subject's blood is placed in a tall, thin tube, red erythrocytes gradually settle to the bottom. Inflammation can cause the cells to clump together. Because these clumps of cells are denser than individual cells, they settle to the bottom more quickly. The ESR test measures the distance red blood cells fall in a test tube in one hour. The farther the red blood cells have descended, the greater the inflammatory response</description>
