  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. Two panels, each consisting of
      eight participants (8 elderly males with mild to moderate hypertension in Panel A and 8
      elderly females with mild to moderate hypertension in Panel B) will be randomized to receive
      either MK-8266 or matching placebo in a 3:1 ratio. Participants will receive single doses of
      MK-8266 or matching placebo in three treatment periods (Periods 1 through 3). In both Panel A
      and Panel B, doses will escalate in a rising, fixed sequence. In Period 1 (0.3 mg), Period 2
      (0.6 mg), and Period 3 (1.0 mg) once daily doses of MK-8266 or matching placebo will be
      administered. Blood samples will be obtained pre-dose and at selected time points up to 48
      hours post-dose for determination of MK-8266 plasma concentrations.

          -  Participant has had major surgery, donated or lost 1 unit of blood (approximately 500
             mL) or participated in another investigational study within 4 weeks prior to the

             procedure (i.e., post-study, AE follow-up, etc.) in the previous study to the
             screening visit of the current study.
