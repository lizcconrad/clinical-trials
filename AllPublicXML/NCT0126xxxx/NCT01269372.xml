    <textblock>
      This pilot, multi center study will establish the effectiveness of Given PillCam® Platform
      with the PillCam® Colon 2 Capsule as demonstrated by the identification of subjects with
      polyps, compared to standard colonoscopy.

      This study will also use to evaluate the administrative feasibility and data management of
      study design.

    <description>Each subject will be required to follow a bowel preparation regimen and will undergo Capsule Endoscopy (CE).
Following capsule ingestion and depending on capsule progression through the digestive tract subjects will be required to take an additional volume of laxatives in order to enhance capsule propulsion and maintain adequate cleansing of the colon.</description>

    <description>The colonoscopy procedure will be scheduled approximately 4-6 weeks after the CE procedure, and the colonoscopy bowel preparation will be the same as the bowel preparation for CE.</description>
