  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-center, open-label, dose escalation study of patients with
      alpha-mannosidosis. 10 patients will be enrolled in this study receiving intravenous
      infusions of Lamazym. In order to avoid development of delayed hypersensitivity all patients
      will continue weekly treatment at the designated dose until the Safety Committee approves
      transfer to the rhLAMAN-03 protocol.

      It is the hypothesis that Lamazym is safe to use.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. The patient must have a confirmed diagnosis of alpha-mannosidosis as defined by
             alpha-mannosidase activity &lt; 10% of normal activity in blood leukocytes

          2. The patient must have an age at the time of screening ≥ 5 year and ≤ 20 years

          3. The patient must have physical ability to perform 6-minutes walk test (6MWT), 3
             minute-stair climb test (3MSCT) and pulmonary lung function test (spirometry, body
             plethysmography).

          4. The patient must have the ability to mentally cooperate in the cognitive and motor
             function tests

          5. The patient must have the ability to hear and follow a request. Hearing aids can be
             worn.

          6. Patient or patient's legally authorized guardian(s) must provide signed, informed
             consent prior to performing any study-related activities (trial-related activities are
             any procedures that would not have been performed during normal management of the
             subject)

          7. The patient and his/her guardian(s) must have the ability to comply with the protocol

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. The patient cannot walk without support.

          2. Presence of known chromosomal abnormality and syndromes affecting psychomotor
             development, other than alpha-mannosidosis

          3. History of bone marrow transplantation

          4. Presence of known clinically significant cardiovascular, hepatic, pulmonary or renal
             disease or other medical conditions that, in the opinion of the Investigator, would
             preclude participation in the trial

          5. Presence of an ECHO with abnormalities within half a year that, in the opinion of the
             Investigator, would preclude participation in the trial

          6. Any other medical condition or serious intercurrent illness, or extenuating
             circumstance that, in the opinion of the investigator, would preclude participation in
             the trial

          7. Pregnancy

          8. Psychosis within the last 3 months
