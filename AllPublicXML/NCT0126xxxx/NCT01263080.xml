      Multicentre randomised double-blind, placebo-controlled 2x2 factorial trial investigating the
      effects of adding mirtazapine and folic acid to existing therapy for patients with
      schizophrenia
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The combination of mirtazapine plus antipsychotic potentially offers considerable benefit for
      patients with schizophrenia. Folic acid is a promising adjunctive therapy for schizophrenia
      that may also provide benefits for patients with other mental disorders. Furthermore the
      effects of folic acid may be affected by genotype.

      The trial will investigate the effects of adding mirtazapine and the effects of adding folic
      acid to treatments for schizophrenia. At randomisation, patients will be separately
      randomised to mirtazapine or placebo and to folic acid or placebo.

      Randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled 2x2 factorial trial with 12-week follow-up.
