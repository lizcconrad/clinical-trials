    <textblock>
      The primary aim of this study is to confirm that LY2216684 is not an inhibitor of CYP1A2 in
      vivo using theophylline as a probe substrate for the enzyme. Since LY2216684 has been
      observed to increase heart rate in some healthy subjects, this study will also assess heart
      rate when co-administered with theophylline.
