  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether narrowband imaging (NBI) makes it easier
      for a surgeon to see cancer.

      NBI is a kind of light. Normally, white light is used during surgery. White light uses many
      wavelengths of light. NBI only uses two wavelengths which highlight the blood vessels. This
      makes it easier for the surgeon to see blood vessels. Tumors often have more blood vessels
      than normal tissue. As a result, NBI may make it easier for the surgeon to see small tumors.

      In this study the surgeon will look with both normal white light and NBI. This way a
      comparison can be made to determine which is superior.

      Improved identification of tumors allows doctors and patients to make informed decisions
      about whether treatment is needed after surgery. It also provides additional information to
      determine which treatments may be best.

    <description>The procedure will begin with washings (peritoneal) and two assessments of the extent of peritoneal disease. First, a four quadrant inspection of the peritoneal cavity under white light, this is the standard of care assessment. Then, a repeat four quadrant inspection of the peritoneal cavity under NBI will be done, this is the only experimental component of the design. White light imaging will always be done first, followed by NBI. For those patients scheduled for thorascopic procedures: The procedure will begin with sampling of pleural effusions when clinically indicated. Then there will be two assessments of the pleural surfaces. First, an inspection of the pleural cavity under white light, this is the standard of care assessment. Then, a repeat inspection under NBI, this is the only experimental component of the design. White light imaging will always be done first, followed by NBI.</description>
