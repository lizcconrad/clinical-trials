  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Induction chemotherapy is gaining momentum in the management of locally advanced squamous
      cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN). The combination of docetaxel, cisplatin, and
      5-FU (TPF) was superior compared with PF in a Phase III clinical trials73,74. We have
      completed a Phase II clinical trial that showed that docetaxel, cisplatin, and cetuximab
      (TPE) is highly active and well tolerated as induction chemotherapy in SCCHN (Argiris et al.
      ASCO 2008; A6002). Preliminary survival results are very encouraging. 39 patients were
      enrolled and with median follow up 26 months the 2-year PFS was 70% and the 2-year OS 84%.The
      combination of chemotherapy plus cetuximab is already a standard treatment in recurrent or
      metastatic SCCHN47. Therefore, TPE can be used as the platform for the addition of novel
      agents.

      EGFR and VEGF are among the most important and validated molecular targets in cancer therapy.
      The incorporation of novel targeted therapies to chemotherapy and radiotherapy is of
      particular interest in head and neck cancer, and may improve efficacy without significantly
      increasing toxicity. A Phase III trial of carboplatin/paclitaxel/bevacizumab with or without
      cetuximab in advanced NSCLC has been proposed by SWOG. Bevacizumab is currently being
      investigated in SCCHN with promising results. A Phase II study investigating the combination
      of pemetrexed and bevacizumab (UPCI 05-002) as well as a Phase II trial of cetuximab and
      bevacizumab (UPCI 05-087) in recurrent or metastatic SCCHN are ongoing at the University of
      Pittsburgh with encouraging results (ASCO 2008 and ASCO 2009). In this study, 32 have been
      already enrolled. There was only 1 patient with grade 3 hemorrhage. The objective response
      rate is 20%, the median PFS 2.8 months and the median OS 8.1 months.

      In order to further improve the efficacy of TPE and the rate of complete responses we propose
      to add bevacizumab to the TPE followed by XPE regimen we developed at the University of
      Pittsburgh. Due to non-overlapping toxicities and based on our prior experience we anticipate
      that the regimen will be well tolerated. Moreover, we plan to obtain tumor biopsies and blood
      samples in the first cycle and evaluate the modulation of biomarkers post combination
      therapy. Data from induction with TPE (presented at ASCO 2009) indicate the potential
      significance of cytokine levels in patient outcome. Also, we will evaluate the feasibility of
      subsequent concurrent radiation, cisplatin, cetuximab and bevacizumab. Patients with stable
      disease in the primary could be considered candidates to surgical resection at the discretion
      of their physician, if the tumor is resectable.

          -  Prior to entry in the study the resectability and alternative treatment options for
             each patient will be determined by a team composed of an Ear, Nose, and Throat
             Surgeon, a Radiation Oncologist and a Medical Oncologist. Stage determination, optimal
             local treatment, and its timing according to this protocol will be determined at this
             evaluation. The unequivocal demonstration of distant metastasis (M1) confers
             ineligibility.

          -  Histologically or cytologically confirmed diagnosis of squamous cell or poorly
             differentiated carcinomas, or WHO types I-III of the nasopharynx.

             therapy which specifically and directly targets the EGFR pathway), or radiotherapy for
             head and neck cancer.

          -  Prior surgical therapy will consist only of incisional or excisional biopsy, and organ
             sparing procedures such as debulking of airway compromising tumors or neck dissection
             in a patient with an existing primary tumor. Any non-biopsy procedure must have taken
             place &gt; 4 weeks but &lt; 3 months of initiating protocol treatment.

             informed consent document.

          -  All patients should have their tumor tissue tested for HPV and will consent to have
             available archival tumor samples, unstained slides or blocks from previous diagnostic
             or therapeutic procedures submitted for correlative studies, including assessment of
             target molecules EGFR, VEGF and related biomarkers. Also, patients must agree to
             submit blood samples for correlative studies at least at baseline.

          -  Absolute neutrophil count equal to or greater than 1500/µl, Platelet count equal to or
             greater than 100,000/µl

          -  Creatinine clearance 60 ml/min or higher calculated using the Cockcroft-Gault formula:

        Calculated Creatinine Clearance = (140-age) X actual body wt.(kg) 72 X serum creatinine
        Multiply this number by 0.85 if the patient is female

          -  Total bilirubin within normal limits and AST/ALT less than 3 times the upper limit of
             normal.

          -  Urine to protein to creatinine (UPC) ratio should be &lt;1.0 at screening

        NOTE: UPC ratio of spot urine is an estimation of the 24 urine protein excretion - a UPC
        ratio of 1 is roughly equivalent to a 24-hour urine protein of 1gm. UPC ratio is calculated
        using one of the following formula:

          -  [urine protein]/[urine creatinine] - if both protein and creatinine are reported in
             mg/DI
