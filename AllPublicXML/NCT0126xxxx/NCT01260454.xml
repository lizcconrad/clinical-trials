  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Subcutaneous treprostinil (Remodulin) is effective therapy for pulmonary arterial
      hypertension, a life threatening disease of the lung blood vessels. Unfortunately,
      treprostinil is irritating to the skin and many patients experience intense pain at the
      infusion site for the first 7-10 days after placing a new subcutaneous infusion site.

      Qutenza is an FDA approved formulation of 8% capsaicin that is approved for the treatment of
      post-herpetic neuralgia, a painful skin condition. The investigators hypothesize that
      pretreatment of an area of skin with Qutenza would decrease the pain associated with a new
      treprostinil infusion site. The investigators hope that Qutenza will decrease both the
      intensity of the pain and the duration of the pain after patients place a new treprostinil
      infusion site.

      In this initial study, the investigators will provide Qutenza in open-label, unblinded
      fashion and ask patients to rate their pain using a diary tool with which they are already
      comfortable.

    <time_frame>14 days after a new infusion site</time_frame>
    <description>Patients will record the maximum intensity of pain (0-10) each day after placing an infusion site in a diary with which they are already comfortable. They will record the score each day for 14 days unless they have recorded &quot;0&quot; for two consecutive days.
The primary outcome measure will be the average of those 14 maximum intensity pain scores (the sum of the maximum for each day divided by the number of days, generally 14; range 0-10).</description>

    <measure>Number of Participants Who Experienced Greater Than 6 Pain Level Using the 10 Point Visual Analog Score</measure>
    <time_frame>60 minute period of patch application and subsequent 3 days</time_frame>
    <description>Qutenza has not previously been used in patients with normal, healthy skin. We will assess the reaction to capsaicin in these patients as compared to the patients with unhealthy skin (post-herpetic neuralgia) who were studied in the registration trials for Qutenza. Pain immediately following Qutenza application was measured on a 10 point visual analog score with the word 'none' above 0 and 'agonizing' above 10.</description>

        <description>Qutenza has not previously been used in patients with normal, healthy skin. We will assess the reaction to capsaicin in these patients as compared to the patients with unhealthy skin (post-herpetic neuralgia) who were studied in the registration trials for Qutenza. Pain immediately following Qutenza application was measured on a 10 point visual analog score with the word 'none' above 0 and 'agonizing' above 10.</description>
