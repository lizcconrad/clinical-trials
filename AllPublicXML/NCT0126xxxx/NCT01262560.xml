      RATIONALE: Manuka honey may prevent or reduce esophagitis-related pain caused by chemotherapy
      and radiation therapy. It is not yet known whether Manuka honey is more effective than
      standard care in preventing pain.

      PURPOSE: This randomized phase II clinical trial is studying Manuka honey to see how well it
      works in preventing esophagitis-related pain in patients receiving chemotherapy and radiation
      therapy for lung cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Evaluate the relative efficacy of 4 times a day consumption of liquid or lozenge Manuka
           honey to delay or prevent radiation esophagitis-related pain (during combined
           chemotherapy and radiation therapy for lung cancer) as compared to standard supportive
           treatment, as measured at week 4 by Numerical Rating Pain Scale (NRPS) for pain upon
           swallowing.

      Secondary

        -  Evaluate the trend of severity of radiation esophagitis-related pain during combined
           chemotherapy and radiation therapy for lung cancer using weekly measurements of the
           NRPS.

        -  Evaluate the adverse events associated with Manuka honey, as measured by CTCAE, v. 4.

        -  Evaluate the severity of radiation esophagitis (grade 3-4, CTCAE, v. 4).

        -  Assess weight loss (percent weight change from baseline to 4 weeks).

        -  Assess quality of life (QOL) and pain, as measured by the European Organization for
           Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) Quality of Life Questionnaire (QLQ-30) global
           QOL score and pain symptom subscale.

        -  Assess patient-reported dysphagia via a daily patient log.

        -  Assess nutritional status, as measured by the mean change in serum prealbumin levels
           from baseline to 4 weeks.

        -  Assess opioid use by collecting the patient's narcotic use in the previous 24-hour
           period at each weekly evaluation.

        -  Evaluate patient-reported adverse events associated with Manuka honey using the
           Patient-Reported Outcomes Version of the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events
           (PRO-CTCAE).

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to the percentage of
      esophagus in the radiation field (V60 &lt; 30% vs V60 ≥ 30%). Patients are randomized to 1 of 3
      treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive standard supportive care for esophagitis-related pain as needed
           during chemoradiotherapy.

        -  Arm II: Patients swallow liquid Manuka honey slowly over 3-5 minutes. Patients must
           refrain from eating and drinking for 1 hour after administration. Treatment continues 4
           times per day during chemoradiotherapy.

        -  Arm III: Patients place Manuka honey lozenges in their mouth one at a time and swallow
           the honey as it dissolves (no chewing or swallowing it whole). Patients must refrain
           from eating and drinking for 1 hour after administration. Treatment continues 4 times
           per day during chemoradiotherapy.

      Patients complete quality of life, pain swallowing diary, and pain assessments (Numerical
      Rating Pain Scale, EORTC QLQ-30 and Pain Subscale, and PRO-CTCAE) periodically during study
      treatment.

      Patients are followed up at 12 weeks from the start of study treatment.

    <time_frame>Baseline and 4 weeks from the start of treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Esophagitis-related pain was measured using patient-reported pain on swallowing as assessed by the Numerical Rating Pain Scale (NRPS), an 11-point scale (0-10) in which 0 indicates no pain and 10 indicates the worst pain imaginable. Generally, scores of 1-4 indicate mild pain, scores of 5-6 indicate moderate pain, and scores of 7-10 indicate severe pain. Change was calculated by subtracting the baseline value from the 4-week value. The experimental arms (honey) were compared to the standard arm (supportive care).</description>

    <description>Adverse events are graded using CTCAE v3.0. Grade refers to the severity of the AE. The CTCAE v3.0 assigns Grades 1 through 5 with unique clinical descriptions of severity for each AE based on this general guideline: Grade 1 Mild AE, Grade 2 Moderate AE, Grade 3 Severe AE, Grade 4 Life-threatening or disabling AE, Grade 5 Death related to AE. For esophagitis specifically, Grade 3 criteria includes severely altered eating/swallowing, tube feeding, total parenteral nutrition (TPN) or hospitalization indicated. Grade 4 criteria include life-threatening consequences, urgent operative intervention indicated.</description>

    <description>Adverse events are graded using CTCAE v4.0. Grade refers to the severity of the AE. The CTCAE v4.0 assigns Grades 1 through 5 with unique clinical descriptions of severity for each AE based on this general guideline: Grade 1 Mild AE, Grade 2 Moderate AE, Grade 3 Severe AE, Grade 4 Life-threatening or disabling AE, Grade 5 Death related to AE.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline and 4 weeks from the start of treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Change from baseline to four weeks in patient-reported difficulty in swallowing via the PRO-CTCAE. PRO-CTCAE is an item bank consisting of individual items to assess adverse symptom events from the patient perspective. There are 78 symptoms included in the survey but the primary item of interest assesses difficulty swallowing. For each AE in the PRO-CTCAE, between 1 and 3 items are included to assess the frequency, severity, and/or interference with activities related to that AE. Frequency questions have responses ranging from never, which is scored as a 0, to almost constantly, which is scored as a 4. Severity questions have responses ranging from none, which is scored as a 0, to very severe, which is scored as a 4. Interference questions have responses ranging from not at all, which is scored as a 0, to very much, which is scored as a 4. Difficulty in swallowing only has a severity question.</description>

        <title>Change in Radiation Esophagitis-related Pain at 4 Weeks as Measured by the Numerical Rating Pain Scale for Pain on Swallowing (NRPS)</title>
        <description>Esophagitis-related pain was measured using patient-reported pain on swallowing as assessed by the Numerical Rating Pain Scale (NRPS), an 11-point scale (0-10) in which 0 indicates no pain and 10 indicates the worst pain imaginable. Generally, scores of 1-4 indicate mild pain, scores of 5-6 indicate moderate pain, and scores of 7-10 indicate severe pain. Change was calculated by subtracting the baseline value from the 4-week value. The experimental arms (honey) were compared to the standard arm (supportive care).</description>

        <description>Adverse events are graded using CTCAE v3.0. Grade refers to the severity of the AE. The CTCAE v3.0 assigns Grades 1 through 5 with unique clinical descriptions of severity for each AE based on this general guideline: Grade 1 Mild AE, Grade 2 Moderate AE, Grade 3 Severe AE, Grade 4 Life-threatening or disabling AE, Grade 5 Death related to AE. For esophagitis specifically, Grade 3 criteria includes severely altered eating/swallowing, tube feeding, total parenteral nutrition (TPN) or hospitalization indicated. Grade 4 criteria include life-threatening consequences, urgent operative intervention indicated.</description>

        <title>Patient Reported Difficulty in Swallowing Associated With Manuka Honey Using the Patient-Reported Outcomes Version of the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (PRO-CTCAE)</title>
        <description>Change from baseline to four weeks in patient-reported difficulty in swallowing via the PRO-CTCAE. PRO-CTCAE is an item bank consisting of individual items to assess adverse symptom events from the patient perspective. There are 78 symptoms included in the survey but the primary item of interest assesses difficulty swallowing. For each AE in the PRO-CTCAE, between 1 and 3 items are included to assess the frequency, severity, and/or interference with activities related to that AE. Frequency questions have responses ranging from never, which is scored as a 0, to almost constantly, which is scored as a 4. Severity questions have responses ranging from none, which is scored as a 0, to very severe, which is scored as a 4. Interference questions have responses ranging from not at all, which is scored as a 0, to very much, which is scored as a 4. Difficulty in swallowing only has a severity question.</description>
