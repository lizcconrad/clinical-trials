  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Critically ill patients with acute kidney injury (AKI) are at high risk of bleeding on
      account of coagulopathy, platelet dysfunction, frequent liver dysfunction and invasive
      procedures.In patients at high risk of bleeding, anticoagulation restricted to the circuit
      (regional anticoagulation) has been advocated as the method of choice.However, citrate
      anticoagulation may have many metabolic consequences, such as metabolic alkalosis due to
      citrate metabolism into bicarbonate, and in patients with liver disease, metabolic acidosis
      and hypocalcemia may occur.Implementation of citrate-based regional anticoagulation with
      frequent monitoring of acid-base and electolytes is also more challenging for the nurses and
      does not eliminate the need of a low-dose systemic anticoagulation for thromboses prophylaxis
      in most of the patients. Citrate-based regional anticoagulation is therefore mainly advocated
      only for patients at high-risk of bleeding.

      The investigators plan to implement an open-label randomized control trial assessing the
      effectiveness of citrate-based regional anticoagulation in critically ill patients with AKI
      and with a special emphasis on the safety profile of this treatment in patients with severe
      liver failure.
