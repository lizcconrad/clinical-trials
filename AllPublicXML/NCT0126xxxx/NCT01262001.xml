      To evaluate the safety and tolerability of FG-3019 in subjects with Idiopathic Pulmonary
      Fibrosis (IPF) and the efficacy of FG-3019 for attenuating fibrosis in these subjects.

      Major Changes: FGCL-3019-049 Protocol Amendment 3 offers long-term extension of treatment
      with FG-3019 to eligible Cohort 1-EX (approximately 14 subjects) and Cohort 2 (approximately
      28 subjects) subjects who complete the Week 48-EX and Week 48 assessments described in
      Protocol Amendment 2, respectively. A subject is eligible for long-term extension of
      treatment if the investigator, after discussion with the Fibrogen Medical Monitor, believes
      that the subject would benefit from continued treatment with FG-3019.

             cancer.

          9. Trauma or surgical procedures requiring hospitalization within 4 weeks of the first
