      This is a Phase 2 study to assess the efficacy of SB1518 in the treatment of patients with
      advanced lymphoid malignancies including Hodgkin Lymphoma, Mantle Cell Lymphoma and Indolent
      Lymphoma (follicular lymphoma, lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma, marginal zone lymphoma and small
      lymphocytic lymphoma).
