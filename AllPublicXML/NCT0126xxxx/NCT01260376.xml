  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will investigate free fatty acid and VLDL-TG metabolism before and during exercise
      with and without pharmacological antilipolysis by the niacin antagonist Acipimox. Main
      focuses will be VLDL-TG and free fatty acid metabolism as well as expression of membrane
      proteins in fat- and muscle biopsies.

    <textblock>
      Insulin resistance in liver and skeletal muscle is of central pathogenic significance in the
      development of type 2 diabetes. The molecular connections are unresolved but high levels of
      free fatty acids and triglyceride is probably involved. Diabetic subjects and to a lesser
      extent obese subjects have increased triglyceride levels, this could be due to an abnormal
      turnover of VLDL-TG. It is not yet investigated whether VLDL-TG kinetics changes during
      pharmacological antilipolysis. Using the aseptic ex-vivo labeling technique (developed in our
      laboratories) we will investigate this issue in sedentary healthy men. After a 3 hour basal
      period subjects will exercise on a bike for 60 minutes at 60% of VO2max. In both basal and
      exercise period one muscle and one fat biopsy will be obtained, further blood samples will be
      drawn to examine FFA and VLDL-TG metabolism etc..

      This new knowledge will contribute to the understanding of metabolic disorders like type 2
      diabetes and obesity.

    <description>Healthy untrained men, investigated with pharmacological antilipolysis by Acipimox (Olbetam) and placebo on 2 occasions. Each day consists of 3 hour basal period and 90 minutes exercise on a bicycle at 60% of VO2-maximum. During the day glucose and lipid metabolism is investigated by glucose and VLDL tracer, as well as indirect calorimetrics. Cellular signaling is investigated by 2 muscle- and 2 fat biopsies each day.</description>
