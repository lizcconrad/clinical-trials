  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to get a better understanding of the side effect burden and
      identify predictors of psychotic, mood and aggressive disorders in children and adolescents.
      The study's primary aim is to identify genetic risk factors for weight gain and metabolic
      abnormalities.

      Participants will be evaluated for biological and genetic risk factors for nutritional and
      metabolic adverse effects associated with SGAPs (second generation antipsychotics) during 4
      visits over 12 weeks. Participants will also be evaluated at month 6, 9, and 12. This study
      does not involve treatment for participants. Treatment of subjects enrolled in this study
      will be determined by their clinician and will remain unaffected by participation in this
      observational minimal risk study.

      All participants were prescribed risperidone (Risperdal) for the duration of study
      participation and doses ranged from 0.25mg to 6mg daily for 52 weeks.

Since only a single participant finished the study and had assessments through Week 52, we compiled the data from all subject endpoints (1 Week 12 visit, 2 Week 36 visits, and 1 Week 52 visit) and this is the data reported below.</description>

        The investigators aim to recruit 200 individuals between the ages of 3 and 19, from a
        diverse range of ethnic and racial backgrounds, who have a clinical diagnosis of psychotic
        disorders, mood disorder or an autism spectrum disorder and are considered for treatment
        with second generation antipsychotic (SGAP) medication by a physician.

        Every effort will be made to recruit participants of all ethnicities, races and genders.
        The investigators will specifically target recruitment efforts toward minorities by using
        minority media and informational liaison with community organizations that serve minority
        populations.
