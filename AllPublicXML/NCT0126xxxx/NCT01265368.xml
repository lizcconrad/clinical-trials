    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1/2, proof-of-principle clinical study to assess safety and efficacy of a
      intradermally administered tumor vaccine (MGN1601). The study will be conducted in patients
      with advanced renal cell carcinoma.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Twenty four patients with advanced RCC will be included in this open, single-arm study.

      The treatment will last 12 weeks. The investigational product (MGN1601) will be administered
      intradermally for a total of 8 applications, whereas the first 3 applications will be
      administered weekly, and the following 5 applications will be administered bi-weekly.

      Patients who will develop disease control (CR, PR, or SD) by week 12 will be proposed to
      participate in the extension phase of the study. The extension phase will be continued until
      disease progression in each patient, however, maximally up to week 120 (total treatment
      duration 2.5 years). During this time period the investigational product will be administered
      5 times by weeks 24, 36, 48, 72, and 120.
