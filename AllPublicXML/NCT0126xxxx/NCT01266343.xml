  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators wanted to reported the results of immediate anterior chamber paracentesis
      (ACP), compared to Mannitol infusion, in patients with acute primary angle-closure glaucoma
      (PACG). In this study, the investigators first divided patients into three sub-groups
      according to their initial intraocular pressure (IOP) for analyzing the differences of IOP
      control, severity of corneal edema, waiting time for laser peripheral iridotomy (LPI), and
      visual outcome between ACP and Mannitol infusion.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators demonstrated that ACP could be first considered in patients with initial
      IOP between 45 to 60 mmHg because it provided better visual outcome than Mannitol infusion
      through the rapid stabilization of the anterior segment, which was achieved by rapid IOP
      control, better corneal edema regression, shortening waiting time for LPI. However, ACP
      should be considered in patients with the initial IOP of 60mmHg and higher only when Mannitol
      was contraindicated.
