  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The optimal valve substitute for patients between 60-70 years is controversial. We compared
      anticoagulation-related adverse events (ARAE) in patients receiving mechanical heart valve
      replacement (MHVR) on INR self-management vs. stentless bioprosthesis, to assess whether the
      risk of structural valve deterioration (SVD) is still out-weighted by the benefit of not
      requiring permanent anticoagulation.
