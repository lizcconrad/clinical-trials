    <textblock>
      This is an ancillary study to a randomized controlled trial of high dose vitamin D in older
      long-term care residents (NCT01102374). In this study, a subset of trial subjects will
      receive the zoster vaccine and the investigators will determine the immunological response to
      the vaccine in this older, frail population, as well as the association between vitamin D and
      immunological outcomes.

      Objectives

        1. To determine the increase in Varicella-zoster virus (VZV)-specific cell-mediated immune
           response from pre-zoster vaccination to 3 weeks post-vaccination in nursing home
           residents after 4 months of high dose vs. standard dose vitamin D3 supplementation.

        2. In the same participants as Aim 1, to measure the association between pre-zoster
           vaccination 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] levels and the increase in VZV-specific
           cell-mediated immune response from pre- vaccination to 3 weeks post-vaccination.

        3. Characterize the phenotypic and functional VZV-specific T cell responses to Zostavax,
           including memory, effector, Th1/Th2, and homing receptor-bearing T cells in the high
           compared to low ELISPOT responders.

      Hypotheses

        1. At baseline, higher serum 25(OH)D levels will be associated with higher levels of
           VZV-specific cell-mediated immunity (cross-sectional).

        2. At baseline, higher serum 25(OH)D levels, independent of vitamin D supplementation dose,
           will be associated with greater increases in VZV-specific cell-mediated immune responses
           to Zostavax, as measured by the interferon (IFN)-γ ELISPOT assay.

        3. Compared to standard dose, high dose vitamin D3 supplementation will enhance
           VZV-specific cell-mediated immune response to vaccination independent of baseline serum
           25(OH)D levels.

    <description>Varicella Zoster Virus vaccine (Zostavax), single dose X 1 injection
All subjects in this trial will receive the VZV vaccine. The Investigators will primarily compare immune responses in those that are receiving high dose vs. standard dose vitamin D supplementation and those that have high and low 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels.</description>
