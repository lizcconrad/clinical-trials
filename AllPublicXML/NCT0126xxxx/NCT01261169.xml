      This study is designed to explore the use of Myfortic® in patients with steroid-refractory
      uveitis. The aim of the study will be to show the therapeutic effect of Myfortic® in managing
      uveitis patients.

    <textblock>
      This study is a single arm prospective evaluation in which patients with uveitis are treated
      with Myfortic® in a dose of 360 mg bid for six months. From day 0, Myfortic will be combined
      with 1 mg/kg prednisone. Prednisone will be tapered from week 1 based on the clinical
      findings of the ophthalmologist.

      There will be no other stratification of patients. After the screening, patients will be
      treated with Myfortic® for 6 months. Patients will be seen at month 1, 3, and 6. Thereafter
      patients will be followed up at month 12. Efficacy and safety assessments will be performed
      at each visit.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Men or women ≥ 18 years of age with corticosteroid-refractory uveitis due to one of
             the inflammatory conditions listed below:

               1. Ocular sarcoidosis: a granulomatous uveitis with posterior inflammation in a
                  patient in which sarcoidosis has been established by means of a biopsy, cytology,
                  or a positive scan.

               2. Intermediate uveitis: patients with clinical features as defined by the IUSG23.
                  However, it is important that the patient has no evidence of a systemic infection
                  such as Lyme Borreliosis and that there is no history of neurological symptoms
                  likely to be associated with multiple sclerosis. All patients with intermediate
                  uveitis should have a negative MRI with gadolinium contrast, prior to being
                  enrolled.

               3. Behçet's syndrome: the international classification criteria of the International
                  Society for Behçet's Disease (ISBD) will be used to define these patients.

               4. Idiopathic Retinal Vasculitis where systemic or infectious causes have been
                  eliminated. In particular patients will not have evidence of Wegener's
                  granulomatosis, SLE, PAN, polymyositis, dermatomyositis or other systemic
                  vasculitic disorders. Patients must also lack evidence for a systemic infection,
                  and have been adequately screened. For the purpose of this study, Eale's disease
                  will be excluded from the idiopathic retinal vasculitis group. However, both
                  non-occlusive and occlusive types of retinal vasculitis can be included in the
                  study.

               5. Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada disease (VKH) as defined according to the international
                  Workgroup definition of VKH.

               6. Sympathetic ophthalmia: a granulomatous uveitis involving the choroid and retina,
                  characterized by multiple white-yellow lesions often in the periphery, which can
                  coalesce particularly in the circumpapillary region. It is associated with trauma
                  or multiple prior surgeries.

               7. Idiopathic panuveitis: all non-infectious panuveititides that can not be related
                  to the diseases mentioned above.

               8. Corticosteroid-refractory uveitis patient is defined as the patient who receive
                  steroid treatment and cannot lower the dosage of steroid to less than 10mg per
                  day in 3 months due to the clinical condition.

          2. Disease that is 5 years or less in duration, with a significant flare in the past 24
             months requiring intensification of anti-inflammatory therapy (predsinolone). A
             significant flare is defined as a drop of 2 lines of vision on an ETDRS chart or
             equivalent, or increase in vitreous flare by 2 grades.

          3. Visual acuity of 0.1 or better in at least one eye.

          4. Men and women of childbearing potential must use adequate birth control measures
             (e.g., abstinence, oral contraceptives, intrauterine device, barrier method with
             spermicidal cream, or surgical sterilization) for the duration of the study and should
             continue such precautions for 6 weeks after receiving the last administration.

          5. The screening laboratory test results must meet the following criteria:

               1. Hemoglobin ≥ 10.5 g/dL

               2. WBC ≥ 3.0 x 103/μL

               3. Neutrophils ≥ 1.5 x 103/μL

               4. Platelets ≥ 1 x 103/μL

               5. SGOT (AST) and alkaline phosphatase levels must be within 3 times the upper limit
                  of normal range for the laboratory conducting the test (3xULN).

               6. Creatinine clearance &gt; 25 ml/min

          6. Must have a normal chest radiograph within 3 months prior to first therapy with no
             evidence of malignancy, infection or TB.

          7. Patient must be able to adhere to the study visit schedule and other protocol
             requirements.
