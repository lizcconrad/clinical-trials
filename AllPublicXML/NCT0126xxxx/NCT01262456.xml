    <measure>Change From Baseline in Mean Number of Nocturnal Voids Averaged Over a 3-Month Period</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1 (Baseline), Week 1, Months 1, 2, 3 (3-month double-blind treatment period)</time_frame>
    <description>The number of nocturnal voids was the average over 3 consecutive 24-hour periods prior to Day 1 and prior to the during-treatment visits (Week 1, Months 1, 2, 3) as recorded in participant diaries. The first morning void was not counted as a nocturnal void. Change from baseline values for Week 1, and Months 1, 2 and 3 are reported below.
Comparison of the mean number of nocturnal voids at baseline and over a 3-month treatment period (obtained by longitudinal analysis of Week 1, and Months 1, 2 and 3) are reported in the statistical analysis. This was the first co-primary outcome. Superiority to placebo was to be simultaneously demonstrated on the 2 co-primary outcomes in a step-down approach from highest (75 μg) to lowest dose (50 μg), thereby controlling the family-wise error rate at the 5% nominal significance level.</description>

    <measure>Adjusted Probability of Participants Achieving a &gt;33% Reduction From Baseline in Number of Nocturnal Voids for All During-Treatment Visits up to Month 3</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1 (Baseline), Week 1, Months 1, 2, 3 (3-month double-blind treatment period)</time_frame>
    <description>Probability of participants achieving 33% responder status during 3 months of treatment employed a longitudinal analysis assessing nocturnal void information captured in the 3-day diary. A 33% responder was defined as a participant with a decrease of at least 33% in the mean number of nocturnal voids relative to baseline. The number of nocturnal voids was the average over 3 consecutive 24-hour periods prior to Day 1 and prior to the during treatment visits (Week 1, Months 1, 2, 3) as recorded in participant diaries. The first morning void was not counted as a nocturnal void.
This was the second co-primary outcome. Superiority to placebo was to be simultaneously demonstrated on the 2 co-primary endpoints in a step-down approach from highest (75 μg) to lowest dose (50 μg), thereby controlling the family-wise error rate at the 5% nominal significance level.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in Mean Number of Nocturnal Voids at Month 3</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1 (Baseline), Month 3</time_frame>
    <description>Comparison of the mean number of nocturnal voids at baseline and at the 3-month visit. The number of nocturnal voids was the average over 3 consecutive 24-hour periods prior to the relevant visits as recorded in participant diaries. The first morning void was not counted as a nocturnal void.
The secondary efficacy outcomes (#3-7) used a hierarchical step-down approach in the order listed. The active treatment groups were compared to placebo using a step-down approach from highest dose (75 µg) to lowest dose (50 µg).</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Mean Time to First Nocturnal Void at Month 3</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1 (Baseline), Month 3</time_frame>
    <description>The time to first void was defined as the time from going to bed with the intention of sleeping until first nocturnal void or until waking in the morning in the case where there was no nocturnal void. The first morning void was not counted as a nocturnal void. The time to first void was derived from the sleep and voiding diary. The mean time to first void was calculated as the average over 3 consecutive 24-hour periods prior to the Month 3 visit.
The secondary efficacy outcomes (#3-7) used a hierarchical step-down approach in the order listed. The active treatment groups were compared to placebo using a step-down approach from highest dose (75 µg) to lowest dose (50 µg).</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Mean Number of Nocturnal Voids Averaged Over a 3-Month Period</title>
        <description>The number of nocturnal voids was the average over 3 consecutive 24-hour periods prior to Day 1 and prior to the during-treatment visits (Week 1, Months 1, 2, 3) as recorded in participant diaries. The first morning void was not counted as a nocturnal void. Change from baseline values for Week 1, and Months 1, 2 and 3 are reported below.
Comparison of the mean number of nocturnal voids at baseline and over a 3-month treatment period (obtained by longitudinal analysis of Week 1, and Months 1, 2 and 3) are reported in the statistical analysis. This was the first co-primary outcome. Superiority to placebo was to be simultaneously demonstrated on the 2 co-primary outcomes in a step-down approach from highest (75 μg) to lowest dose (50 μg), thereby controlling the family-wise error rate at the 5% nominal significance level.</description>

        <description>Probability of participants achieving 33% responder status during 3 months of treatment employed a longitudinal analysis assessing nocturnal void information captured in the 3-day diary. A 33% responder was defined as a participant with a decrease of at least 33% in the mean number of nocturnal voids relative to baseline. The number of nocturnal voids was the average over 3 consecutive 24-hour periods prior to Day 1 and prior to the during treatment visits (Week 1, Months 1, 2, 3) as recorded in participant diaries. The first morning void was not counted as a nocturnal void.

          <description>Probability of participants achieving 33% responder status at Month 3 employed a longitudinal analysis assessing nocturnal void information captured in the 3-day diary. A 33% responder was defined as a participant with a decrease of at least 33% in the mean number of nocturnal voids relative to baseline. The number of nocturnal voids was the average over 3 consecutive 24-hour periods prior to Day 1 and prior to the Month 3 visit as recorded in participant diaries. The first morning void was not counted as a nocturnal void.
The secondary efficacy outcomes (#3-7) used a hierarchical step-down approach in the order listed. The active treatment groups were compared to placebo using a step-down approach from highest dose (75 µg) to lowest dose (50 µg).</description>

          <title>Change From Baseline in 24-Hour Urine Volume at Month 3</title>
          <description>Twenty-four hour urine volume was derived from the 3-day urine volume diary. Mean urine volumes were calculated as the average over 3 consecutive 24-hour periods prior to the Month 3 visit.
The secondary efficacy outcomes (#3-7) used a hierarchical step-down approach in the order listed. The active treatment groups were compared to placebo using a step-down approach from highest dose (75 µg) to lowest dose (50 µg).</description>

        <title>Minimum Post-Treatment Serum Sodium Levels in the Double-Blind Period</title>
        <description>Serum sodium levels were monitored at each study visit since hyponatremia is a potential serious adverse event associated with daily doses of desmopressin. The serum sodium level must have been within the normal reference range at the Screening Visit for the participant to be eligible for enrollment. A participant was to be withdrawn from the trial if the serum sodium level was &lt;=125 mmol/L at any time.</description>
