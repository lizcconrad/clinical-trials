  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A Phase 2 open label, dose escalation study to find the minimally and maximum effective dose
      (dose beyond which no further effect on PVR is seen) of inhaled nitric oxide generated by the
      GeNOsyl® System compared to placebo.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Up to 54 subjects undergoing RHC are planned in this study, and shall include subjects
      meeting eligibility criteria classified as WHO Group 1 PAH or WHO Group 3 IPF-PH. Subjects
      will receive inhaled nitric oxide from the GeNOsyl® System to characterize the hemodynamic
      response and evaluate safety and tolerability.

      Dose cohorts of approximately 5, 15, and 20 ppm nitric oxide in air will be studied.
      Different dose levels will be achieved by varying the flow rate of the drug substance (80 ppm
      NO2 in balance air) delivered to the subject via nasal cannula. Each subject will receive two
      different doses of inhaled nitric oxide separated by a placebo (medical grade air or
      supplemental oxygen) washout. Eligible subjects will be assigned to a dosing cohort in an
      escalating manner to receive study drug (80 ppm nitric oxide in air.)
