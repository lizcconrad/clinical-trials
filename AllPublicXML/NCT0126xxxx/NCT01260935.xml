    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the effects (good and bad) of the Laparoscopic Hill
      anti-reflux procedure with the Laparoscopic Nissen anti-reflux surgical procedure to see
      whether one is better than the other.

      The design is a two-armed prospective single-blinded comparison between the two procedures,
      performed and randomized independently at the Swedish Medical Center Cancer Institute in
      Seattle, WA, and at Legacy Health Systems in Portland, OR, in adult patients with
      uncomplicated gastroesophageal reflux failing medical management. A standardized operative
      technique for each procedures will be utilized at both institutions, and will include
      intraoperative manometrics and intraoperative photographic documentation of the
      gastroesophageal valve, as well as placement of clips at the GE junction to accurately
      identify its location post-operatively. To eliminate &quot;expertise&quot; bias, the investigator from
      each institution will participate in up to 50 of the first of each of the two procedures.
