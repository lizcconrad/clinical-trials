  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Ambulatory monitoring of physiological variables is important in following the health status
      of individuals in non-hospital controlled situations. The investigators are developing a
      non-invasive sensor based on dynamic light scattering that is able to measure pulse, blood
      flow and coagulability. Oxygen saturation can also be detected with minor modification of the
      apparatus. The investigators plan to validate the investigators sensor by applying it to
      patients in the intensive care unit, or to patients undergoing cardiac stress tests. The
      results of the investigators sensor will not be utilized for any therapeutic decisions, but
      will be collected for later comparison with conventional monitoring of pulse and oxygenation
      with standard monitors. The monitor is worn like a wrist watch, and will collect data into a
      small data storage disc for later analysis.

      Subjects to be studied will be either individuals undergoing routine cardiac stress tests, or
      patients admitted to the pulmonary ward of Meir Hospital who are being monitored in
      conventional manner. Normal volunteers will also be tested, under the following conditions:
      at rest, while running, while performing calisthenics, and while crawling on the ground. If
      non-inferiority of the new sensor is established compared to the standard clinically used
      sensors, then additional studies will be performed on acutely ill patients, such as patients
      admitted with multi-trauma.

        Normal volunteers will be studied. Individuals undergoing routine cardiac stress testing
        will be studied. Stable patients admitted to the pulmanary ward who are being monitored
        routinely for oxygen saturation and pulse will be studied.
