  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether the WT1 vaccine causes an immune response
      which is safe and able to keep the leukemia from coming back. While vaccines have been used
      in infectious diseases like smallpox and measles,the idea about using vaccines in a cancer
      like AML/ALL is really a new use of the idea of vaccines.The WT-1 vaccine is made up of
      protein pieces that the immune system can recognize as abnormal. The doctor thinks that the
      WT-1 protein is important in AML/ALL and using some lab tests they are still able to find
      some of it in the bone marrow. By attacking this small amount of the protein they hope to get
      rid of any small amount of AML that is still in the body.

    <description>Six vaccinations of the WT1 peptide preparation (1.0 ml of emulsion) will be administered on weeks 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10. All vaccinations will be administered subcutaneously with vaccination sites rotated among extremities. Patients who are clinically stable and have not had disease progression, may receive up to 6 more vaccinations administered appropriately every month.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Morphologic confirmation of a diagnosis of AML or ALL at MSKCC

          -  Patients will have completed induction therapy, achieved 1st CR and will have
             completed any planned postremission therapy. Patients are not candidates for
             allogeneic stem cell transplantation. For purposes of this study, patients who are not
             candidates for allogeneic stem cell transplantation shall be defined as 1) those who
             do not meet the eligibility criteria of an open allogeneic transplant protocol or 2)
             those who do not have a suitable available HLA matched donor available or 3) those who
             refuse to undergo stem cell transplantation or 4) those patients whose disease is
             characterized by &quot;good risk&quot; features (For AML the following cytogenetic subtypes:
             t(8;21), inv (16), or t(16;16), t(15;17), normal karyotype with mutated NPM1 and
             negative for tandem duplication of FLT-3. For ALL: T cell phenotype of any B lineage
             disease exclusive of t(9;22) or t(4;11) in whom allogenic stem cell transplantation in
             1st CR would not be offered as standard of care.

          -  Alternatively, those patients greater than or equal to 60 years of age who have
             achieved 1st CR and in whom no further postremission chemotherapy is planned may be
             enrolled

          -  Patients must have documented WT1 + disease. For purpose of this study, this is
             defined as detectable presence of any WT1 transcript via RT-PCR on a bone marrow
             performed at MSKCC within 4 weeks prior to the administration of the first dose of
             vaccine.

          -  Patients must be within 2 years of achieving CR following chemotherapy

          -  At least 4 weeks must have elapsed between the patient's last chemotherapy or
             radiation treatment and the first vaccination.
