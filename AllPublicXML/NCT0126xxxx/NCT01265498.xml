      Administration of the farnesoid X receptor (FXR) ligand obeticholic acid (OCA) for 72 weeks
      to subjects with biopsy evidence of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) will result in
      improvement in their liver disease as measured by changes in the nonalcoholic fatty liver
      disease (NAFLD) activity score (NAS).

      To evaluate whether treatment with obeticholic acid, 25 mg daily for 72 weeks compared to
      treatment with placebo, improves the severity of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) as
      determined from hepatic histology.

The score for each domain ranges from 0 to 100. Norm based scoring (based on the general US population) is used with a mean of 50 and standard deviation of 10. Higher values represent a better outcome.</description>
