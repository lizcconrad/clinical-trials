      The objective is to compare efficacy and safety of AB1010 at 3 or 6 mg/kg/day in treatment of
      patients with mastocytosis with handicap and bearing activating point mutations in the
      phosphotransferase domain of c-Kit such as the main mutation Asp-816-Val (D816V).

    <criteria>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients with one of the following documented mastocytosis:

               -  Smouldering systemic mastocytosis

               -  Indolent systemic mastocytosis with organomegaly

               -  Indolent Systemic Mastocytosis having 2 infiltrated organs (skin and bone-marrow)

               -  Any mastocytosis with in the last 6 months at least 3 anaphylactic shocks or
                  syncops requiring either use of adrenaline or medical assistance

               -  Cutaneous Mastocytosis (CM)

          2. Skin biopsy-documented mastocytosis and evaluable disease based upon:

               -  Histological criteria: typical infiltrates of mast cells in a multifocal or
                  diffuse pattern in skin biopsy

               -  Clinical criteria: typical skin lesions (maculopapular, urticaria pigmentosa,
                  mastocytoma)

          3. Missing data (c-kit molecular analysis not done) or documented presence of an
             activating point mutation in the phosphotransferase domain of c-kit such as D816V
             c-kit mutation in at least one infiltrated organ (bone marrow or skin)

          4. Refractory to at least one of the symptomatic treatments such as:

               -  Anti H1

               -  Anti H2

               -  Proton pump inhibitor

               -  Osteoclast inhibitor

               -  Cromoglycate Sodium

               -  Antileukotriene

               -  Other therapies used for the symptomatic care

          5. Handicap defined as at least one of the following handicaps:

               -  pruritus score ≥ 6

               -  number of flushes per week ≥ 7

               -  number of stools per day ≥ 4 ,

               -  number of mictions per day ≥ 8 ,

               -  QLQ-C30 score ≥ 60,

               -  Hamilton score ≥ 10

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients with one of the following mastocytosis:

                  Association Criteria. (i.e., congestive heart failure, myocardial infarction
                  within 6 months of study)

               -  Patient has a severe and/or uncontrolled medical disease.
