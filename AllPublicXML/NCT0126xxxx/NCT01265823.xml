    <textblock>
      W11-050 is a Mexican open label multicenter study that has been designed to further assess
      the safety and efficacy of adalimumab in the treatment of patients with active plaque
      psoriasis who have failed prior conventional systemic psoriasis treatment or who are
      candidates for systemic therapy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Up to 150 subjects having a diagnosis of active plaque psoriasis and fulfilling the study
      eligibility criteria were enrolled in Mexico. Adalimumab was administered as follows: 80 mg
      at baseline, followed by 40 mg every other week (eow; starting at week 1 until week 15). The
      study drug was self administered via subcutaneous (sc) injection. Safety and efficacy
      measures were performed throughout the study.

    <measure>Percentage of Participants With Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI)-75 Response at Week 4</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 4</time_frame>
    <description>PASI is a composite score based on the degree of effect on body surface area of psoriasis and the extension of erythema (reddening), induration (plaque thickness), desquamation (scaling) of the lesions and area affected as observed on the day of examination. The score ranges from 0 (no psoriasis) to 72 (very severe psoriasis). PASI-75 response is the percentage of participants who achieved at least a 75% reduction (improvement) from baseline in PASI score at Week 4. The improvement in PASI score was used as a measure of efficacy.</description>

    <time_frame>Week 4</time_frame>
    <description>Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) score is a participant-reported outcome consisting of a set of 10 questions regarding the degree to which the participant's skin has affected certain behaviors and quality of life over the last week. Responses to each are: very much (score of 3), a lot, a little, or not at all (score of 0). The DLQI score ranges from 0 (best) to 30 (worst); the higher the score, the more quality of life is impaired. A score &lt;6 indicates that psoriasis has small or no effect at all on participant's life.</description>

        <title>Percentage of Participants With Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI)-75 Response at Week 4</title>
        <description>PASI is a composite score based on the degree of effect on body surface area of psoriasis and the extension of erythema (reddening), induration (plaque thickness), desquamation (scaling) of the lesions and area affected as observed on the day of examination. The score ranges from 0 (no psoriasis) to 72 (very severe psoriasis). PASI-75 response is the percentage of participants who achieved at least a 75% reduction (improvement) from baseline in PASI score at Week 4. The improvement in PASI score was used as a measure of efficacy.</description>

        <description>Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) score is a participant-reported outcome consisting of a set of 10 questions regarding the degree to which the participant's skin has affected certain behaviors and quality of life over the last week. Responses to each are: very much (score of 3), a lot, a little, or not at all (score of 0). The DLQI score ranges from 0 (best) to 30 (worst); the higher the score, the more quality of life is impaired. A score &lt;6 indicates that psoriasis has small or no effect at all on participant’s life.</description>

        <description>Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) score is a participant-reported outcome consisting of a set of 10 questions regarding the degree to which the participant's skin has affected certain behaviors and quality of life over the last week. Responses to each are: very much (score of 3), a lot, a little, or not at all (score of 0). The DLQI score ranges from 0 (best) to 30 (worst); the higher the score, the more quality of life is impaired.</description>

        <title>Percentage of Participants Achieving Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI)-50, 90, 100 Responses at Week 4</title>
        <description>PASI is a composite score based on the degree of effect on body surface area of psoriasis and the extension of erythema (reddening), induration (plaque thickness), desquamation (scaling) of the lesions and area affected as observed on the day of examination. The score ranges from 0 (no psoriasis) to 72 (very severe psoriasis). PASI-50, 90, and 100 responses are the percentage of participants who achieved at least a 50%, 90%, or 100% reduction (improvement) from baseline in PASI score at Week 4. 100% reduction was considered complete clearance of psoriasis.</description>

          <description>PASI is a composite score based on the degree of effect on body surface area of psoriasis and the extension of erythema (reddening), induration (plaque thickness), desquamation (scaling) of the lesions and area affected as observed on the day of examination. The score ranges from 0 (no psoriasis) to 72 (very severe psoriasis). PASI-50, 90, and 100 responses are the percentage of participants who achieved at least a 50%, 90%, or 100% reduction (improvement) from baseline in PASI score at Week 4. 100% reduction was considered complete clearance of psoriasis.</description>

Response to treatment in participants with obesity (based on Body Mass Index) versus those without obesity was assessed via PASI-75 response (see Outcome Measure 1 for details) and DLQI score of &lt;6 (see Outcome Measure 3 for details).</description>
