  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Persistent Atrial Fibrillation (AF) is a common and distressing cardiac arrhythmia and
      accounts for 1% of the healthcare budget in the UK and it's prevalence is rising. Symptoms of
      atrial fibrillation include palpitations, chest pain , shortness of breath and fatigue, with
      quality of life measures reduced for patients with persistent AF, increased stroke risk and
      increased all cause mortality rates. DC Cardioversion is used to restore normal sinus rhythm
      in patients with persistent AF. It has a high success rate but reoccurence of AF is common.
      The use of anti arrhythmic drugs (AADs) can augment the number of patients remaining in sinus
      rhythm at one year, with amiodarone currently the most superior. Unfortunately it can have
      serious side affects. Dronedarone is a related drug designed specifically to minimise the
      most serious side affects and is no approved and used prominently in the management of non
      permanent AF. However it has not yet been studied in a post DC Cardioversion population.

      Patients in persistent AF who are referred for elective DC Cardioversionwill be randomised to
      receive either Amiodarone or Dronedarone to compare the ability to help maintain sinu rhythm
      post cardioverion in one NHS hospital. Patients will be followed up for a year post
      cardioversion to see if they stay in sinus rhythm.

      Ho: there will be no difference in maintenance of sinus rhythm with the use of amiodarone or
      dronedarone

    <description>Visit One:. Once consent is given patarticipants will be randomised into either group and instructed and prescribed the drug as appropriate.
Visit Two: Patients will attend for routine cardioversion. This is performed by an experienced CCU nurse as per normal protocol. Patients will also undergo an ECG, and fill in symptom and quality of life (QoL) questionnaires.
Visit Three: Patients will attend a routine outpatient appointment 6 weeks post cardioversion. They will undergo ECG and fill in symptom and QoL questionnaires
Visit Four: Participants will attend at 12 weeks for ECG, symptom and QoL questionnaires
Visit Five: Participants will attend at 24 weeks for ECG, symptom and QoL questionnaires
Visit Six: Participants will attend at 36 weeks for ECG, symptom and QoL questionnaires
Visit Seven: Participants will attend at 52 weeks for ECG, symptom and QoL questionnaires. Participants will then be followed up as per protocol by their consultant cardiologist.</description>
