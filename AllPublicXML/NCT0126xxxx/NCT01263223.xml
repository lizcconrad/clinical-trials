      The purpose of this study is to determine the effect of LY2216684 on heart rate and blood
      pressure in research participants with MDD who are being treated with an SSRI (selective
      serotonin reuptake inhibitors). Information about any side effects that may occur will also
      be collected. The duration of participation in this study is approximately 24 days not
      including the screening visit. This study requires 1 clinic confinement of 17 days/16 nights
      and 1 Follow-up Outpatient Visit. A screening visit is required within 30 days prior to the
      start of the study. In both periods 1 and 2, the study involves 4 single daily doses of 18 mg
      LY2216684 or placebo taken as 2 tablets by mouth. In period 3, the study involves four single
      daily doses of 36 mg LY2216684 or placebo taken as 4 tablets by mouth.
