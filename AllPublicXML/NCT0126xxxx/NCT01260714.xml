      This phase I trial studies the best dose of azacitidine and to see how well it works with
      mitoxantrone hydrochloride and etoposide in treating older patients with acute myeloid
      leukemia that has a lower chance of responding to treatment or higher risk of returning (poor
      prognosis). Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as azacitidine, mitoxantrone hydrochloride, and
      etoposide, work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the
      cells or by stopping them from dividing. Giving more than one drug (combination chemotherapy)
      may kill more cancer cells.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the highest tolerated dose of two dosing schedules of azacitidine when
      combined with mitoxantrone (mitoxantrone hydrochloride) and etoposide (A-NOVE) chemotherapy
      in poor prognosis older patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML).

      II. To evaluate the toxicity of this regimen.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the complete response (CR) rate and using this regimen. II. To evaluate
      changes in topoisomerase II activity, deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) methylation and DNA
      expression arrays in leukemia cells during azacitidine treatment, and to correlate these
      changes with responses to A-NOVE chemotherapy.

      III. To evaluate relapse-free survival (RFS) and overall survival (OS) in patients receiving
      post-remission consolidation with A-NOVE in patients achieving CR. (OS follow-up discontinued
      as of 08/07/2014)

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of azacitidine.

      Patients receive induction therapy comprising azacitidine subcutaneously (SC) once daily (QD)
      on days 1-7, mitoxantrone hydrochloride IV over 30 minutes, and etoposide IV over 1 hour on
      days 4-8. Patients may receive up to 2 additional courses of the same treatment as
      re-induction or consolidation therapy beginning 35-60 days from the start of the previous
      course.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months.
