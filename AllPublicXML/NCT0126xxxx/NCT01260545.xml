  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to examine the safety and tolerability of CA-18C3 in subjects
      with hematologic malignancies, as well as look at the preliminary efficacy of IL-1alpha
      blockade.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Male or female subjects age ≥ 18 years of age

          -  Subject must have a relapsed/refractory leukemia for which no standard therapies are
             anticipated to result in a durable remission. Subjects with previously treated
             high-risk myelodysplasia (MDS) (Intermediate 2 or high-risk by IPSS) and chronic
             myelomonocytic leukemia-2 (CMML-2 by WHO classification) are also candidates for this
             protocol. Relapsed/refractory leukemias include acute non-lymphocytic leukemia (AML)
             by WHO classification, acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL), chronic lymphocytic leukemia
             (CLL), or chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) in blast crisis. Subjects with
             myelofibrosis are also eligible. Untreated patients with above diagnoses considered
             unfit for standard therapy will also be eligible.

          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0-3.

          -  Women of child bearing potential (i.e., women who are pre-menopausal or not surgically
             sterile) must use acceptable contraceptive methods (abstinence, intrauterine device
             [IUD], oral contraceptive or double barrier device), and must have a negative urine
             pregnancy test within 2 weeks prior to beginning treatment on this trial. Nursing
             subjects are excluded. Sexually active men must also use acceptable contraceptive
             methods for the duration of time on study. Pregnant and nursing subjects are excluded
             because the effects of CA-18C3 on a fetus or nursing child are unknown.

          -  In the absence of rapidly progressing disease, the interval from prior treatment to
             time of study drug administration should be at least 2 weeks for cytotoxic agents, or
             at least 5 half-lives for non-cytotoxic agents. If the subject is on hydroxyurea to
             control peripheral blood leukemic cell counts, the subject must be off hydroxyurea for
             at least ¬48 hours before initiation of treatment on this protocol. Persistent
             clinically significant toxicities from prior chemotherapy must not be greater than
             grade 1.

          -  Subjects must have the following clinical laboratory values (unless out of range
             values are considered to be the result of leukemic organ involvement):

               1. Serum creatinine ≤ 2.0 mg/dl.

               2. Total bilirubin ≤ 1.5x the upper limit of normal unless considered due to
                  Gilbert's syndrome.

               3. Alanine aminotransferase (ALT), or aspartate aminotransferase (AST) ≤ 3x the
                  upper limit of normal unless considered due to organ leukemic involvement.

          -  Signed and dated institutional review board (IRB)-approved informed consent before any
             protocol-specific screening procedures are performed.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to uncontrolled
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric
             illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements.

          -  Active heart disease including myocardial infarction within previous 3 months,
             symptomatic coronary artery disease, arrhythmias not controlled by medication, or
             uncontrolled congestive heart failure.

          -  Subjects receiving any other standard or investigational treatment for their
             hematologic malignancy.

          -  Subjects who at the time of evaluation for participation in the study have evidence of
             active leukemic involvement in the brain or spinal cord (CNS).

          -  Dementia or altered mental status that would prohibit the understanding or rendering
             of informed consent

          -  Subjects immunocompromised due to a process unrelated to leukemic disease or
             treatment, including subjects known to be infected with human immunodeficiency virus
             (HIV)

          -  Subjects with detectable levels of endogenous antibodies to IL-1α at the time of
             screening.
