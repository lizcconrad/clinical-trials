  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Aim of this study is to validate a treatment of anastrozole in combination with
      tegafur-uracil as pre-operative therapy for postmenopausal primary breast cancer. Although
      pre-operative hormone therapy is a novel therapeutic approach, only hormone therapy has
      limitation in terms of efficacy. Metronomic chemotherapy, which is the frequent
      administration of low-dose cytotoxic agents, is not only target tumor cells but also
      inhibiting angiogenesis. Because there was a report that efficacy of hormone therapy add to
      metronomic chemotherapy as pre-operative therapy, a randomized phase II trial of anastrozole
      (ANA) in combination with/without metronomic tegafur-uracil (UFT) as neo-adjuvant for
      postmenopausal breast cancer will be conducted.
