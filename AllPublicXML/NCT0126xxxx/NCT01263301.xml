    <textblock>
      Subclavian steal phenomenon is normally observed in patients with stenosis of subclavian
      artery proximal to orifice of vertebral artery(V0). However, uremic patients undergoing
      hemodialysis using vascular access in the arm or forearm may also develop dialysis associated
      steal syndrome(DASS).For patients with symptomatic subclavian steal phenomenon, the treatment
      for these two groups is different. The investigators want to see if the investigators can use
      noninvasive duplex examination instead of invasive conventional angiography to do the
      differential diagnosis.

    <textblock>
      Carotid duplex is widely used for diagnosis of subclavian steal syndrome. We have a patient
      who suffered from acute brain stem stroke after receiving hemodialysis for months. He has DM
      related uremia and the vascular access is in the forearm. Subclavian steal was found on
      duplex in the same arm for hemodialysis. We used standard cuff test for diagnosis of
      subclavian steal by carotid duplex examination. Accidentally, we found the flow of subclavian
      artery was back to normal when the cuff is on that stops the flow. We want to see if this
      phenomenon can be used to serve as a differential diagnostic tool for differentiation of
      subclavian steal caused by stenosis of subclavian artery or due to DASS.
