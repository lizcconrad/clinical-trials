      This study aimed to develop Video Compact Disc (VCD) program that applying the concept of
      imitative learning with mirror neurons stimulation on standard rehabilitation technique in
      children with cerebral palsy. The author will also examine effectiveness of the program by
      compare the motor function measured by the gross motor function measure (GMFM-66) between
      conventional physical therapy and the mirror neurons stimulation based VCD program for six
      months.

      A randomized controlled trial was performed with thirty children with cerebral palsy
      recruited from Thammasat University Hospital and Rajanukul institute. Informed consent was
      obtained from the participants' parents before participation in this study. The participants
      were randomly assigned according to the randomization list to receive either the mirror
      neurons stimulation based VCD program and practice at home or conventional physical therapy
      for six months. The participants in the experiment group received the mirror neurons
      stimulation based VCD program and practice at home three times a day for six months.
      Concerning the control group, the participants received conventional physical therapy
      regularly at the hospital once a week for first two months and twice a month for last four
      months. Both experimental and control groups were measured their motor functions with gross
      motor function measure (GMFM-66).

    <time_frame>Base line, two months and six months</time_frame>
    <description>The mean total score of GMFM-66 of each group at entry, the second and the sixth month. The GMFM-66 contains five dimensions of motor measure including lying/rolling (4 items), sitting (15 items), crawling/kneeling (10 items), standing (13 items), and walking/running/jumping (24 items). The GMFM-66 are scored on a 4-point ordinal scale 0=does not initiate, 1=initiates &lt; 10% of activity,2=partially completes 10% to &lt; 100% of activity,3=completes activity). The scores were converted to a continuous scale by using the Winsteps Rasch Software.The GMFM-66 score is an interval-level measure of function where subjects are placed on an ability continuum ranging from 0 (low motor ability) to 100 (high motor ability). GMFM-66 score less than 30 that are considered low gross motor skills.</description>

The running time of each volume is 30 minutes. The children had been practicing for two weeks per volume. Their parents were trained for practicing their children by VCD program at home and were asked to complete daily record of children's activities.

Their parents were trained for practicing their children by VCD program at home and were asked to complete daily record of children's activities. The children were scheduled to meet a pediatric physical therapist once a week to monitor possible side effects.</description>

          <title>The Gross Motor Function Measure (GMFM-66) Score at Entry, the Second and the Sixth Month.</title>
          <description>The mean total score of GMFM-66 of each group at entry, the second and the sixth month. The GMFM-66 contains five dimensions of motor measure including lying/rolling (4 items), sitting (15 items), crawling/kneeling (10 items), standing (13 items), and walking/running/jumping (24 items). The GMFM-66 are scored on a 4-point ordinal scale 0=does not initiate, 1=initiates &lt; 10% of activity,2=partially completes 10% to &lt; 100% of activity,3=completes activity). The scores were converted to a continuous scale by using the Winsteps Rasch Software.The GMFM-66 score is an interval-level measure of function where subjects are placed on an ability continuum ranging from 0 (low motor ability) to 100 (high motor ability). GMFM-66 score less than 30 that are considered low gross motor skills.</description>
