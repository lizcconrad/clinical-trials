        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Biopsy proven NASH

          2. If suffering from diabetes may be treated by up to 2 oral medications, with stable
             doses for 2 months.

          3. If participating in sexual activity that could lead to pregnancy, the study volunteer
             must agree that two reliable methods of contraception will be used simultaneously
             while receiving the protocol-specified medication and for 1 month after stopping the

             NOTE: Hormonal-based methods alone are not sufficient. At least two of the following
             methods MUST be used appropriately unless documentation of menopause, sterilization,
             or azoospermia is present:

               -  Condoms (male or female) with or without a spermicidal agent. - Condoms are
                  recommended because their appropriate use is the only contraception method
                  effective for preventing HIV transmission

               -  Diaphragm or cervical cap with spermicide

               -  IUD

               -  Hormonal-based contraception

             Study subjects who are not of reproductive potential (girls who have not reached
             menarche or women who have been post-menopausal for at least 24 consecutive months or
             have undergone hysterectomy and/or bilateral oophorectomy are eligible without
             requiring the use of contraceptives. Written or oral documentation communicated by
             clinician or clinician's staff is required by one of the following:

               -  Physician report/letter

               -  Operative report or other source documentation in the patient record (a
                  laboratory report of azoospermia is required to document successful vasectomy)

               -  Discharge summary

               -  Laboratory report of azoospermia

               -  FSH measurement elevated into the menopausal range as established by the
                  reporting laboratory.

          4. Ability and willingness of subject or legal guardian/representative to provide
             informed consent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Pregnancy or Breast-Feeding

          2. Continuous use of the following medications for more than 3 days within 30 days of
             study entry:

               -  Immunosuppressives

               -  Immune modulators

               -  Systemic glucocorticoids

               -  Anti-neoplastic agents

          3. Active drug or alcohol use or dependence that, in the opinion of the site
             investigator, would interfere with adherence to study requirements.

          4. Serious illness requiring systemic treatment and/or hospitalization within 30 days
             prior to entry.

          5. Surgery within the previous 3 months.

          6. Any serious infectious, cardiac, pulmonary, or kidney disease

          7. Hypersensitivity to Femarelle ®

          8. Malignancy of the uterus or breast

          9. Past thromboembolic event
