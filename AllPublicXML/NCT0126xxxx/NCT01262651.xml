      This 9-week, multi-center, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study aimed to
      determine the efficacy, safety and tolerability of nabiximols, administered as an adjunctive
      treatment for 5 weeks, versus placebo. Eligible participants had advanced cancer, with a
      clinical diagnosis of cancer related pain which was not wholly alleviated by their current
      optimized opioid treatment.

      Qualifying participants entered the study at screening and commenced a 5 to 14 day
      eligibility period. During this period, eligible participants had 3 consecutive days where
      pain severity remained within defined parameters, break-through opioid usage had not exceeded
      an average of 4 episodes per day, and maintenance opioid medication and dose had not changed.
      Eligible participants returned for randomization on Day 1 and were randomized to either the
      nabiximols or placebo treatment arm using a 1:1 allocation ratio. Participants began an
      initial titration period that lasted up to 14 days. The titration schedule required dosing to
      a minimum of 3 sprays per day, after which participants were allowed to individualize their
      dose (3 to 10 sprays per day) until Day 14 when that dose was then fixed for the remainder of
      the study. Participants returned at Day 22 and Day 36 (end of the randomized treatment
      period), or earlier if they terminated prematurely from the study. After the end of the
      5-week treatment period, participants were offered the option of entering an open-label
      extension (OLE) study; a safety follow up visit (up to Day 43) was not required if the
      participant entered the OLE on Day 36. Participants who entered the OLE, up to 7 days after
      study completion had their follow-up assessments performed on the same day as their first OLE
      study visit. Participants that did not enter the OLE study had a safety follow up visit 14
      days after treatment completion, which could be via telephone.

    <measure>Percent Improvement From Baseline In Mean NRS Average Pain At End Of Treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, End of Treatment (Day 36)</time_frame>
    <description>Participants indicated level of pain in the last 24 hours on an 11-point Numerical Rating Scale (NRS), where a score of 0 was &quot;no pain&quot; and 10 was &quot;pain as bad as you can imagine&quot;. Baseline = mean score from first day of 3-day eligibility period through to the day before first dose of study drug. End of Treatment = mean score over last (up to) 7 days to the final pain score at End of Treatment or up until Day 35, whichever is earlier, or final score available (prematurely terminated).
Percentage improvement from baseline (Imp%) was calculated as:
Imp% = (Baseline pain NRS mean - End of Treatment pain NRS mean)/Baseline pain NRS mean * 100.
For participants who died or withdrew due to disease progression, Imp% values were used. For participants who died or withdrew unrelated to disease progression before end of Week 5 (no diary data from Day 33 onwards), Imp% was zero for participants whose Imp% value was positive and it was Imp% for participants whose Imp% value was not positive.</description>

    <participant_flow>
      <pre_assignment_details>Per the Statistical Analyses Plan, all randomized participants who received at least 1 dose of study drug were analyzed in the Intent-to-Treat (ITT) population as per randomized treatment group. However, if a participant randomized to placebo ever took a nabiximols dose, the participant was analyzed as nabiximols-treated in the Safety population.</pre_assignment_details>

        <group group_id="P1">
          <title>Nabiximols</title>
          <description>Nabiximols was self-administered by participants as a 100 microliter (μL) oromucosal spray in the morning and evening, up to a maximum of 10 sprays per day, for 5 weeks. Nabiximols oromucosal spray contained delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) (27 milligram [mg]/milliliter [mL]):cannabidiol (CBD) (25 mg/mL), in ethanol:propylene glycol (50:50) excipients, with peppermint oil (0.05%) flavoring. Each 100 μL actuation delivered 2.7 mg THC and 2.5 mg CBD.</description>

        <title>Percent Improvement From Baseline In Mean NRS Average Pain At End Of Treatment</title>
        <description>Participants indicated level of pain in the last 24 hours on an 11-point Numerical Rating Scale (NRS), where a score of 0 was “no pain” and 10 was “pain as bad as you can imagine”. Baseline = mean score from first day of 3-day eligibility period through to the day before first dose of study drug. End of Treatment = mean score over last (up to) 7 days to the final pain score at End of Treatment or up until Day 35, whichever is earlier, or final score available (prematurely terminated).
Percentage improvement from baseline (Imp%) was calculated as:
Imp% = (Baseline pain NRS mean - End of Treatment pain NRS mean)/Baseline pain NRS mean * 100.
For participants who died or withdrew due to disease progression, Imp% values were used. For participants who died or withdrew unrelated to disease progression before end of Week 5 (no diary data from Day 33 onwards), Imp% was zero for participants whose Imp% value was positive and it was Imp% for participants whose Imp% value was not positive.</description>

        <title>Subject Global Impression Of Change At Last Visit (Up To Day 36)</title>
        <description>The Subject Global Impression of Change (SGIC) was used to assess the overall status of the participant related to their cancer pain, with the markers “very much improved, much improved, slightly improved, no change, slightly worse, much worse, or very much worse”. The SGIC was assessed at Day 36 or at which a participant’s last evaluation was performed, such as in the case of early termination. Last visit refers to the last visit that a participant completed the assessment; this could be either Day 22 or Day 36.</description>
