    <textblock>
      The purpose is to evaluate the effectiveness of a physiotherapy program for chronic low back
      pain. We'll randomize more about 35 patients in two groups. Both groups will receive an 8
      physioterapy intervention in 4 weeks, in particular the first group (study) will receive 4
      Fascial Manipulation treatment combined with 4 session of a standard approach (mobilization
      and stretching exercises); whereas the second (control) will receive only the standard
      approach.

      All patients were assessed and randomised by a physician. The control group intervention
      concerned of: relaxation of lumbar and respiration muscles, stretching for posterior muscular
      chain and hip flexors, assisted/active mobilization of lumbar region in sagittal plane and
      rotation, exercises to improve proprioception of lumbar spine, active and progressive
      movement of lumbar spine in anterior flexion, extension, lateroflexion and rotation, active
      exercise for lumbar stabilizers muscles, occupational training for activity of daily living,
      indications and recommendations for correct postures. The study group intervention received 4
      manual intervention on deep fascial tissues, according to fascial manipulation tecnique,
      providing a specific motor and manual assessment, and a deep manual intervention over
      specific fascial alteration.
