  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The patients who admit to emergency department with upper gastrointestinal system bleeding
      will undergo a clinical evaluation with Rockall Risk Scoring System. The patients with
      Rockall score of 1 or less will be discharged with medical treatment, and will have an
      elective upper gastrointestinal endoscopy in the end of the 30th day. The impact of Rockall
      Risk Scoring System on assessing the necessity of emergency endoscopy, length of hospital
      stay, morbidity, and mortality in low-risk patients will be evaluated.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The patients who admit to emergency department with symptoms of upper gastrointestinal system
      bleeding will undergo a clinical evaluation. First, diagnosis of upper gastrointestinal
      system bleeding will be established by combined physical examination and nasogastric tube
      application. After a certain diagnosis, all of the patients will be scored according to
      Rockall Risk Scoring System. The patients with a 1 or less Rockall score will have
      conservative treatment including mucosal protective agent (sucralfat), proton pump inhibitors
      (omeprazole, lansoprazole, pantoprazole), and hemodynamic monitorization. Should Rockall
      score and hemodynamic parameters remain unchanged or get improved in the end of 6 hours after
      admission, oral feeding will be started and the patient will be discharged with anti-ulcer
      medication (mucosal protective agent and proton pump inhibitor, PO). These patients will be
      scheduled for upper gastrointestinal endoscopy at 30th day. The patients who have: an initial
      Rockall score of 2 or greater, an increase in Rockall score or deterioration in hemodynamic
      parameters during observation, will have emergency endoscopy and will be excluded from the
      study.
