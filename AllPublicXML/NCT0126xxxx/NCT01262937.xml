  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of the project is to determine whether confocal endomicroscopy can be used to
      identify and discriminate among dysplastic, neoplastic, and nonneoplastic tissue, as compared
      with histologic specimens as a reference. The project will evaluate those at risk for or with
      known Barrett's esophagus, and those with known or suspected biliary strictures. It is our
      hypothesis that we will be able to identify between neoplastic and nonneoplastic tissue.

      This study was amended from it's initial design to increase the number of patients to 200.
      The study was terminated in July 2016 after 106 patients were enrolled and had completed the
      study.
