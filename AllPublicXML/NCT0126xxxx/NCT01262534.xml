  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the clinical profile of patients with moderate to
      severe psoriasis in Spain. The primary objective is to analyze the clinical profile of
      patients with moderate to severe psoriasis, as defined by a set of conditions (obesity,
      hypertension, diabetes, abnormal amounts of lipids in the blood, cardiovascular disease,
      etc.) and its correlation to the patients' quality of life. The secondary objectives are to
      describe the demographic characteristics and habits of the patient, to evaluate the clinical
      characteristics of the disease, and to describe the diagnostic and therapeutic procedures
      being used in standard clinical practice and the patients' expectations for these therapies.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an epidemiological, non-interventional, multi-centre, cross-sectional, retrospective,
      observational study to assess the clinical profile of patients with moderate to severe
      psoriasis in Spain. The data for each patient will be recorded only once, in one visit.
      During this visit the specialist will ask the patient a series of questions to describe the
      existence or absence of a number of conditions and their associated treatments, to record the
      characteristics of psoriasis experienced by the patient and the type of associated treatment.
