  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Human papillomavirus (HPV-16) is an important factor in the development of many tonsil and/or
      base of tongue squamous cell cancers. Although HPV-16 is not thought to cause cancer by
      itself, it appears to contribute to the development of tonsil and/or base of tongue cancer in
      many patients. It is likely that treatment for many patients with tonsil and/or base of
      tongue cancer could be improved if effective therapy to control HPV-16 is developed. The
      investigators in this study want to learn if ribavirin shows evidence of activity against
      HPV-16.

      Ribavirin is a pill therapy that is approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as
      part of the standard treatment for Hepatitis C. Laboratory experiments suggest that ribavirin
      might also be useful in the treatment of head and neck cancers. However, ribavirin has not
      yet been tested against head and neck cancer in patients. The purpose of this study is to
      find out the effects of ribavirin on tonsil and base tongue squamous cell cancer in patients.

      The main purpose of this study is to see if ribavirin changes the expression of certain
      proteins related to HPV infection in the tumor. The study will also find out if ribavirin
      changes how the tumor appears in a PET/CT scan (positron emission tomography/computed
      tomography scan).

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Prior diagnostic surgical or core needle biopsy, with confirmation of tonsil and/or
             base of tongue squamous cell carcinoma that is positive for expression of p16 and
             phosphorylated eIF4E, as determined by the Department of Pathology at MSKCC. The
             biopsy may be either of the tonsil base of tongue and/or an involved neck node. 2
             unstained slides and/or tissue block must be available from the initial diagnostic
             biopsy

          -  Positive expression p16 and phosphorylated eIF4E is defined as &gt;=30% of tumor cells
             with cytological and/or nuclear staining
