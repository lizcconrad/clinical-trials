    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the validity and reliability of the Thai version of
      the Confusion Assessment Method for the intensive care (CAM-ICU) in the elderly and the
      prevalence of delirium in elderly.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The incidence of delirium in intensive care unit varied between 20 and 80% depending on many
      factors such as types of study, diagnostic tools, severity of patients.The occurrence of
      delirium is common in elderly patients. However, the prevalence of delirium in the intensive
      care has not been reported in Thailand. There is no common tool used for detecting delirium
      in Thai ICU. Currently, CAM-ICU has been developed for nonpsychiatric physician and other
      health care professionals to detect delirium. The sensitivity and specificity of CAM-ICU was
      91-93% and 89-100% respectively. In addition, it has been translated to many version to
      diagnose deliriums for all over the world. In Thailand, there is no common tool used for
      detecting delirium in ICU. The use of CAM-ICU may be useful in Thai ICU settings.
