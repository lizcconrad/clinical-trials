  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Toothache is a common source of pain for Emergency Department patients. There are several
      common ways to control the pain of toothache. But we do not know if any one of them is more
      effective than another. It is also possible that how we take care of your pain in the
      Emergency Department will influence the level of pain you experience one or two days from
      now. This study seeks to answer these questions.
