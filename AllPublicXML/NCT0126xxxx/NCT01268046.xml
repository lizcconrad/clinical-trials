      This study will focus on how aging affects changes in the way the brain works when affected
      by estrogen in areas of the brain associated with memory.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The broad goal of this proposal is to determine the effect of aging on areas of the brain
      whose function is impacted by gonadal steroids in women. The overarching hypothesis is that
      aging differentially alters the effects of estrogen on the brain. Our preliminary data
      indicate that aging alters the effect of estrogen on brain regions involved in cognition and
      thus, the current proposal will focus on the impact of aging on functional changes induced by
      estrogen in cortical and subcortical areas associated with verbal working memory and
      declarative/episodic memory. As our model, we will use women in whom the absence of gonadal
      function makes it possible to control the duration and amount of estrogen exposure,
      specifically postmenopausal women who are younger (45-55) or older (65-80). We will
      investigate the effects of both short-term (48 hr) and prolonged (28-30 days) estrogen
      exposure to determine whether the changes in brain regions involved in cognition that were
      seen with short-term estrogen exposure persist with prolonged exposure, a finding that would
      have enormous clinical relevance. These studies, using sophisticated neuroimaging tools
      (structural and functional magnetic resonance imaging [MRI] and [18F]
      2-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose positron emission tomography [FDG-PET]), provide a unique window
      into the brain in the human.
