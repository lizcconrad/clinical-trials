    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to measure how much of the study drugs reach the blood stream
      and how long it takes the body to get rid of them, and determine how clopidogrel and
      LY2216684 might affect each other in the body. Information about any side effects that may
      occur will also be collected.
