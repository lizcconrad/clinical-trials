  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Primary objective of the PAPPHY Study is to establish the prevalence of primary aldosteronism
      (PA) in consecutive hypertensive patients hospitalized for lone (non valvular), paroxysmal,
      persistent or permanent atrial flutter or fibrillation (AFF).

      Secondary objectives are to identify:

        1. the clinical, echocardiographic and biochemical predictors of AFF in the hypertensive
           patients with/without PA;

        2. if AFF, by increasing ANP and/o BNP thereby conceivably blunting aldosterone secretion,
           can lower the ARR and impede PA detection.

        3. the usefulness of the aldosterone-to-renin ratio (ARR) based on plasma renin activity
           (PRA) and the direct measurement of renin (DRA) for diagnosing PA in patients with AFF.

        4. the rate of recurrence or new onset AFF during follow-up in a cohort of hypertensive
           patients with/without PA as a function of specific treatment for the latter.

      Design: cohort multicenter prospective study. Sample size: 1000 consecutive patients.

      Procedure At baseline cardiac function, arterial stiffness, and plasma renin activity (PRA),
      direct renin assay (DRA), plasma aldosterone (PAC) will be measured. Pharmacologic or direct
      current cardioversion (DCC) will be performed if indicated according to 2010 ESC guidelines.

      PRA and PAC will be measured again 2 weeks after cardioversion to answer secondary aim b.

      If ARR is &gt; 26 and PAC &gt; 15 ng/dL, adrenal vein sampling (AVS) will be performed in patients
      willing to undergo adrenalectomy to identify a lateralized PAC excess.

      Follow-up will be aimed at assessing damage organ, occurrence of cardiovascular events and
      recurrence of AFF in patients with or without PA.

      Demonstration of a higher prevalence of PA in the patients with AFF as compared to the
      general population of the hypertensive subjects will provide evidence for 1) a role of
      aldosterone excess in causing AFF and cardiac electric remodeling; 2) the usefulness of case
      detection of PA in hypertensive patients with AFF; 3) the predictors of AFF; 4) the outcome
      of specific treatment for PA on risk of incident and recurrent AFF.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A previous retrospective study documented a 12-fold increase of the risk of AFF in patients
      with primary aldosteronism (PA) as compared to subjects with primary (essential) hypertension
      (Milliez 2005). However, being retrospective this investigation could involve a selection
      bias and therefore is to be regarded as hypothesis-generating rather than a proof-of-concept
      study.

      Hence, based on results of experimental studies, we hypothesize that in a proportion of
      hypertensive patients presenting with lone (non valvular) PA could be the underlying cause of
      hypertension leading to AFF. If proven, this hypothesis would imply that an early diagnosis
      of PA might not only cure PA and hypertension but also prevent AFF in a non negligible number
      of hypertensive patients.

      Primary objective is to establish the prevalence of PA in consecutive hypertensive patients
      hospitalized for lone (non valvular), paroxysmal, persistent or permanent AFF.

      Secondary objectives are to identify:

        1. the clinical, echocardiographic, and biochemical predictors of AFF in the hypertensive
           patients with/without PA;

        2. if AFF by increasing ANP and/or BNP, and thereby conceivably blunting aldosterone
           secretion, can lower the ARR and impede detection of PA;

        3. the usefulness of the aldosterone-to-renin ratio (ARR) based on either plasma renin
           activity (PRA) or the direct measurement of active renin (DRA) for diagnosing PA in
           patients with AFF;

        4. prospectively the rate of recurrence of AFF during follow-up in a cohort of hypertensive
           patients with/without PA after correction of PA with adrenalectomy or mineralocorticoid
           receptor antagonists and after pharmacological treatment of essential hypertension.

      Study design: Prospective multicenter cohort study. Enrolment Sites: Internal Medicine,
      Cardiology, Endocrinology located all over Europe. These centers constitute the network of
      the PAPY (Primary Aldosteronism Prevalence in Hypertension) Study and the ENS@T (European
      Network for the Study of Adrenal Tumors).

      Sample size:

      Based on the PAPY study experience and on available data from the literature concerning
      prevalence studies, we anticipated that the enrolment of at least 1000 consecutive patients
      will give conclusive evidence on PA prevalence in AFF patients.

      Data analysis. Data will be collected using a specific software; the database will be
      securely stored and analyzed at the core laboratory of the Clinica Medica 4-DMCS in Padova,
      Italy.

      Experimental Procedures.

      Baseline visit (visit 1)

        -  Clinic evaluation of the patient;

        -  Collection of demographic data and history;

        -  Measurement of blood pressure and heart rate;

        -  Scanning and storage of ECG documenting AFF;

        -  Echocardiography for measurement of left atrial and aortic diameters, left ventricular
           thickness and diameters, systolic and diastolic and transmitral Doppler flow velocity
           indexes;

        -  Measurement of pulse wave velocity and ankle-brachial index with EcoDoppler for the
           assessment of regional arterial stiffness;

        -  Clinical chemistry including serum ions, s-Creatinine, GFR calculated with MDRD formula,
           HbA1c, microalbuminuria, S-proBNP, ANP, TSH, and SNP identification;

        -  Measurement of PRA and plasma aldosterone concentration (PAC), under baseline and after
           captopril challenge, if the patient is not assuming drugs interfering with the renin
           angiotensin system and eventually after correction of hypokalemia;

        -  Cardioversion according to 2010 ESC guidelines. In patients assuming drugs interfering
           with the renin angiotensin-aldosterone system, such drugs will be withdrawn and therapy
           with verapamil, or diltiazem, or amiodarone will be started for heart rate control. α2
           agonists will be added, if necessary, to achieve BP control.

      Visit 2. If not performed at visit 1, PRA, DRA and PAC will be measured under both basal
      conditions and after the captopril challenge.

      Visit 3. Two weeks after cardioversion, PRA, DRA and plasma aldosterone will be measured at
      baseline and after captopril challenge to calculate the ARR-P and ARR-D. If baseline ARR-P &gt;
      26 and PAC &gt; 15 ng/dL, either before and/or after cardioversion, imaging of the adrenal gland
      with CT will be performed to exclude an adrenocortical carcinoma. The patients who are
      plausible candidates for general anesthesia and are willing to undergo adrenalectomy in case
      of detection of lateralized excess aldosterone production, will be offered AVS. If patients
      do no satisfy these criteria they will receive spironolactone or potassium canrenoate, alone
      or in combination with other antihypertensive medications as appropriate, in order to achieve
      target BP for their level of risk.

      If ARR-P &lt; 20 and PAC &gt; 15 ng/dL under basal conditions, PA may be excluded and the patient
      will enter follow-up with no further investigation.

      Visit 4. AVS will be used for diagnosis only if bilaterally selective (Selectivity Index &gt;
      1.1) and lateralization will be diagnosed if Lateralization Index &gt; 2. In case of lateralized
      excess aldosterone production, adrenalectomy will be planned.

      Follow-Up. Follow-up will be aimed at assessing damage organ, occurrence of cardiovascular
      events, including recurrence of AFF in patients with or without PA. Visits will be scheduled
      every 6 months for 2 years. BP, HR and biochemical parameters will be measured, and EKG and
      echocardiography will be recorded.
