  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The obesity epidemic has reached down into the infant and toddler age group. Dietary
      indiscretion during pregnancy, particularly in our current food environment, is a major risk
      factor for both gestational diabetes and neonatal macrosomia (&gt;4kg newborns), which is itself
      a risk factor for obesity and metabolic syndrome in the offspring, possibly even during
      childhood. Temporal increases in fructose consumption in the last two decades coincide with
      temporal increases weight gain during pregnancy and with increased birth weight, including a
      higher prevalence of macrosomic newborns. Our central hypothesis is that higher fructose
      consumption during pregnancy is a risk factor for infant obesity and metabolic syndrome.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The &quot;fetal origins hypothesis&quot; suggests that an individual's risk for obesity and metabolic
      disorders begins in utero; that fetal or early postnatal exposure to environmental factors,
      such as maternal nutrition or endocrine disrupting chemicals, adversely influences early
      development and results in permanent changes affecting energy storage and expenditure.

      Most studies on &quot;fetal origins&quot; of obesity in the offspring have focused on maternal high-fat
      diets; yet dietary fat consumption has not changed appreciably in the last two decades. One
      chemical exposure in both pregnant mothers and newborns that has been steadily increasing
      worldwide is fructose. Although ostensibly a carbohydrate, fructose is a potent lipogenic
      substrate, and in the hypercaloric state, as much as 30% of an ingested fructose load
      undergoes de novo lipogenesis to form triglyceride thus the effects of high-fat and
      high-fructose diets in terms of physiology and outcome are comparable. Substituting sucrose
      (fructose + glucose) for glucose alone increases visceral adiposity, insulin resistance, and
      dyslipidemia in adult animals and humans. For humans, fructose is ubiquitous in the food
      environment, especially for pregnant mothers, who are often counseled to drink juice during
      pregnancy, as it is deemed to be healthier than soda. The effects of fructose consumption
      during pregnancy on infant birth weight and adiposity has not yet been studied.
