      The purpose of this study is to investigate the safety, tolerability and immunogenicity of
      ascending doses of a novel, universal flu vaccine, in healthy volunteers.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      FP-01.1 is composed of a mixture of synthetic peptides, modified with a fluorocarbon vector,
      which is anticipated to enhance the immune properties of the drug, and allows differentiation
      from recent investigational interventions by avoiding the use of adjuvant. The peptide
      sequences, derived from internal influenza-A proteins, were selected based on the presence of
      CD4+ and CD8+ T cell epitopes and a high degree of conservation across all influenza strains,
      using a proprietary bioinformatics approach, and, it is proposed, will enable FP-01.1 to
      universally treat influenza-A -infected populations.

      This study is the initial exploration of the safety, tolerability and immunogenicity response
      of FP-01.1 in healthy volunteers. Ascending doses of FP-01.1 will be assessed.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Age 18 to 55 years inclusive at the time of consent

          2. Male and female subjects who are willing to comply with the applicable contraceptive
             requirements of the protocol

          3. Satisfactory medical assessment with no clinically significant or relevant
             abnormalities in medical history, physical examination, vital signs, ECG and
             laboratory evaluation (haematology, biochemistry or urinalysis) as assessed by the
             Investigator.

          4. Ability to provide written, personally signed and dated informed consent to
             participate in the study.

          5. The subject has a body mass index within the range 19.0-32.0 kg/m2 and falls within
             the weight range of 50.0-100.0 kg.

          6. Subject is willing to refrain from consuming alcohol for 24h prior to all visits.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. As a result of the medical screening process, the Principal Investigator or
             Co-Investigator considers the subject unfit for the study.

          2. Current or recurrent disease (e.g. cardiovascular, respiratory, endocrine, renal,
             liver, gastrointestinal, autoimmune, immune suppression, malignancy or other
             conditions) that could affect the action, absorption or disposition of the
             investigational medicinal product (IMP) or could affect clinical or laboratory
             assessments.

          3. Significant illness as judged by the Principal Investigator or Co-Investigator within
             2 weeks of the first dose of IMP.

          4. Subjects with a history of allergies or allergic conditions including asthmatics, hay
             fever and eczema sufferers requiring medication which in the opinion of the Principal
             Investigator or Co-Investigator will affect their participation in the study.

          5. Concurrent use of any medication (including prescription, over the counter, herbal or
             homeopathic preparations and any vaccinations (including travel vaccinations).

             injection site local reactions.

             or intention to donate blood during the entire study.

         12. Use of another investigational medicinal product within 90 days prior to receiving the
             first dose of IMP or intention to enrol in another clinical study throughout the
             entire study including the follow up period.
