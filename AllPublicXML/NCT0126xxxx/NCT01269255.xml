      A Phase I trial of Induction chemotherapy and Chemoradiotherapy with TS-1 and Cisplatin (SP)
      as first-line treatment in patients with high risk advanced gastric cancer. Drugs used in
      chemotherapy work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the
      cells or by stopping them from dividing. Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to kill
      tumor cells. Giving chemotherapy before surgery may make the tumor smaller and reduce the
      amount of normal tissue that needs to be removed. Radiation therapy was effectively used in
      esophageal cancer, laryngeal cancer and rectal cancer, but gastric cancer are rarely studied
      in Korea. There is an increasing interest in preoperative radiotherapy in effort to improve
      survival and increase pathologic complete response in patients with gastric cancer.
      Chemoradiotherapy may be the best modality in the neoadjuvant setting for high-risk advanced
      tumors, such as type IV or large type III, N3/bulky N2 metastasis, or locally advanced
      tumors.
