    <textblock>
      Targeted therapies such as multi-targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) and mammalian
      target of rapamycin inhibitors (mTORI) in renal cell carcinoma (RCC), demonstrate a high
      level of efficacy with acceptable tolerability. Currently, there are five approved targeted
      therapies available for RCC: sunitinib (Sutent®), sorafenib (Nexavar®), pazopanib
      (Votrient®), temsirolimus (Torisel®), and everolimus (Afinitor®). Hepatocellular carcinoma
      treated with sorafenib and gastro intestinal stromal tumors patients treated with sunitinib
      will be included, too.

      Since this agents have dermatological adverse events in common, with oral mucositis (OM),
      hand-foot skin reaction (HFSR) and papulopustular eruption (PPE) as an disabling side effect,
      we require evidence based management options to prevent and treat these adverse events. The
      incidence of OM of any grade is for sunitinib 38%, sorafenib 28%, pazopanib 4%, temsirolimus
      41%, and everolimus 44%. Recent data suggest that TKI and mTORI associated OM is distinct
      from conventional mucositis and more closely resembles aphthous OM.

      Recently, supersaturated calcium-phosphate rinse (Caphosol®), a Ca2+/PO43- mouth rinse,
      became available to prevent or treat OM.

      The objective is to assess the relieving effect of Caphosol® oral rinse on clinical outcomes
      which include oral intake, swallowing function and pain associated with incidence of grade ≥
      1 oral side effects and the anticancer therapy cessation in patients treated with selected
      targeted anticancer therapy.

      Patients with OM &gt; grade 0 on targeted therapy will be randomly allocated to receive either
      Caphosol® or NaCl 0.9% rinse for two weeks. After the first rinse period all patients will
      switch to the opposite treatment arm (NaCl 0.9% or Caphosol®) for another two weeks. Duration
      of oral side effects, severity, pain, dose of analgesics and tolerability will be assessed
      weekly with the Modified-VHNSS-version-2.0 oral-specific questionnaire. Patients will be
      stratified by targeted anticancer agent and per tumor type (pre-defined cohorts). Objective
      severity of oral side effects will be assessed using the NCI-CTCAE v4.0. Correlation of
      subjective Modified-VHNSS-version-2.0 scores with the objective NCI-CTCAE grade, sex, age,
      targeted therapy type, and cancer type will be conducted.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      OM with mucosal change, associated pain, and taste change - are clinically relevant
      toxicities of TKI's and mTORI's presently in use. The incidence of oral mucositis of any
      grade is for sunitinib 38%, sorafenib 28%, pazopanib 4%, temsirolimus 41%, and for everolimus
      44%.

      Optimal antitumor activity requires maintaining the highest tolerable dose in individual
      patients. In order to improve health related quality of life (HRQoL) and patient adherence,
      adverse effects should be prevented, if possible avoided and treated if necessary. Current
      oral formulations consist of various schedules (continuous administration or 4 weeks on, 2
      weeks off) to optimize the benefit-risk profile. Adherence to anti-cancer treatment is
      particularly important when prescribing oral therapies as adherence to the protocol can have
      a significant impact on efficacy and the severity of treatment-related AEs. As sorafenib,
      sunitinib, pazopanib, and everolimus are taken in the outpatient setting, patient education
      on the correct treatment dosing, usage and the nature, recognition, and severity of AEs is
      essential.

      Recent data suggest that TKI and mTORI associated OM is different from conventional
      chemotherapy related OM. Oral ulceration usually presents as aphthous-like ulcerations and
      has in some studies been reported as mucositis. An analysis of the appearance, course, and
      toxicity experiences demonstrated that the condition is distinct from conventional mucositis
      and more closely resembles aphthous oral mucositis. These TKI/mTORI related ulcers may
      represent a dose-limiting toxicity for this new class of agents, especially considering the
      fact that even lower grade mucositis with chronic daily dosing may be cumbersome to the
      patient and lead to dose reductions. Studies of treatment strategies for aphthous OM may
      therefore be important for the dose adherence of TKI and mTORI and for the overall acceptance
      of this therapy for patients.
