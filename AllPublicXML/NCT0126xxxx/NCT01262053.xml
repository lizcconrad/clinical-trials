      With the increased adoption of CPOE systems, it is important to recognize that design flaws
      have resulted in the creation of new types of iatrogenic medical errors. An example of a new
      type of iatrogenic medical error introduced by CPOE systems has been named &quot;juxtaposition
      errors&quot;. Juxtaposition errors, as defined by Ash, et al. are &quot;errors that can result when
      something is close to something else on the screen, and the wrong option is too easily
      clicked in error.&quot; Juxtaposition errors can lead to a patient receiving a medication, a test,
      or a treatment intended for another patient, sometimes with dire consequences. Juxtaposition
      errors are likely a subclass of a broader group of wrong-patient CPOE errors that have
      multiple etiologies.

      The primary objectives of this research proposal is to investigate the prevalence of
      wrong-patient near miss CPOE errors, to investigate the root cause of these errors, and to
      investigate and compare the efficacy and workflow impact of two distinct interventions to
      prevent these errors.

      Computerized Physician Order Entry (CPOE) systems have been shown to prevent medical errors,
      and have become a major component of the patient safety movement. To accelerate the adoption
      of clinical information technology including CPOE systems, the American Recovery and
      Reinvestment Act of 2009 allocated approximately $17 billion as incentive payments to
      providers and hospitals who implement health information technology. With the increased
      adoption of CPOE systems, however, it is important to recognize that design flaws have
      resulted in the creation of new types of iatrogenic medical errors. In addition, CPOE systems
      developed with suboptimal and onerous user interfaces have contributed to entire systems
      being rejected by physicians. The ideal CPOE system maximizes medical error reduction,
      minimizes medical error creation, and has a user friendly interface that is accepted by
      nurses, physicians, and pharmacists.

      An example of a new type of iatrogenic medical error introduced by CPOE systems has been
      named &quot;juxtaposition errors&quot; . Juxtaposition errors, as defined by Ash, et al. are &quot;errors
      that can result when something is close to something else on the screen, and the wrong option
      is too easily clicked in error.&quot; Juxtaposition errors can lead to a patient receiving a
      medication, a test, or a treatment intended for another patient, sometimes with dire
      consequences.

      Juxtaposition errors are likely a subclass of a broader group of wrong-patient CPOE errors
      that have multiple etiologies. Other possible causes of wrong-patient CPOE orders include
      interruption errors, or double-interruption errors.

      Primary Objectives:

        -  Specific Aim 1: Investigate the prevalence of wrong-patient near miss CPOE errors.

        -  Specific Aim 2: Investigate the root cause of wrong-patient near miss CPOE errors.

        -  Specific Aim 3: Investigate and compare the efficacy and workflow impact of two distinct
           interventions to prevent wrong-patient near miss CPOE errors against a control.

    <description>When a user is about to place orders on a patient, a pop up alert will show the user the name, age, sex, room number and MR# of the patient who is currently activated. The point of the alert is to display identification information about the patient as a double check for the provider to make sure he is on the correct patient. This alert will only occur once at the onset of each order session (i.e. the provider will not be alerted for every single order, but if the provider leaves the order pad and then returns, the alert will reoccur).</description>

    <description>The user will be required to enter the initials, age and sex of the activated patient prior to placing any orders. For example, for a patient named Donald Duck who is 76 years old and male, the user will be required to type &quot;dd76m&quot; to unlock the order pad. This step will NOT be required for every order, but WILL be required every time the user enters the order pad (i.e. if a user leaves the order pad and then returns, the system will require the initials, age and sex to be re-entered as above). This will be a forcing function.</description>
