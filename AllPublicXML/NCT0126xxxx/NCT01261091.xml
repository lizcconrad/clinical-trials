    <textblock>
      Patients with severe ischemic and hemorrhagic strokes, who require mechanical ventilation,
      have a particularly bad prognosis. If they require long-term ventilation, their orotracheal
      tube needs to be, like in any other intensive care patient, replaced by a shorter tracheal
      tube below the larynx. This so called tracheostomy might be associated with advantages such
      as less demand of narcotics and pain killers, less lesions in mouth and larynx, better mouth
      hygiene, safer airway, more patient comfort and earlier mobilisation. The best timepoint for
      tracheostomy in stroke, however, is not known. This study investigates the potential benefits
      of early tracheostomy in ventilated critically ill patients with ischemic or hemorrhagic
      stroke.

      Background: Tracheostomy is a common procedure in critical care patients. Advantages of a
      short tracheal tube compared to a long orotracheal one are the avoidance of laryngeal lesions
      and sinusitis, facilitation of nursing care and physiotherapy and the reduction of
      analgosedatives. The optimal point in time for tracheostomy is still unknown, but it is
      commonly done not later than 2-3 weeks and after one or several failed extubation trials.
      Studies in different sets of critical care patients have suggested additional advantages of
      early tracheostomy: less pneumonias and other complications, more patient comfort, less
      analgosedation, shorter duration of ventilation and of ICU stay. These questions have not
      been looked at in non-traumatic neurocritical care patients, although these might have a
      special weaning benefit by early tracheostomy, being mainly compromised in securing their
      airway, but not in breathing.

      Method: Non-traumatic Neurocritical care patients with ischemic strokes, intracerebral
      hemorrhage or subarachnoid hemorrhage so severly affected that 2 weeks of ventilation need
      are estimated, are principally eligible for the study. After randomization, one group
      receives tracheostomy within the first 3 days after intubation. The other group stays
      orotracheally intubated and is either weaned and extubated or receives tracheostomy within 7
      to 14 days after intubation. Tracheostomy is done as percutaneous dilatation by neurologists.
