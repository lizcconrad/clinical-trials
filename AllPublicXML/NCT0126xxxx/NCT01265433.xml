  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The doctors are testing a Wilms Tumor-1 (WT1) vaccine to see if it delays or prevents the
      mesothelioma from growing back after surgery. WT1 is a protein in cancer cells that regulates
      gene expression and causes cell growth. Mesothelioma tumors generally have high levels of
      WT1.This study was originally designed to have two treatment groups. One group received
      non-specific immunotherapy with medications called Montanide and Sargramostim (Granulocyte
      Macrophage Colony Stimulating Factor, GM-CSF). Enrollment to this group has stopped The other
      group, which continues receives more specific immunotherapy with the WT1 vaccine plus
      Montanide and GM-CSF. Both Montanide and GM-CSF are commonly given along with vaccines
      because they have a general effect in boosting the immune response. Some researchers believe
      that this general increase in the immune system may have some effect in treating cancer. Some
      studies using GM-CSF with melanoma vaccines have suggested that it could lessen the effects
      of the vaccine. The addition of the WT1 proteins makes this therapy more directed to
      mesothelioma. The combination of WT1 vaccine with Montanide and GM-CSF has been tested in a
      prior trial including 9 patients with advanced mesothelioma. In that trial, the vaccine was
      safe and caused an immune response.

    <description>Patients will receive 6 injections over 12 weeks. Treatment will be administered on weeks 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10. All patients will receive Sargramostim (GM-CSF) (70 mcg) injected subcutaneously on days 0 and -2 of each vaccination. Patients may self administer the Sargramostim (GM-CSF) on day -2 if they have been appropriately instructed on SQ injection administration. Patients will be informed of the expected reactions such as irritation at the injection site. Patients will keep a logbook noting the time and placement of the injection. Patients will also receive 1.0 ml of emulsion with Montanide alone or with WT-1 peptides plus Montanide. It will be administered by a nurse (it may not be self administered) subcutaneously to the same anatomical site as the GM-CSF. This site will be marked by the patient or treating healthcare professional by a permanent marker pen.</description>
