  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study was to evaluate the long-term safety and efficacy of alogliptin and
      an α-glucosidase inhibitor administered once daily (QD) or three times daily (TID) for 40
      consecutive weeks in participants who completed a phase 2/3 α-glucosidase inhibitor add on
      study.

    <textblock>
      Both insulin hyposecretion and insulin-resistance are considered to be involved in the
      development of type 2 diabetes mellitus.

      Takeda is developing SYR-322 (alogliptin) for the improvement of glycemic control in patients
      with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Alogliptin is an inhibitor of the dipeptidyl peptidase IV
      (DPP-IV) enzyme. DPP-IV is thought to be primarily responsible for the degradation of 2
      peptide hormones released in response to nutrient ingestion. It is expected that inhibition
      of DPP-IV will improve glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes.

      &quot;To evaluate the long-term safety and efficacy of alogliptin and an α-glucosidase inhibitor,
      this extension study was administered for 40 consecutive weeks (52 weeks from the start of
      treatment in the phase 2 dose-ranging study) to participants who completed a phase 2/3
      α-glucosidase inhibitor add on study 322/CCT-003 (NCT01263483).

    <description>A treatment-emergent adverse event (TEAE) is defined as an adverse event with an onset that occurs after receiving study drug and within 30 days after receiving the last dose of study drug. A TEAE may also be a pre-treatment adverse event or a concurrent medical condition diagnosed prior to the date of first dose of study drug, which increases in intensity after the start of dosing. Adverse events data with onset occurring more than 30 days after last dose of study drug (AE start date - last dose date &gt;30) will be listed, but not included in the summary tables below.</description>

A TEAE may also be a pre-treatment adverse event or a concurrent medical condition diagnosed prior to the date of first dose of study drug, which increases in intensity after the start of dosing. Adverse events data with onset occurring more than 30 days after last dose of study drug (AE start date - last dose date &gt;30) will be listed, but not included in the summary tables below.</description>

          <description>A treatment-emergent adverse event (TEAE) is defined as an adverse event with an onset that occurs after receiving study drug and within 30 days after receiving the last dose of study drug. A TEAE may also be a pre-treatment adverse event or a concurrent medical condition diagnosed prior to the date of first dose of study drug, which increases in intensity after the start of dosing. Adverse events data with onset occurring more than 30 days after last dose of study drug (AE start date - last dose date &gt;30) will be listed, but not included in the summary tables below.</description>
