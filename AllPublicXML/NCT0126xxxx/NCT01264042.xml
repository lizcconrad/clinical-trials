  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Although the essential role of iron during pregnancy is well established, concerns have been
      raised that current iron supplements given routinely during pregnancy may also have harmful
      consequences, such as increased oxidative stress and enhanced risks of infection,
      pre-eclampsia and impaired glucose regulation. A potential mechanism for the production of
      adverse effects is the appearance of non-transferrin-bound iron after oral administration of
      iron supplements. Non-transferrin-bound iron is more readily available to pathogens and could
      promote injurious free radical reactions that might add to the oxidative stress of pregnancy.

      The present study will determine if oral administration of 60 mg of iron as ferrous sulfate
      during the second trimester of pregnancy is followed by the appearance of
      non-transferrin-bound iron two hours later. The investigators will examine the influence of a
      variety of factors, including iron status and previous use of iron supplements. Detection of
      non-transferrin-bound iron after administration of an iron supplement to pregnant women would
      be an important new observation that could lead to re-evaluation of current methods of iron
      supplementation.
