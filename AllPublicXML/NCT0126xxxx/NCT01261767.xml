  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This trial is conducted in the United States of America (USA). The aim of this clinical trial
      is evaluate the safety and tolerability of anti-IL-20 in patients with psoriasis and to
      determine the preliminary efficacy in an expansion phase of this trial.

      This trial consists of 3 parts: A single dose (SD) dose-escalation phase for 16 weeks, a
      multiple dose (MD) dose-escalation phase for 22 weeks, and a MD expansion phase for 22 weeks.

      Initiation of the MD expansion phase will depend on results from the SD and MD
      dose-escalation phases and only if an acceptable safety profile is present. Subjects
      participating in the expansion phase are not allowed to have participated in the previous
      phases (SD and MD dose-escalation phases) of the trial.

  <overall_status>Terminated</overall_status>
  <why_stopped>
    Trial discontinued due to apparent lack of response in psoriasis measures. No safety concerns
    were present
