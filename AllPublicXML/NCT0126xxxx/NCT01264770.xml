  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to evaluate the improvements in signs and symptoms of rheumatoid
      arthritis (RA) for fostamatinib compared to placebo or adalimumab in patients who are
      Disease-Modifying anti-rheumatic drug (DMARD) naïve, DMARD intolerant or have had an
      inadequate response to DMARDs. The study will last for approximately six months

      Objectives: To collect and store, with appropriate consent , DNA samples for future
      exploratory research into genes/genetic variation that may influence response (ie,
      absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion, safety, tolerability and efficacy) to
      fostamatinib disodium and/or adalimumab; and/or susceptibility to, progression of and
      prognosis of RA

      The main study recruitment is complete, and sub study recruitment will continue until the
      target is reached, estimated to be June 2013

    <time_frame>Baseline and 24 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>SF-36: 36-item Short Form Health Survey, a measure of health-related QoL. Scores for 8 sub-domains (Physical Functioning, Role-Physical, Bodily Pain, General Health, Vitality, Social Function, Role-Emotional &amp; Mental Health) are derived &amp; normalised to a scale of 0-100. Physical &amp; Mental Component Scores (PCS &amp; MCS) are derived by multiplying each of these 8 scores by a constant, summing them &amp; standardising against a population with mean of 50, standard deviation of 10. Higher scores represent a better QoL. Mean changes from baseline score are presented at each visit as increases from baseline (defined as post-baseline minus baseline); larger changes indicate a better clinical condition. Non-responder imputation applied by carrying the baseline observation forward. ANCOVA = analysis of covariance, BID = twice daily, DMARD = disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drug, IR = inadequate response, LS = least squares, PO = orally, QD = once a day, QoL = quality of life, SC = subcutaneous.</description>

          <title>DAS28-CRP Score - Change From Baseline to Week 24 Compared to Adalimumab</title>
          <description>DAS28-CRP: Disease Activity Score based on a count of swollen and tender joints (out of 28 joints), blood test measures of inflammation (CRP) and the patient's own assessment. Scores can take any positive value with a lower value indicating a better clinical condition. Mean changes from baseline in DAS28-CRP score are shown at each visit and are presented as decreases from baseline (defined as baseline minus post-baseline) with larger changes indicative of a better clinical condition. Non-responder imputation has been applied by carrying the baseline observation forward. ANCOVA = analysis of covariance, BID = twice daily, CRP = C-reactive protein, DMARD = disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drug, IR = inadequate response, LS = least squares, n/a = not applicable, PO = orally, QD = once a day, SC = subcutaneous.</description>
          <population>The full analysis set includes those patients who received at least 1 dose of investigational product. Patients were analysed by randomised treatment in accordance with the intention to treat principle. In line with the study objectives, fostamatinib was compared with adalimumab (not placebo) at Week 24.</population>

          <description>ACR70: American College of Rheumatology 70% response criteria, based on count of swollen and tender joints (out of 28 joints), blood test measures of inflammation (such as CRP) and the physician and patient's own assessments of disease activity, pain and physical function. Non-responder imputation has been applied by carrying the baseline observation forward. BID = twice daily, CRP = C-reactive protein, DMARD = disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drug, IR = inadequate response, n/a = not applicable, PO = orally, qd = once a day, SC = subcutaneous.</description>
          <population>The full analysis set includes those patients who received at least 1 dose of investigational product. Patients were analysed by randomised treatment in accordance with the intention to treat principle. In line with the study objectives, fostamatinib was compared with placebo (not adalimumab) at Week 6 and with adalimumab (not placebo) at Week 24.</population>

        <description>HAQ-DI: Health Assessment Questionnaire - Disability Index, a measure of physical function. The HAQ-DI score is calculated by summing the category scores from 8 sub-categories (ie, scores for patient ability in dressing and grooming, rising, eating, walking, hygiene, reach, grip and common daily activities) and dividing by the number of categories completed. The HAQ-DI score takes values between 0 and 3, with a higher score indicating greater disability. Non-responder imputation has been applied by carrying the baseline observation forward.

          <title>HAQ-DI - Comparison of the Change From Baseline Between Fostamatinib and Adalimumab at Week 24</title>
          <description>HAQ-DI: Health Assessment Questionnaire - Disability Index, a measure of physical function. The HAQ-DI score is calculated by summing the category scores from 8 sub-categories (ie, scores for patient ability in dressing and grooming, rising, eating, walking, hygiene, reach, grip and common daily activities) and dividing by the number of categories completed. The HAQ-DI score takes values between 0 and 3, with a higher score indicating greater disability. Non-responder imputation has been applied by carrying the baseline observation forward. ANCOVA = analysis of covariance, BID = twice daily, DMARD = disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drug, IR = inadequate response, LS = least squares, n/a = not applicable, PO = orally, qd = once a day, SC = subcutaneous.</description>

        <description>SF-36: 36-item Short Form Health Survey, a measure of health-related QoL. Scores for 8 sub-domains (Physical Functioning, Role-Physical, Bodily Pain, General Health, Vitality, Social Function, Role-Emotional &amp; Mental Health) are derived &amp; normalised to a scale of 0-100. Physical &amp; Mental Component Scores (PCS &amp; MCS) are derived by multiplying each of these 8 scores by a constant, summing them &amp; standardising against a population with mean of 50, standard deviation of 10. Higher scores represent a better QoL. Mean changes from baseline score are presented at each visit as increases from baseline (defined as post-baseline minus baseline); larger changes indicate a better clinical condition. Non-responder imputation applied by carrying the baseline observation forward.

          <title>SF-36 - Comparison of the Change in MCS From Baseline Between Fostamatinib and Adalimumab at Week 24</title>
          <description>SF-36: 36-item Short Form Health Survey, a measure of health-related QoL. Scores for 8 sub-domains (Physical Functioning, Role-Physical, Bodily Pain, General Health, Vitality, Social Function, Role-Emotional &amp; Mental Health) are derived &amp; normalised to a scale of 0-100. Physical &amp; Mental Component Scores (PCS &amp; MCS) are derived by multiplying each of these 8 scores by a constant, summing them &amp; standardising against a population with mean of 50, standard deviation of 10. Higher scores represent a better QoL. Mean changes from baseline score are presented at each visit as increases from baseline (defined as post-baseline minus baseline); larger changes indicate a better clinical condition. Non-responder imputation applied by carrying the baseline observation forward. ANCOVA = analysis of covariance, BID = twice daily, DMARD = disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drug, IR = inadequate response, LS = least squares, PO = orally, QD = once a day, QoL = quality of life, SC = subcutaneous.</description>
          <population>The full analysis set includes those patients who received at least 1 dose of investigational product. Patients were analysed by randomised treatment in accordance with the intention to treat principle. In line with the study objectives, fostamatinib was compared with adalimumab (not placebo) at Week 24.</population>
