  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      New onset diabetes after transplantation (NODAT) is a frequent and feared complication after
      kidney transplantation and leads to an increase in cardiovascular complications as well as in
      the rate of graft loss. Very little data exist on how patients in which NODAT has been
      diagnosed should be treated. It is suspected that Cylosporine A (Sandimmun, TM) is less
      diabetogenic than Tacrolimus (Prograf, TM). Furthermore, it has been described that early
      initiation of insulin treatment in Diabetes mellitus type 2 can preserve and improve the
      function of the insulin secreting cells in the pancreas. Therefore, the investigators test
      the effects of conversion from Tacrolimus to Cyclosporine A in patients with newly diagnosed
      NODAT who have just started early treatment with insulin. The hypothesis is that patients who
      are treated with insulin and who are switched to Cyclosporine A have improved glucose
      metabolism compared to patients who are treated with insulin and who remain on Tacrolimus
      therapy.

    <description>Patients in this arm will be switched from immunosuppressive therapy with Tacrolimus to Cyclosporine A. Furthermore, patients in this arm will commence insulin treatment with NPH-insulin to reach normoglycemia. After the achievement of normoglycemia the insulin treatment will be continued for three more weeks and than terminated.</description>

    <description>Patients randomized into arm A will be switched from Tacrolimus to Cyclosporine A. Conversion will be done by a &quot;stop and go&quot; protocol. Patients will take their last dose Tacrolimus in the morning of the day of conversion and will start taking Cyclosporine A in the evening of the same day at a dose of 3mg/kg/d. The first measurement of Cyclosporine A trough levels will be performed 3 days after conversion and the dose will then be adjusted if necessary. Furthermore, treatment with NPH insulin once daily in the morning will be initiated.</description>
