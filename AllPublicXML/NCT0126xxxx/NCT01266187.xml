    <textblock>
      Is a perioperative chemotherapy based on FOLFOX and Cetuximab (K-RAS wild-type) associated
      with a higher rate of postoperative complications in patients with resectable colorectal
      liver metastases as compared to only adjuvant FOLFOX and chemotherapy? Are there any
      differences for disease free survival between periand postoperative treatment in patients
      with &gt;3 liver metastases or at least one metastasis &gt; or = 5 cm in diameter?

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In recent years chemotherapy based on FOLFOX and cetuximab has become a standard treatment in
      patients with colorectal liver metastases. Recently, the analysis of the CELIM trial reported
      response rates of 70% in patients with initially unresectable colorectal liver metastases
      treated with FOLFOX + Cetuximab. 46% of the patients had their metastases R0 or R1 resected
      or a ablation by radiofrequency with an overall 34% R0 resection rate. In recent studies,
      adjuvant chemotherapy with FOLFOX leads to a prolongation of disease free survival after
      successful resection of colorectal liver metastases, but there is not sufficient data
      concerning a perioperative regimen. In only one study of Nordlinger et al. a trend in
      progression-free survival could be reached in patients receiving a perioperative
      FOLFOX-therapy, but without reaching statistical significance. Furthermore those patients
      displayed a significantly higher rate of postoperative complications and morbidity. Although
      the advantages of perioperative treatment are not proven, this concept has become more and
      more popular in recent years, mainly because of a lack of guidelines. Thus the aim of our
      study is to compare the complication rate of both therapeutical concepts. Furthermore,
      secondary objectives (disease-free survival, overall survival, resection rates, response
      rates, toxicities and quality of life) will be used to estimate the efficacy, feasibility,
      and safety of both regimens. Perioperative treatment probably has a better efficacy in
      patients with high tumor burden (&gt;3 liver metastases or one metastasis &gt; or = 5 cm in
      diameter) with effect on disease free survival and will be investigated in a subgroup
      analysis.
