  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, randomized, double blind, comparative, experimental controlled Phase 3
      clinical trial to assess the efficacy, safety and superiority of F0343 (gabapentin combined
      with B vitamins) compared to gabapentin alone for treating neuropathic pain in subjects with
      chronic distal diabetic polyneuropathy.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Subjects will be assigned to one of the two arms of the study, after having been deemed
      eligible during the screening visit in random double-blind design. Subjects will be evaluated
      for a 4 week period.

      OBJECTIVES

        -  To assess the effects of F0434 and gabapentin alone on neuropathic pain and Quality Of
           Life (QOL) of subjects with diabetic neuropathy through a current and validated
           neuropathic pain scale along with the QOL questionnaire.

    <description>Neuropathic pain score included 10 pain descriptors (intensity, stinging, burning, dull pain, coldness, sensitivity, numbness, depth, superficial and unpleasant) quantified on a 0 (no symptoms) to 10 (worst symptoms imaginable). Questionnaire generated a score in each of the relevant dimensions and a total score of 0-100. Higher score indicated a greater intensity of pain.</description>

    <measure>Quality of Life Survey Assessed Using Short Form 36 (SF-36) Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>Visit 2 (Baseline) to Visit 6 (Week 4)</time_frame>
    <description>SF-36 is a standardized health survey consisting of 36 questions to measure functional health status. Summary scores are calculated using the following 8 dimensions: physical functioning, role-physical, bodily pain, general health, vitality, social functioning, role-emotional, and mental health. The score for a component is obtained by SF-36 algorithm and it is represented as an average of the individual question scores, which are scaled 0 (not functioning) to 100 (highest functioning). Higher scores are indicative of a better health status.</description>

        <title>Quality of Life Survey Assessed Using Short Form 36 (SF-36) Questionnaire</title>
        <description>SF-36 is a standardized health survey consisting of 36 questions to measure functional health status. Summary scores are calculated using the following 8 dimensions: physical functioning, role-physical, bodily pain, general health, vitality, social functioning, role-emotional, and mental health. The score for a component is obtained by SF-36 algorithm and it is represented as an average of the individual question scores, which are scaled 0 (not functioning) to 100 (highest functioning). Higher scores are indicative of a better health status.</description>
