    <textblock>
      This study aims at assessing efficacy and safety of DBS for treatment of patients suffering
      from resistant major depression, by means of a random, controlled and crossed study.

      The first phase of the study will consist of implanting electrodes and applying continuous
      stimulation until the patients stabilise clinically. This period is anticipated between 6 and
      9 months. The next phase will consist of the crossover study. Responders will be randomised
      to either of 2 groups for a period of 3 months: a stimulation-on group and a stimulation-off
      group. Patients will then be crossed over to the other group for a further 3 months.
      Fortnightly visits will be made during the entire study to evaluate treatment efficacy and
      patient tolerance
