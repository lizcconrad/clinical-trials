      This is a phase II study to assess whether treatment with chemotherapy drugs FOLFOX
      (5-Fluorouracil (5FU), Oxaliplatin (Eloxatin) and Leucovorin (Folinic Acid)) or FOLFIRI
      (5-Fluorouracil (5FU), Irinotecan (Camptosar) and Leucovorin (Folinic Acid))and panitumumab
      before and after surgery can improve outcome in patients with liver metastases (the cancer
      has spread to other parts of the body such as the liver) that are resectable (can be
      surgically removed), from colorectal cancer that have a non mutant (wild-type) K-ras gene.

      FOLFOX/FOLFIRI is an intravenous (given by vein) chemotherapy combination that is approved
      for colorectal cancer while panitumumab is also an intravenous drug and have been approved
      for treatment of refractory (not responding treatment) metastatic colorectal cancer whose
      cancers have the K-ras gene. These drugs are not approved for the treatment of colorectal
      cancer liver metastases (CRCLM) who can have surgery.

      Patients will receive FOLFOX/FOLFIRI and panitumumab for four 2-week cycles before surgery.
      Surgery will be done no sooner than 4 weeks and no later than 8 weeks, after completion of
      the fourth cycle of chemotherapy.

      If the liver metastases after the chemotherapy and surgery decreases or stops growing, then
      chemotherapy will be given after surgery. Treatments will start no sooner than 4 weeks, and
      no later than 12 weeks, after surgery. Patients will receive a maximum of 8 cycles of
      treatment with the combination of drugs and then receive panitumumab alone for a maximum of
      12 cycles.

      On treatment visits, patients will also have tests and procedures done. As part of the study,
      patients will provide archival tumor tissue and sample of tissue removed from surgery for
      K-ras testing. Patients will also be given the option of allowing the collected tissue for
      research (biomarker) studies and banking for future studies.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Emerging data suggests that KRAS mutation is a strong predictor for resistance to EGFR
      antagonist therapy. In the KRAS wild-type cohort, the addition of EGFR antagonists to
      chemotherapy has been shown to improve RR and PFS. Improved response rate to neoadjuvant
      chemotherapy would be expected to improve surgical outcomes for patients with CRCLM. We
      therefore wish to test the hypothesis that the combination of FOLFOX/FOLFIRI and panitumumab,
      given perioperatively to patients with wild-type KRAS CRCLM will improve outcome, compared to
      historical control, in optimally resectable patients. As this patient population remains at
      high risk for recurrence post-chemotherapy, we also wish to explore the tolerability and
      efficacy of continued panitumumab monotherapy for an additional 6 months.

      As opposed to most clinical trials for advanced colorectal cancer where the majority are
      treated with palliative intent, patients in this trial will all be treated aggressively with
      curative intent at the outset. There is also the additional benefit of assessment of tumor
      tissue after treatment with a biologic agent.

        within normal institutional limits OR- creatinine clearance &gt;50 mL/min/1.73 m2 for patients
        with creatinine levels above institutional normal

          -  Appropriate imaging investigations, including CT or MRI of chest/abdomen/pelvis. Other
             scans if clinically indicated may be performed. All imaging studies must be performed
             within 28 days of study entry.

          -  Women of child-bearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception
             (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry, for
             the duration of study and for a period of six months after cessation of study therapy.
             Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while participating in this
             study, she must inform her treating physician immediately.

          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document.

        Exclusion Criteria

          -  Patients must have had no previous systemic treatment in the adjuvant or metastatic
             setting within 6 months of registration.

          -  Patients may not have had prior treatment with an EGFR antagonist.

          -  Patients may not have a history of other malignancies, except: adequately treated
             non-melanoma skin cancer, curatively treated in-situ cancer of the cervix, or other
             solid malignancies curatively treated with no evidence of disease for ≥ 5 years.

          -  Patients may not have extrahepatic metastatic disease. Patients who have had prior
             surgical resection for hepatic metastases or extrahepatic disease (eg. pulmonary
             metastases) are also excluded from this study.

          -  Patients may not have pre-existing chronic hepatic disease (eg. cirrhosis, chronic
             active hepatitis B or C)

          -  History of allergic reactions, or intolerance, attributed to compounds of similar
             chemical or biologic composition to 5-fluorouracil, oxaliplatin, or panitumumab.

             to, ongoing or active infection, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would
             limit compliance with study requirements.

          -  HIV-positive patients on combination antiretroviral therapy are ineligible because of
             the potential for pharmacokinetic interactions with the agents used in this study. In
