      To evaluate the efficacy of Diacerein 100 mg daily versus placebo in reducing rheumatoid
      arthritis symptoms, when added to stable oral MTX therapy in patients with active early RA.

      To evaluate the safety of Diacerein 100 mg daily when administrated in combination with oral
      MTX therapy in those patients for up to 24 weeks

      To investigate a potential persistent effect, 4 weeks after Diacerein treatment is stopped
      (carry-over effect)

         12. Treatment with NSAID or oral corticosteroids, unless the patient has been on a stable
             dose for at least 4 weeks before randomisation (maximal allowed daily dose of oral
