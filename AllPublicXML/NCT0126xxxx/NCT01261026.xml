      OBJECTIVE: This study evaluated serum vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)
      concentrations in women with ectopic pregnancy (EP), abnormal intrauterine pregnancy (aIUP)
      and normal intrauterine pregnancy (nIUP).

      METHODS: This was a prospective, case-control study comparing serum VEGF concentrations among
      72 women with ectopic pregnancy (n=35), abnormal IUP (n=15) and normal IUP (n=22) matched for
      gestational age. For the determination of serum VEGF concentration a solid phase sandwich
      ELISA was used. Patients were stratified according to serum VEGF above or below 200pg/mL.

      RESULTS: The serum level of VEGF was significantly higher in women with ectopic pregnancy
      (median 211.1 pg/mL; range 5 - 1017.0 pg/mL) than in women with normal IUP (median 5 pg/mL;
      range 5- 310.6 pg/mL) P &lt; 0.0001. Serum VEGF concentrations did not show any statistically
      significant difference between women with aIUP (median 231.9 pg/mL range 5 - 813.7 pg /mL )
      and EP (median 211.1 pg/mL range 5 - 1017.0 pg/mL). When cut-off concentrations of 200 pg/mL
      for VEGF were used, a nIUP could be distinguished from an unviable (EP and aIUP) with a
      sensitive of 53%, specificity of 90.9%, a positive predictive value of 92.9% and a negative
      predictive value of 46.5%..

      CONCLUSIONS: Serum VEGF could not distinguish between an EP and an aIUP. However, serum VEGF
      concentrations above 200 pg/mL could discriminate a nIUP from an unviable pregnancy (EP or
      aIUP) with a PPV of 92.9%.

        Inclusion Criteria:The inclusion criterion was the presence at transvaginal ultrasound of
        an extraovarian adnexal mass in women with a suspected ectopic pregnancy (amenorrhea,
        bleeding and pain) with positive test for beta-hCG.

        Exclusion Criteria:The exclusion criterion was non-tubal ectopic pregnancy (cervical,
        cesarean scar, ovarian, and abdominal).
