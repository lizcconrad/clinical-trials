  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cervical Cancer is staged clinically, not surgically. Patients in whom an extensive disease
      is identified are not usually eligible for surgery. PET-CT is used to support staging.
      However, some patients received surgery after staging and subsequently require
      radio/chemotherapy due to findings on operation.

      This study will attempt to find a correlation between SUV-Max on PET-CT and subsequent
      outcomes i.e. need for adjuvant therapy.
