         11. Absolute neutrophil count ≥1,5x109/l

         12. Serum creatinine &lt; 2.5 x ULN

         13. Liver function: Serum bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x ULN, AST or ALT ≤ 2.5 x ULN. Patients with
             suspected liver metastasis: AST and ALT ≤ 5x ULN

         14. Able to swallow the study drug whole as a tablet

         15. Expected life expectancy of at least 6 months

         16. Women of childbearing potential must have had a negative serum pregnancy test within
             14 days prior to the administration of the study treatment or must have a documented
             condition that prohibits pregnancy (e.g. hysterectomy, post-menopausal).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients who have received &gt;1 prior VEGFR-TKI therapy or prior therapy with
             bevacizumab +/- interferon.

          2. VEGFR-TKI therapy within 14 days prior to start of study drug

          3. Patients who have previously received systemic mTOR inhibitors (sirolimus,
             temsirolimus, everolimus).

          4. Patients with a known hypersensitivity to everolimus or other rapamycin (sirolimus,
             temsirolimus) or to its excipients.

          5. Any condition which, in the opinion of the investigator, would preclude participation
             in this trial

          6. Patients within 4 weeks post-major surgery (e.g., intra-thoracic, intra-abdominal or
             intrapelvic), open biopsy, or significant traumatic injury to avoid wound healing
             complications. Minor procedures and percutaneous biopsies or placement of vascular
             access device require 7 days prior to study entry.

          7. Patients who had radiation therapy within 4 weeks prior to start of study treatment.
             Palliative radiotherapy to bone lesions within 2 weeks prior to study treatment start.

          8. Patients in anticipation of the need for major surgical procedure during the course of
             the study.

          9. Patients with a serious non-healing wound, ulcer, or bone fracture.

         10. Patients with a history of seizure(s) not controlled with standard medical therapy.

         11. History or clinical evidence of central nervous system (CNS) metastases. Subjects who

               1. are asymptomatic and,

               2. have had no evidence of active CNS metastases for ≥ 3 months prior to enrolment

         12. Patients receiving chronic systemic treatment with corticosteroids (dose of &gt; 10
             mg/day methylprednisone equivalent) or another immunosuppressive agent. Inhaled and
             topical steroids are acceptable.

         13. Poorly controlled diabetes as defined by fasting serum glucose &gt;2.0 x ULN.

         14. Impaired liver function classified as Child-Pugh class C.

             conditions within the past 12 months that could affect their participation in the
             study such as cardiac angioplasty or stenting, unstable angina pectoris, symptomatic
             peripheral vascular disease, symptomatic congestive heart failure (NYHA II, III, IV),
             myocardial infarction ≤ 6 months prior to first study treatment, serious uncontrolled
             cardiac arrhythmia, any disorders that impair the ability to evaluate the patient or
             for the patient to complete the study.

         20. Patients who have a history of another primary malignancy and off treatment for ≤ 3
             years, with the exception of non-melanoma skin cancer and carcinoma in situ of the
             uterine cervix or breast, and localized cancer of the bladder (T1) and prostate (T1 -
             T2).

             are not acceptable. For definition of highly effective birth control methods please
             refer to section 12.3.6 of this protocol.

         23. Patients who are using other investigational agents or who had received
