  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a specimen collection protocol designed with the purpose of understanding the immune
      responses to influenza in children and adult subjects through collection of blood specimens
      and influenza medical history data. This protocol will allow the investigators to evaluate
      influenza-specific immune responses to a variety of influenza strains in a broad age range of
      the U.S. population early and late in the 2010-2011 influenza season. Immune responses will
      be evaluated using blood samples. The underlying hypothesis for this protocol is that the
      detailed characterization of immune responses to influenza in subjects from different age
      groups will further the understanding of immune responses cross-reactivity and advance
      development of influenza vaccines that are cross-reactive against old, new and re-emerging
      influenza strains.
