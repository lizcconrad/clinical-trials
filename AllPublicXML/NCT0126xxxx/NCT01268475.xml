  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Bronchiectasis can be defined as an abnormal and irreversible dilatation of the bronchial
      tree due to repeated cycles of inflammation and infection, resulting in progressive loss of
      lung function. The surgical treatment by pulmonary resection or even lung transplantation is
      indicated in cases of bronchiectasis primary nonresponsive to appropriate medical treatment,
      or when associated with serious complications. There are few literature data on the influence
      of bronchiectasis in exercise capacity, quality of life and functional capacity, and the
      impact of lung resection in patients with this diagnosis. The primary objective of this study
      is to evaluate prospectively the impact of lung resection on exercise capacity in patients
      with clinical and radiological diagnosis of bronchiectasis. The secondary objective of this
      study is to evaluate the impact of lung resection on quality of life and lung function and to
      analyze the the presence of predictors of postoperative functional deterioration and the
      occurrence of complications.
