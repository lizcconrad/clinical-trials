  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The database and biobank establishment started in 1997 in our institute. However, the sample
      size was too small with respect to our clinical and fundamental scientific research's
      requirement. Thus the Chinese gynecological oncology study (GOS) group was established to
      create a large multicentre database and biobank of patients with gynecologic diseases.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The database contains clinical and epidemiologic information about patients with gynecologic
      neoplasms, such as cervical carcinoma, ovarian carcinoma, etc. With the data gathered from
      this database, the investigators could further demonstrate the etiology, risk factor,
      clinical treatment, and other aspects of the complicated gynecologic diseases. The cervical
      cancer database v1.10 including more than 10,000 cases and more than 200 variables has been
      established.

      The biobank collects blood, fluids, tissue samples, and related clinical data from consenting
      patients with gynecologic neoplasms, such as cervical cancer, ovarian cancer, endometrial
      cancer, choriocarcinoma, uterine myoma, endometriosis. Besides, blood samples of
      population-based healthy people with informed consent are also collected.
