  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Tranexamic acid has been shown to reduce postoperative blood losses and transfusion
      requirements in a number of types of surgery. Most trials in orthopedic surgery have been
      conducted intravenously in arthroplasty, hip fracture and spine surgeries. This study would
      aim to see the effect of topical use of tranexamic acid in reduction of blood loss and
      transfusions for total hip arthroplasty
