    <textblock>
      GERICO 09/0907 is a Phase II multicentric trial evaluating the toxicity and activity of the
      combination of lapatinib and capecitabine in locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer
      over expressing HER2 for patients aged ≥ 70 who have failed after one line of chemotherapy in
      combination with trastuzumab.

      Due to the minimal participation of older people in clinical trials, there is a lack of data
      to make evidence-based decisions regarding chemotherapy in this indication.

      The study is designed to investigate whether elderly patients with locally advanced or
      metastatic breast cancer over-expressing HER2 could take advantage of the combination
      lapatinib and capecitabine in term of clinical benefit, and with no adverse effects and no
      detrimental impact on functional status (part of geriatric assessment).

      The main objective is to assess clinical benefit (defined at 4 months as complete response,
      partial response or stable disease), safety and preserved geriatric independence (main
      objective is a &quot;bi-criteria&quot; or composite criteria).

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      More than half of patients who have breast cancer with Her2-positive tumors treated with
      trastuzumab as a single agent develop resistance within one year of treatment initiation.

      Recent studies on this population of patients show that the use of Capecitabine combined with
      Lapatinib demonstrates an improvement of TTP without an increase of serious toxic effects.

      Our study is designed to investigate whether elderly patients with locally advanced or
      metastatic breast cancer over-expressing HER2 could take advantage of the combination
      lapatinib (1250mg/day) and capecitabine (1st cycle day 1 to day 14: 850mg/m2/day x2; next
      cycles day 1 to day 14: 1000 mg/m2/day x2) in term of clinical benefit, and with no adverse
      effects and no detrimental impact on functional status (part of geriatric assessment).
      Treatment will continue until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity occurence.

      This is a phase II multicentric trial associated to a pharmacokinetic study which aims to
      assess the effect of age modifications (absorption, distribution, metabolism and elimination)
      on the combination Lapatinib-Capecitabine by measuring the Cmin-Cmax of both components in
      elderly patients.
