    <measure>Numbers of Fingerstick Blood Glucose (BG) Results Within +/- 5 to 20mg/dL (&lt;75 mg/dL) or Within +/- 5% to 20% (&gt;=75 mg/dL) of Laboratory Glucose Method</measure>
    <time_frame>2 hours</time_frame>
    <description>Subjects with diabetes tested subject fingerstick blood using an investigational blood glucose monitoring system (BGMS), which included an investigational meter and sensor. BGM results were compared to a reference lab glucose method - Yellow Springs Instrument (YSI) Analyzer. BG results were used to calculate the number of BG results within +/- 5 to 20 mg/dL (for reference BG results &lt;75mg/dL) or +/- 5 to 20% (for reference BG results &gt;=75mg/dL) of the reference method results.</description>

    <measure>Number of Subjects Rated as&lt;=3 Performing Basic Meter Tasks (Labeling Comprehension)</measure>
    <time_frame>2 hours</time_frame>
    <description>Subjects reviewed the instructions for use (User Guide and Quick Reference Guide) to learn to use the system. Study staff then observed and rated the subjects (1 to 4) on their success at performing the tasks. Scale: 1.Success in performing tasks correctly without assistance. 2.Successful with additional review of User Guide. 3.Successful with additional review and study staff assist similar to review of a specific function during a Customer Service call. 4.Subject did not perform task correctly and study staff intervention was required.</description>

        <description>Subjects with diabetes tested subject fingerstick blood using an investigational blood glucose monitoring system (BGMS), which included an investigational meter and sensor. BGM results were compared to a reference lab glucose method - Yellow Springs Instrument (YSI) Analyzer. BG results were used to calculate the number of BG results within +/- 5 to 20 mg/dL (for reference BG results &lt;75mg/dL) or +/- 5 to 20% (for reference BG results &gt;=75mg/dL) of the reference method results.</description>

        <description>Subjects with diabetes used an investigational blood glucose monitoring system (BGMS) with subject capillary blood obtained from the palm. BGM results were compared to a reference lab glucose method - Yellow Springs Instrument (YSI) Analyzer. BG results were used to calculate the number of BG results within +/- 5 to 20 mg/dL (for reference BG results &lt;75mg/dL) or +/- 5% to 20% (for reference BG results &gt;=75mg/dL) of the reference method results.</description>
        <time_frame>2 hours</time_frame>
        <population>Five subjects were hypoglycemic (low blood glucose value). Since alternate-site palm testing by these subjects was not allowed in the study, palm data from these five subjects were not obtained/ not evaluable. The remaining 85 subjects tested 2 test strip lots on the BGM system. 2x85(170)test results were available.</population>

          <description>Subjects with diabetes used an investigational blood glucose monitoring system (BGMS) with subject capillary blood obtained from the palm. BGM results were compared to a reference lab glucose method - Yellow Springs Instrument (YSI) Analyzer. BG results were used to calculate the number of BG results within +/- 5 to 20 mg/dL (for reference BG results &lt;75mg/dL) or +/- 5% to 20% (for reference BG results &gt;=75mg/dL) of the reference method results.</description>
          <population>Five subjects were hypoglycemic (low blood glucose value). Since alternate-site palm testing by these subjects was not allowed in the study, palm data from these five subjects were not obtained/ not evaluable. The remaining 85 subjects tested 2 test strip lots on the BGM system. 2x85(170)test results were available.</population>
