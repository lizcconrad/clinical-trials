  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Malnutrition is a severe comorbidity in hospitalised patients, especially in elderly. The
      consumption of Oral Nutritional Supplements (NOS) is one of several tools for fighting
      against malnutrition. Their use is easy, and framed by recent French recommendations
      suggesting to propose NOS at end of meals or as snacking . Nevertheless, there is no
      scientific data to affirm which is the best of these two hypothesis in elderly hospitalised
      in Long Term Care Unit(LTCU) . Moreover, a preliminary survey of NOS consumption in LTCU in
      Limoges university hospital showed some problems about the mode of supplying NOS, partially
      linked with an insufficiency for paramedical staff in realizing importance of NOS. However,
      the effect of time of supplying NOS on total food consumption had not been evaluated in this
      first study. The new one will include 48 malnourished elderly patients in two LTCU and having
      a prescription of NOS. They will receive them at the same quantity during the whole study
      either firstly at end of meals (10 days) and secondly as snackings (10 days), or conversely.
      Order of choice will be randomised. Total daily alimentary intakes will be noted by
      paramedical staff of the two units, and translated by dieticians in daily energy, protein,
      carbohydrates and lipids intakes. The time of supplying NOS will be confronted with these
      intakes, in order to precise the best one.
