  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a study of safinamide, an investigational drug for Parkinson disease (PD). Safinamide
      is being developed as add-on therapy for the treatment of Parkinson disease. It is theorized
      that safinamide acts by increasing the available dopamine in those areas of the brain where
      dopamine is decreased as a result of Parkinson;s Disease. . Dopamine in the brain is involved
      in controlling body movements. Safinamide has been extensively studied in animals, and has
      been shown to increase the level of dopamine in these animals. Safinamide has also been
      tested in patients with Parkinson disease. The goal of this research trial is to see if
      safinamide is safe and well tolerated and to better understand how it affects the dopamine
      system in the brain in individuals with Parkinson disease. Data from this trial may provide
      essential information about the effectiveness and safety of these doses of safinamide in
      patients with early Parkinson disease, who are already receiving a stable dose of their
      normal Parkinson disease treatment.

    The Dopamine transporter brain imaging trial is terminated due to a company decision to return
