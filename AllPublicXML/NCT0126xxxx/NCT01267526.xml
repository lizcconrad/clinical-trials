  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Canadian, Multicentre, Observational Registry to study Adherence and Long Term
      Outcomes of Therapy in paediatric subjects using Easypod™ electromechanical device for growth
      hormone treatment from hospital and to assess the level of adherence of subject receiving
      SAIZEN® via Easypod™ .

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Subjects will be enrolled in a multicenter, longitudinal observational registry.
      Parents/subjects will provide their Informed Consent/assent to upload their data for
      populationbased analyses and optionally to adhere to a patient adherence support program
      designed to improve their adherence and, ultimately, clinical outcomes. Adherence data will
      be primarily derived from the Easypod™ device combined with physician data entry of outcome
      measures. Data will be collected retrospectively and prospectively. This will allow the
      establishment of adherence profiles and explore the hypothesis that patient adherence support
      programs improve adherence and subsequent clinical outcomes. Collected data will be also
      analyzed in a multinational pooled analysis of comparable national studies.

      Primary Objective:

      - To assess the level of adherence of subjects prescribed SAIZEN® via easypod™

      Secondary Objectives:

        -  To describe the impact of adherence on clinical outcomes for subject prescribed SAIZEN
           via easypod™

        -  To identify adherence subject profiling
