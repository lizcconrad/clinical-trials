  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A Pilot study to evaluate the safety and the efficacy of endotracheal instillation of
      pulmonary surfactant, with or without topical steroid (Budesonide), as a prophylactic
      treatment for Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia (a form of chronic lung disease) in extremely low
      birth weight infants. Cytokines (a group of inflammatory mediators) are measured in the
      tracheal aspirate before and after instillation of the study drugs.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia (BPD) is still one of the most common complications of ventilated
      premature infants. Lung inflammation plays a major role in its pathogenesis. Systemic
      steroids can be given to control this inflammatory process but their widespread use is
      limited by their systemic side effects and concerns for long neurodevelopmental adverse
      sequelae. Delivering steroids by inhalation which has been proven to be effective in young
      infants with asthma has been shown to be unsatisfactory for ELBW infants with BPD. This may
      be due to the fact that current delivery devices do not meet the requirements of the specific
      anatomical and physiologic characteristics of the airways and breathing patterns in this
      special group of patients. A novel approach to facilitate delivery directly to the lungs,
      thereby avoiding systemic concerns has been demonstrated in a recent study in which
      budesonide ( a topical steroid) was given to ventilated preterm infants using surfactant as a
      vehicle.

    <description>The main goal of the study is to determine whether endotracheal instillation of surfactant (Infasurf) with or without potent topical steroid (Budesonide) reduces the development of Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia (BPD) in Extremely Low Birth Weight (ELBW) infants at high risk of BPD.</description>

    <time_frame>The measurement of cytokines in tracheal aspirate samples will be done at the end of the study.</time_frame>
    <description>Tracheal aspirate samples will be collected before instillation of each dose of the study drug, 7 days after the last dose if the infant is still intubated, and prior to elective extubation regardless of when extubation occurs. Tracheal aspirate samples will be obtained from the control (standard management) group in the same way and using the same time frame as the treatment groups</description>
