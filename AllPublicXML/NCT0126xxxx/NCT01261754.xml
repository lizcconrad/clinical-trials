    <textblock>
      This is a single-blind, randomized, cross-over design. Patients with metastatic prostate
      adenocarcinoma; newly diagnosed, high-risk patients with prostate adenocarcinoma; and healthy
      subjects will be administered a single intravenous dose of each of the study drugs 99mTc MIP
      1404 and 99mTc MIP 1405 administered approximately 14 to 21 days apart.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This trial is a single-blind, randomized, cross-over design. Up to six patients with
      confirmed metastatic prostate adenocarcinoma; six newly diagnosed, high-risk patients with
      prostate adenocarcinoma; and up to six healthy volunteers will receive 20.0 (± 3) mCi of
      intravenously administered 99mTc MIP 1404 or 99mTc MIP 1405. Whole-body planar scintigraphic
      images will be acquired at various times post-injection over 24 hours. A pelvic SPECT/CT
      image will be acquired on the first day. Blood and urine will be collected for
      pharmacokinetic measurements and metabolic analysis over 24 hours. Each patient will receive
      an initial study drug administration and a second study drug administration approximately 14
      to 21 days after the first. A final follow-up visit will occur approximately 2-3 weeks after
      the second study drug.

    <description>Percent of injected activity (%IA) in a set of source organs will be determined by comparing a reference whole body scan to subsequent whole body scans to determine percentage of administered activity for source organs at the various scanning times.

Percent injected activity and estimated residence times will be summarized by organ.</description>
