      Our team is interested in what can be done to improve the functioning of patients who suffer
      from glaucoma, a chronic and irreversible eye disease. Patients with vision loss as a result
      of this disease may feel like they have been 'given up on', or lost to our medical system
      when no further interventions can be offered to treat their eye disease. It is our intent to
      investigate what alternatives we can provide our patients, instead of simply saying, 'nothing
      more can be done'. We have learned from studies done on other chronic eye diseases, like age
      related macular degeneration, that low vision rehabilitation can improve visual function.

      What exactly is low vision? It can involve a loss of visual acuity, making activities such as
      reading or writing a challenge; it can involve loss of contrast sensitivity, making shapes
      and edges hard to discern, like those of a stair edge, or person's face. It could also
      involve a loss of peripheral, or side vision which is a symptom common to most glaucoma
      patients. Whatever the cause of low vision, doing day-to-day activities can become
      increasingly difficult, and many suffer from a loss of their independence and may even become
      depressed. Low vision rehabilitation involves helping patients to use their remaining vision
      in optimal, and sometimes even new, ways. This involves an assessment of a person's baseline
      vision, and an idea of what their needs are. Patients are then given low vision aids (such as
      magnifiers, telescopes, video screens which magnify images, and other tools) as well as
      instructions and support for adapting to living and functioning with altered vision.

      Although there currently exists no cure for glaucoma, and we are certainly not promising a
      reversal of the damage done to the eyes from this chronic disease, we do believe that these
      types of rehabilitation services may offer some hope and potential visual benefit to patients
      living with vision loss. Our hypothesis is that the use of state-of-the-art low vision aids
      in patients with advanced glaucomatous visual loss will provide an improvement in visual
      tasks and thereby an improvement in quality of life.

      Visual impairment, including both low vision and blindness, ranks among the ten most
      prevalent causes of disability in North America (1). Leading causes of low vision are
      diseases also associated with an aging population, including age related macular degeneration
      (ARMD), glaucoma, diabetic retinopathy and optic neuropathies (1). Of these, irreversible
      vision loss is most commonly caused by ARMD and glaucoma, diseases for which there exists no
      cure (2). Quality of life and functional ability are negatively impacted by vision loss and
      blindness (2). Loss of visual ability impairs both mental and physical functioning, limiting
      activities of daily living (ADL) (eating, dressing, reading, writing, mobilizing,
      interpersonal communication etc.) (3). Impedance on basic functioning secondary to visual
      impairment can lead to loss of independence, low self-esteem or depression (3). When
      pharmacological or surgical interventions prove futile in advanced vision loss, low vision
      rehabilitation may be the only option for regaining lost function in patients. The goal of
      low vision rehabilitation is to not restore lost vision but rather utilize the remaining
      vision to its fullest potential thus enabling patients to reclaim their ADL and thereby their
      independence.

      Our study is based on the Veterans Affairs Low Vision Intervention Trial (LOVIT), a
      randomized controlled trial conducted by Stelmack et al (4-6). Their goal was to evaluate the
      efficacy of an outpatient low vision rehabilitation program for patients with moderate to
      severe vision loss secondary to age related macular degeneration (ARMD). Their intervention
      was effective in improving all aspects of visual function when compared with the control
      group. There is very little evidence to support the use of low vision rehabilitation in
      patients with chronic, irreversible visual loss secondary to glaucoma, and currently no
      randomized trials have been done. Because the pattern of visual loss is different in ARMD and
      glaucoma, it is not possible to extrapolate the ARMD data beyond the ARMD cohort. Yet, the
      ARMD experience has established a proof of principal that can be used in the glaucoma
      protocol design In patients with advanced glaucomatous optic neuropathy, functional loss
      often begins with mobility and difficulty ambulating (7). In one study, patients with visual
      field loss secondary to their glaucoma showed a diminished traffic gap judgement when
      crossing the street, which lead to an increased risk of harm. As a whole, the group made 23%
      more errors in identifying a gap as crossable when it was too short to be made safely (7).
      Another researcher found that 25% of patients with visual field loss in both eyes reported a
      moderate to severe restriction in their mobility activities overall. In another study, field
      loss secondary to glaucoma lead to a lower vision-related quality of life score. When
      examined collectively, these reports and others suggest that those with reduced visual fields
      and glaucoma experience more falls, more motor vehicle accidents, greater overall difficulty
      with mobility activities and an overall decreased quality of living (7). Visual acuity can
      vary over a wide range among patients with moderate to severe glaucoma, but overall, central
      vision reduction occurs late in the disease. Some studies do show mild central and diffuse
      reduction in fields in the early stages of glaucoma. As the visual fields and visual acuity
      decline, patients often note difficulty with glare sensitivity, leaving response times to
      light and dark adaptations hindered. In summary, the problems most often experienced by
      patients with advanced glaucoma are related to ambulation, reading, distance spotting and
      glare. Low vision rehabilitation aims to maximize independence in patients' daily lives by
      addressing these difficulties.

      It would be difficult to argue that low vision aids and rehabilitation in patients with
      visual loss do not have a positive impact on both patients and their families; however there
      exists little in the way of randomized controlled clinical trials which evaluate efficacy of
      outpatient low vision rehabilitation and interdisciplinary strategies to deliver such
      services. Given the existing shortage of inpatient resources and the staff required to manage
      such patients, an outpatient program could deemed more cost effective and practical in our
      limited health care system. Moreover, most available data on the subject focuses on
      rehabilitation in patients with ARMD. There is very little to support the use of low vision
      rehabilitation in patients with chronic, irreversible visual loss secondary to glaucoma. As
      our population ages, we can expect with certainty an increase in the prevalence of visual
      loss secondary to glaucoma, beginning in the next ten years (12). An evaluation of the
      efficacy of strategies to address 'untreatable' vision loss, such as those patients with 'end
      of the line' glaucoma, would be of great significance as we see glaucoma and its devastating
      effects on vision and subsequently on quality of life increase greatly in the near future.
      Evidence based models of outpatient low vision rehabilitation programs are needed to support
      the implementation and delivery of such services for patients suffering from moderate to
      severe glaucoma, and its devastating impact on daily functioning.
