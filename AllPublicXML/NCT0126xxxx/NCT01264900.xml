    <textblock>
      Aggressive behavior is a leading worldwide public health problem. Despite this, relatively
      little is known about how to best treat individuals who are highly angry and aggressive. A
      rich literature suggests that aggression is associated with a tendency to interpret
      situations as threatening or hostile even when they are not. This process is governed by a
      prefrontal-limbic circuit in the brain. A goal of cognitive behavioral therapy is to reduce
      these kinds of hostile biases. Preliminary data by the PI suggests a 12- session cognitive
      behavioral aggression treatment (CBAT) may help reduce aggressive behavior and underlying
      hostile biases associated with affective aggression. To assess the efficacy of this
      treatment, 120 adults with high levels of anger and aggression will receive 12 sessions of
      either CBAT or supportive psychotherapy. All subjects will monitor their anger and aggressive
      behavior throughout the treatment electronic diaries. Subjects will also complete
      questionnaires and computer tasks to assess anger, hostile biases and related processes
      1-week before treatment begins, and again 1-week, 6-months and 1-year after treatment ends.
      In addition, to understand the effects of CBAT on the brain, subjects will have their brains
      scanned (functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging) while they look at emotional pictures and
      complete computer tasks. The brain scans will occur once before treatment starts and once
      after treatment ends.

      Our hypotheses are:

        1. CBAT will reduce anger, aggression and hostile biases more than supportive therapy.

        2. CBAT will decrease limbic activation and increase prefrontal activation to emotional
           pictures more than supportive therapy.
