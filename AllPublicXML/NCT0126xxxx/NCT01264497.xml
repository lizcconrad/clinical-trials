    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study was to determine whether TH9507, a stabilized analogue of growth
      hormone-releasing factor (GRF), would have an effect on insulin sensitivity or control of
      diabetes in patients with type 2 diabetes.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Male or postmenopausal or surgically sterilized female subjects, 50 years of age or
             older;

          -  Documented diagnosis of type 2 diabetes as defined by the American Diabetes
             Association;

          -  Diagnosis of type 2 diabetes for at least 3 months before screening;

          -  Subjects on stable diabetes treatment regimens (receiving oral hypoglycemics with or
             without insulin) for at least 2 months before screening;

          -  Screening and pre-randomization glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) &lt;10.0%, according to
             central laboratory;

          -  Body mass index (BMI) between 25 and 38 kg/m2

          -  Subjects willing to perform specified home blood glucose monitoring and comply with
             all study protocol requirements;

          -  Signed informed consent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Serum creatinine &gt;2 mg/dL;

          -  Fasting triglycerides &gt;1000 mg/dL;

          -  Albuminuria &gt;200 mg/24 hours;

          -  Positive mammography (if female) or prostate-specific antigen (PSA) or prostate
             examination for cancer (if male);

          -  Use of oral or parenteral glucocorticoids in the 30 days before screening;

          -  Use of any experimental or marketed growth hormone, growth hormone secretagogues,
             insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1), or insulin-like growth factor binding protein-3
             (IGFBP-3) during the previous 6 months;

          -  Subjects with two or more severe hypoglycemia episodes within the past 6 months, or
             any hospitalization or emergency room visit due to poor glycemic control within the
             past 6 months. Similarly, during the lead-in period, any subject with more than one
             severe hypoglycemic episode or any hospitalization or emergency room visit due to poor
             glycemic control will be excluded from randomization;

          -  History of or presence of active concomitant conditions or diseases (e.g., myocardial
             infarction, poorly controlled hypertension, thyroid disease, rheumatoid arthritis,
             seizure disorder, diabetic neuropathy, diabetic retinopathy [except subjects with only
             microaneurysms on fundus examination]) that would interfere with the protocol conduct
             and endpoint measurements;

          -  Subjects with a major surgical operation during the 30 days before screening;

          -  Subjects with known hypopituitarism, history of pituitary tumor/surgery, head
             irradiation, or severe head trauma;

          -  Current cancer or history of cancer, except non-melanomatous skin cancer;

          -  Subjects with active infection at any body site or a history of severe infection
             (requiring oral or parenteral treatment) during the 30 days before screening;

          -  Subjects with clinically significant abnormalities on screening laboratory evaluation
             (unless discussed with and approved by the medical monitor);

          -  Subjects with allergy to synthetic growth hormone products or their excipients;

          -  Subjects who had previously received growth hormones in any clinical trial;

          -  Participation in a trial of an experimental drug or device within 90 days before
             screening.
