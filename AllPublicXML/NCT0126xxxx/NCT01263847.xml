      The purpose of this study is to determine the effects of galactooligosaccharide (GOS)
      supplementation on calcium absorption and and gut microbe profiles.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Galactooligosaccharides (GOS) have been shown to have positive effects on calcium absorption
      in animals and postmenopausal women. This study aims to see whether the addition of fiber in
      the form of GOS to a calcium-containing yogurt drink will increase calcium absorption
      compared to placebo in a group of girls near menarche. Secondary outcomes are to assess
      physical fitness and determine the relationship between physical fitness and calcium
      absorption in adolescent girls as well as assess changes in gut microbiota. During this three
      phase, randomized, controlled crossover study, participants will consume yogurt drinks
      supplemented with 0, 2.5 or 5 grams of GOS twice daily for three weeks. Following each three
      week period, participants will complete a weekend clinical visit to measure calcium
      absorption. Height, weight, bone density and geometry, calcium absorption, gut microbiota and
      physical fitness will be measured. Effects of this GOS fiber intervention may help elucidate
      a mechanism of action for improving bone health with fiber supplementation.

    <description>Calcium absorption will be measured using dual isotope methods. Calcium-44(Ca-44) as calcium chloride will be administered in a yogurt drink provided at breakfast along with a roll, butter, jam and juice. A second isotope, Calcium-43 (Ca-43) as calcium chloride will be administered intravenously, one hour after consumption of breakfast. Urine and blood samples will be collected over a period of 48 hours and levels of Ca-44 and Ca-43 will be measured in urine and blood. Levels of Ca-44 and Ca-43 will be expressed as a ratio (Ca-44/Ca-43).</description>

    <description>Zero, 5 or 10 g/day of galactooligosaccharide will be administered in two yogurt drinks containing about 300 mg total calcium each per day for three weeks. During a clinical visit following three weeks of consumption, zero, 2.5 or 5 g of galactooligosaccharide will be administered in the same yogurt with the addition of 15 mg Ca-44 (calcium chloride). Participants will be given one of the above yogurts at breakfast in addition to intravenously receiving 3.5 mg Ca-43 (calcium chloride) in 4 ml saline one hour after breakfast consumption.</description>
