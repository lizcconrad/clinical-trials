      The main objective was to evaluate the effect of a nutritional education program for school
      lunch cooks, aiming to reduce added sugar in schools meals and in their sugar intake.

    <textblock>
      Although Brazil is the largest producer and one of the world's largest consumers of sugar,
      research on sugar consumption is still a weak point among health indicators and there are no
      population studies to investigate the sugar intake in Brazilian population. Available data
      have shown reduction in the consumption of refined sugar (-37% between 1996 and 2003) but
      significant increase in consumption of soft drinks (400%), which constitute the main vehicle
      for consumption of added sugar. Moreover, studies have shown the adverse effects of excessive
      consumption of added sugar in dental caries and health, as excess energy intake hence in
      weight gain. Although several factors are associated with weight gain in adolescents, adults
      and elders, and several strategies have been released by both Brazil and International
      Agencies, as the Global Strategy, increased weight gain, particularly in adolescents, has
      been observed in several countries with large increase in Brazil, justifying specific
      projects to evaluate which messages, strategies and proposals for intervention would be
      effective.

    <description>A nutritional education program was carried out during seven months of one school year aiming to reduce added sugar in school meals by the school lunch cooks and in their own consumption.
All women in the intervention group participated in three sections about sugar consumption and one section on food labeling, as well as recipes competition of with reducing sugar.
Printed material and gifts, such as mugs, refrigerator magnets and small purses with the logo of the campaign were given to the participants.
All sections of education were delivered in the schools. The activities required 20 to 30 minutes and were facilitated by trained research assistants. Printed instructions and orientations on the facilitation process supported the assistants' efforts.</description>
