  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sleep apnea is a common situation that affects up to 80% of acromegalic patients. This
      disease is linked to disturbance on the carbohydrate metabolism increasing the rates of
      diabetes. The objective of this trial is to assess (with the euglycemic hyperinsulinemic
      clamp) the impact of the treatment of sleep apnea, with a continuous positive air pressure
      device (CPAP), on the insulin resistance.

    <description>The insulin resistance, the target of this study, will be assessed by an index obtained during the euglucaemic hyperinsulinemic clamp (EHC). This index is derived from the amount of glucose delivered to the patient during a determined period of time. The (EHC) will be performed at the beginning of the study and 90 days after the intervention.</description>
