    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to conduct preparatory research needed to design a behavioral
      intervention to decrease sexual transmission risk behaviors in HIV-infected individuals in
      care and to determine whether a similar intervention structure can be used across various
      sexual risk groups and cultural settings.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Men and women at least 18 years of age (Note: Pregnant and breast feeding women are
             allowed to enroll into the study)

          -  Documented evidence of HIV infection (HIV diagnosis performed outside of the trial is
             acceptable so long as local/country guidelines were followed in the testing)

          -  Receiving HIV/AIDS care (defined as at least two visits within 9 months of enrollment)
             in a formal health care setting (clinic or hospital)

          -  Reported history of sexual risk behavior in the previous 12 months, including:
             acquisition of a sexually transmitted infection, vaginal or anal intercourse without a
             condom, difficulty negotiating condom use, or non-disclosure of HIV status to an
             HIV-uninfected partner or partner of unknown HIV serostatus.

          -  NOTE: For the MSM population, we will enroll men who have sex with men, regardless of
             whether or not they also have sex with women

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Anyone currently enrolled in another study that involves protocolized HIV risk
             reduction counseling (e.g. ACTG 5175 or HPTN 052) or any other prevention study

          -  Anyone having unprotected (i.e. without a condom) sex for the expressed purpose of
             conceiving

          -  Planning to relocate out of the area in the next year

          -  Any condition that, in the opinion of the Investigator of Record or designee, would
             make participation in the study unsafe, complicate interpretation of study outcome
             data, or otherwise interfere with achieving the study objectives
