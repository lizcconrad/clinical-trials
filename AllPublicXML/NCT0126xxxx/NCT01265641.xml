  <brief_title>To Investigate the Effects of AZD1981 on the QT Interval</brief_title>
  <official_title>A Single-centre, Double-blind, Double-dummy, Randomised, Placebo Controlled, Four-period Crossover Study in Healthy Male Volunteers, to Assess the Effect on QT/QTc Interval of Single Oral Doses of AZD1981 (200 mg and 2000 mg) Using Moxifloxacin (AveloxÂ®) as a Positive Control</official_title>

  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to evaluate the effect of AZD1981 on the electrical
      activity of the heart, in particular when the heart muscle is relaxed during a heart beat
      cycle. The effect of AZD1981 will be compared to a licensed antibiotic (moxifloxacin) which
      is well known to affect the electrical activity of the heart, but this effect is known to be
      at levels that are safe at the dose used in this study. The investigators will also compare
      the effects of AZD1981 with a &quot;dummy drug&quot; (placebo). The investigators will also be
      evaluating how safe and well tolerated AZD1981 is and how much AZD1981 enters the blood
      circulation by collecting blood during the study.
