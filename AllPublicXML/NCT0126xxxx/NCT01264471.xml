  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to investigate possible causes for Gulf War Syndrome. Gulf War
      Syndrome is associated with increased incidences of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (Lou
      Gehrig's Disease), pain syndromes, muscle complaints that include fatigue and myalgias
      (muscle pain), as well as other neurological symptoms. Abnormalities in the part of the cell
      known as mitochondria have been delineated in Gulf War Syndrome. Mitochondria are the &quot;power
      plants&quot; of the body. Mitochondria take the food you eat and break the food down into a form
      of energy that the body can use. The investigators propose that Gulf War Syndrome is
      determined by a complex interaction of factors that interfere with mitochondrial function.
      This study will be the first investigation of mitochondrial function in Gulf War Syndrome.
      The investigators objective is to establish the cause for symptoms in affected veterans,
      develop testing that can more easily identify Gulf War Syndrome, and ultimately develop
      treatment protocols for Gulf War Syndrome.

    <description>After collecting a skin and blood sample, mitochondrial cellular energetics in Gulf War Syndrome patients will be characterized by: 1. high resolution respirometry of intact cells, 2. quantitative analysis of individual mitochondrial proteins, 3. analysis of intact OXPHOS enzyme complexes and supercomplexes, 4. in gel enzyme activity assessment of intact OXPHOS enzyme complexes and supercomplexes, 5. mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) copy number quantitation to assess for defects in regulation mtDNA replication and 6. cellular coenzyme Q10 quantitation.</description>
