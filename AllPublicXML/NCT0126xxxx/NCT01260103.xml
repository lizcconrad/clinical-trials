      Primary Objectives

      To compare progression free survival (PFS), the time from randomization to progressive
      disease,in children with optic pathway glioma (OPG) age ≥ 6 months to &lt; 18 years, who receive
      combination antineoplaston therapy (ANP therapy) vs. temozolomide (TMZ); study subjects will
      have 1) received prior treatment with carboplatin or cisplatin, which was terminated
      secondary to toxicity or progression of OPG, or 2) developed recurrence of OPG after
      completion of carboplatin or cisplatin therapy. PFS data will be censored on the date of the
      last tumor assessment documenting absence of progression for study subjects:

        -  Who are alive, on study and are progression-free at the time of the analysis;

        -  Who discontinue, receive no subsequent therapy and are progression-free at the time of
           the analysis;

        -  Who are given/change therapy other than the study treatment prior to observing
           progression;

        -  Who discontinued (due to personal preference or toxicity) with a change in therapy,
           withdrew, or was lost to follow-up;

        -  For whom documentation of disease progression or death occurs after ≥ 2 consecutive
           missed tumor assessments.

             -  To describe the toxicity profile for ANP therapy vs. TMZ.

      Secondary Objectives:

        -  To compare overall survival (OS) for subjects treated with ANP therapy vs. TMZ;

        -  To compare disease stabilization rates for subjects treated with ANP therapy vs. TMZ;

        -  To compare complete response (CR), partial response (PR), stable disease (SD), and
           progressive disease (PD) rates for subjects treated with ANP therapy vs. TMZ.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, phase 3, open-label, multicenter, protocol study in children age ≥ 6
      months to &lt; 18 yr., with recurrent and/or progressive OPG who have 1) received prior
      treatment with carboplatin or cisplatin, which was terminated secondary to toxicity or
      progression of OPG or 2) developed recurrence of OPG after completion of carboplatin or
      cisplatin therapy. A total of 158 subjects will be enrolled and randomized equally to one of
      two therapy groups: ANP therapy (79 subjects) or TMZ (79 subjects). If an average of 4
      subjects is enrolled each month, enrollment will be completed in 3 years and 3 months. There
      will be an additional three years of follow-up.

      Children of either gender and from all racial/ethnic groups will be eligible for this
      protocol study if they meet the criteria outlined in Section 3. Upon determination of
      eligibility, including the obtaining of an informed consent, study subjects will be
      randomized to ANP therapy or TMZ. The randomization will be stratified by prior RT (Y/N),
      hypothalamic involvement (Y/N) and age (&lt; 5 years / ≥ 5 years).

      In a group of children treated with TMZ after developing progressive and/or recurrent disease
      following first-line chemotherapy, a 2-year PFS of 49% and a 4-year PFS of 31% was reported
      by Gururangan and associates. Based on their results, and assuming an exponential
      distribution, a least squares estimate of the hazard is 0.333 per year.

      For those study subjects, in the BRI Phase 2 study of ANP therapy for OPG, who 1) received
      prior treatment with carboplatin or cisplatin, which was terminated secondary to toxicity or
      progression of OPG or 2) developed recurrence of OPG after completion of carboplatin (or
      cisplatin) therapy, a least squares estimate of the hazard is 0.075 per year. Since the
      sample size in the Phase 2 study is small and may overstate the effect of ANP therapy in
      general use, a hazard of 0.167 per year was utilized in determining the sample size for the
      proposed Phase 3 protocol study, giving a hazard ratio (TMZ:ANP) of 2.0.

      The primary efficacy hypothesis of the proposed protocol study is that ANP therapy provides
      for a significantly better PFS than does TMZ. This protocol study is event-driven (PD or
      death from any cause), and will be completed after 90 events have occurred. The required
      sample size in each treatment group is 79.

      A log rank test of equality of survival curves, with a 0.05 two-sided significance level, has
      90% power to detect the difference in PFS between children treated with ANP therapy vs.
      children treated with TMZ. Assuming an accrual rate of 4 subjects per month, the accrual
      period is 3 years and 3 months. There is an additional 3 years of follow-up. A common
      exponential dropout rate of 0.05 per year is assumed.

      This study utilizes an intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis. It is event-driven (PD or death
      from any cause), and will be completed after 90 events have occurred. All subjects are
      evaluable for PFS from the time of randomization to the time of PD or death, regardless of
      therapy group, eligibility, or adequacy of follow-up. All study subjects who receive at least
      one dose of ANP therapy or TMZ are evaluable for safety.

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Children age ≥ 6 months &lt; 18 years are eligible if they have 1) received prior
             treatment with carboplatin or cisplatin, which was terminated secondary to toxicity or
             progression of OPG or 2) developed recurrence of OPG after completion of carboplatin
             or cisplatin therapy.

          2. Children with or without prior RT are eligible.

          3. Histological confirmation of OPG is required unless the risks of obtaining a
             diagnostic biopsy are prohibitive.

          4. Evidence of OPG (≥ 5 mm), as diagnosed by MRI of the brain, with and without
             gadolinium contrast, within four weeks of protocol study entry is required. The MRI is
             interpreted by two independent neuroradiologists. If there is disagreement, a third
             independent neuroradiologist will adjudicate. Baseline MR spectroscopy (MRS) and
             positron emission tomography (PET) scan are also performed.

          5. Children who are receiving corticosteroids and, for at least one week prior to entry
             into the protocol study have been on the lowest dose of corticosteroids that preserves
             optimal neurologic function, are eligible.

          6. Children with a life expectancy of &gt; 6 months are eligible.

          7. Children ≤ 14 years of age with a Lansky performance status of &gt; 60 are eligible.
             Children &gt; 14 years of age with a Karnofsky performance status of &gt; 60 are eligible.

          8. Children with normal organ and marrow function (as defined below) are eligible.

               -  hemoglobin ≥ 10 g/dL

               -  leukocytes &gt; 2000/mm3

               -  absolute neutrophil count (ANC) &gt;1,500/ mm3

               -  serum NA+, K+, BUN within institutional normal limits

               -  platelets &gt;75,000/ mm3

               -  total bilirubin &lt; 1.5 mg/dL

               -  AST(SGOT)/ALT(SGPT) &lt;3 times institutional upper limit of normal (ULN)

               -  serum creatinine &lt; 1.5 mg/dL

          9. At the recommended therapeutic dose, the effects of ANP therapy on the developing
             human fetus are unknown. For this reason, women of child-bearing potential who agree
             to use adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control;
             abstinence) prior to protocol study entry and for the duration of protocol study are
             eligible. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while
             participating in this protocol study, she will inform her treating physician
             immediately.

         10. Children who are able to understand a written informed consent document, and are
             willing to sign it, are eligible. A subject with a parent or guardian who is able to
             understand a written informed consent document, and who is willing to sign it on the
             subject's behalf, is eligible.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Children receiving prior ANP or TMZ therapy are not eligible.

          2. Children with an uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to,
             ongoing or active infection, uncontrolled hypertension (&gt; grade 2) or psychiatric
             illness and/or social situations that would limit compliance with protocol study
             requirements are not eligible.

          3. Children with a history of congestive heart failure, deep venous thrombosis, or other
             cardiovascular or renal conditions that would contradict administration of high dose
             intravenous sodium or insertion of a subclavian venous catheter are not eligible.

          4. Pregnant women are not eligible because the teratogenic and abortifacient effects of
             ANP therapy in humans are unknown. Because there is an unknown but potential risk for
             adverse events in nursing infants secondary to the mother receiving ANP therapy,
             breastfeeding is discontinued if the mother receives ANP therapy.
