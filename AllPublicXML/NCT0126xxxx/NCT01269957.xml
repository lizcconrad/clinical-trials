      Objective: determine whether there is a correlation between halitosis and mouth breathing in
      children. Study design: Fifty-five children between three and 14 years of age were divided
      into two groups (nasal and mouth breathing) for the assessment of halitosis. Descriptive
      analysis was carried out regarding the degree of halitosis in each group. The chi-square test
      was used for the comparison between groups, with 5% level of significance.

        All children registered at the clinic of the specialization course in pediatric dentistry
        of the ABCD/SP in 2008 were included in the study.

        The children were divided into two groups based on breathing pattern (nasal and mouth) for
        the evaluation of halitosis. Breathing pattern was determined by a clinical evaluation and
        specific tests (mirror test and water-in-mouth test) and confirmed by the evaluation of an
        otolaryngologist.
