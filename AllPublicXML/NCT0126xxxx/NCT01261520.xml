  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study examined whether a culturally-tailored video has a greater impact on increasing
      mammography use in Chinese American women and improving barriers to mammography screening
      compared to a generic, non-tailored video and a printed fact sheet (control group).

      This study examined the efficacy of a culturally-tailored video in increasing mammography use
      among non-adherent Chinese women (vs. a generic video and control fact sheet). A total of 671
      Chinese American women from metropolitan Washington, DC and New York city were enrolled to
      participate in this study. The majority of participants were recruited from on-site community
      events and some were recruited through public advertisement and referrals. Participants who
      completed baseline assessment were randomized to one of the three groups: 1) viewing an
      18-minute cultural video, 2) viewing an 18-minute generic video, and 3) reading a fact sheet
      (control group). Participants were interviewed twice after intervention:1) process evaluation
      2-4 weeks post intervention regarding participants' feedback on the materials and repeated
      key measures of knowledge, cultural views, and health beliefs and 2) outcome evaluation
      six-months post intervention that assesses actual receipt of mammography use.
