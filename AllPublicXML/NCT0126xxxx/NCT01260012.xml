  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Liver fibrosis is the most serious complication of schistosomiasis mansoni. However only
      limited proportion of subjects with infection develop this pathology and there is limited
      knowledge on risk factors for the differential morbidity patterns observed in endemic
      communities. Our preliminary cross-sectional study indicated that serum levels of
      antioxidants may be related with the development of fibrosis. The present project is a
      randomised double blinded placebo controlled prospective study investigating the role of food
      based antioxidant supplements on the outcome of anti-schistosomal chemotherapy with regards
      to the extent of fibrosis reversal.

      Schistosomiasis is the second leading parasitic disease worldwide, after malaria. Liver
      fibrosis is the most serious complication of schistosomiasis mansoni which can lead to
      reduced work capacity and early death in endemic countries. There is, however, limited
      knowledge on the development of liver fibrosis and the differential patterns morbidity
      observed in endemic communities. Our preliminary cross-sectional study in Ethiopia seems to
      indicate that serum levels of antioxidants may influence the development of fibrosis. The
      present project is a translational study combining basic antioxidant laboratory work with is
      a randomised double blinded placebo controlled prospective study in endemic areas in
      Ethiopia, investigating the role of food based antioxidant supplements on the outcome of
      anti-schistosomal chemotherapy with regards to the extent of fibrosis reversal. In addition,
      analysis of dietary intakes of antioxidants among communities with comparable levels of S.
      mansoni infection but with differing levels of schistosomal periportal fibrosis will be
      undertaken to compare serum levels of antioxidants and prevalence of liver fibrosis.
      Furthermore we plan to assess development of schistosomal peri-portal fibrosis in a cohort of
      students established 9 years back who had comparable levels of community prevalence of
      schistosomiasis but with differing access to fruits and vegetables. Research on this topic
      has a high priority globally which is in line with the millennium development goals.
      Knowledge in this field will also add to our understanding of fibrosis development in general
      and to the efficacy of clinical treatment of schistosomiasis in particular.

    <time_frame>2 years</time_frame>
    <description>Patients schistosomal periportal fibrosis will be treated with praziquantel at the start, at six weeks and at 3 months from the start of the study. Praziquantel therapy will then be offered if subjects have demonstrable S. mansoni eggs on six-monthly evaluation periods. In addition, one group will recieve supplemental antioxidant for one year, the second group will recieve supplement as a placebo for two months and then antioxidant suppliment for 10 months, the third group will receive placebo as a supplement for one year.</description>

    <description>Subjects will be followed with six-monthly evaluations for a period of 4 years and praziquantel therapy will be offered if subjects have demonstrable S. mansoni eggs on the six-monthly evaluations. Over the four year period we plan to assess the time required for the reversal of the various stages of schistosomal periportal fibrosis.</description>
