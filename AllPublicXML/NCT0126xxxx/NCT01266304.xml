      The overall objective of this study is to develop and test an efficient self-report
      instrument to measure Complementary and Alternative Medicine(CAM)-relevant contextual factors
      important in healing.

      The initial phase of the study involves developing and refining an item bank. During the
      initial 'item bank development' phase, the investigators will run focus groups and cognitive
      interviews with individuals who participate in CAM and conventional medicine interventions.

      The current protocol in ClinicalTrials.gov pertains only to the initial phase of the study
      involving focus groups and cognitive interviews.

      The next step of instrument development is called Calibration, and will involve administering
      the revised item bank to an internet sample and to persons who receive services in a CAM
      clinic and a conventional primary care setting. The items will be calibrated using item
      response theory and classical test theory. This will result in a computerized adaptive
      testing version of the instrument, as well as a static short form of the instrument.

      The final phase of the project will involve conducting initial validation studies of the
      instrument. The instrument will be called the Healing Encounters and Attitudes List (HEAL).
      The investigators will evaluate the convergent, discriminant, and predictive validity of the
      HEAL in a sample of 200 persons with chronic low back pain who are receiving physical
      therapy, chiropractic care, or mindfulness-based stress reduction. For convergent validity,
      the HEAL is expected to display moderate to large correlations with measures of similar
      constructs. The HEAL is expected to correlate modestly with self-report measures of general
      psychosocial functioning, in support of discriminant validity. Finally, HEAL score should
      account for a significant proportion of the variance in treatment outcome, supporting
      predictive validity.

      This project will develop and test a patient self-report measurement tool to assess the
      perceived contextual factors, such as patient attitudes and expectations, patient provider
      relationship factors, and environmental factors that contribute to healing. Our project is
      synergistic with the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Roadmap initiative, Patient Reported
      Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS), and will use the rigorous instrument
      development and validation methodology of PROMIS. The overall objective of this study is to
      develop an efficient self-report instrument to measure CAM-relevant contextual factors
      important in healing, hereafter referred to as the Healing Encounters and Attitudes List
      (HEAL), and conduct initial validation in persons seeking CAM and conventional treatment for
      pain.

      Specific Aim 1: Develop an item bank. We will employ several iterative steps used
      successfully in PROMIS to identify items that assess contextual factors of healing relevant
      to CAM. Initial steps in developing an item bank include: a) compilation and evaluation of
      existing instruments and relevant questions, b) consultation with experts, and c) focus
      groups with individuals who participate in CAM and conventional medicine interventions, and
      d) item editing. During the initial year of this study, we expect to identify conceptual
      areas of potential importance to CAM interventions and patients, and identify and edit items
      to create an item bank assessing these conceptual areas.

      Specific Aim 2: Calibrate items. We will use item response theory (IRT) and classical test
      theory (CTT) to calibrate the items from Aim 1 on three samples: 1) an internet-based sample
      (n= 1000), 2) 100 outpatients participating in CAM interventions at our Center for
      Integrative Medicine (CIM), and 3) 100 outpatients at a General Internal Medicine clinic.
      During year 2-3 we administer the items in the item bank to the 1200 persons, conduct IRT and
      CTT analyses and refine the item bank to only those items that best assess the constructs.
      Specific aim 2 will result in a Computerized Adaptive Testing (CAT) version of the HEAL,
      which maximizes information while minimizing patient time burden. A static short form of the
      HEAL will be derived from the HEAL CAT in Aim 2.

      Specific Aim 3: Conduct initial validation studies. We will evaluate convergent,
      discriminant, and predictive validity of the Healing Encounters and Attitudes List (HEAL) in
      a sample of chronic low back pain (CLBP) patients receiving CAM and conventional medicine
      treatments. The validity studies will use two samples of adults with CLBP: 100 persons
      receiving CAM treatments: chiropractic manipulation (CM) or mindfulness-based stress
      reduction (MBSR) at the CIM, and 100 persons receiving conventional care (physical therapy)
      at Centers for Rehab Services referred by the General Internal Medicine Clinic (GIMC) of the
      University of Pittsburgh Medical Center (UPMC). We will administer the CAT version of the
      HEAL questionnaire developed in aims 1 and 2 as well as conventional measures of treatment
      expectancy, confidence in treatment provider, psychosocial functioning, and treatment outcome
      measures for CLBP of pain and disability.

        -  Hypothesis 3a: Scores on the HEAL measure will display moderate to large correlations
           (r's &gt; .50) with similar self-report measures, supporting convergent validity.

        -  Hypothesis 3b: Scores on the HEAL measure will correlate modestly (r's = .20-.35) with
           self-report measures of general psychosocial functioning, supporting discriminant
           validity.

        -  Hypothesis 3c: HEAL scores will account for a significant proportion of variance in
           treatment outcome in both samples. In addition, we predict that HEAL scores will
           demonstrate incremental validity, i.e., they will account for significant incremental
           variance in outcome beyond that accounted for by existing measures of treatment
           expectancy and related constructs.
