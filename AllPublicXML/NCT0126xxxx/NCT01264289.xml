      The objective of this study was to evaluate the relative bioavailability of the test
      formulation of finasteride 5 mg tablets (Dr. Reddy's Laboratories Limited) with the reference
      formulation PROSCAR® 5 mg Tablet (Merck &amp; Co., Inc.)under fasting conditions in healthy adult

      This randomized, single-dose, two-treatment, two-way, crossover study was conducted to
      compare the relative bioavailability of two formulations of 5 mg finasteride tablets under
      fasted conditions. The study was conducted with 26 (25 completed) healthy adults. The
      subjects received the test product in one study period and the reference product in the other
      period; the order of administration was according to the dosing randomization schedule. There
      was a 7-day interval between treatments.
