  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the absolute oral bioavailability and intravenous
      pharmacokinetics of GSK962040. The oral dose of 50 mg has been selected because it was well
      tolerated following single oral administration and it is considered to be within therapeutic
      dose range. The need to characterize the intravenous disposition of GSK962040 is in
      anticipation of drug use in special populations such as critically.

    <textblock>
      GSK962040 is a selective non-peptide motilin receptor agonist which is being developed for
      the treatment of conditions associated with slow rates of gastric emptying. The purpose of
      this study is to determine the absolute bioavailability and the metabolic profile of
      GSK962040. Subjects will be administered a single oral dose of 50 mg followed by a single
      intravenous dose of 10 mL containing 100 microgram (not more than 270 nCi, 10 kBq) 14C
      GSK962040, administered by infusion over 15 minutes, beginning at 90 min after administration
      of the oral dose (approximate Cmax). The oral dose of 50 mg was well tolerated following
      single oral administration and is predicted to be a therapeutic dose. There is need to
      characterize GSK962040 disposition in anticipation of drug use in special populations such as
      critically ill patients. The intravenous (infused) microdose (100 microgram) is 500-fold
      lower than the oral dose, therefore exposure to GSK962040 originating from the infused
      microdose is considered negligible.

             active disease or physical or mental impairment). A subject with a clinical
             abnormality may be included only if the Principal Investigator or physician designee
             considers that the abnormality will not introduce additional risk factors and will not
             interfere with the study procedures. Consultation with the GSK medical monitor is
             required before such subjects may be included.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  A positive pre-study Hepatitis B surface antigen or positive Hepatitis C antibody
             result within 3 months of screening

             product within the following time period prior to the first dosing day in the current
             study: 30 days, 5 half-lives or twice the duration of the biological effect of the
             investigational product (whichever is longer).

          -  .Exposure to more than four new chemical entities within 12 months prior to the first
             dosing day.

          -  Participation in a clinical trial involving administration of 14C-labelled compound(s)
             within the last 3 months.

             history of drug or other allergy that, in the opinion of the investigator or GSK
             Medical Monitor, contraindicates their participation.

          -  Where participation in the study would result in donation of blood or blood products
             in excess of 500 mL within a 90 day period.
