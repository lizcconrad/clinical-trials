      The cross sectional area of posterior tibial nerve (PTN) is increased in diabetic patients
      with distal symmetric polyneuropathy (DSPN) as compared to diabetic patients without DSPN.
      This study aims to evaluate whether the cross sectional area of the Posterior Tibial Nerve
      (PTN) as measured by ultrasound is increased in patients with distal symmetric polyneuropathy
      (DSPN) as compared to diabetic patients without DSPN.

    <textblock>
      Regional anesthesia is associated with a low frequency of neurologic injury that can result
      in permanent deficit. It is believed that patients with neuropathies might be at higher risk
      of injury but detailed investigation of the diabetic patient is lacking yet anesthetic
      practices may be altered nevertheless. This study intends to investigate the appearance and
      sonographic qualities, as well as electrophysiologic measures, of the posterior tibial nerve
      (PTN) in diabetic patients undergoing nerve conduction studies in order to compare PTN
      characteristics between diabetic patients with peripheral neuropathy to those without.
      Ultimately, we hope that ultrasound, a commonly used non-invasive tool, will be able to
      assist in the identification of patients at higher risk of injury from regional anesthesia

    <description>The criteria for assessment of severity of DSPN is as follows:
No neuropathy: diabetic patients with no sign or symptoms of neuropathy, and normal NCS;
Incipient neuropathy: diabetic patients with signs, and symptoms of neuropathy, and normal NCS;
Subclinical neuropathy: Diabetic patients without signs of symptoms of neuropathy and abnormal NCS;
Moderate neuropathy: diabetic patients with signs and symptoms of neuropathy and abnormal NCS;
Severe neuropathy: diabetic patients with signs and symptoms of neuropathy and abnormal NCS, with absence of the sural nerve response.</description>
