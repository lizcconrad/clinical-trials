  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A number of psychosocial risk factors have been strongly related to a range of health
      problems (chief among them CVD). Clinical research has shown that behavioral interventions
      have enormous promise to ameliorate the psychosocial distress, the health-damaging effects
      and the costs associated with these risk factors. However, few such programs have been
      implemented in a large-scale way. Corporations are increasingly interested in providing such
      services for their employees, but they have encountered difficulties in knowing which
      programs are most effective. Until these programs are developed as products that can be
      tested and shown to produce consistent benefits, dissemination of these beneficial programs
      will be hindered. Taken together, these findings make a strong case that the development of a
      standardized, protocol-driven behavioral intervention package that can be delivered in a wide
      range of corporate settings presents a remarkable commercial opportunity. The overall goal of
      this SBIR Fast-Track-funded project is to gain empirical evidence in a RCT that documents the
      effectiveness of the Williams LifeSkills Workshop (a protocol driven 6-session workshop) in
      reducing BP, psychosocial risk factors, and promoting positive health outcomes in a cost
      effective manner in a corporate setting. This empirical support, tested in a setting
      independent of the program developers and by an experienced research team, will then be used
      to help market the product in the corporate wellness marketplace. It is hypothesized that
      participants (employees in an urban medical center) in the LifeSkills intervention will
      experience greater reductions in blood pressure and improvements in measures of psychosocial
      well-being than those receiving usual medical care and given educational materials on
      reducing BP.

    <description>The Usual Care group received a self-help brochure on BP control developed by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI). In addition, with the participants' permission, their BP readings were sent to their listed physicians, along with the 1-page JNC-7 express summary for the management of high BP.</description>
