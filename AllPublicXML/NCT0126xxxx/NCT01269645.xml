  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this project is to examine the impact of providing cancer patients
      with audiovisual information about clinical trials on attitudes towards clinical trial
      participation. It is hypothesized that patients provided these materials will have more
      favorable attitudes toward clinical trial participation compared to patients not provided
      these materials.

      Participants will be randomized to either: (1) an intervention condition in which they will
      be asked to view a short video and read an accompanying brochure about clinical trials
      developed by the investigative team; or (2) a control condition in which they will be asked
      to read the National Cancer Institute's brochure entitled &quot;Taking Part in Cancer Treatment
      Research Studies.&quot; Self-report data will be collected at two timepoints: 1) in person
      following study enrollment, but before receipt of material related to intervention assignment
      (baseline/Time 1), and 2) by telephone interview between 7 and 28 days following study
      enrollment (follow-up/Time 2). In addition, data will also be collected from medical records
      six weeks after study enrollment.

    <description>The secondary objectives are to examine the impact of audiovisual information about clinical trials on knowledge, self-efficacy, receptivity, and likelihood of participating in a clinical trial. It is hypothesized that patients provided audiovisual materials will be more knowledgeable about clinical trials, will believe themselves to be more capable of participating in a clinical trial, will be more receptive to learning more about a clinical trial, and will report greater likelihood of participating in a clinical trial if asked compared to patients not provided these materials.</description>

    <description>The tertiary objective is to explore the impact of providing cancer patients with audiovisual information about clinical trials on actual participation in clinical trials. Since this aim is exploratory, no hypothesis is offered.</description>
