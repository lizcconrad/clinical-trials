  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), which affects at least 20% of adult
      Americans, may be especially common and severe in Veteran patients. Proton pump inhibitors
      (PPIs), which block gastric acid production, are the most effective medications for GERD, and
      the VA spends more than $177 million each year on outpatient PPI prescriptions. PPIs do not
      prevent the reflux of non-acidic material and do not completely eliminate esophageal acid
      exposure, however, and bothersome GERD symptoms persist in approximately 40% of patients
      treated with PPIs. Recent studies using the new technique of esophageal pH/ impedance
      monitoring, which detects the reflux of both acidic and non-acidic materials, have shown that
      PPI-resistant GERD symptoms correlate with episodes of reflux (acidic and/or non-acidic) in
      approximately one-half of patients. For those patients, an antireflux operation might relieve
      symptoms and obviate the expense of ineffective PPI therapy, but the efficacy of modern,
      laparoscopic fundoplication in this regard is not clear. For patients with PPI-resistant GERD
      symptoms, furthermore, the efficacy of medications that that can prevent gastroesophageal
      reflux (e.g. baclofen) or diminish pain of esophageal origin (e.g. neurotropic agents like
      desipramine) also is not clear. Study Hypothesis: Laparoscopic antireflux surgery (Nissen
      fundoplication) is superior to medical therapy (PPIs plus baclofen and desipramine) for GERD
      patients who, while on PPIs, have persistent episodes of heartburn that are associated with
      reflux episodes or with abnormal esophageal acid exposure by esophageal pH/impedance
      monitoring.

      Study Goals: The primary goal is to compare the efficacy of laparoscopic Nissen
      fundoplication and medical therapy (PPIs plus baclofen and desipramine) for GERD patients
      who, while on PPIs, have persistent episodes of heartburn that are associated with reflux
      episodes or with abnormal esophageal acid exposure by esophageal pH/impedance monitoring, and
      to compare the efficacy of each therapy with placebo. Secondary goals are: 1) To determine
      the frequency with which non-GERD disorders underlie &quot;PPI failure,&quot; 2) To determine the
      frequency of functional gastrointestinal symptoms, anxiety and depression in patients who
      have persistent heartburn while on PPIs, 3) To determine whether functional gastrointestinal
      symptoms, anxiety and depression is associated with the outcomes of medical and surgical
      therapies, and 4) To determine whether the outcome of Nissen fundoplication is associated
      with adherence to technical aspects of the operation.

      Study Design: At 15 VA medical centers, there will be a 30-month recruitment period to enroll
      393 patients with heartburn that is refractory to PPI therapy. Patients will have their
      baseline GERD symptoms scored using the GERD Health-Related Quality of Life (GERD-HRQL)
      index, and will have endoscopy, esophageal manometry and esophageal pH/impedance monitoring
      while on PPI therapy. Patients who have episodes of heartburn that are associated with reflux
      episodes or with abnormal esophageal acid exposure by esophageal pH/impedance monitoring will
      be randomized to one of three treatment groups: Surgical Treatment (laparoscopic Nissen
      fundoplication), Active Medical Treatment (omeprazole and baclofen initially; desipramine for
      baclofen failures) or Placebo Medical Treatment (omeprazole, placebo baclofen, placebo
      desipramine). All patients will have quarterly clinic visits for symptom scoring and
      laboratory testing. At one year, patients will have a final symptom scoring and repeat
      endoscopy, esophageal manometry and esophageal pH/impedance monitoring. Treatment success
      will be defined as 50% improvement in the GERD-HRQL score at 12 months. Patients also will
      complete the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), Rome III Functional GI Disorders
      Questionnaire and the Short-Form Health Survey (SF-36) at baseline and one year. The results
      will be correlated with treatment outcomes.
