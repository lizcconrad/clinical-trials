  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Urothelial carcinoma of the bladder mostly is chemically induced and represents the second
      prevalent urooncological disease. About 20% of newly diagnosed urothelial carcinoma cases of
      the bladder are already advanced or metastasized. Before 2008 2009 no second line therapy
      after failure of primary systemic therapy of advanced / metastatic disease was established
      outside of clinical trials. The actual standard for this situation was a supportive,
      symptomatic therapy. Vinflunine has demonstrated improved survival from 4.3 to 6.9 months
      (p=0.04), with an adequate disease control, good symptom control and with acceptable
      toxicity. Based on these results, this compound became standard se¬cond line treatment for
      refractory metastatic bladder cancer disease after failure of platinum-containing therapy. As
      the prognosis still remains poor, new treatment opportunities have to be explored.

      The target-specific therapy with Pazopanib suggests a positive influence of both inductive
      and perioperative treatment of solid tumors. Pazopanib has been approved by the FDA and the
      EMA for the treatment of advance renal cell carcinoma. Results for advanced urothelial
      carcinoma are missing so far as well as data on tolerability of the combination of both
      vinflunine and pazopanib. As the pharmacodynamic properties as well as the safety profile of
      both drugs are different, assumption is justified that there might occur additive efficacy
      effects without addition of adverse outcomes. Aim of the study thus is

        1. To define the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of Pazopanib in combination with Vinflunine
           in a phase-I-setting and

        2. To further assess efficacy and safety of the combination at the MTD level in phase II.

      During the pase-I-part of the study different doses of pazopanib will be added to the
      standard vinflunine scheme in groups of 6 patients maximum. Dose escalation will only be
      performed in the next patient group if not more than one out of six patients shows
      dose-limiting toxicity. Each patient will be treated with the drug combination for a duration
      of two vinflunine cycles, that is six weeks.

      During the phase-II study new patients will be treated with the drug combination at
      maximum-tolerated dose until disease progression (assessed by RECIST 1.1 procedures).
