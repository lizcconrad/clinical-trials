      The investigators will describe the characteristics, prevalence, incidence, severity
      co-morbidity and management of patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) in
      the UK. 100 practices will be sampled amounting to a total study population of about 10 000
      patients. Information will be collected electronically and, where necessary, by a hand search
      of patient records.

      Research questions:

        1. What is the recorded prevalence of COPD in the UK? [numerator: the prevalence of COPD
           defined as ANY current READ code for COPD or inclusion in a COPD register denominator:
           the whole population]

             -  What proportion of this population has documented spirometry to confirm the
                diagnosis?

             -  What proportion has documented spirometry in the last year?

             -  What proportion has ever had a documented history of asthma?

             -  What proportion currently has a documented history of asthma?

             -  What proportion currently smokes?

             -  What proportion of smokers has a record of receiving smoking cessation advice?

             -  What proportion of smokers has had a prescription for smoking cessation therapy?

             -  What proportion of people with COPD has a READ code for exception reporting?

             -  What are their demographic features? (height weight, BMI, age, smoking status,
                forced expiratory flow in 1st second (FEV1_, DOSE)

             -  What proportion of people with COPD has a READ code for exception reporting from
                spirometry?

             -  What are their demographic features? (height, weight, body mass index (BMI), age,
                smoking status, FEV1, DOSE)

           Sub analysis: descriptions and comparison of prevalence by • Age

           • geographical location of participating practices

           • primary care training practice

           • number of performing general practitioners (GPs) in practice (&lt;3 v &gt;/= 3)

        2. What is the incidence of COPD in the UK

           • number of people with a new diagnosis of COPD in the last year as a proportion of the
           whole population

        3. What is the distribution of severities of COPD?

           • Description of severity of airflow obstruction by FEV1 measurement:

           Mild (FEV1 ≥ 80% predicted):

           Moderate (FEV1 50% to 79% predicted) Severe (FEV1 30% to 49% predicted) Very severe
           (FEV1 ≤ 30% predicted)

           • And by DOSE

           Compare the severity of disease (exacerbation rate) according to DOSE &quot;high risk&quot; and
           &quot;low risk&quot; and compare this to the stratification of severity in the study population by
           degree of airflow limitation.

           • And by COPD Assessment Test (CAT)

           Explore the use of CAT in clinical practice and the availability and spread of data

        4. What is the exacerbation rate?

             -  In the last year in people with a diagnosis of COPD &gt; 1 year

             -  In the last three years in people with a diagnosis of COPD &gt; 3years (as a
                proportion of the population with COPD).

             -  What is the seasonal variation of COPD exacerbations: what proportion of
                exacerbations occurs in each month of the year?

             -  Do recurrent primary care managed exacerbations predict hospital admissions? What
                is the prior exacerbation rate in patients admitted to hospital? Population of
                interest: those with hospital admissions for COPD: what is the exacerbation rate
                (and time frame of exacerbations) prior to a hospital admission?

                4a. What proportion of the COPD population had at least one exacerbation?

           Hospital attendance: Any documented visit to any secondary care (not primary care out of
           hours) site with no overnight stay

           Hospital admission: Any documented visit to any secondary care site with an overnight
           stay with a principal diagnosis of COPD or chest infection or pneumonia or exacerbation
           of asthma ICU admission: Any documented admission to any high dependency unit (note, AN
           EXPLORATORY EXERCISE. Validity of this data in primary care record is questionable)

           Death: Any death with COPD documented as the primary cause or within 14 days of the
           onset of an exacerbation (EXPLORATORY)

             -  Does DOSE predict undesirable outcomes (death, hospital admission, exacerbation
                rate)?

             -  Does FEV1 predict undesirable outcomes (death, hospital admission, exacerbation
                rate)?

             -  Does medical research council dyspnoea (MRC) score (or other component of DOSE)
                predict undesirable outcomes?

             -  Possible exploratory analysis: does ADO index (Age, Dyspnoea (MRC score)
                Obstruction (FEV1 % pred)) predict undesirable outcomes?

             -  Does number of patients in a practice receiving a Tiotropium prescription predict
                hospital admission at a practice level?

        5. Therapy:

             -  What proportion of patients (without a diagnosis of asthma) receives inhaled
                glucocorticosteroids at unlicensed doses (any steroid (fluticasone, budesonide,
                beclometasone, ciclesonide) or combination Seretide, Symbicort, Fostair) EXCEPT
                Seretide Accuhaler 50/500 or Symbicort?

             -  What proportion of patients with FEV1&gt; 50 and no diagnosis of asthma receive any
                steroid preparation? (Note: Seretide Accuhaler 50/500 is licensed for use in
                patients with COPD and (pre-bronchodilator) FEV1 &lt; 60% predicted and is therefore
                not subject to off label use in this instance). The approach outlined here is a
                consensus for the purposes of identifying a pragmatic approach to data collection.

             -  What proportion of patients with FEV&lt;50 do not receive any inhaled steroid?

             -  What proportion of patients with 1 or more exacerbation in the last year does not
                receive any inhaled steroid?

             -  What proportion of patients with FEV1 &lt;50 do not receive Seretide 50/500 or
                Symbicort?

             -  What proportion of patients are on &quot;triple therapy&quot; i.e. Seretide or Symbicort PLUS
                Tiotropium, classified by severity (FEV1)

             -  What is the refill rate for prescriptions by class (all above and SABA) in the
                previous year?

             -  What proportion of patients have an MRC dyspnoea score &gt;/= 3?

             -  What proportion of these patients has been referred for pulmonary rehabilitation?

             -  What proportion has received pulmonary rehabilitation?

             -  What proportion has documented evidence of receiving a self management plan?

        6. Co-morbidities:

           What proportion of patients with COPD have any READ code ever for the following
           co-morbidities:

             -  Cardiovascular disease

             -  Cerebrovascular disease

             -  Diabetes Mellitus

             -  Cancer

             -  Lung cancer

             -  Depression

             -  Osteoporosis What proportion of patients with at least one comorbidity has attended
                a specialist chest service / clinic in the last year? What is the exacerbation rate
                in this group v patients without comorbidity? What is the hospital admission rate
                in this group v the rest? What proportion of the population has a record of NEVER
                smoking? What are the features of this group (age, sex, geography, exacerbation
                rate, medication, comorbidities

        7. Newly diagnosed patients

             -  What are the characteristics (demographics: height weight, BMI, age, smoking
                status, FEV1, DOSE) of newly diagnosed patients (first READ code for COPD within
                the last year)?

             -  What proportion of these patients received a prescription for Tiotropium within 1
                month of diagnosis?

             -  What proportion of these patients received a prescription for an inhaled
                corticosteroid / longa acting beta-agonist fixed dose (ICS / LABA) combination
                within 1 month of diagnosis?

             -  In patients FEV1 &lt;50% predicted, what proportion receive a) Tiotropium and b) an
                ICS / LABA combination first

             -  What proportion of these patients with FEV1&gt;50 received a prescription for ICS /
                LABA combination within 1 month of diagnosis?

        8. General Practice Research database (GPRD)

             -  What proportion of our sample currently contributes to the GPRD database?

             -  Are their differences in the features of the two groups: Age geographical location
                of participating practices, primary care training practice, number of performing
                GPs in practice (&lt;3 v &gt;/= 3), disease severity (DOSE, FEV1) exacerbation rate

        9. What changes have there been at practice level to the above parameters in the last year?
