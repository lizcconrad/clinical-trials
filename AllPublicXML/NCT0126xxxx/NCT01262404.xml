  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Three groups of subjects are trained to practice mindfulness meditation, compassion
      meditation, or attend a health training control class. Individuals from each group will
      undergo structural and functional brain imaging before and after training. The hypothesis is
      that the compassion meditation group will show the largest changes in brain structure and
      function. In a second series of experiments, the subjects practicing a Tibetan meditation
      practice will be undergo MRI thermometry imaging to construct detailed three dimensional
      temperature maps of their bodies before, during, and after they perform this practice.

      Structural (MRI) Imaging will be used to measure changes in cortical thickness in the pre and
      post training groups. Function (fMRI) Imaging will be used to measure changes in cortical and
      sub-cortical responses to a series of affectively controlled visual images, presented during
      scanning. MRI Thermometry Imaging will be used to construct three dimensional temperature
      maps of subjects while performing meditation in the scanner.
