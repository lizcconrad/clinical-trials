    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, randomized phase II study. Patients will be randomly assigned to
      either FL or TS-1/irinotecan preoperative chemotherapy regimens by stratification. Patients
      in FL group will be treated with bolus injections of 5-FU 400 mg/m2/day and LV 20 mg/m2/day
      for 3 consecutive days every 4 weeks for 2 cycles, and patients in TS-1/irinotecan will be
      treated with irinotecan 40 mg/m2/day on days 1, 8, 15, 22, 29. TS-1 at a dose of 35mg/m2 was
      administered orally twice a day after a meal on the day of irradiation (Monday-Friday)
      concurrent with radiotherapy.

      administered orally twice a day after a meal on the day of irradiation (Monday-Friday)
      concurrent with radiotherapy. Total 45-50.4 Gy radiations in 25-28 fractions to tumor and
      draining lymph nodes will be delivered concurrently. Curative surgery (especially total
      mesorectal excision will be considered as 1st choice of surgical procedure) will be performed
      for about 4-8 weeks after the completion of chemoradiotherapy. Postoperative chemotherapy
      regimen is 5-FU plus leucovorin.
