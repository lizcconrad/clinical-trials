    <textblock>
      Modern orthopedic and spine surgeons strive towards minimizing surgical exposure and towards
      increased precision in the placement of implants. This trend requires an increased use of
      fluoroscopic guidance, which leads to increased exposure of the patient, surgeon and the
      operating room staff to radiation.

      Robotic assisted spine surgery is routinely performed in the authors' institution for a
      variety of indications such as degenerative conditions, trauma, tumors , infections and
      deformity correction11. The objective of this study is to compare the radiation exposure time
      during robotic guided vertebral body augmentation to the published results for similar
      surgeries.

    <description>Robotic guidance: SpineAssistâ„¢ (Mazor Surgical Technologies, Caesarea, Israel), is a bone-mounted miniature robot. It is a semi-active system offering surgical tool guidance while leaving performance of the actual surgical operation, such as the drilling, in the surgeon's hands.</description>
