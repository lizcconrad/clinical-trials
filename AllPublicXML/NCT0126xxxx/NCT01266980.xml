      This study will assess the saftey of giving fluticasone furoate 200mcg/GW642444M 25mcg once
      daily for 7 days to patients with severe renal imparement. The results of this study will aid
      in deciding whether a FF/GW642444M doseadjustment is justified in subjects with severe renal
      impairment and in estimating any such adjustments.

      This is an open-label, non-randomized study which will assess the pharmacokinetics and safety
      following 7 days once daily dose of inhaled FF/ GW642444M (200/25mcg) in subjects with renal
      impairment. Nine subjects with severe renal impairment (as defined by a Clcr&lt;30mL/min) will
      be recruited along with healthy control subjects (as defined by a Clcr&gt;80mL/min matched to
      the severe subjects based on gender, ethnicity, body mass index (±15%) and age (±5 years)).
      All subjects will receive fluticasone furoate 200mcg/GW642444M 25mcg once daily for 7 days.
      The results of this study will aid in deciding whether a FF/GW642444M dose adjustment is
      justified in subjects with severe renal impairment and in estimating any such adjustments.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

        A subject will be eligible for inclusion in this study only if all of the following
        criteria apply:

          1. Male or female between 18 and 70 years of age inclusive, at the time of signing the
             informed consent.

          2. A female subject is eligible to participate if she is of:

               -  Non-childbearing potential defined as pre-menopausal females with a documented
                  tubal ligation or hysterectomy; or postmenopausal defined as 12 months of
                  spontaneous amenorrhea [in questionable cases a blood sample with simultaneous
                  follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) &gt; 40 MlU/ml and estradiol &lt; 40 pg/ml (&lt;140
                  pmol/L) (healthy subjects only) is confirmatory]. Females on hormone replacement
                  therapy (HRT) and whose menopausal status is in doubt will be required to use one
                  of the contraception methods in Section 8.1 if they wish to continue their HRT
                  during the study. Otherwise, they must discontinue HRT to allow confirmation of
                  post-menopausal status prior to study enrollment. For most forms of HRT, at least
                  2-4 weeks will elapse between the cessation of therapy and the blood draw; this
                  interval depends on the type and dosage of HRT. Following confirmation of their
                  post-menopausal status, they can resume use of HRT during the study without use
                  of a contraceptive method.

               -  Child-bearing potential and agrees to use one of the contraception methods listed
                  in Section 8.1 for an appropriate period of time (as determined by the product
                  label or investigator) prior to the start of dosing to sufficiently minimize the
                  risk of pregnancy at that point. Female subjects must agree to use contraception
                  until completion of the follow-up visit.

          3. BMI within the range 19.0 - 33.0 kg/m^2 (inclusive).

          4. Capable of giving written informed consent, which includes compliance with the
             requirements and restrictions listed in the consent form.

          5. Single QTcF &lt; 450 msec; or QTcF &lt; 480 msec in subjects with Bundle Branch Block.

          6. Able to satisfactorily use the dry powder inhaler.

             Healthy Subjects:

          7. Healthy as determined by a responsible and experienced physician, based on a medical
             evaluation including medical history, physical examination, laboratory tests and
             cardiac monitoring. A subject with a clinical abnormality or laboratory parameters
             outside the reference range for the population being studied may be included only if
             the Investigator and the GSK Medical Monitor agree that the finding is unlikely to
             introduce additional risk factors and will not interfere with the study procedures or
             outcome.

          8. AST, ALT, alkaline phosphatase and bilirubin ≤ 1.5xULN (isolated bilirubin &gt;1.5xULN is
             acceptable if bilirubin is fractionated and direct bilirubin &lt;35%).

          9. Creatinine clearance &gt; 80mL/min calculated by the Cockcroft-Gault equation using serum
             creatinine.

             Renally Impaired Subjects:

         10. AST and ALT &lt; 2xULN; alkaline phosphatase and bilirubin ≤ 1.5xULN (isolated bilirubin
             &gt;1.5xULN is acceptable if bilirubin is fractionated and direct bilirubin &lt;35%).

         11. Creatinine clearance &lt; 30mL/min calculated by the Cockcroft-Gault equation using serum
             creatinine.

         12. Subjects with renal insufficiency must have stable renal function defined as ≤ 25%
             difference in creatinine clearance assessed on two occasions. Renal function will be
             based on estimated creatinine clearance (CLcr) calculated by the Cockcroft-Gault
             equation using serum creatinine obtained on two occasions separated by at least 4
             weeks within the last 3 months (historic data is permitted for the first measurement).

        Exclusion Criteria:

        A subject will not be eligible for inclusion in this study if any of the following criteria
        apply:

          1. Suffered a lower respiratory tract infection in the 4 weeks before the screening
             visit.

          2. Taken oral corticosteroids less than 8 weeks before the screening visit.

             product within the following time period prior to the first dosing day in the current
             study: 30 days, 5 half-lives or twice the duration of the biological effect of the
             investigational product (whichever is longer).

          8. Exposure to more than four new chemical entities within 12 months prior to the first
             dosing day.

          9. Use of nephrotoxic medications 4 weeks before dosing.

         10. Where participation in the study would result in donation of blood or blood products
             in excess of 500 mL within a 56 day period.

         19. Any adverse reaction including immediate or delayed hypersensitivity to any beta2-
             agonist, sympathomimetic drug, or any intranasal, inhaled, or systemic corticosteroid
             therapy. Known or suspected sensitivity to the constituents of the Novel DPI (i.e.,
             lactose or magnesium stearate). History of drug or other allergy that, in the opinion
             of the investigator or GSK Medical Monitor, contraindicates their participation.

             study) or condition (including pancreatitis or acute cholecystitis) which the
             investigator considers sufficiently significant to interfere with the conduct,
             completion, or results of this trial or constitutes an unacceptable risk to the
             subject.

         23. Urinary tract or bladder infection within 4 weeks of the first scheduled
             administration of study drug.

         27. Hemoglobin or hematocrit below the reference range at screening.

         28. Use of prescription or non-prescription drugs, including vitamins, herbal and dietary
             supplements (including St John's Wort) within 7 days (or 14 days if the drug is a
             potential enzyme inhibitor) or 5 half-lives (whichever is longer) prior to the first
             dose of study medication, unless in the opinion of the Investigator and GSK Medical
             Monitor the medication will not interfere with the study procedures or compromise
             subject safety.

             Renally Impaired Subjects:

         29. Life expectancy less than 3 months.
