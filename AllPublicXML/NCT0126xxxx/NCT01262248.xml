    <textblock>
      Recent studies have shown that narrow-band imaging (NBI) is a powerful diagnostic tool for
      the differentiation between neoplastic and non-neoplastic colorectal polyps. The aim of the
      present study is to develop and evaluate a computer-based method for automated classification
      of small colorectal polyps on the basis of vascularization features.In a prospective study
      207 polyps with a size of 10mm or smaller should be detected by a zoom NBI colonoscopy. These
      polyps were imaged and subsequently removed for histological analysis. the polyp images were
      analyzed by a computer algorithm. The proposed computer-based method consists of several
      steps: preprocessing, vessel segmentation, feature extraction and classification. The results
      of the automatic classification (sensitivity, specificity, negative predictive value,
      positive predictive value and accuracy)were compared to those of human observers, who were
      blinded to the histological gold standard.
