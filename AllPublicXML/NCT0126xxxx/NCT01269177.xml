    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to define the current treatment of patients ospitalized with
      acute cardiogenic pulmonary edema. Clinical and laboratory data collected in the Emergency
      Department will used to investigate the primary outcome (mortality) and risk factors related
      to the primary outcome.

      ACPE is a common cause of presentation to the Emergency Department (ED). Early recognition of
      high-risk patients could help in better locating human and technical resources and in
      deciding adequate treatment and site of care.

      The investigators planned a real life, multicentric, prospective, web-based observational
      study performed in Italian Emergency Departments.

      The investigators enroll consecutive patients admitted to the Emergency Department with acute
      cardiogenic pulmonary edema, that is defined as all the following: respiratory distress,
      bilateral rales and congestion on chest X-ray.

      Demographic, clinical and laboratory findings are collected on admission and during
      hospitalization to evaluate mortality and risk factors related to mortality.
