      The purpose of this study is to determine whether Duloxetine (cymbalta) can reduce pain
      severity in patient with Systemic Lupus Erythematosus.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Duloxetine (Cymbalta) is a reuptake inhibitor of both serotonin and norepinephrine. By
      increasing levels of serotonin and norepinephrine, the descending inhibitory pain pathways
      may function better. These pathways lessen the perception of pain. Results of double blind,
      placebo controlled, clinical trials investigating the effectiveness of Duloxetine (Cymbalta)
      have shown that at doses of 60 mg once a day or 60 mg twice a day, Duloxetine (Cymbalta)
      demonstrated significantly higher rates of treatment response for pain when compared to
      placebo.

      Given the positive findings in other clinical trial studies for Duloxetine (Cymbalta) such as
      Diabetic Peripheral Neuropathy (Raskin et al., 2005) and Fibromyalgia (e.g. Arnold et al.,
      2005), the investigators hypothesize that Duloxetine (Cymbalta) may reduce the pain severity,
      frequency and intensity of exacerbations in patients with SLE.

    <description>This is a pilot study designed to explore the efficacy of Duloxetine (Cymbalta) 60 mg to 120 mg once daily (QD) on the reduction of pain in patients with Lupus pain. The primary objective will be measured by comparing changes from baseline and end of study in:
1. The Brief Pain Inventory (BPI-SF) average pain questionnaire.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. A diagnosis of Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) according to the American College of
             Rheumatology (ACR) classification criteria, before visit 1.

          2. Able to swallow all required medication without opening or crushing.

          3. Male or female outpatient 18-65 years old at visit 1.

          4. Painful physical symptoms with a frequency &gt; or equal to 2 times per week.

          5. Painful physical symptoms with a score &gt; or equal to 4 on the BPI- SF average pain
             question at visits 1 and 2.

          6. Clinical Global Impression of Severity (CGI-S) score 3 or higher at visit 1.

          7. Able to speak, read and provide informed consent.

          8. Judged by the investigator to be reliable and agree to keep all appointments.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Subjects who have participated in an investigational drug trial in the 30 days prior
             to the screening visit.

          2. Pregnancy, nursing. Women of child-bearing potential (not surgically sterilized and
             between menarche and 1 year postmenopausal) who are not using a medically accepted
             means of contraception (For example, oral contraceptive, contraceptive patch, implant,
             Depo-Provera®, Norplant®, reliable barrier method/devices [diaphragms with
             contraceptive jelly; cervical caps with contraceptive jelly; condoms with
             contraceptive foam; intrauterine devices]

             positive drug screen for a substance at Visit 1, a retest may be performed prior to
             Visit 2 if, in the judgment of the investigator, there is an acceptable explanation
             for the positive result. A retest is not required for a positive result for
             benzodiazepines or hypnotics if the investigator confirms use is within protocol
             criteria.

          4. Serious medical illness, including any cardiovascular, hepatic, renal respiratory
