  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to determine the pharmacokinetic profile of a loading
      dose of intravenous levetiracetam, given for clinical reasons, in term and late preterm
      infants with seizures. Secondary objectives are to evaluate the safety and efficacy of
      levetiracetam in term and preterm infants with seizures.

    <description>Blood specimens for quantitation of levetiracetam and its metabolite L057 will be obtained from an indwelling vascular catheter not used for study drug infusion or by heel stick in three different sampling schedules:
Group 1 (n=6): at times 2-15 minutes after the end of infusion, 1-2 hours, and 12 hours post start of infusion Group 2 (n=6): at times 2-15 minutes after the end of infusion, 2-4 hours, and 18 hours post start of infusion Group 3 (n=6): at times 2-15 minutes after the end of infusion, 4-8 hours, and 20-24 hours post start of infusion</description>
