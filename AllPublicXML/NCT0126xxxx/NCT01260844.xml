      Phase 1, drug-drug interaction study to evaluate the effects of Briakinumab on hte
      pharmacokinetics of single doses of CYP substrate in subjects with moderate to severe
      psoriasis.

      The study does involve 3 days confinement at the beginning of the trial and 4 days at the end
      of the trial. The trial duration is 17 days with 6 visits not including the confinement
      periods. The trial is being conducted in moderate to severe plaque psoriasis subjects. Serial
      blood samples will be taken after each doses of the CYP substrates are administered and blood
      samples will be collected for briakinumab PK and briakinumab ADA.
