      Background:

        -  New weight-loss intervention programs are being studied to determine their effectiveness
           in helping overweight and obese individuals reach a healthy weight. However, these
           programs often have not been tested against each other, and researchers are interested
           in determining which interventions are most effective both immediately and over the long
           term in promoting and maintaining weight loss.

        -  Mindful Tai Chi is a combined form of the meditative martial art tai chi and the
           practice of mindfulness meditation. Tai chi and mindfulness meditation both have common
           philosophical underpinnings that address health promotion and well-being by applying the
           skill of non-judgmental awareness on a moment-to-moment daily basis. More research is
           needed on whether Mindful Tai Chi and mindfulness meditation can help improve various
           health factors in overweight and obese individuals.

      Objectives:

      - To compare the effects of Mindful Tai Chi, mindfulness meditation, walking, or a discussion
      group on the weight and well being of overweight and obese participants.

      Eligibility:

      - Healthy individuals at least 18 years of age who are either overweight or obese (body mass
      index between 25 and 40), have a sedentary lifestyle (have not engaged in more than 1 hour of
      aerobic exercise per week within the last month), and are willing to commit to a specific
      weight-loss intervention program.

      Design:

        -  This study involves four visits for collecting information and 12 weeks of research
           study activities.

        -  During the first visit, participants will hear information about the study and may ask
           any questions. They will be screened with a medical history and physical examination,
           and those eligible will be assigned to one of the four study groups: Mindful Tai Chi
           (MTC), Mindfulness Meditation (MM), Mall Walking (MW), or Weekly Discussion (WD) group.

        -  For the second visit, participants will give blood and urine samples, receive an
           abdominal ultrasound, ride a stationary bicycle for 5 minutes, and fill out
           health-related questionnaires.

        -  For 12 weeks, participants will be involved in the following activities depending on
           their group:

        -  MTC: Class for 2 hours per week, emphasizing the meditation aspects of tai chi. Each
           session will include at least 20 minutes of meditation. Participants will receive
           written instructions and an accompanying DVD in comparable formats specifying a minimum
           of 30 minutes of daily home assignment. In weeks 2 and 8, participants will have a
           workshop for mindfulness skill application in daily activity.

        -  MM: Class for 2 hours per week of mindfulness meditation. Participants will receive
           written instructions and an accompanying DVD in comparable formats specifying a minimum
           of 30 minutes of daily home assignment. In weeks 2 and 8, participants will have a
           workshop for mindfulness skill application in daily activity.

        -  MW: Participants will meet at a designated mall location once a week for 2-hour walk.

        -  WD: Participants will meet at the National Institutes of Health for weekly weight-loss
           discussion.

        -  For the third and fourth visits, participants will receive the same procedures as those
           used in the second visit. These visits will occur at the end of the 12-week activity
           period and at a 3-month follow up visit.

      Objective: The objective of this protocol is to pilot test the efficacy of a Mindful Tai Chi
      (MTC) intervention as an integrative approach to facilitate durable weight loss and
      well-being among sedentary obese and overweight individuals. Numerous interventions for
      obesity are available but the results are temporary, with most individuals returning to or
      exceeding their baseline weights. Contrasting with conventional emphases on quantitative
      weight reduction with factual didactics, exercise and diet, this protocol will focus on
      enhancing individuals integrative resources utilizing mindfulness principles facilitating
      changes in self healthcare behaviors.

      MTC is a combined form of Tai Chi and mindfulness meditation. Tai Chi and mindfulness both
      have common philosophical underpinnings that address health promotion and well-being. Tai Chi
      is a gentle moving meditation that fosters individuals body-mind-spiritual integration
      through specific movements. MTC is a systemic intervention with multidimensional effects on
      health and well-being that facilitate healthy lifestyle by applying the skill of
      non-judgmental awareness on a moment-to-moment daily basis. We hypothesize improvements in
      health and well-being variables of the participants.

      Study population: Healthy ambulatory volunteers 18 years and older with BMI between 25 and &lt;
      40 will be recruited from the greater Washington area. Exclusion criteria include mental or
      physical health limitations that impede participation in the treatments or assessment of
      outcome variables.

      Design: A randomized controlled clinical trial: comparing the MTC group to an active health
      education (HE) control group. These groups will participate in the assigned activities in a
      90 minute session twice a week for 10 weeks. All groups will be assessed at baseline and upon
      completion of the treatments at week 10 and at a 2 month follow-up.

      Outcome measures: The primary outcomes are changes in weight and multiple domains of
      well-being. BMI and intra-abdominal fat by abdominal ultrasound will measure weight changes.
      Physical well-being variables include biomarkers (lipid profile, BP, CRP, Leptin, IL 6, and
      A1C), aerobic fitness from VO(2) max measurement with 6 to 10 minutes of a treadmill test,
      and telomerase activity in leukocytes. A battery of questionnaires will measure
      psychological, cognitive-affective, socio-spiritual and overall well-being. Secondary
      outcomes include mindfulness quality and lifestyle indices.
