      The purpose of this research study is to observe body contour changes following treatment
      using the MC1 device. The MC1 System is FDA cleared for relief of minor muscle aches, pain
      and muscle spasm, temporary improvement in local blood circulation, and temporary reduction
      in the appearance of cellulite.
