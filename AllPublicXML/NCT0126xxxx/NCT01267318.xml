      Development of a new diagnostic detection tool for gastrointestinal bleeding.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Literature does not support enough data/knowledge regarding stomach bleeding Hb levels in
      pathological situations and/or stomach bleeding levels following biopsy. It is important to
      understand the approximate concentration level of stomach bleeding before proceeding with
      technology development to insure this technology is capable of detecting such blood levels.

        All gastric juice samples should contain blood. This will be determined by the treating
        physician based on visual assessment in a region alongside the fresh biopsy site just
        performed, and prior to any saline washing.
