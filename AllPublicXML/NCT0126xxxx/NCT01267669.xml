      Background: Efficacy of endoscopic variceal sclerotherapy in achieving initial control of
      acute variceal bleeding and five-day haemostasis has been shown to significantly improve when
      vasoactive drug is added. However, there is limited data whether addition of somatostatin, to
      endoscopic variceal ligation (EVL) improves the efficacy of EVL.

      Aim: To compare EVL plus somatostatin versus EVL plus placebo in control of acute variceal
      bleeding.

      Patients and methods: Consecutive cirrhotic patients with acute variceal bleeding from
      esophageal varices were enrolled in the trial. After emergency EVL, patients were randomized
      to receive either somatostatin (250 mcg/hr) or placebo infusion. Primary endpoint was
      treatment failure within 5 days. Treatment failure was defined as fresh hematemesis ≥2 hour
      after start of therapy or death.
