      The purpose of this research study is to look at how trauma affects the ability of blood to
      clot. The blood of people who suffer a traumatic injury can under-clot or over-clot, and this
      research study will look at blood drawn from people after they suffer a traumatic injury to
      see how well their blood clots.
