    <textblock>
      Treatment options for lumbar spinal stenosis include surgical and non-surgical approaches.
      For most people, the decision depends on how bothered they are by their symptoms and how they
      feel about having surgery. Since individuals with the same clinical presentation may feel
      differently about their symptoms and how they view the benefits and harms of their options,
      there is no agreed upon &quot;best&quot;treatment. It has been shown that, for &quot;preference-sensitive&quot;
      decisions like this one, decision aids (tools that pair balanced, evidence-based information
      regarding treatment options with values clarification) improve patients'knowledge and
      realistic expectations, lower decisional conflict, increase patient involvement in decision
      making, decrease the number of undecided, and increase agreement between values and choice.1
      The Spine Center, in collaboration with the Center for Shared Decision Making (CSDM) at
      Dartmouth Hitchcock Medical Center (DHMC), has been providing patients with decision aids
      (DAs) for several years.

      Hypothesis:

      Patients identified as having low literacy and/or high decisional conflict after viewing a
      video decision aid will show greater resolution of their decisional conflict, higher decision
      self-efficacy and less decision regret if a coaching intervention is paired with a video
      decision aid.

      Decision support in the form of coaching develops patients'skills in preparing for a
      consultation and deliberating about their options.2 A study of women with abnormal uterine
      bleeding showed that pairing coaching with a DA helped patients clarify their values and
      preferences, reduced costs, and increased long term satisfaction.3 The investigators plan to
      assess the impact of coaching in patients with lumbar spinal stenosis who are referred to the
      CSDM for a video decision aid about their treatment options. The investigators are also
      interested to learn whether screening for low literacy and high decisional conflict can
      identify a subgroup of patients who are more likely to benefit from coaching.

    <description>Assess the impact of decision coaching, following a specialty consultation for lumbar spinal stenosis, on levels of decisional conflict.
Assess the impact of decision coaching on decision self-efficacy, the number of treatment decision-related clinical contacts, treatment follow-through and decision regret.
Determine whether we can develop a tool that will allow us to identify patients most likely to benefit from coaching and develop a process to provide coaching to patients who need help making treatment decisions.</description>
