  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In current radiation therapy, imaging (typically, cone beam CT imaging or two orthogonal
      X-ray projection imaging) is done for patient setup before radiation dose delivery. Dose
      delivery typically takes 2 to 5 minutes depending on the delivery technique used for
      treatment. A tumor target may change its position during the dose delivery process. The goal
      of this project is develop a real-time imaging strategy to monitor the tumor position during
      dose delivery and evaluate its potential clinical impact.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  The study population will be drawn from available patient population that will be
             treated using IMRT/VMAT. The Stanford population of IMRT/VMAT will be taken as roughly
             representative of prospective IMRT patients and will not be subdivided by any
             additional characteristics.
