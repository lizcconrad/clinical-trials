      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effects of diltiazem on the pharmacokinetics
      (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD) of E5555 and its metabolites in healthy subjects.

    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, 2-arm study to evaluate the effects of diltiazem given in conjunction
      with E5555 on the PK of diltiazem and its metabolites. This is a Phase 1 study of 24 healthy
      male and female subjects that will be conducted at a single site. The planned duration of
      treatment for each subject is approximately 15 days including 1 day in Treatment Period 1 and
      14 days in Treatment Period 2.
