      A prospective follow-up study was carried out in the Yang Ming branch of the Taipei City
      Hospital between April 2008 and April 2010. Sixty-seven climacteric women with sleep
      difficulty received SZRT at a rate of 4.0 g, thrice daily for four weeks. Baseline scores
      were measured on the Pittsburg Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), followed by further measures at
      the end of weeks one and four. The World Health Organization Quality of Life (WHOQOL)
      assessment and the Menopause Rating Scale (MRS) were undertaken as secondary outcomes.
      Regression models were constructed to explore the score differences between the baseline and
      at weeks one and four by various determinants including age, body mass index (BMI), and
      severity of baseline menopausal symptoms. Among 99 surveyed patients, 67 and 61 were screened
      for intention to treat (ITT) and per-protocol population set analysis, respectively.
      Statistically significant reductions in the PSQI index scores evidenced on the fourth week.
