      To research the effect of vitamin A to newborn respiratory distress syndrome by intratracheal
      administration with surfactant.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Chronic lung disease (CLD) of prematurity is the major cause of long-term disability of
      extremely LBW (ELBW) premature infants, and it is the most cost consumptive disease in
      Neonatal Intensive Care Unit graduates. Vitamin A plays an important role in the development
      of premature lung. Nevertheless, premature infants are prone to vitamin A deficiency. Oral
      supplementation of vitamin A does not alter the incidence of CLD in ELBW infants.
      Intramuscular administration of vitamin A reduced the incidence of CLD. The treatment is
      considered painful and this way is not routinely practiced. Vitamin A is systemically
      bioavailable after intratracheal administration with surfactant in an animal model of newborn
      respiratory distress.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  1.Newborn infants with birth weight &gt;500 gm.

          -  2.Gestational age &gt;24 completed weeks.

          -  3.Intention to manage the infant with non-invasive respiratory support (i.e. no
             endotracheal tube), where either: 1) the infant is within the first 7 days of life and
             has never been intubated or has received less than 24 hours of total cumulative
             intubated respiratory support; 2)the infant is within the first 28 days of life, has
             been managed with intubated respiratory support for 24 hours or more and is a
             candidate for extubation followed by non-invasive respiratory support.

          -  4.No known lethal congenital anomaly or genetic syndromes.

          -  5.Signed parental informed consent

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  1.Considered non-viable by clinician (decision not to administer effective therapies)

          -  2.Life-threatening congenital abnormalities including congenital heart disease
             (excluding patent ductus arteriosis)

          -  3.Infants known to require surgical treatment

          -  4.Abnormalities of the upper and lower airways

          -  5.Neuromuscular disorders

          -  6.Infants who are &gt;28 days old and continue to require mechanical ventilation with an
             endotracheal tube
