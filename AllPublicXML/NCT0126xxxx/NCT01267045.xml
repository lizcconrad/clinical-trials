    <textblock>
      This pilot study is a two arm randomized, controlled clinical trial that evaluated whether a
      standardized Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) intervention reduces symptoms
      associated with Gulf War Syndrome (GWS) more effectively than treatment as usual. Fifty-five
      veterans meeting diagnostic criteria for Gulf War Syndrome were randomized to treatment as
      usual (TAU) or TAU plus an 8-week course of course of MBSR. Study measures were collected at
      baseline, immediate post-MBSR, and 6 months post intervention. Measures were obtained at
      equivalent time points for veterans randomized to TAU only. Following completion of all study
      activities, veterans randomized to TAU only had the opportunity to enroll in MBSR.

      A randomized controlled trial with two arms. 55 veterans meeting diagnostic criteria for Gulf
      War Syndrome were randomized to standard care or standard care plus an 8-week course of
      course of Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR). Study measures were collected at
      baseline, immediate post-MBSR (within one week of completion of the MBSR class) and 6 months
      following completion of the MBSR course. Measures were obtained at equivalent time points for
      veterans randomized to usual care only. Following completion, veterans randomized to standard
      care only had the opportunity to enroll in MBSR.

      This pilot study will whether there is sufficient evidence of benefit to warrant further
      study, and gathered data that will allow estimation of the sample size needed in future
      studies. We also obtained measures working memory and attention, in addition to patient
      self-report measures of symptoms, in order to provide additional assessment of whether MBSR
      is effective. This project is prerequisite to a larger study.

    <description>Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) teaches mindfulness as a non-religious practice of self-observation and self-awareness. Kabat-Zinn developed MBSR in 1979 in response to a growing awareness that medical interventions were often inadequate at addressing chronic pain issues and restoring function and life satisfaction. He drew on his meditation and yoga training to develop this program as a complement to traditional medicine that could help patients live fully despite their chronic medical and psychiatric conditions. Through MBSR an individual's emphasis shifts from a preoccupation with what is wrong to a growing appreciation for what is right and what can be built upon.</description>

The most common clinical method of teaching mindfulness is a standardized class called &quot;mindfulness-based stress reduction&quot; (MBSR), which is available at over 250 hospitals nationwide. MBSR teaches mindfulness as a non-religious practice of self-observation and self-awareness. Kabat-Zinn developed MBSR in 1979 in response to a growing awareness that medical interventions were often inadequate at addressing chronic pain issues and restoring function and life satisfaction. He drew on his meditation and yoga training to develop this program as a complement to traditional medicine that could help patients live fully despite their chronic medical and psychiatric conditions. Through MBSR an individual's emphasis shifts from a preoccupation with what is wrong to a growing appreciation for what is right and what can be built upon.</description>

Each item is a statement, and the subject indicates how much, on a scale of 1 (yes, that is true) to 5 (no, that is not true), he or she agrees with the statement (e.g. &quot;I feel very active.&quot;) Scores range from a minimum of 20 to a maximum of 100; the higher the score, the worse the outcome.</description>

            <description>Participants in this arm undergo the mindfulness training intervention through taking part in a Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction course
The most common clinical method of teaching mindfulness is a standardized class called &quot;mindfulness-based stress reduction&quot; (MBSR), which is available at over 250 hospitals nationwide. MBSR teaches mindfulness as a non-religious practice of self-observation and self-awareness. Kabat-Zinn developed MBSR in 1979 in response to a growing awareness that medical interventions were often inadequate at addressing chronic pain issues and restoring function and life satisfaction. He drew on his meditation and yoga training to develop this program as a complement to traditional medicine that could help patients live fully despite their chronic medical and psychiatric conditions. Through MBSR an individual's emphasis shifts from a preoccupation with what is wrong to a growing appreciation for what is right and what can be built upon.</description>

The interviewing researcher asks the subject to respond to each question (e.g. “Have you had recurrent or intrusive distressing thoughts or recollections about the trauma?”) by indicating how often per week he or she experiences that symptom. For each item, “not at all” is scored as 0; “once per week or less/a little” is scored as 1; “2 to 4 times per week/somewhat” is scored as 2; and “5 or more times per week/very much” is scored as 3. Total scores range from a minimum of 17 to a maximum of 51; the higher the score, the worse the outcome.</description>

          <description>The PTSD Symptom Severity Interview (PSSI) is a 17-question interview that measures the severity of PTSD symptoms in the past month. The interviewing researcher asks the subject to respond to each question (e.g. “Have you had recurrent or intrusive distressing thoughts or recollections about the trauma?”) by indicating how often per week he or she experiences that symptom. For each item, “not at all” is scored as 0; “once per week or less/a little” is scored as 1; “2 to 4 times per week/somewhat” is scored as 2; and “5 or more times per week/very much” is scored as 3. Total scores range from a minimum of 17 to a maximum of 51; the higher the score, the worse the outcome.</description>

        <title>PROMIS Fatigue</title>
        <description>The self-report PROMIS Fatigue measure uses a maximum of 7 questions to assess fatigue symptoms over the past 7 days. Subjects respond to each question (e.g. “How often did you feel tired?) with the following scale:
= never
= rarely
= sometimes
= often
= always
Raw scores are converted to T-scores, which are standardized to a mean of 50. Scores above 50 indicate higher than average fatigue; scores below 50 indicate lower than average fatigue.</description>

The most common clinical method of teaching mindfulness is a standardized class called &quot;mindfulness-based stress reduction&quot; (MBSR), which is available at over 250 hospitals nationwide. MBSR teaches mindfulness as a non-religious practice of self-observation and self-awareness. Kabat-Zinn developed MBSR in 1979 in response to a growing awareness that medical interventions were often inadequate at addressing chronic pain issues and restoring function and life satisfaction. He drew on his meditation and yoga training to develop this program as a complement to traditional medicine that could help patients live fully despite their chronic medical and psychiatric conditions. Through MBSR an individual's emphasis shifts from a preoccupation with what is wrong to a growing appreciation for what is right and what can be built upon.</description>

It is a 39-item self-report questionnaire. Subjects respond to each statement (e.g. “I disapprove of myself when I have irrational ideas”) by indicating how often they agree with the statement on a scale of 1 (“never or very rarely true”) to 5 (“very often or always true”). Scores range from a minimum of 39 to a maximum of 195. Higher scores indicate greater levels of mindfulness.</description>
