      BBK- 2 - study:

      STUDY-SUMMARY

      Background:

      The need for stenting of the main and side branch (double stenting) in the treatment of
      coronary bifurcation lesion primarily depends on the complexity of the bifurcation lesion. If
      the bifurcation lesion is very complex (Medina classification 111, severe stenosis of both
      branches, severe calcified lesion, long lesions etc.) double stenting may be the treatment of
      choice. When double stenting is required, the most frequently used stenting techniques are
      T-stenting and Culotte-stenting. It is still unclear, however, which double stent technique
      yields the best long-term outcome.

      Aim:

      This randomized study will compare the long-term safety and efficacy of T-stenting versus
      Culotte-stenting in the treatment of de-novo coronary bifurcation lesions with drug-eluting
      stents.

      Methods:

      Three-hundred patients in whom a double-stenting technique is intended for the treatment of a
      de-novo coronary bifurcation lesion will be randomly assigned to T-stenting or
      Culotte-stenting with an approved drug-eluting stent. Patients will undergo 9-month
      angiographic follow-up with quantitative coronary angiography. Clinical follow-up is planed
      at 30 days, 6 months, 1 year, 2 years, 3 years and 5 years. The primary study endpoint is the
      maximal percent diameter stenosis in the bifurcation lesion at 9 months. Secondary endpoints
      include binary restenosis (estimated by Quantitative Coronary Angiography (QCA) analysis),
      Target Lesion Revascularisation (TLR), Freedom from Major Adverse Cardiac Events (MACE) and
      the rate of stent thrombosis according to the definition of the Academic Research Consortium
      (ARC definition). The study will have 90% power to detect a 25% reduction in the primary
      endpoint at p &lt; 0.05.

      1. STUDY BACKGROUND:

      Currently, a simple stepwise provisional T-stenting approach is most frequently used type of
      treatment in coronary bifurcation lesions. When stenting of both the side branch and the main
      branch (double stenting) is needed because of dissection, TIMI flow &lt; 2, high residual
      stenosis &gt; 75% there is a variety of techniques, which have been proposed. The most common
      techniques are T-stenting and Culotte-stenting.

      Adriaenssens et al (1) have analysed the data of 132 patients treated with Culotte-stenting
      including Quantitative Coronary Angiography (QCA) analysis and clinical follow-up 1 year post
      Percutaneous Coronary Intervention (PCI). The authors demonstrated an incidence of binary
      angiographic restenosis of 22% for the whole bifurcation lesion. Procedural angiographic
      success was achieved in all lesions (final kissing balloon dilatation was performed in 62 %
      of patients). At 12 months, 28 of 132 (21%) patients had undergone target lesion
      revascularization. The incidence of stent thrombosis (at 1 year) was low (1.5%).

      Ferenc et al. (2) compared systematic T-stenting with the provisional T-stenting in 202
      patients of the BBK 1 study. There was no significant difference between the 2 strategies.
      Overall, maximum percent diameter stenosis in the bifurcation was 31 % at 9 months,
      corresponding to a binary restenosis rate of 11 %. Within 1-year follow-up, this prompted
      target lesion reintervention in 9,9 % of the patients. The risk of late stent thrombosis was
      low (2 %) at 2-year follow-up.

      The randomised multicenter Nordic 2 study addressed the question whether Crush-stenting or
      Culotte-stenting achieves better angiographic and clinical outcome after PCI in bifurcation
      lesions (Erglis et al). The results demonstrated the superiority of Culotte-stenting as
      compared to the Crush-stenting. Major adverse cardiac events (MACE) as primary study endpoint
      occurred in 3.7 % in the Culotte study arm as compared to 4.3 in the Crush study arm (p
      =0.87). Likewise, in the double stent study arm of the BBC One study the Crush-stenting was
      used successfully (Hildick-Smith, TCT Late Breaking Trials 2008).

      Currently, there is no data from randomized trials comparing T-stenting with
      Culotte-stenting.

      2. STUDY DESIGN

      This study is a prospective, randomized, single-center evaluation of the treatment in de novo
      bifurcated coronary lesions comparing a technique of T-stenting with Culotte-stenting using
      approved drug- eluting stents.

      The primary objective of this study is a comparison of T-stenting with Culotte-stenting with
      respect to the maximal percent diameter stenosis within the bifurcation at 9 months. In
      addition the study will assess various safety parameters.

      Three-hundred patients will be enrolled in the study at one investigational site and will be
      randomly assigned to T-stenting or to Culotte-stenting of the bifurcation lesion. Any
      approved drug-eluting stent can be used. The choice of stent is left to the operator's
      discretion.

      2.1 HYPOTHESIS

      The hypothesis of this study is as follows:

      In large coronary bifurcation lesions (main vessel ≥2.5mm, side branch ≥2.25mm) including
      significant ostial side branch disease, Culotte-stenting compared with T-stenting reduces
      maximal percent diameter stenosis at the bifurcation at 9-month follow-upby 25 %, relative.
      results in a lower restenosis rate than T stenting technique with a comparable long-term
      safety.

      3. STUDY ENDPOINTS

      3.1. Primary Study Endpoint

      The primary study endpoint is:

      - Maximal percent diameter stenosis at the bifurcation at 9 months.

      3.2. Secondary Endpoints

      The following secondary endpoints will be evaluated in this study:

        -  Binary restenosis (≥ 50% diameter stenosis) rate at any segment of the bifurcation at 9
           month post procedure

        -  TLR of the main and side branch at 12 months post procedure.

        -  Binary restenosis (≥ 50% diameter stenosis) in the main and side branch at 9 months post
           procedure.

        -  MACE defined as death, Myocardial infarction (Q wave and Non-Q wave), emergent cardiac
           bypass surgery, or TLR at 30 days, 6 months, 1, 2, 3, 5 years.

        -  Device success defined as attainment of &lt; 30% residual stenosis of the target lesion
           using drug-eluting stent (DES)in the main and side branch

        -  Procedure time, radiation time and volume of used contrast medium

             -  Post-procedure thrombotic stent occlusion at 12 and 24 months according to the
                Academic Research Consortium-criteria:

      Stent thrombosis is classified by the ARC definition as definite, probable, or possible and
      as early (0 to 30 days), late (31 to 360 days), or very late (&gt;360 days).

      The definition of definite stent thrombosis requires the presence of an acute coronary
      syndrome with angiographic or autopsy evidence of thrombus or occlusion.

      Probable stent thrombosis includes unexplained deaths within 30 days after the procedure or
      acute myocardial infarction involving the target-vessel territory without angiographic
      confirmation.

      Possible stent thrombosis includes all unexplained deaths occurring at least 30 days after
      the procedure. Intervening target-lesion revascularization is defined as any repeated
      percutaneous revascularization of the stented segment, including the 5-mm proximal and distal
      margins, that preceded stent thrombosis.

      of 20 stratified to the type of drug-eluting stent in clinical use. The size of the block and
      the random sequence will be select by the statistician and will be unknown to the
      investigators and medical staff caring for the patients. Randomization will be performed
      immediately before catheter treatment of the bifurcation lesion.

      5. PROCEDURES BY VISIT

      5.1. Patient Enrollment

      All potential subjects should be consented prior to performing any study related procedures.
      The investigator or representative will explain the nature and scope of the study, potential
      risks and benefits of participation, and answer questions for the patient and/or legally
      authorized representative. If the patient agrees to participate, the informed consent must be
      signed and dated; a copy must be provided to the patient or legally authorized
      representative.

      Baseline data to be collected will include demographics , angiograophic and clinical
      parameters.

      5.2. Laboratory Assessments

        -  ECG prior to procedure and between 12 hours and 24 hours post-procedure or before
           hospital discharge

        -  CK and CKMB and Troponin T prior to procedure and 8 hours, 16 hours and 24 hours
           post-procedure

      5.3. Concomitant Medications

      All subjects receive the medication regimen listed below. All medications administered should
      be recorded in the subjects medical record.

      least 6 months or Prasugrel 10 mg or 5 mg/die for at least 6 months as per clinical
      indication

      Glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors (Abciximab) can be used only for bail out.

      5.4. Coronary Angiography and Intervention

      5.4.1. Angiography

      Using standard procedures for angioplasty, an introducer sheath of at least 6 French will be
      introduced and the heparin bolus will be administered. After introduction of the guiding
      catheter and following intra-coronary injection of nitroglycerin, baseline angiography of the
      vessel will be performed in at least two best views that show the target lesion free of
      foreshortening or vessel overlap, using a 6 French or larger guiding catheter.

      5.4.2. Lesion / Vessel Pre-treatment

      For any patients with multiple lesions requiring treatment at the time of the index
      procedure, lesions outside the target vessel must be treated first successfully.

      The target lesion in the main branch will be crossed with an intracoronary guide wire of
      0.014 inch diameter and a second guide wire is passed into the side branch to protect the
      access. The choice of the appropriate guide wires is up to the discretion of the operator.
      After successful passage with the guide wires the lesion in the main branch should be
      pre-dilated with an appropriately sized balloon. Predilatation of the side branch before
      stenting of the main branch is up to the discretion of the operator.

      5.4.3. Stenting Procedure and Stenting Technique

      Among the many approaches to bifurcation stenting, we chose techniques that avoid non-stented
      gaps at the orifice of the side branch with minimal stent distortion or stent overlap in the
      carina region or the proximal segment of the main branch. Both techniques the provisional
      T-stenting as well the Culotte-stenting provide complete coverage of the side branch ostium.
      Final 'kissing balloon' dilatation should be performed in all patients irrespective of
      whether they were assigned to T-stenting or Culotte-stenting.

      Stents should be selected long enough to cover the lesions completely. If more than one stent
      is needed to cover the lesion in the main or side branch completely, it is recommended to
      overlap the stents 1 - 2 mm. The aim should be to reach a diameter stenosis &lt; 10% without
      proximal and distal dissections. Post dilatation may be performed at the operators
      discretion. Pre or post dilatation technique should avoid balloon injury to any segment of
      the vessel that will not be entirely covered by the drug eluting stent including the patients
      with provisional side branch stenting following an unsatisfactory result after balloon
      angioplasty.

      T-stenting:

      Both vessels have to be wired. Lesion preparation in the main vessel and side branch may be
      undertaken according to operator preference. After lesion preparation, the main branch is
      stented first.

      After placement of the stent in the main branch, rewiring and predilatation of the side
      branch, the second stent in the side branch is advanced and an additional balloon is placed
      in the main branch at the orifice of the side branch. Then, the stent in the side branch is
      positioned, taking care that the marker band and about the first half millimetre of the stent
      are within the main branch stent. When the optimal position of the side-branch stent is
      achieved, the side-branch stent is deployedby a kissing balloon manoeuvre, first inflating
      the side-branch balloon with the stent and immediately afterwards the main branch balloon.

      Culotte stent technique:

      Both vessels have to be wired. Lesion preparation in the main vessel and side branch may be
      undertaken according to operator preference. After lesion preparation, the side branch have
      be stented first.

      The first stent is placed from main branch into the side branch side branch, covering the
      entire diseased segment with a wire jailed in the main vessel. The main vessel is rewired
      through the stent struts, and after removal of the jailed wire, is dilated with a balloon to
      separate stent struts. The side branch wire is then removed (to prevent metal-to-metal jail)
      and the main vessel is stented covering the proximal and distal segment. The side-branch is
      re-wired and high pressure (e.g. 20 atm) individual inflations are made in each vessel at the
      bifurcation point to ensure good stent strut separation. Finally a lower pressure kissing
      inflation is made. For both the high pressure individual and lower pressure final kissing
      inflations, balloon sizing should be in accordance with the diameter of the vessel itself.

      Further treatment to proximal or distal aspects of the main vessel or side branch can be
      continued at the discretion of the operator. At any stage, proximal or distal dissections may
      be treated as required with further stent implantations. At any stage, post-dilatations may
      be undertaken to optimise stent expansion.

      Irrespective of the assigned treatment, glyceryl trinitrate is injected intra-coronarily at
      the completion of the procedure and final angiography of the vessel is performed in the two
      optimal views that were chosen at baseline.

      5.4.4. Stent type

      Any approved type of drug-eluting stent can be used at the operator's discretion.

      5.5. Follow-up Procedures

      All patients enrolled in the study will be required to complete 30 days, 6 months, one, two,
      three and fiv -years follow-up to evaluate long-term results.

      5.5.1. 30 Days (± 5 days) Post Procedure (Telephone contact)

      The assessment will include angina status (according to the Canadian Cardiovascular Society
      Classification of angina), all adverse events, all concomitant medications and any
      interventional treatment that occurred since the the index procedure.

      5.5.2. Angiographic Follow-Up 9 Months (± 14 days) Post Procedure

      As part of current routine clinical practice, all patients will undergo repeat angiography at
      9 months after the index procedure. Angiographies will be performed as described in Section
      5.4.1.

      All films, including unscheduled angiograms, will be analysed to the angiographic core
      laboratory.

      . 5.5.3. At 30 days, 6,12, 24. 36 and 60 Months (± 30 days) post Procedure (Telephone contact
      or contact with family doctor)

      The assessment will include angina, all adverse events, all concomitant medications and any
      interventional treatment that occurred since the previous contact.

      5.5.4 Quantitave coronary angiography:

      For quantitative coronary angiography, angiograms obtained at baseline, at completion of the
      intervention and at 9 month follow-up will be analysed with using a computer based system
      dedicated to bifurcation analysis (Qangio XA, version7.0, Medis, Leiden, Netherlands),
      according to the standard operating procedure of our angiographic core laboratory.
      Quantitative angiographic measurements will be obtained of the three segments of the
      bifurcation lesion: the proximal and distal segment of the main branch and the side branch.
      We will perform measurements in the stented portion of the vessel (in-stent) and in the
      distal or proximal 5 mm margin (edge). In-segment analyses will comprise the in-stent and the
      edge area.

      In addition, the bifurcation angle from the analysis system will be estimated.

      6. SAFETY ISSUES

      All serious adverse events must be reported to the ethic committee.

      These include any complication that:

      results in death is life-threatening results in persistent and significant disability or
      incapacity.

      7. SAMPLE SIZE ESTIMATION

      The study is designed to have a 90% power to detect a 25% relative reduction of the primary
      endpoint by Culotte technique as compared with T stenting at a significance level of 0.05.
      Assuming percent diameter stenosis in the side branch of 30±23 % at follow-up (ref. 10), a
      sample size of 133 patients in each arm is obtained. The study will include 150 patients in
      each arm, to allow for losses to angiographic follow-up.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Clinical indication for interventional treatment of the bifurcation lesion.

          2. There is indication to perform the double stenting as judged by the operator.

          3. Bifurcation lesions according to the Medina classification of a native coronary artery
             with a reference vessel diameter: main branch &gt;2,5 mm; side branch &gt;2,25 mm (the
             difference between vessel diameter of the main and side branch should be ≤1 mm)

          4. The target lesion (main branch and / or side branch) must be at least 50% diameter
             stenosis.

          5. The target lesion has not been previously treated with any interventional procedure.

          6. The target vessel (main branch and side branch) must be feasible for stent
             implantation (successful passage with the guide wire; successful predilataion with an
             appropriately sized balloon; no heavy calcification; no diffuse distal disease that
             might impede run off).

          7. Patient has no other treatment planned within 30 days of the procedure.

          8. Patient has been informed of the nature of the study and agrees to its provisions and
             has written informed consent as approved by the Ethics Committee.

          9. Patient is willing to comply all required post-procedure follow-up.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patient had an acute myocardial infarction (&gt; 3x normal CK ) within 72 hours preceding
             the index procedure and CK has not returned to normal limits at the time of the
             procedure.

          2. Patient will have a known hypersensitivity or contraindication to aspirin, heparin,
             clopidogrel, prasugrel, stainless steel, sirolimus, everolimus, zotarolimus, biolimus
             or contrast sensitivity that cannot be adequately pre- medicated.

          3. Non successful treatment of other lesion during the same procedure

          4. Patient has a platelet count of &lt;100,000 cells/mm³ or &gt;700,000 cells/mm³, a White
             Blood Cells of &lt;3,000 cells/mm³, or documented or liver disease.

          5. Patient has a history of bleeding diathesis or coagulopathy.

          6. Patient has suffered a stroke within the past six months.

          7. Active peptic ulcer or upper gastrointestinal bleeding within the prior 6 months.

          8. Patient has a co-morbidity (i.e. cancer or congestive heart failure) that may cause
             the patient to be non-compliant with the protocol, or is associated with limited life-
             expectancy (less than 2 years).

          9. Indication for oral anticoagulation

         10. Patient must be excluded from the study if any of these angiographic criteria are met:

               1. The target vessel contains intraluminal thrombus.

               2. The target lesion or vessel shows angiographic evidence of severe calcification.

               3. The patient has undergone previous PCI to the target vessel within 6 months.

               4. Pre treatment of the lesion is done with a technique other than balloon
                  angioplasty.
