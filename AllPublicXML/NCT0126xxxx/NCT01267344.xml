  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective is to investigate the objective response rate in patients receiving
      GEMOX (gemcitabine plus oxaliplatin) plus cetuximab as first line treatment in advanced or
      metastatic unresectable BTC biliary tract cancer compared to patients receiving the same
      chemotherapy without cetuximab. The secondary objectives include the exploration of the
      effect of the multimodality strategy on progression-free and overall survival, biomarker
      prediction, and toxicity.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      It is considered realistic, that within 18 months 120 patients can be included in the
      participating centers. Based on the previous publications an objective response rate (ORR) of
      20% is expected in the GEMOX arm (Arm B). When the sample size of evaluable patients is
      between 110 and 120 evaluable patients (ie. 55 to 60 patients per treatment arm), then a
      two-sided 95% confidence interval (CI) for the difference between an arm B response rate PB,
      of 20% and an arm A response rate PA of 30%, 35% or 40% based on the large sample normal
      approximation will have a width between 15.4% and 16.7%. We assume an objective response rate
      of 30% for Arm A, then a two-sided 95% confidence interval (CI) for the difference between an
      arm B response rate PB, of 20% and an arm A response rate PA of 30% will have a width ±15.4%
      when the sample size of evaluable patients is 120 (i.e., 60 patients per treatment arm).
