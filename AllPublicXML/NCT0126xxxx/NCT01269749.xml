      The investigators hypothesize that 131I is an effective therapy for children with Graves'
      Disease (GD) and will not be associated with long-term cancer risks when used in older
      children, but may be associated with excessive levels of whole body radiation in young
      children. To address issues of 131I safety and cancer risk in the pediatric population, the
      investigators propose to: (1) Perform dosimetry to assess whole body radiation exposure
      following 131I therapy in children treated for GD (2) the investigators will assess
      chromosome translocation as related to age and dose of 131I.

      It is anticipated that these studies will provide new insights into RIA use in children and
      provide important information about radiation exposure associated 131I use in children. As
      such, these studies are expected to result in new recommendations for 131I use in the
      treatment of pediatric GD.

      Primary Aims. The investigators propose to assess the safety of 131I use in children with
      hyperthyroidism due to Graves' disease (GD). The investigators will measure whole body
      radiation exposure following 131II therapy in children treated for GD. The investigators will
      assess the effects of GD treatment on chromosome structure.

      These studies will involve collaborative efforts with Dr. Patrick Zanzonico (Memorial
      Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center), who is an expert in 131I dosimetry and Dr. James Tucker
      (Wayne State University), who is an expert in cytogenetic effects of radiation. The studies
      will involve children treated for GD at University of Florida University and Baylor
      University. These studies have been designed with the help of the University of Florida
      Center for Clinical Investigation, Biostatistics Support Unit, which will be involved in data
      analysis.

      Characteristics of study population. The investigators will recruit a total of 150 patients
      diagnosed with GD younger than 18 years of age. All subjects are to be treated with 131I. In
      this trial, children will not be randomized to treatment, but will be treated per physician
      prescribed care. To ensure an equal distribution of age and gender between the two groups of
      children, the investigators stratify enrollment by gender (male vs. female) and age (5-10
      yrs, 10-15 yrs, 15-18 yrs).

      Two sites will enroll patients to achieve the desired sample size: Baylor College of Medicine
      and University of Florida University. These sites have been selected for the following
      reasons. (1) These are large centers where radioactive iodide has been used for decades. (2)
      Each site has treated large number of children with radioactive iodide. (3) Each site has
      computerized patient databases and contact information for children treated with 131I is
      known. (4) The investigators have working relationships with collaborators at these sites.
      Based on the relative patient volumes of Baylor and University of Florida, the investigators
      anticipate that 70% of patients will come from Baylor and 30% from University of Florida.
      Calculations supporting the sample size are detailed in each of the two aims below.

      Patient eligibility. Eligibility criteria include the following:

        1. A diagnosis of GD based on initial laboratory studies showing a suppressed Thyroid
           Stimulating Hormone (TSH) (i.e. &lt;0.01); high total triiodothyronine (T3), high total
           thyroxine (T4) and/or free T4 level; an elevated thyroid stimulating immunoglobulin
           (TSI) titer; increased and diffuse uptake of 123I, 131I, or 99Tc in the thyroid gland.

        2. Age &lt;18 years at the time of GD disease diagnosis.

        3. Non-smoking parents. Subject enrollment. Practitioners in the University of Florida
           Pediatric Thyroid Center and the Baylor Pediatric Endocrinology Division will identify
           eligible individuals for study participation. Patients will be enrolled after
           appropriate consent/assent procedures have been satisfied. At the time of collection,
           the investigators will record age, gender, current treatment, and treatment history for
           Graves' disease (i.e., antithryoid drugs (ATDs) and/or 131I therapy including dose).

      These studies will only be performed on children treated with 131I as part of physician
      prescribed clinical care. Children will not be treated with 131I for the sole purpose of
      generating subjects for this study.

      After treatment is decided upon by the physician and the patient, then the patient will be
      offered participation as to provide balanced enrollment for each treatment/age/gender
      category.

        1. Primary aim (1) and secondary aim (i): Perform dosimetry to assess whole body and tissue
           specific radiation exposure in children treated with 131I and determine potential cancer
           risk from these data. At present, no data are available to assess whole body and
           tissue-specific radiation exposure for children treated with 131I for GD. Theoretical
           modeling has been done, but this has not been based on actual data. Knowing the exposure
           of specific organs to radioactivity can be used to determine tissue-specific risk for
           malignancies. The investigators thus propose to perform a cross-sectional dosimetry
           study on children being treated with 131I to determine tissue specific and whole body
           radiation exposure. These studies have been designed by Dr. David Cheng (University of
           Florida University), Dr. Patrick Zanzonico (Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center; NY),
           and Dr. James Dziura (University of Florida University).

           Patient's Total-Body Mass and Administered Activity. On the day of administration of the
           therapeutic administered activity of 131I, the patient will be weighed. Immediately
           prior to administration, the therapeutic administered activity of 131I will be measured
           in a dose calibrator on the 131I setting, and the activity and the dates and times of
           assay and of administration recorded. This activity will be prescribed by the treating
           physicians at University of Florida or Baylor.

           Gamma Camera Imaging. All 131I gamma camera whole-body scanning will be performed using
           a 20% photopeak energy window (i.e. 364 keV + 10% = 328 to 400 keV) and a scan speed of
           10 cm/min for all scans. The scan length will be set for each patient to include the
           entire patient and the same scan length will be used for all scans of a given patient.
           The exact dates and times of each whole-body scan will be recorded. The time
           post-administration of each whole-body scan will be calculated as the time interval (in
           hours) from the date and time of 131I administration and the date and time of whole-body
           scanning.

           Determination of Organ and Total-Body Activities. The determination of organ and
           total-body activities will use each patient as his or her own calibration standard. The
           patient will undergo a conjugate-view whole-body scan within 30 to 60 minutes after the
           131I administration (i.e. nominally specified as time 0) but before the first
           post-administration void or bowel movement. In addition, scans will be performed at one
           day and, four days after administration of the dose. A blood sample (10cc) will also be
           drawn to measure the amount of radioactive iodide in the blood at these times and for
           assessment of DNA damage markers. For each patient, the net (i.e. background-subtracted)
           geometric-mean count rate for the total body for this initial scan thus corresponds to
           100% of the administered activity. As noted, this scan will be performed at 30 to 60
           minutes post-administration to allow some dispersion of the activity throughout the
           body, so that the effects of scatter and attenuation are grossly the same for this
           initial scan as for subsequent scans of the patient. For the time-0 and each subsequent
           conjugate-view whole-body scan, the posterior (lower-detector) gamma-camera image is
           &quot;mirrored&quot; to align it with the anterior (upper-detector) image.

           The regions of interest (ROIs) will be manually drawn around the organs of interest (the
           thyroid, salivary glands, liver, intestines, stomach, and urinary bladder) and the total
           body. For each organ, its ROI may be drawn in the scan in which it is best visualized
           and then copied and pasted onto the other whole-body scans, translating and/or rotating
           the ROI as needed on these other scans to accurately superimpose it on the organ. Note
           that, for each scan, a single background (BG) ROI, drawn outside of but close to the
           body, may be used.

           Statistical Analysis. OLINDA-based Calculation of Organ Absorbed Doses and Effective
           Dose. The OLINDA dosimetry program will be used to assess absorbed doses (11, 76). In
           OLINDA, the investigators will select the &quot;Fraction and Half-times&quot; option (in OLINDA's
           &quot;Kinetics Input Form&quot;) and enter the best-fit parameters of the respective time-activity
           functions (A/100% and Ta and, if, applicable, B/100% and Tb) for the specified source
           regions - the thyroid, salivary glands, liver, intestinal contents, stomach contents,
           urinary bladder contents, red marrow, and total body. Note that OLINDA requires the
           zero-time intercept values in fraction (not %) of the administered activity. Click &quot;hr&quot;
           radiobutton for the &quot;Half-life Units&quot; and the &quot;Biological&quot; radiobutton for the
           &quot;Half-lives.&quot; Also in OLINDA, the investigators will select iodine-131 (I-131&quot;) as the
           nuclide (in OLINDA's &quot;Nuclide Input Form&quot;) and the anatomic model most closely
           approximating the age or total-body mass of the patient as the model (in OLINDA's &quot;Model
           Input Form&quot;). Then, select the &quot;Main Input Form&quot; and click the &quot;Doses&quot; button to
           calculate the organ doses and the effective dose.

           Evaluation of Radiation exposure. Distributions of the primary outcome measures for the
           total body and organ-specific radiation exposure (described above) will be summarized
           graphically (boxplots) and numerically (means, standard deviations, medians,
           interquartile ranges).

           Radiation exposure (e.g., absorbed dose of 131I in the total body and specific organs)
           will be compared across specific categories of the administered dose of 131I, as well as
           across age groups, and gender using Analysis of Variance (ANOVA). The investigators will
           also evaluate whether there were outcome differences by study site. Should data not
           comply with distributional assumptions required of the ANOVA, alternative non-parametric
           techniques (i.e. Kruskal-Wallis test) will be considered. The investigators will
           correlate the administered dose of 131I with the absorbed dose of the radioactive agent,
           using Spearman's Rank Correlation. In all analyses, alpha of 0.05 will be used.

        2. Primary aim (2) and secondary aim (ii): Assess chromosomal translocations in children
           treated with 131I and evaluate chromosomal translocations as related to patient's age
           and 131I exposure. Low-level, whole body irradiation is a risk factor for cancer 58 .
           The prolonged use of certain medications is associated with the risk of cancer in some
           circumstances as well. Current 131I therapy for Graves' disease in children and adults
           aims for ablation sufficient amounts of thyroid gland to result in a hypothyroid state.
           This treatment, though, will also be associated with low-level whole body irradiation11.
           Studies of adults, who have been treated with 131I, have revealed small increases in
           rates of stomach and breast cancer. Although it has been suggested that children are
           more prone to carcinogenic risks of low level irradiation58, there have not been any
           studies with a sufficient sample size to assess long-term cancer risk in children
           treated with 131I.

      Recent data convincingly show that chromosome translocations are associated with long-term
      cancer risks. Chromosome translocations are a molecular sign of ionizing radiation exposure.
      Importantly, translocations persist for decades after radiation exposure22. This persistence
      makes chromosomal translocations the gold-standard aberration type for performing radiation
      dosimetry when there is a lag between the time of exposure and assessment. Normative data for
      chromosomal translocations are available, as related to age and gender20.

      The investigators therefore propose to perform an observational cohort study of children
      treated for Graves' disease to assess chromosomal translocation. These studies will be
      performed on the children in which dosimetry is performed, as detailed above. The
      investigators will stratify enrollment by gender and age to ensure a comparable distribution
      of these characteristics. The chromosome translocation studies, at baseline and at the 12
      month-follow-up.

      Treatment with 131I. Patients will be treated with 131I as detailed above. Sample Collection.
      Blood will be obtained for chromosome translocation analysis at baseline and at 12 months
      after treatment with 131I, or after receiving surgery or ATDs. For blood collection, a
      heparinized vacutainer will be used to collect 5 ml of blood. Blood will be obtained at the
      time of routine phlebotomy for assessment of thyroid hormone levels.

        1. Sample size calculation. The investigators will test the hypothesis that translocation
           frequencies are higher in subjects receiving 131I compared to subjects receiving
           alternative treatment (ATDs or surgery only) for GD. Since there is a low level of
           chromosomal breaks in healthy children20, if there is an increase in chromosomal
           translocation it should be possible to detect significant increases with a relatively
           small sample size. Our estimates of sample size are based on rates of translocation
           described by Sigurdson who observed rates of 0.2 translocations per 100 cell equivalents
           in children under 20 y. Given these baseline rates and using the PASS 2005 module for
           Poisson regression, the investigators estimated that a sample size of 135 children
           treated with 131I and 135 treated with ATDs or surgery will provide 80% power at the
           two-sided 0.05 significance level to detect a doubling of the chromosomal translocation
           rate between the two groups of patients at 12 months after tre. The investigators will
           aim for 1/3 of the children being in each of the following age groups: 5-10 yrs, 10-15
           yrs, 15-18 yrs. The investigators will enroll 150 subjects in each group to accommodate
           a potential 10% loss to follow-up.

        2. FISH assay for chromosome aberrations. Personnel in Dr. Tucker's laboratory will
           determine the frequency of chromosome translocations using Fluorescence In Situ
           Hybridization (FISH) whole chromosome painting probes. All samples will be coded so that
           the Tucker laboratory will not know the radiation exposure history of the subjects. Cell
           cultures will be initiated 24-48 hr after phlebotomy in Dr. Tucker's laboratory and
           processed according to routine cytogenetic methods. Approximately 1,800 metaphase cells
           will be evaluated per subject, and this will be equivalent to 1,800 x 0.56 = 1,000
           metaphase cells (define as cell equivalents; CEs) as if the full genome had been scored.
           All translocations in cells will be enumerated and the frequency of translocations per
           100 CEs will be used as the dependent variable in the statistical analyses.

        3. Data Analysis. Data analysis will be conducted in collaboration with the Biostatistics
           Unit of the University of Florida Center for Clinical Investigation. All analyses will
           be performed using SAS v9.2 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC) with a two-sided 0.05 type I error
           used to evaluate statistical significance. Frequency distributions and missingness will
           be examined for each variable. The investigators will omit from consideration in further
           analyses variables with homogenous distributions or with a high degree of missingness
           and collapse categorical variables with underrepresented levels. Associations between
           independent variables will be examined using Spearman correlation coefficients,
           principal components and hierarchical clustering (PROC VARCLUS).

           Demographic (age, gender and race of child and primary caretaker), socioeconomic
           (parental education and income), and clinical variables (e.g., duration of Graves
           disease, ATD treatment, and 131I dose) will be compared between the two treatment groups
           at baseline using t-tests for continuous variables and chi-square tests for categorical
           variables. Meaningful clinical differences will be reported and adjusted for in the
           multivariate analysis of chromosomal translocation described below.

           (ii) Comparison of Chromosomal Translocation Frequencies. The number of chromosomal
           translocations at baseline and at 12 months post treatment will be determined using
           means and confidence intervals. These data will also be compared to our data for healthy
           children.

           The investigators will compare the number of chromosomal translocations at baseline and
           at 12 months between groups in a multivariate model, using zero-inflated Poisson mixed
           model analysis69. The zero-inflated Poisson model accommodates the increased variance
           that is typical of count data with a large proportion of zeroes. Furthermore, through
           the inclusion of random effects, the mixed model analysis will allow for the correlation
           from repeated observations. The mixed model also accommodates individuals with
           incomplete observations (i.e. lost to follow-up) under the assumption that given the
           observed data the missing data is not dependent on unobserved values.

           The following fixed effects will be used: treatment group (131I treatment vs. surgery or
           ATD group), selected covariates (e.g., child age and gender, 131I dose, parental
           education or income), time (baseline and at 12months), and time by treatment group
           interaction. A random effect will be used to account for possible correlation between
           the number of chromosomal translocations at baseline and 12 months for the same subject.
           The investigators will also explore whether the effect of treatment on chromosomal
           translocations is modified by the age of child and the received radiation dose, by
           including three-way interaction terms between treatment, age and time or treatment,
           radiation dose and time.

           Several strategies will be imposed to accommodate the likelihood that missing data will
           occur during this study. Prevention is the most obvious and effective manner to control
           bias and loss of power from missing data. Postcard and telephone visit reminders will be
           delivered to participants prior to protocol specified collection times. Alternative
           contacts will be identified on entry into the study to minimize loss-to follow-up.
           Timely data entry combined with weekly missing data reports will trigger protocols for
           tracking and obtaining missing data items or outcome assessments. Despite these
           prevention efforts, it is reasonable to assume missing data will occur. The primary
           analysis method will use a likelihood-based mixed model which accommodates incomplete
           observations and operates under the assumption that the missing data is missing at
           random (MAR)69. Missing data patterns and reasons for dropout will be compared between
           the treatment groups. T-tests, cross-tabulations and logistic regression will be used to
           evaluate whether withdrawal is dependent on any observed variables.

        4. Statistical Considerations: Describe the statistical analyses that support the study
           design.

      The investigators used Power Analysis and Sample Size software (PASS 2005) to estimate
      precision around a mean of radiation exposure (e.g., expressed as mean percent of
      administered activity in an organ/total body or Olinda-based mean organ absorbed dose and
      mean effective dose). A sample of 150 subjects produces a 95% confidence interval equal to a
      mean plus or minus 0.16 standard deviations. From a previously published study of children
      with Graves disease (ages 7-18 years)42, the investigators estimated that our sample of 150
      patients can be stratified into patients who will receive 150-200 Gy and 200-300 Gy. Given
      these proportions, the investigators will be able to estimate stratum-specific 95% confidence
      intervals around the means with a precision of 0.32 standard deviations for the two smaller
      strata and 0.16 standard deviations for the larger strata.

To ensure an equal distribution of age and gender between the two groups of children, we stratify enrollment by gender (male vs. female) and age (5-10 yrs, 10-15 yrs, 15-18 yrs).</description>

          <description>Secondary Aims. (i) As a follow-up to the first primary aim, we will calculate potential cancer risk from the radiation exposure data; and (ii) within the analyses for the second primary aim, we will evaluate chromosomal translocation in children treated with 131I vs. not, as related to age and dose of 131I.</description>
