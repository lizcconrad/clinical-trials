    <description>Nucleoside-analogue naive patient : Clevudine 30mg qd
Assess the complete virological response(HBV DNA &lt; 60 IU/ml) at 24 weeks: Only Clevudine 30mg qd
Assess not the complete virological response at 24 weeks : Add Adefovir 10mg qd
During medication of Clevudine, virological breakthrough : add adefovir 10mg qd
During treatment period, composite virological response : stop the medication and F/U for 2 years
Recurrence after stopping treatment(HBV DNA &gt; 2,000IU/ml) retreat medication at composite virological response.
complete virological response: HBV DNA &lt; 60 IU/ml
virological breakthrough : During antiviral treatment, HBV DNA increased from nadir to 1 log10IU/ml continuously.</description>
