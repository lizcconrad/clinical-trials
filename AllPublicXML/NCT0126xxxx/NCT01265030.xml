  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Desmoid-type fibromatosis (or desmoid tumor) represents an intermediate grade neoplasm with a
      striking predilection for locally invasive growth and recurrence following resection. It
      occurs in children as well as young adults. As a typically localized disease, the historical
      standard of care for treatment has been surgical resection, with or without ionizing
      radiation. In some cases where surgical resection or radiation is not feasible, chemotherapy
      has been used. Two clinical trials conducted in the Pediatric Oncology Group (POG) and the
      Children's Oncology Group (COG) evaluated the role for either low intensity or non-cytotoxic
      chemotherapy for children with desmoid tumor that is not amenable to standard therapy. These
      were largely empirical treatment strategies or based on somewhat anecdotal observations. By
      better understanding desmoid tumor biology, even more effective therapy targeting a
      particular protein that is central to the disease can be developed.

      Desmoid tumor is well-known to be associated with deregulation of the Adenomatous Polyposis
      Cell/beta-catenin (APC/β-catenin pathway). This is true of familial cases associated with
      Gardner's Syndrome and also in sporadic desmoid tumor, nearly all of which display
      histological or molecular evidence of Adenomatous Polyposis Cell/beta-catenin (APC β-catenin)
      pathway activation (Alman et al., 1997; Lips et al., 2009). Several new pieces of evidence
      support the concept that deregulation of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) cell
      proliferation/survival pathway may play an important role in tumor biology when the
      APC/β-catenin pathway is disrupted. Sirolimus, a drug that inhibits mammalian target of
      rapamycin (mTOR), is currently being evaluated as an anti-cancer agent in a variety of tumor
      types, but it has not been previously studied in desmoid tumor.

      The investigators are conducting this pilot study to begin to explore whether mTOR inhibition
      may be beneficial for children and young adults with desmoid tumor.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      We propose a translational research project that will directly test the hypothesis that mTOR
      is active in desmoid tumor in children and young adults. Activity will be assessed by
      clinical and histological studies following a course of pre-operative chemotherapy using
      sirolimus. Clinical response will be measured using validated pain assessment scales because
      desmoid tumor size is unlikely to change during the course of pre-operative chemotherapy in
      this study. Histological response will be based on quantifying the phosphorylation of
      following mTOR targets: thr389p-p70S6K, p-4E-BP1, and ser473p-AKT.
