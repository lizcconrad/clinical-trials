  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether LI administered in combination with
      cyclophosphamide, indomethacin and zinc (CIZ) in a multivitamin combination prior to standard
      of care therapy (surgery followed by radiotherapy or concurrent radiochemotherapy) is safe
      and will increase the overall survival of subjects with previously untreated squamous cell
      carcinoma of the oral cavity or soft palate at a median of 3 years

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Head and neck carcinomas constitute about 5% of all cancers annually worldwide. In the US
      there are about 37,000 new cases annually. Ninety percent are advanced primary squamous cell
      carcinoma (SCCHN). Approximately 2/3 of SCCHN patients present on their first visit with
      locally advanced disease. The median 3 year overall survival(OS) for these patients with
      existing standard of care (SOC) therapies - surgery followed by radiotherapy or combined
      radiochemotherapy - is between 52 and 55%; the 5 year OS is 43%. There are clearly a large
      number of SCCHN patients not well served by available modalities.

      Regional intra or perilymphatic and/or intratumoral or peritumoral low dose cytokine therapy
      may have important therapeutic effects in SCCHN patients and constitute an additional
      anti-tumor mechanism of action different and distinct from current SOC. Leukocyte Interleukin
      Injection (LI) [Multikine]contains a defined mixture of naturally derived cytokines and
      chemokines with demonstrated safety and immunomodulatory activity in animals and in man in
      Phase 1 and 2 clinical trials. LI was administered prior to SOC and in combination with low
      non-chemotherapeutic doses of cyclophosphamide, indomethacin, and zinc (CIZ) in studies with
      LI. The results of these studies indicate that the local/regional injection of mixed
      interleukins (LI) with CIZ prior to SOC can overcome local immunosuppression, break tumor
      tolerance to tumor antigens and allow for a sustainable and effective anti-tumor immune
      response.

      LI is being tested in this large, global, multinational Phase III clinical trial to develop
      definitive proof of its efficacy and safety in treating SCCHN. The trial is an open-label
      randomized multi-center controlled study of LI + CIZ + SOC in subjects with advanced primary
      SCCHN of the oral cavity/soft palate vs. SOC [The Comparator Arms for, Overall Survival, the
      Primary End Point of this Study].

    <measure>Overall Survival (OS) in LI + CIZ + SOC vs. SOC</measure>
    <time_frame>3 year</time_frame>
    <description>OS will be assessed using Kaplan-Meier life-table and compared using a logrank test and confirmed further with tumor stage location and geographic stratified log rank tests. The unstratified logrank test constitutes the primary analysis. A two-sided p-value of 0.05 or less will be considered statistically significant for comparing the two groups. Interim analyses will be performed throughout the study to assess safety, sample size and futility.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Local regional control (LRC) in LI + CIZ + SOC vs. SOC</measure>
    <time_frame>2 years</time_frame>
    <description>LRC is assessed by classifying the first evidence of progression in local and distal sites for the control groups and for the LI treated group. LRC failure includes progression of tumor(s) and nodes or appearance of new disease above the clavicle (but not distant metastases) the reappearance of tumor in the original tumor bed, development of cervical node metastases and new disease above the clavicle other than distant metastases not present at baseline. The total number and corresponding percent of subjects in each of the treated and untreated control groups as well as the time to LRC in days for each group will also be displayed for each group.</description>

    <measure>Progression Free Survival (PFS) in LI + CIZ + SOC vs.SOC</measure>
    <time_frame>3 year.</time_frame>
    <description>PFS will be assessed using Kaplan-Meier life-table and compared using a logrank test and confirmed further with stage location and geographic stratified log rank tests. The unstratified logrank test constitutes the primary analysis.A two sided p-value of 0.05 or less will be considered statistically significant in comparing the groups. The Holm closed-sequential procedure will be used to control type 1 error probability to at most 0.05</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Quality of Life (QOL) in LI + CIZ + SOC vs. SOC</measure>
    <time_frame>3 yr.</time_frame>
    <description>QOL will be based on the EORTC QLOQ-C30 and EORTC QLQ-H&amp;N35. QOL data will be assessed for change in QOL from baseline within and between treatment groups.Between group comparisons will be performed using ANOVA or Wilcoxon rank sum test. Within treatment group change from baseline will be performed using a paired t-test or a signed rank test. Two-sided t-test will be used with no adjustment for type I error. An exact binomial test of each treatment group will be used to assess a 10 point improvement between treatments. A Fisher Exact Test will be used for between group comparisons.</description>
