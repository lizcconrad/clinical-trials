      To evaluate the safety of a new bioresorbable (non-permanent) stent platform in native
      coronary arteries.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Today, coronary artery disease is often treated by placing a metal stent inside the vessel
      that serves as a permanent scaffold. However, it is hypothesized that the stent is no longer
      needed once the artery has healed. This study will evaluate the safety of a bioresorbable
      (non-permanent) stent for the treatment of coronary artery disease. The stent is designed to
      restore blood flow to the artery which allows the artery to remodel (heal), and then resorb
      from the body. The stent supports the vessel during the critical 90-day healing process, and
      then gradually resorbs and is cleared from the body.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Evidence of myocardial ischemia or a positive functional study.

          -  Normal CK-MB.

          -  Target lesion must be located in a native coronary artery where target vessel diameter
             is ≥ 2.9 mm and ≤ 3.3 mm and target lesion length is ≤ 12 mm, both assessed by on-line
             QCA and IVUS

          -  Target lesion must be in a major artery or branch with a visually estimated stenosis
             of ≥ 50% and &lt; 100% with a TIMI flow of ≥ 2.

          -  Staged procedures are allowed in non-target vessels &gt;24 hours before or &gt; 30 days
             after REVA stent implantation

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  A myocardial infarction (CK-MB or Troponin &gt; 3 times normal) within 72 hours of the
             procedure, has signs or symptoms of an ongoing myocardial infarction or has any
             visible thrombus

          -  Unprotected left main coronary disease with &gt;50% stenosis

          -  The target vessel is totally occluded (TIMI Flow 0 to 1)

          -  Target lesion involves a bifurcation (a lesion with a side branch &gt;2.0 mm in diameter
             containing a &gt;50% stenosis)

          -  Target lesion is located within a segment supplied by distal graft

          -  Target lesion has possible or definite thrombus
