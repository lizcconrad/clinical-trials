    <textblock>
      This trial is conducted in Japan. The aim of the trial is to compare pharmacokinetics (at
      which rate the body eliminates the substance from the body) of insulin aspart with
      fast-acting insulin human following intravenous (IV) infusion or intramuscular (IM) injection
      in Japanese subjects with type 1 diabetes mellitus.

    <description>At the first treatment visit, a single dose of insulin aspart at 0.2 U/kg via IM (in the muscle) injection is administered. At the second treatment visit, a single dose of fast-acting insulin human at 0.2 IU/kg via IM (in the muscle) injection is administered. Subjects will resume their usual insulin treatment in the wash-out period of 4-28 days between treatment visits.</description>
