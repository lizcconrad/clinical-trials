  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Fulvestrant is an ER antagonist with no agonist effects, which binds, blocks and degrades the
      ER. Fulvestrant is comparable to third-generation aromatase inhibitors in terms of efficacy
      and tolerability for patients who have progressed on prior tamoxifen therapy and past studies
      have found all three-third-generation AIs to be at least as good as tamoxifen in first-line
      metastatic therapy in postmenopausal women. Fulvestrant has been studied little in
      premenopausal women despite of its attractive mechanism of actions. The clinical
      effectiveness of fulvestrant as a treatment for advanced breast cancer has previously been
      demonstrated at the standard dose (AD; 250 mg/mo) in several phase III clinical trials in
      postmenopausal women. However, there is evidence to suggest that doses of fulvestrant higher
      than 250 mg may have greater pharmacodynamic activity against the ER pathway. Moreover,
      dose-dependent clinical activity has been observed for fulvestrant. The activity of a
      fulvestrant high-dose (HD; 500 mg/mo) regimen has been investigated in two recent studies. A
      pilot Japanese study showed fulvestrant HD to have clinical activity in the treatment of
      advanced or recurrent breast cancer, to be well tolerated, and to result in plasma levels
      approximately double those seen with fulvestrant low-dose. Subsequently, a neoadjuvant study
      comparing fulvestrant low-dose and high-dose reported that significantly greater Ki67 and ER
      downregulation was achieved with the high-dose compared with the low-dose regimen and that
      both doses were well tolerated. A recent randomized trial also showed superior outcome of
      high-dose fulvestrant than AI.

      Based on this rationale, we introduced high-dose fulvestrant with LHRH agonist as a
      randomized trial comparing with AI plus LHRH agonist and LHRH alone in premenopausal
      metastatic breast cancer patients who failed to tamoxifen treatment.

      This randomized phase II trial is studying fulvestrant with goserelin for ovarian suppression
      by goserelin to see how well it works compared to anastrozole with goserelin and goserelin
      alone in recurrent or metastatic ER-positive breast cancer.
