      In relation to their severity, hepatic diseases can significantly modify drug absorption and
      disposition and consequently can interfere with drug efficacy and/or produce toxicity. The
      purpose of this study will be to aid in deciding whether a dose adjustment is required in
      subjects with hepatic impairment and in estimating any such adjustments.

    <textblock>
      In relation to their severity, hepatic diseases can significantly modify drug absorption and
      disposition and consequently can interfere with drug efficacy and/or produce toxicity.
      Pathological modifications of liver structure or functionality might result in complex
      modifications of various factors including liver blood flow, hypoalbuminaemia, indirectly
      affect renal function and reduce the hepatic drug metabolizing capability including the
      microsomal oxidase system [Howden, 1989].

      Although FF/GW642444M is delivered directly to the site of action, i.e. the lungs, a large
      portion of the administered dose is swallowed. For both FF and GW642444 any drug absorbed
      from the GI tract undergoes first pass metabolism via CYP3A4. In addition, drug absorbed into
      the systemic circulation is metabolised in the liver and removed by biliary clearance. Hence,
      there is a possibility that when used by patients with impaired liver function the
      pharmacokinetics of inhaled FF and/or GW642444 may be changed due to reduced first pass
      metabolism and/or reduced clearance. The results of this study will aid in deciding whether a
      dose adjustment is justified and in estimating any such adjustments in patients with impaired
      hepatic function.

      This is an open-label, non-randomized study which will assess the pharmacokinetics and safety
      of inhaled FF 200mcg/GW642444M 25mcg in subjects with hepatic impairment following 7 days
      once daily dosing. Subjects with mild, moderate and severe hepatic impairment (as defined by
      a Child-Pugh score of 5-15) will be recruited along with healthy control subjects matched to
      the moderate subjects (matched on gender, ethnicity, body mass index +/-15%, age +/-5 years).

      Approximately thirty-six subjects will be recruited: 9 subjects for each severity and 9
      matched healthy subjects. All subjects are scheduled to receive FF 200mcg/GW642444M 25mcg
      once daily for 7 days. The dose for subjects with severe hepatic impairment may be adjusted
      to FF 100mcg/GW642444M 12.5mcg after review of the PK and safety data from the moderate and
      healthy matched control subjects. The results of this study will aid in deciding whether a
      dose adjustment is required in subjects with hepatic impairment and in estimating any such
      adjustments.

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

        A subject will be eligible for inclusion in this study only if all of the following
        criteria apply:

          -  Male or female between 18 and 70 years of age inclusive, at the time of signing the
             informed consent.

          -  A female subject is eligible to participate if she is of:

               -  Non-childbearing potential defined as pre-menopausal females with a documented
                  tubal ligation or hysterectomy; or postmenopausal defined as 12 months of
                  spontaneous amenorrhea [in questionable cases a blood sample with simultaneous
                  follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) &gt; 40 MlU/ml and estradiol &lt; 40 pg/ml (&lt;140
                  pmol/L) (healthy subjects only) is confirmatory]. Females on hormone replacement
                  therapy (HRT) and whose menopausal status is in doubt will be required to use one
                  of the contraception methods in Section 8.1 if they wish to continue their HRT
                  during the study. Otherwise, they must discontinue HRT to allow confirmation of
                  post-menopausal status prior to study enrollment. For most forms of HRT, at least
                  2-4 weeks will elapse between the cessation of therapy and the blood draw; this
                  interval depends on the type and dosage of HRT. Following confirmation of their
                  post-menopausal status, they can resume use of HRT during the study without use
                  of a contraceptive method.

               -  Child-bearing potential and agrees to use one of the contraception methods listed
                  in Section 8.1 for an appropriate period of time (as determined by the product
                  label or investigator) prior to the start of dosing to sufficiently minimize the
                  risk of pregnancy at that point. Female subjects must agree to use contraception
                  until completion of the follow-up visit.

          -  BMI within the range 19 - 33 kg/m^2.

          -  Able to satisfactorily use the dry powder inhalation inhaler.

          -  Capable of giving written informed consent, which includes compliance with the
             requirements and restrictions listed in the consent form.

          -  Single QTcF &lt; 450 msec; or QTcF &lt; 480 msec in subjects with Bundle Branch Block.

          -  Able to satisfactorily use the dry powder inhaler.

        Healthy subjects:

          -  AST, ALT, alkaline phosphatase and bilirubin â¤1.5xULN (isolated bilirubin &gt;1.5xULN is
             acceptable if bilirubin is fractionated and direct bilirubin &lt;35%).

          -  Healthy as determined by a responsible and experienced physician, based on a medical
             evaluation including medical history, physical examination, laboratory tests and
             cardiac monitoring. A subject with a clinical abnormality or laboratory parameters
             outside the reference range for the population being studied may be included only if
             the Investigator and the GSK Medical Monitor agree that the finding is unlikely to
             introduce additional risk factors and will not interfere with the study procedures or
             outcome.

        Hepatically Impaired Subjects:

        - Hepatically impaired.

        To be classified as hepatically impaired, subjects must have:

        Known medical history of liver disease with or without a known history of alcohol abuse;
        and A Child-Pugh score of 5-15 to cover all severities (Mild = 5-6 points; Moderate = 7-9
        points; Severe = 10-15 points). The components that contribute to the CP score should be
        directly related to the underlying hepatic disease and not to non-hepatic disease.

        - Subjects with no significant abnormality, apart from impaired hepatic function and
        related symptoms, or clinical examination. A subject with a clinical abnormality may be
        included only if the Investigator considers that the abnormality will not introduce
        additional risk factors and will not interfere with the study procedures. Hepatically
        impaired subjects with other laboratory parameters outside the reference ranges will only
        be included if, in the opinion of the Investigator, the result is not clinically important
        and introduces no additional risk factors.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        A subject will not be eligible for inclusion in this study if any of the following criteria
        apply:

          -  Suffered a lower respiratory tract infection in the 4 weeks before the screening
             visit.

          -  Taken oral corticosteroids less than 8 weeks before the screening visit.

             product within the following time period prior to the first dosing day in the current
             study: 30 days, 5 half-lives or twice the duration of the biological effect of the
             investigational product (whichever is longer).

          -  Exposure to more than four new chemical entities within 12 months prior to the first
             dosing day.

          -  History of sensitivity to any of the study medications, or components thereof or a
             history of drug or other allergy that, in the opinion of the investigator or GSK
             Medical Monitor, contraindicates their participation.

          -  Where participation in the study would result in donation of blood or blood products
             in excess of 500 mL within a 56 day period.

          -  Subjects with any predisposing condition that might interfere with the absorption,
             distribution, metabolism or excretion of drugs or any previous gastrointestinal (GI)
             surgery (except appendectomy or cholecystectomy more than three months prior to the
             study) condition which the investigator considers sufficiently significant to

             pancreatitis or acute cholecystitis which the investigator considers sufficiently
             significant to interfere with the conduct, completion, or results of this trial or
             constitutes an unacceptable risk to the subject.

          -  A positive pre-study Hepatitis B surface antigen or positive Hepatitis C antibody
             result within 3 months of screening

          -  Current or chronic history of liver disease, or known hepatic or biliary abnormalities

             wine or 1 (25 ml) measure of spirits.

          -  Use of prescription or non-prescription drugs, including vitamins, herbal and dietary
             supplements (including St John's Wort) within 7 days (or 14 days if the drug is a
             potential enzyme inhibitor) or 5 half-lives (whichever is longer) prior to the first
             dose of study medication, unless in the opinion of the Investigator and GSK Medical
             Monitor the medication will not interfere with the study procedures or compromise
             subject safety. In particular subjects taking steroids or medications that
             significantly inhibit P450 CYP3A4 (e.g. ketoconazole) must not be included in this
             study.

        Hepatically Impaired Subjects

          -  If in the opinion of the examining physician, an unstable cardiovascular, renal,
             pulmonary, endocrine, metabolic, neurological, haematological or gastrointestinal
             condition is present or any other significant medical condition which the investigator
             considers sufficiently serious to interfere with the conduct, completion, or results
             of this trial or constitutes an unacceptable risk to the subject.

          -  Severe ascities (Child-Pugh ascites score of 3) upon clinical exam, including physical
             exam and abdominal ultrasound at screening. Subjects identified to have moderate

             constitutes an unacceptable risk to the subject.

          -  Patients at risk of requiring a transfusion during the study period, or has
             haemoglobin &lt; 9 g/dL, or has underlying coronary artery disease (or other clinical
             condition) in which a reduction in haemoglobin associated with FF/GW642444M
             administration might be expected to cause clinical deterioration.

          -  Evidence of current significant infection (e.g. spontaneous bacterial peritonitis,
             pneumonia etc.).

          -  Subjects who develop symptoms such as infections or haemorrhage between screening and
             dosing must not be included in the study.

          -  Fluctuating or rapidly deteriorating hepatic function (such as, but not limited to,
             rapidly increasing ascites, rapidly deteriorating mental status, deteriorating hepatic
             function based on prothrombin time [PT], albumin, total bilirubin). Assessment of the
             stability of the subject's hepatic function will be at the discretion of the Principal
             Investigator.

          -  Subjects with significant renal insufficiency as defined by estimated creatinine
             clearance of &lt;50 ml/min, using the Cockcroft and Gault equation.

          -  Subjects with a diagnosis of primary biliary disease such as cholestasis or sclerosing
             cholangitis.

          -  Subjects who need to take any concomitant medication, either prescribed or
             over-the-counter, which may in the opinion of the Investigator, interfere in any way
             with the study procedure or be a safety concern (see Section 9 for the list of
             permitted concurrent medications). In particular subjects taking medications that
             significantly inhibit P450 CYP3A4 (e.g. ketoconazole) must not be included in this
             study.

          -  Subjects who, within the past six months, have had a history of significant drug abuse
             or alcohol abuse.
