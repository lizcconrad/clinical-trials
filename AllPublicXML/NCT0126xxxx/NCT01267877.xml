      The purpose of this study was to determine attitudes regarding the 2009 USPSTF Guidelines for
      breast cancer screening for women in their 40's and assess the effect of one of two newspaper
      articles on their attitudes. The population studied was women seeing their private
      gynecologist for annual exams in the 39-49 year old age group.

      Subjects completed a baseline questionnaire listing demographics, previous experience with
      mammograms, and acquaintances with breast cancer. They then were randomly assigned one of two
      articles (one favorable and one unfavorable) that had been published in the newspaper
      regarding the USPSTF breast cancer screening guidelines. Their attitudes towards the safety
      of the guidelines and their willingness to comply with them was then measured.
