  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Toddlers (2- to 3-year-old children) in foster care often have difficulty regulating behavior
      and biology, and are at risk for a host of mental health problems. Critical issues for
      toddlers straddle the challenges of infancy and preschool years. In particular, toddlers in
      foster care face significant challenges in forming new attachment relationships and
      developing behavioral and biological regulatory capabilities. This project will assess the
      effectiveness of an intervention that targets these issues. Attachment and Biobehavioral
      Catch-up for Toddlers in Foster Care (ABC-T) was developed to help parents: provide nurturing
      care so that children develop secure, trusting relationships; and supporting children when
      they become overwhelmed that enhance children's ability to regulate behavior and biology.
      This intervention's effectiveness will be assessed in a randomized clinical trial.

      This study assesses the efficacy of a 10-session intervention for young children in the
      foster care system. Children are randomly assigned to the experimental condition (ABC-T) or
      to a treatment control (DEF). In the Attachment and Biobehavioral Catch-up for Toddlers
      (ABC-T) condition, children's foster parents receive an intervention that focuses on
      nurturance, following children's lead, and helping children settle when they become
      overwhelmed. In the Developmental Education for Families (DEF) intervention, children's
      foster parents receive an intervention that focuses on enhancing children's cognitive and
      motor skills. Both of the interventions are provided in families' homes for 10 sessions of
      about 60 minutes duration. Outcomes include attachment (assessed in the Preschool Strange
      Situation), cortisol production (assessed diurnally), child behavior problems (assessed
      through laboratory procedures that stress children), and through psychiatric interviews.
