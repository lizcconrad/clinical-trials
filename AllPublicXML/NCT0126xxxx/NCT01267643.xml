    <textblock>
      Aplastic Anemia (AA) is an autoimmune hematologic stem cell disease mediated by activated
      T-lymphocytes that leads to pancytopenia. The disease related morbidity and mortality if left
      untreated can approach 90%. For over 30 years, anti-thymocyte globulin (ATG) in combination
      with cyclosporine (CsA) remains the standard therapy. However, the treatment response with
      ATG is at best between 50-60% with a sizeable number of partial responses. Treatment with ATG
      is also associated with significant toxicity and high relapse rate that can be as high as
      45%. Since the prognosis in refractory and relapsed AA remains poor, there is a need for less
      toxic novel immunosuppressive agents that can improve response rates and remission duration
      in refractory and relapsed AA.

      Alefacept is a human recombinant dimeric fusion protein composed of the terminal portion of
      leukocyte functioning antigen-3 (LFA3/CD58) and the Fc portion of human IgG1. It prevents
      co-stimulatory signals between antigen presenting cells and memory T cells by competitive
      inhibition of CD2 in T cells, induces selective apoptosis of CD4+ and CD8+ memory effector T
      cells by interaction between the Fc portion of IgG1 and the FcyIII in NK cells, and possibly
      direct ligation of CD2 molecules on T cells that subsequently result in the alteration in T
      cell agonist signaling. It has been used successfully in the treatment of other T cell
      mediated disorders particularly psoriasis and steroid refractory graft versus host disease
      (GVHD) with minimal side effects. In a case of liver transplant associated AA (similar to
      transfusion associated AA) which is fatal in most patients, Alefacept induced remission after
      patient did not respond to ATG and other immunosuppressants. The investigators hypothesize
      that the LFA3-CD2 co-stimulatory pathway play an important role in the immune pathogenesis of
      AA and treatment with Alefacept can help treat refractory/relapsed cases of AA.

      OBJECTIVES:

        1. Primary Objective

             -  To define the safety, tolerability, dose-limiting toxicities (DLT), of alefacept in
                relapsed/ refractory aplastic anemia (AA).

             -  To evaluate the efficacy of alefacept in refractory/ relapsed AA by determining
                overall response rates (ORR) which includes complete remission [CR] and partial
                remission (PR) rates.

        2. Secondary Objective

             -  To evaluate for predictive markers for response to Alefacept with relapsed/
                refractory AA and evaluate its effect on the PNH clone. The effects of alefacept in
                major populations of lymphocytes will be evaluated. The absolute numbers of various
                T cell populations including CD3+ T cell, CD3+/CD4+ T cell, CD3+/CD8+, CD57+
                natural killer cell count and CD4/CD8 ratio will be measured as part of an
                immunodeficiency panel by flow cytometry. The functional properties of T cells will
                be evaluated by measuring markers of T cell activation and cytokine production. The
                saturation of CD2 receptors with alefacept will be determined. Occupied CD2 will
                not be detectable by competing antibody in-vitro. The expression of CD2 within
                lymphocytes will be measured prior to the initiation of therapy and every 2 weeks
                prior to and 30 minutes after the administration of alefacept. The presence of a
                Paroxysmal Nocturnal Hemoglobinuria (PNH) clone in patients with AA has been shown
                to correlate with increased response to immunosuppression25.

      OUTLINE: This is an open-label, single center study. Patients will receive intravenous
      Alefacept once weekly for a total of 12 weeks in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity. After completion of the 12 week treatment, patients will go through a
      12 week observation period. After completion of the study, patients will be followed
      periodically. The dose defined in the Phase 1 study will be used for the subsequent Phase 2
      study. Four bone marrow biopsies will be taken at screening, week 13, week 24, and the end of
      study.
