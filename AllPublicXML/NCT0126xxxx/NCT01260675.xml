    <textblock>
      The pharmacokinetics of an orally administered investigational buprenorphine
      hydrochloride/naloxone hydrochloride 2 mg/0.5 mg capsule formulation will be studied. This is
      a single-dose, two period, two treatment, crossover comparative bioavailability study under
      fasting conditions.
