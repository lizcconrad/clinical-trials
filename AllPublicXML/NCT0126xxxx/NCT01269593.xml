  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to see how a new drug, named PUH71, accumulates in the different
      parts of the body &amp; inside tumors and how long PUH71 lasts in the blood, when given to study
      participants in tiny amounts. The results of this study will help researchers (1) plan how
      they will use PUH71 as an experimental new drug (at much-higher doses) for the treatment of
      cancer, in clinical trials; and (2) know whether PUH71 might be used as a drug for detecting
      tumors with scanner machines.

    <description>Patients will receive an injection of up to 11.0 mCi (range: 4.0-11.0 mCi) of 124I-PUH71, followed by serial PET scanning and blood draws, over a period of 3 days. Optional with a fourth day of PET scanning is to be pursued, in willing patients.</description>

    <description>A dose of up to 11.0 mCi (range: 4.0-11.0 mCi) of 124I-PUH71 will be administered intravenously with the patient at rest. 124I-PUH71 scans will be performed at immediately and/or 3-4 hours, 20-24 hours, and 40-80 hours after injection of the radiotracer. Optionally, in willing patients scans will be performed 160-200 hours (~7-8 days) after injection of the radiotracer. At each time-point, a 45-60 minute axial body image is acquired. Images will be acquired on a state-of-the-art PET-CT scanner. A low-dose CT will be obtained immediately-prior to PET imaging, at each time-point. A 30-45 minute scanning timeperiod is typical for clinical PET studies.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with solid malignancy, myeloproliferative neoplasm, myeloma, and/or lymphoma
             (histology confirmed by MSKCC Department of Pathology)

          -  Disease is measurable or evaluable as defined by RECIST (1.1 or original version) or
             other tumor response criteria from an MSKCC IRB-approved clinical research protocol.

          -  This does not apply to patients with myeloproliferative neoplasm. The presence of
             active myeloproliferative neoplasm will be determined by applicable disease specific
             diagnostic criteria and patient assessment by the patient's oncologist and trial
             investigators (eg, manifestations of active MPN such as splenomegaly, abnormal blood
             counts, etc).

          -  Age between 18-90

          -  Negative serum pregnancy test for females of childbearing age (11-55 years) and/or
             lack child-bearing potential

          -  No breast-feeding

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Previous allergic reaction to contrast medium.

          -  Hypersensitivity to iodide products.

          -  Known hyperthyroidism

        Hepatic:

          -  Bilirubin &gt; 1.5 x institutional upper limit of normal (ULN)

          -  AST/ALT &gt;2.5 x ULN

          -  Albumin &lt; 2 g/dl

          -  GGT &gt; 2.5 x ULN IF Alkaline phosphatase &gt; 2.5 x ULN. Renal: Creatinine &gt;1.5 x ULN or
             creatinine clearance &lt; 60 mL/min.

          -  Positive serum pregnancy test for females

          -  Acute major illness (e.g., infection, unstable cardiovascular condition, etc.)
