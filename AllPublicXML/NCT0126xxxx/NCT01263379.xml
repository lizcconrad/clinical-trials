  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This trial will create a skin graft, which the investigators call &quot;LEAES,&quot; using the
      patient's own skin cells that have been genetically engineered in the lab to express a
      missing protein called type VII collagen. The corrected cells will be transplanted back to
      the patient.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The research project involves gene transfer into keratinocytes, which are the majority of the
      cells in the outer layer of skin. In this gene transfer trial we plan to biopsy some skin
      tissue, grow the cells in a skin cell culture (sterile dishes with special fluid that allows
      cells to grow and multiply) and then infect the cells with a virus that we have genetically
      engineered to insert the correct type VII collagen gene. The cells should then make type VII
      collagen.

      The process of inserting the correct type VII collagen gene into cells is called &quot;gene
      transfer.&quot; The virus used is called a &quot;retrovirus.&quot; The virus is made so that it only
      delivers the type VII collagen gene and it should not spread to other parts of the body.
      During the study we will check for growth of the virus.

      After cells have received gene transfer, we will grow the cells in culture into a sheet of
      cells that look like a plastic film. We plan to graft the sheet to wounds. Grafting means we
      will take cells from the culture and stitch them to the patient's skin.
