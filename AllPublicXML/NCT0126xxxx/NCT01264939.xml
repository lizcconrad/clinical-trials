  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is a global Phase III, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled,
      parallel-group study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of omalizumab administered
      subcutaneously as an add-on therapy for the treatment of adolescent and adult patients aged
      12-75 who have been diagnosed with chronic idiopathic urticaria (CIU) who remain symptomatic
      despite standard-dosed H1 antihistamine treatment (including doses up to 4 times above the
      approved dose level), H2 blockers, and/or leukotriene receptor antagonists (LTRA).

        <title>Time to Minimally Important Difference (MID) Response in the Weekly Itch Severity Score by Week 12</title>
        <description>The time to the MID response is the number of weeks from the start of treatment (Baseline) until the time point at which the first MID response occurs. The MID response is defined as a reduction ≥ 5 points from Baseline in the weekly itch severity score. The weekly itch severity score is the sum of the daily itch severity scores over 7 days and ranges from 0 to 21. The daily itch severity score is the average of the morning and evening scores on a scale of 0 (none) to 3 (severe). The Baseline weekly itch severity score is the sum of the daily itch severity scores over the 7 days prior to the first treatment. A higher itch severity score indicates more severe itching.</description>

        <description>The UAS7 is the sum of the daily urticarial activity scores over 7 days and ranges from 0 to 42. The daily urticarial activity score is the average of the morning and evening urticarial activity scores and ranges from 0 to 6. The urticarial activity score is the sum of ratings on a scale of 0 to 3 (0=none to 3=intense/severe) for (1) the number of wheals (hives) and (2) itch intensity over the previous 12 hours, ranges from 0 to 6, and is measured twice daily (morning and evening). The Baseline score is the sum of the daily urticarial activity scores over the 7 days prior to the first treatment. A higher urticarial activity score indicates more urticaria activity.</description>

        <description>A complete responder was defined as a participant with a UAS7 score = 0 at Week 12. The UAS7 is the sum of the daily urticarial activity scores over 7 days and ranges from 0 to 42. The daily urticarial activity score is the average of the morning and evening urticarial activity scores and ranges from 0 to 6. The urticarial activity score is the sum of ratings on a scale of 0 to 3 (0=none to 3=intense/severe) for (1) the number of wheals (hives) and (2) itch intensity over the previous 12 hours, ranges from 0 to 6, and is measured twice daily (morning and evening). The Baseline score is the sum of the daily urticarial activity scores over the 7 days prior to the first treatment. A higher urticarial activity score indicates more urticaria activity.</description>
