  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will compare the effect of two doses of exercise on energy intake and body weight.
      The comparison will be between three groups; two exercise groups and a control group. The
      exercise groups will not be provided with a dietary intervention and the study design also
      includes a non-exercise control group. E-Mechanic trial can make important contributions to
      understanding of the role of exercise dose in weight management. While it is accepted that
      regular exercise plays an important role in general health, the exact role of exercise in
      prevention of weight gain, weight loss and prevention of weight regain remains poorly
      understood despite exercise being widely prescribed for these purposes. The idea that current
      weight management exercise recommendations may produce increased energy intake (or other
      forms on compensation) resulting in disappointing weight loss is an important public health
      issue. The finding of this study could help shape future exercise and weight loss
      recommendations and treatment plans.

      The purpose of the E-MECHANIC Trial is to test the effect of two doses of exercise on energy
      intake, body weight, body composition, activity levels, and metabolic rate. The exercise
      doses will reflect current recommendations for: 1) general health (8 KKW), and 2) weight loss
      (20 KKW). A non-exercise control group will also be recruited. The primary outcome variables
      are: 1) energy intake, and 2) the discrepancy between expected weight loss and observed
      weight loss. Energy intake will be measured using doubly labeled water and laboratory-based
      food intake tests. Secondary outcome variables include resting metabolic rate, activity
      levels (excluding structured exercise), and body composition. Following a comprehensive
      baseline assessment, participants will be randomly assigned to the 8 KKW, 20 KKW, or control
      group in a 1:1:1 ratio. Additional assessments will be conducted at week 4, with another
      comprehensive assessment at week 24. The week 4 assessment is important to determine if
      endpoints change in the short-term, but not long-term.

    <time_frame>6 months after screening</time_frame>
    <description>A comparison of three groups for the effects of energy balance: 1. Healthy Living, 2. Recommended dose exercise, and 3. High dose exercise. Random assignment is determined by chance.
Healthy Living Group: Information tips on a variety of topics, including stress management, the benefits of eating fruits and vegetables, and other health related matters. This information is sent directly to your cell phone or email address throughout the study. Encouragements are sent to attend monthly seminars on various health topics at Pennington. Maintain a baseline level of exercise throughout the study.
Recommended Dose Exercise: 3 t0 4 low-intensity sessions per week, each lasting about 30 minutes, at Pennington Fitness and Wellness Center. All exercise will be done on a treadmill.
High Dose Exercise: 4 to 5 high-intensity session s per week, each lasting about 50-70 minutes, at Pennington Fitness and wellness center. All exercise will be done on the treadmill.</description>

        The study population group will be 198 sedentary, overweight and obese(BMI levels &gt; 25
        kg/m2 and &lt; 40 kg/m2) individuals. Based on previous studies, we expect to enroll 132
        females and 66 males. Participants will be randomly assigned to an 8 kcal/kg/week, 20
        kcal/kg/week, or control group. The exercise groups will be closely monitored during
        exercise sessions for six months in our exercise-training laboratory.
