  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:

      Some patients do not readily absorb vitamin D from intestine. These patients may be helped by
      ultraviolet rays, which can come from sunlight or solar beds. When the skin is exposed to
      ultraviolet B rays (UVB) vitamin D is produced. This usually happens when the skin is exposed
      to sunlight. Vitamin D can also be ingested trough some foods, mainly fatty fish or
      supplements.

      Vitamin D is important for bone, and long-term vitamin D deficiency can lead to osteoporosis.
      Vitamin D may also be important for the immune system—including autoimmune diseases—and the
      cardiovascular system.

      Purpose:

      The main purpose of the study is to learn more about the production of vitamin D3 in the
      skin, by ultraviolet radiation.

      Study Course:

      Day 0: Randomization. Subjects are randomized to two groups. Subjects in both groups will be
      exposed to light in a solar bed for approximately 10 minutes on the first day, but only one
      of the solar beds wields ultraviolet rays. The other has a filter, which filters out the
      ultraviolet rays.

      Blood samples are drawn on the first day at following times: Before solar bed, after at 15
      minutes, 1, 2, 4 and 6 hours.

      Day 1,2,3 and 7 after solar bed exposure:

      Blood samples are drawn and adverse events are registered.
