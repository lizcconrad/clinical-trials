  <brief_summary>

      Background:

      - The Ukrainian Research Center for Radiation Medicine and the U.S. National Institutes of
      Health have been studying cancer risks and outcomes in individuals who participated in the
      decontamination clean-up process following the Chornobyl nuclear accident. Some of these
      individuals were exposed to external radiation at various levels, as well as radioactive
      iodine that may have affected the thyroid and increased the risk of developing thyroid
      cancer. Because more individual and comparative data are needed on the affected populations
      and clean-up workers associated with the Chornobyl accident, researchers are interested in
      collecting personal information and saliva samples from Chornobyl clean-up workers who have
      been diagnosed with thyroid cancer.

      Objectives:

      - To assess the radiation-related risk of thyroid cancer among male Chornobyl clean-up
      workers and collect saliva samples for an initial study.

      Eligibility:

      - Male Chornobyl clean-up workers from Kyiv and Donetsk oblasts who have been diagnosed with
      thyroid cancer.

      Design:

        -  Participants will complete a standardized questionnaire during a personal interview. The
           questionnaire will ask for detailed information on the following areas of study:

        -  Work history, conditions, and activities inside the 70-km clean-up and radiation
           calculation zone.

        -  Residence history inside and outside the 30-km exclusion zone.

        -  Milk consumption between April 26 and June 30, 1986 (to assess radioactivity from
           radioiodine fallout).

        -  Potential non-radiation risk factors for thyroid cancer (e.g., smoking, alcohol
           consumption, family cancer history).

        -  Participants will provide a saliva sample for pilot study testing.

      Background:

      Much is known about the radiation-related risk of thyroid cancer, but there is considerable
      uncertainty about the magnitude of the radiation risk among those who were exposed as adults,
      particularly in males. A large number of clean-up workers, mostly male, who participated in
      decontamination and clean-up activities after the Chornobyl accident were exposed to external
      radiation at various levels. An increased thyroid cancer risk has been reported from studies
      of Russian, Estonian and Latvian clean-up workers, but there is little evidence of a dose
      response. However, recent published data from an IARC study of thyroid cancer cases and
      controls pooled from the Chornobyl clean-up workers in Belarus, Russia and Baltic countries
      show a strong dose response with an estimated risk per unit dose that is much higher than
      those reported from other irradiated populations exposed as adults. Following the completion
      of our NCI study of leukemia among Ukrainian clean-up workers, we are proposing a nested
      case-control study to assess the radiation-related risk of thyroid cancer among the 150,000
      male cleanup workers in Ukraine. In preparation for this study, a pilot study is in progress
      to assess the feasibility of a full study.

      Objectives:

      The objectives are (i) to identify thyroid cancer cases and demographically matched controls
      without thyroid cancer occurring among the 150,000 Ukrainian clean-up workers through linkage
      to the National Cancer Registry and Chernobyl State Registry of Ukraine; (ii) to trace/locate
      and interview a small sample of subjects with thyroid cancer and their respective controls ;
      (iii) to obtain saliva buccal cell samples; and (iv) to locate and transfer thyroid tumor
      specimens from identified cases to the archive maintained at the Research Center for
      Radiation Medicine (RCRM),for diagnostic verification and possible future genetic/molecular
      research using the latest available techniques.

      Eligibility:

      The cohort includes Ukrainian clean-up workers who meet the following eligibility criteria:
      males, first year of service as a clean-up worker (1986-1990); initial registration as a
      clean-up worker in one of the study areas; and age when first worked in the Chornobyl zone
      (under 60). For the pilot study, we will select 100-110 cases with thyroid cancer in three
      study areas, Kyiv, Donetsk and Dnipropetrovsk oblasts and controls (with a case-control ratio
      of 1:3). We will assess the feasibility of proxy interview for deceased thyroid cancer cases
      in the study area.

      Design:

      This pilot study will be conducted in the framework of the planned nested case-control study
      in the cohort of Chornobyl clean-up workers but will involve only a small number of subjects
      with thyroid cancer and their respective controls. Thyroid cancer cases will be identified by
      linkage to the Cancer Registry of Ukraine. Controls will be identified from the Chernobyl
      State Registry. Locating archived tumor tissues will be done by search of the Cancer Registry
      of Ukraine database supplemented by interview data. Consent for transfer of tissues to RCRM
      will be sought at the time of interview.

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:

        For the pilot study, we will select clean-up workers with thyroid cancer reported in three
        study areas, Kyiv, Donetsk and Dnipropetrovsk oblasts and controls (with a case-control
        ratio of 1:3) demographically matched to cases. We estimate the number of these cases will
        be between 100 and 110. These two oblasts have been chosen to represent an area known, from
        the leukemia study, to have a high study participation rate (Kyiv and Dnipropetrovsk
        oblasts) and an area newly added and thus unknown regarding participation rate (Donetsk).
        All study subjects are males and average about 55 years. In view of the very high survival
        rate for thyroid cancer, a majority of the subjects are expected to be alive.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

        Excluded from the study will be those who cannot be located, refuse to participate in the
        study, or do not provide informed consent.
