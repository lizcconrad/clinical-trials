    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of adding AZARGA® as a
      single agent to prostaglandin monotherapy in patients with either ocular hypertension or
      primary open-angle glaucoma.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study consisted of 3 study visits (Screening/Baseline, Week 4, and Week 12). Eligible
      patients self-administered the study medication (AZARGA® Eye Drops), adjunct to their current
      prostaglandin monotherapy for 3 months.

    <measure>Mean Change From Baseline in Intraocular Pressure (IOP) at Week 12</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>IOP (fluid pressure inside the eye) was measured by Goldmann applanation tonometry. A higher IOP can be a greater risk for developing glaucoma or glaucoma progression (leading to optic nerve damage). A more negative change indicates a greater amount of improvement. Only one eye (study eye) contributed to the mean.</description>

    <measure>Mean Change From Baseline in IOP Per Prostaglandin Group at Week 12</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>IOP (fluid pressure inside the eye) was measured by Goldmann applanation tonometry. A higher IOP can be a greater risk for developing glaucoma or glaucoma progression (leading to optic nerve damage). A more negative change indicates a greater amount of improvement. Only prostaglandin subgroups with ≥ 15 patients were analyzed. Only one eye (study eye) contributed to the mean.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Clinical diagnosis of ocular hypertension, primary open angle (including pigment
             dispersion) glaucoma in both eyes.

          -  IOP considered to be safe, in both eyes, in such a way that should assure clinical
             stability of vision and the optic nerve throughout the study period.

          -  Treated with, and in the Investigator's judgment demonstrated an inadequate response
             to, prostaglandin monotherapy for a minimum of 4 weeks at Visit 1. Last dose of
             prostaglandin instilled correctly to put patient within the dosing cycle at Visit 1.

          -  At Visit 1, have an IOP of ≥ 20 mmHg in at least one eye and ≤ 35 mmHg in both eyes
             treated with prostaglandin monotherapy.

          -  Best corrected visual acuity of 1.0 LogMAR or better in each eye.

          -  In any eye not qualifying as a study eye, IOP should be able to be controlled on no
             pharmacologic therapy or on prostaglandin monotherapy alone.

          -  Willing to sign an informed consent form.

          -  Able to follow instructions and willing and able to attend required study visits.

          -  Other protocol-defined inclusion criteria may apply.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Known medical history of allergy, hypersensitivity or poor tolerance to any component
             of AZARGA® that is deemed clinically significant in the opinion of the investigator.

          -  A history of, or at risk for uveitis or cystoid macular edema (CME).

          -  History of ocular herpes simplex.

          -  Corneal dystrophies in either eye.

          -  Concurrent infectious/non infectious conjunctivitis, keratitis or uveitis in either
             eye (excluding Blepharitis or non-clinically significant conjunctival hyperemia).

          -  Intraocular conventional surgery or laser surgery in study eye(s) less than 3 months
             prior to Visit 1.

          -  Risk of visual field or visual acuity worsening as a consequence of participation in
             the study, in the investigator's best judgment.

          -  Progressive retinal or optic nerve disease from any cause apart from glaucoma.

          -  Use of systemic medications known to affect IOP (e.g. oral beta-adrenergic blockers,
             alpha-agonists and blockers, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and calcium
             channel blockers), which have not been on a stable course for 7 days prior to Visit 1
             or an anticipated change in the dosage during the course of the study.

          -  Use of corticosteroids (oral, topical ocular or nasal) within 30 days of Visit 1 and
             during the course of the study.

          -  Bronchial asthma or a history of bronchial asthma, bronchial hyper reactivity, or
             severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease that would preclude the safe
             administration of a topical beta-blocker.

          -  History of severe allergic rhinitis.

          -  A condition, which in the opinion of the principal investigator, would interfere with
             optimal participation in the study, or which would present a special risk to the
             subject.

          -  Use of any systemic carbonic anhydrase inhibitors (CAI) (e.g. methazolamide
             [Neptazane], acetazolamide [Diamox]).

          -  Severely impared renal function.

          -  History of an allergy to sulphonamides.

          -  Bronchial asthma or a history of bronchial asthma, bronchial hyper reactivity, severe
             allergic rhinitis or severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease that would preclude
             the safe administration of a topical beta-blocker.

          -  Pregnant, lactating, or of childbearing potential and not using a reliable method of
             birth control.

          -  Any clinically significant, serious, or severe medical condition.

          -  Participation in any other investigational study within 30 days prior to the

        <title>Mean Change From Baseline in IOP Per Prostaglandin Group at Week 12</title>
        <description>IOP (fluid pressure inside the eye) was measured by Goldmann applanation tonometry. A higher IOP can be a greater risk for developing glaucoma or glaucoma progression (leading to optic nerve damage). A more negative change indicates a greater amount of improvement. Only prostaglandin subgroups with ≥ 15 patients were analyzed. Only one eye (study eye) contributed to the mean.</description>

      <desc>An AE was defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a patient who is administered a study treatment, regardless of causal relationship with the treatment. Reports of AEs were obtained through solicited and spontaneous comments from the patients and through observations by the Investigator as outlined in the study protocol.</desc>

    <limitations_and_caveats>A single-arm, non-randomized study somewhat limits interpretation of efficacy results. A 3-month duration does not allow for long-term safety conclusions; however, data obtained at V2 and V3 did not vary much, indicating a steady state at Month 1.</limitations_and_caveats>
