  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: In patients with chronic liver diseases, liver fibrosis staging is crucial for
      hazard evaluation of future disease complication development and thus for the optimal
      decision making on treatment selections.In the era of antiviral and antifibrotic treatments,
      clinical and research demands are also increasing for non-invasive surveillance of liver
      fibrosis to evaluate the progression or regression. However, local baseline data on liver
      stiffness measurement (LSM) using ARFI technique is still lacking in Taiwan, where viral
      hepatitides are highly endemic. Aim: Using the ARFI elastosonography, we are dedicated to the
      aims to recruit patients based on strict but appropriate criteria, to complete the
      correlation and validity studies between ARFI quantification and the referenced METAVIR
      fibrosis scoring and to conduct subsequent innovative studies on liver diseases. Materials
      and Methods: We plan to perform the ARFI quantification for each HBV or HCV-infected patient
      immediately followed by priorly scheduled conventional liver biopsy for METAVIR scoring
      during the same session of examination. Statistics: The first year's study using ARFI will
      focus on the correlation testings and validity studies using receiver operating
      characteristics.

      Contribution and Future Works: Using the ARFI quantification either as a causal factor or as
      a outcome, we can conduct future analyses ranging from validations, regressions to
      prospective time-to-event analysis among our cohorts.
