      of panitumumab and paclitaxel will provide benefit for patients with metastatic or current
      Squamous Cell Carcinoma of the Head and Neck (SCCHN)

    <description>Paclitaxel 80 mg/m2 may be infused, intravenously, over one hour every week. Panitumumab will be administered every 2 weeks at a dose of 6 mg/kg, using a non pyrogenic low protein binding filter with a 0.20-0.22-μm pore size intravenously over 1 hour ± 15 minutes. Panitumumab will be administered prior to paclitaxel.</description>
