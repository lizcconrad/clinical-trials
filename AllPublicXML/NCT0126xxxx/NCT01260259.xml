    <textblock>
      Remote Ischemic Preconditioning (RIPC) is a treatment that may be associated with improved
      outcomes after cardiac surgery. It can be elicited noninvasively by using a tourniquet to
      elicit transient ischemia over a lower extremity. It is thought to promote anti-inflammatory
      and cell survival pathways, and thus protect remote organs against future ischemic injury. We
      hypothesize that compared to sham treatment, RIPC will be associated with decreased
      post-operative acute kidney, myocardial, and lung injury.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In children undergoing cardiac surgery and cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB), our primary aims are
      to determine whether RPC is associated with: 1) decreased AKI and 2) decreased acute
      myocardial injury. Secondary aims include investigating the effects of RPC on post-procedure:
      1)acute lung injury and 2) morbidity/mortality.

    <description>RIPC will be elicited in the operating room (OR) after anesthesia induction and before start of surgery. After placement of an arterial line, a tourniquet will be placed over a lower extremity. It will be inflated to 15 mmHg above systolic blood pressure for 5 minutes, and then deflated for 5 minutes. This cycle of inflation-deflation will be repeated another 3 times before surgery.</description>
