  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well vismodegib works in treating patients with
      chondrosarcomas that have spread to other places in the body and usually cannot be cured or
      controlled with treatment. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as vismodegib, work in different
      ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from
      dividing, or by stopping them from spreading.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the antitumor activity of GDC-0449 (vismodegib) in terms of 6-month clinical
      benefit rate (complete response, partial response, and stable disease, as per the revised
      Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors [RECIST] criteria 2009).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Best overall response (as per the revised RECIST criteria 2009). II. 1- and 2-year
      progression-free survival. III. 1- and 2-year overall survival. IV. GDC-0449 safety. V.
      Pharmacogenomics analysis of predictive markers of treatment outcome.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive vismodegib orally (PO) on days 1-28. Courses repeat every 28 days in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed up every 3 months.
