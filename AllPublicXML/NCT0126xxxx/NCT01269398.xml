    <textblock>
      Utilization of trans-pedicular trans-discal implants for stabilization of a single lumbar
      motion segment, in conjunction with posterior facets fusion. The trajectories are planned and
      achieved by means of the SpineAssist® system - a computerized, image-based guidance system
      that assists surgeons in precisely guiding spinal surgical tools and implants in line with a
      CT-based pre-operative plan. GO-LIF and SpineAssist are CE marked products.

      Thy study's objective is to to collect data regarding the ability to achieve solide fusion,
      comibing the GO-LIF procedure for spinal fixation and stabilization with percutaneous
      posterior facets fusion.

      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Skeletally-mature patients requiring single-level instrumented fusion from L1 to S1

          2. Men and women, 18-80 years of age.

          3. Unequivocal medical indication for the fixation surgery of a single motion segment of
             the lumbar spine.

          4. Correct coronal profile of the lumbar spine. An asymmetric collapse of the disk space
             in the coronal plane between the vertebral bodies envisioned for instrumentation is by
             itself not an exclusion criterion.

          5. Patient may have, but is not required to, secondary diagnosis of any one of the
             following:

               -  Degenerative spondylolisthesis (Grades 1 and 2) in the sagittal plane with
                  preserved or normal sagittal alignment

               -  Spinal stenosis (Not excluding patient with a need to decompression )

          6. ODI cut-off for inclusion, lower than or equal to 40 for ODI

          7. VAS cut-off for inclusion, lower than or equal to 9

          8. Patient is willing and able to comply with study requirements, including follow-up
             schedule and postoperative management program

          9. Patient must understand and sign informed consent

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Lumbar hyperlordosis &gt; 70° between the end plate of the lumbar vertebral body 1 and
             the end plate of the sacral vertebral body 1.

          2. Deformities of the vertebral bodies envisioned for instrumentation or the sacrum.

          3. Spondylolisthesis &gt; grade 2 acc. to Meyerding.

          4. Scoliosis and other deformities in the coronal plane.

          5. Fractures of the vertebrae envisioned for instrumentation.

          6. Osteoporosis or osteopenia (see below for examination criteria).

          7. Therapy with systemic corticosteroids or immunosuppressants.

          8. Bone metabolism diseases, such as osteomalacia or Paget's disease.

          9. Post inflammatory instability of the vertebral spine.

         10. State after radiation therapy of the relevant vertebral spine region.

         11. Current Marcoumar or heparin therapy for more than 6 months at the time of operation.

             term steroid use).

         30. Any medical condition that would preclude the patient from having surgery, impede the
             benefit of spinal implant surgery or impede the patient from completing the post
             operative rehabilitation plan.

         31. Pregnancy, current or planned during the duration of the study.
