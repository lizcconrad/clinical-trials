  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It has been repeatedly demonstrated that cardiac surgery with the use of extracorporeal
      circulation elicits a systemic inflammatory response and provokes ischemia-reperfusion
      related oxidative stress which could further lead to the development of organ failure in
      critically ill patients. Perioperative levels of macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF)
      and other inflammatory mediators could be involved in adverse outcomes in cardiac surgery.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The trace element selenium (Se) serves as an essential co-factor for the antioxidant enzymes
      Thioredoxin - reductase (TRR) and many other antioxidant enzymes, which protect tissues from
      oxidative stress. In septic patients it has previously been shown that thioredoxin, a TRR
      regulated Redox Enzyme, has the ability to suppress the synthesis of MIF.

      Aim of the present study is therefore to investigate the relation between perioperative
      selenium decrease and the reduction of TRR activity with a possible release of MIF during the
      inflammatory response after cardiac surgery.

    <description>To assess the importance of the MIF ligand/receptor family in a large cohort of patients (n=100) undergoing cardiac surgery and to characterize the underlying molecular events.
Possible correlation between several clinical and laboratory parameters will be analyzed. This is a pilot study to generate hints at future items to be studied in controlled trials.</description>
