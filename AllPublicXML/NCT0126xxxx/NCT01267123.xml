      Colonoscopy is a procedure commonly performed to screen for colon cancer and to look for and
      remove colon polyps. It involves inserting a flexible tube, equipped with a video-camera at
      the tip, through the colon. The insertion process can be difficult in some patients,
      resulting in an uncomfortable and lengthy procedure.We postulate that raising the foot of the
      bed so that the stretcher forms a 15 degrees angle with the floor (&quot;Trendelenburg position&quot;)
      may make the colonoscopy easier and more comfortable to the patient.

      Colonoscopy is a procedure commonly performed to screen for colon cancer and to look for and
      remove colon polyps. It involves inserting a flexible tube, equipped with a video-camera at
      the tip, through the colon. The insertion process can be difficult in some patients,
      resulting in an uncomfortable and lengthy procedure. Colonoscopy procedures are typically
      started with the patient positioned on their left side. If there is later difficulty
      advancing the colonoscope, the patient is shifted to other positions (e.g. back, right side,
      prone). We postulate that raising the foot of the bed so that the stretcher forms a 15
      degrees angle with the floor (&quot;Trendelenburg position&quot;) may make the colonoscopy easier and
      more comfortable to the patient. This is a position commonly used in gynecologic surgery.
      This is a pilot project for us to gain experience with doing colonoscopy this way. The
      enrolled patient will be assigned randomly to 2 groups: one in the standard left lateral
      position and one in the 15 degree Trendelenberg position. We will be collecting data
      regarding the procedure from each group in the form of questionnaire and data sheet which
      will be filled during or at the conclusion of the procedure.
