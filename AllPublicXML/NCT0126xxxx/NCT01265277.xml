    <textblock>
      When babies start day care, they experience many changes, some of which may affect their risk
      for sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS). The investigators want to find out if stress or
      change in the baby's sleep patterns can be a reason for this increased risk for SIDS.

      The overall aim of this study is to describe sleep patterns in infants as they transition
      from home to child care, including 24-hour sleep duration, changes in the timing of daytime
      naps, and changes in nocturnal sleep periods; to describe potential sleep disrupters, such as
      temperature, light and noise, in home and child care settings that may impact sleep quality
      and sleep patterns; to describe markers of parent and infant stress levels during the
      transition to child care; to describe markers of infant circadian rhythm during the
      transition to child care.
