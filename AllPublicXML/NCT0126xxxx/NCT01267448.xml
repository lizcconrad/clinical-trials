  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Saxagliptin + Metformin XR (S+M) will be effective in stabilizing blood glucose (BG) levels
      in patients with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes (T2DM) with severe hyperglycemia (BG levels
      300 to 450 mg/dl) and glucose toxicity and with no criteria for inpatient admission or
      occurrence of severe hypoglycemia compared to glipizide XL.

      The study may provide preliminary evidence to support the role of S+M as a bridging,
      stabilizing and safe therapy in patients with severe hyperglycemia

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There is very little information regarding diabetes discharge regimens for patients with
      recently diagnosed diabetes (&lt;1 year duration) who present with severe hyperglycemia (blood
      glucose 300-450 mg/dl) to the ED or other clinical settings and who do not need to be
      admitted.

      A combination of Saxagliptin+Metformin XR, could be a potential drug combination to be tested
      as an initial treatment in these circumstances compared to Glipizide XL which was shown to be
      effective in our previous study. We expect Saxagliptin to improve beta cell function and
      decrease glucagon levels as was shown for the DPP-IV class medications and in turn improve
      blood glucose levels, while Metformin XR may reduce insulin resistance and hepatic glucose
      output. Such discharge therapy may help to prevent deterioration into acute metabolic
      complications (DKA or hyperosmolar states) and avoid hospitalization. A high proportion of
      patients may achieve glycemic targets without significant hypoglycemia as measured by self
      glucose monitoring and objectively by continuous glucose monitoring system (CGMS). Such an
      easy regimen may safely bridge the time gap until patients will be seen by their providers.

    <description>Non-responder:1 FBG &gt;300 and/or PPBG &gt;400 mg/dl (week 1-6) and FBG &gt;250 and/or PPBG &gt;300 mg/dl in 4 consecutive readings or more (week 7-12).
2. A single confirmed BG of &gt;450 mg/dl. 3. Significant hypoglycemia: Single episode of hypoglycemia with BG &lt; 50 mg/dl or 2 episodes of BG between 50 and 70 mg/dl within 7 days or any episode of symptomatic hypoglycemia.
4. Persistently positive large ketones in urine and/or electrolyte imbalances. 5. Revisit to ED or admission to hospital because of hypoglycemia or uncontrolled hyperglycemia.</description>

    <description>The rate of decline in BG values (mg/dl) in the two groups over the period of twelve weeks will be analyzed using a mixed model (with random intercept) as a sensitivity analysis.

    <description>Hypoglycemia and hospitalization rates will be compared between the 2 groups using either chi-square or Fisher exact test will be used. Binary logistic regression will be used to further analysis to identify predictors of hypoglycemia.</description>

    <measure>The number of fold increase in beta cell function in the 2 arms.</measure>

    <description>The early insulin response (EIR) will be calculated as the ratio of insulin to glucose response at 0 and 30 minutes (ΔI30pmol/l/ΔG30mmol/l,). The homeostasis model assessment to assess basal insulin secretion (HOMA-β cell) and insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) will be calculated. The beta cell response to OGTT will be calculated as area under the curve for glucose and insulin at 0, 30 and 60 minutes using the trapezoid rule.</description>
