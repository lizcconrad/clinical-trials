  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In severe injuries of the radial head with multiple, displaced fracture fragments and
      concomitant ligament damage, excision of the fragments and replacement of the radial head
      with a metallic implant are indicated. Current radial head implants are composed of metal or
      a combination of metal and high molecular weight polyethylene. The prostheses are assembled
      intra-operatively as a solid unit (monopolar) or as an articulating implant with motion
      between the stem and head (bi-polar). The stem of the implant is inserted into the proximal
      radius for support and can be classified as either loose-fitting or fixed. According to the
      investigators, there are no studies that directly compare the clinical and radiographic
      outcomes between different radial head implant designs. The purpose of this retrospective
      study is to compare the clinical and radiographic results in patients treated for an
      irreparable radial head fracture with either a smooth stem, bipolar radial head implant or a
      monopolar, in-growth radial head implant. The study findings may provide useful clinical
      information regarding the similarities and differences in these two implant designs.
