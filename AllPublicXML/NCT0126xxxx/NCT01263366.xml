      This study, a nonrandomized open-label Phase I safety and exploratory study, will evaluate
      the safety of topical norepinephrine in post-surgical breast cancer patients who are
      undergoing radiation therapy.

      The study will also provide information about whether topical norepinephrine can prevent or
      decrease the severity of the radiation dermatitis experienced by these patients.

    <time_frame>Safety will be assessed during the study (5-7 weeks) and at follow-up visits approximately 1, 2 and 4 weeks after the end of the treatment period.</time_frame>
    <description>The primary safety hypothesis is that there will be little or no skin irritation associated with the application of the topical norepinephrine and no systemic effects secondary to transdermal absorption.</description>

    <description>The primary efficacy hypothesis is that the portion of the radiation site that is treated with topical norepinephrine immediately prior to daily radiotherapy will have less severe radiation dermatitis than the adjacent untreated portion of the radiation site.</description>

        Eligibility Criteria

        Subjects must:

          -  be â‰¥ age 18 years of age with a documented pathological diagnosis of Stage Ia (T1, N0,
             M0), Stage Ib (T0 or 1, N1mic, M0) or Stage IIa (T&lt;3cm, N0, M0) infiltrating ductal or
             lobular carcinoma of the breast or ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS).

          -  be post-surgical patients scheduled to be treated with at least 40 to 50.4 Gy to the
             whole breast and axilla using either standard or hypofractionated radiation techniques
             . An additional 10-16 Gy boost to the lumpectomy region may also be delivered. All
             radiation treatment is to be delivered based on standard CT planning.

          -  have the ability to understand the informed consent document.

          -  be able to comply with protocol schedule.

          -  have a negative serum pregnancy test (within 7 days prior to starting radiation
             therapy), if a female of child bearing potential.

          -  consent to utilize medically acceptable methods of contraception throughout the study
             period if of child-bearing potential.

        Exclusion Criteria

        Subjects:

          -  with unhealed surgical wounds or scars in the study treatment area (axilla).

          -  with underlying active untreated cardiac disease (e.g. arrhythmia).

          -  with generalized skin disorders that have required treatment within the past 6 months.

          -  with connective tissue disorders.

          -  with rashes, ulcerations, or poorly healed scars in the study drug application area
             (axilla).

          -  with a known allergy to norepinephrine.

          -  with known uncontrolled hypertension (repeatedly elevated BP; systolic BP &gt;139 or
             diastolic BP &gt;89).

          -  with a known clinically significant abnormal ECG within the past 6 months.

          -  receiving MAO inhibitors or antidepressants (triptyline or imipramine types).

          -  who are pregnant or breastfeeding.

          -  with lymphovascular space invasion on pathology.

          -  with dermal lymphatic invasion on pathology.

          -  with proximity of the tumor to the overlying skin as evidenced by a distance of less
             than 5 mm on US or MRI (if performed) and within 2 cm of the anticipated application
             field

          -  diagnosis of inflammatory breast cancer.

          -  receiving chemotherapy other than Herceptin concurrent with the radiation.

          -  with previous radiation to the breast to be treated.
