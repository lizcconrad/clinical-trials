  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Currently, a 10-day concomitant therapy has been reported to be equally effective and safe to
      the 10-day sequential therapy for 1st-line anti-Helicobacter pylori(H. pylori) therapy. To
      our knowledge, there has been no report concerning the efficacy of this regimen used as a
      rescue therapy.

      The aims of this study are:

        1. to compare the efficacy of high dose dual therapy and concomitant therapy as rescue
           regimen in H. pylori eradication;

        2. to compare the patient adherence and adverse effects of these treatment regimens;

        3. to investigate factors that may influence H. pylori eradication by these treatment
           regimens.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients, aged 18, having H. pylori-positive chronic gastritis with/without peptic ulcers
      will be recruited. All undergo endoscopy with biopsy before treatment. Four to eight weeks
      after termination of treatment, H. pylori infection status will be examined by endoscopy with
      biopsy or the Carbon 13-urea breath test if the patients refuse the second endoscopy. The
      cytochrome P450 (CYP)2C19 genotype of each participant will be analyzed by the polymerase
      chain reaction-based restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) method. A computed
      generated random numbers sequence will be blocked into two subgroups, say A and B.

      If the patients had received anti-H. pylori therapy previously, they will be invited to enter
      the study for evaluating the efficacy of rescue regimens. After giving their written informed
      consent, all patients will be labeled with numbers by enrolling order. Each patient will be
      randomly allocated to one of two treatment groups which receives medications for 10 to 14
      days:

      group A - high dose dual therapy (rabeprazole 20 mg qid + amoxicillin 750 mg qid for 14
      days); group B - concomitant therapy (rabeprazole 20 mg + amoxicillin 1000 mg + metronidazole
      500 mg + clarithromycin 500 mg, bid for 10 days).

      All patients will be asked to complete a questionnaire and to record symptoms and drug
      consumption daily in a diary card during the treatment period. Post-treatment, the patients
      will be seen at the Outpatient Clinic to investigate patient adherence and adverse effects of
      treatment.
