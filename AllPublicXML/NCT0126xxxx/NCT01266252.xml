    <textblock>
      Clinical experience with dexmedetomidine in the paediatric population is limited. Critical
      illness can affect drug pharmacokinetics and -dynamics; the investigators cannot simply
      extrapolate adult data for use in children but the investigators are in need of data on
      pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics in every paediatric subpopulation.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Currently, dexmedetomidine is approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration
      (FDA) for short-term analgosedation (&lt;24h) in mechanically-ventilated critical care adult
      patients and sedation of non-intubated adult patients prior to and/or during surgical and
      other procedures. Trials are underway to investigate its pharmacokinetics, clinical efficacy
      and safety in long-term use. Clinical experience with dexmedetomidine in the paediatric
      population is limited. Moreover, during childhood many developmental changes take place with
      consequences on drug exposure and drug response. Finally, critical illness itself can affect
      drug pharmacokinetics and -dynamics. Therefore, the investigators cannot simply extrapolate
      adult data for use in children but the investigators are in need of data on pharmacokinetics
      and pharmacodynamics in every paediatric subpopulation.

    <description>Dexmedetomidine will be given maximal 72 hours. In case analgosedation is still needed after stop of the dexmedetomidine infusion, the treatment is switched to conventional analgosedation regimens.
Additional drugs are given to every inadequately sedated-painful patient (assessed by regular Comfort-neo and Numeric Rating Scale scoring). In case of oversedation or adverse drug events (hypotension, bradycardia), a downtitration (or stop) of the dexmedetomidine infusion is needed.</description>
