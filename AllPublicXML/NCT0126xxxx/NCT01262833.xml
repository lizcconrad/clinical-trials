  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study will address the role of internal pudendal artery disease in erectile dysfunction
      (ED), and whether it might eventually be amenable to intervention with stenting. There is
      currently a small trial investigating the potential benefit of stenting for erectile
      dysfunction, but the relationship between pelvic arterial stenoses and erectile dysfunction
      is not yet proven. The investigators intend to perform angiography on patients both with and
      without erectile dysfunction, to see whether internal pudendal artery disease is more common
      in the population with erectile dysfunction. In addition to angiography, stenoses will be
      examined using fractional flow reserve. The degree of internal pudendal artery disease will
      then be correlated with the degree of erectile dysfunction using a validated questionnaire,
      the International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF). Patients will then complete IIEF
      questionnaires for 5 years to assess the relationship between internal pudendal artery
      disease and progression of erectile dysfunction.

    <description>Secondary analyses will include correlation between bilateral disease and erectile dysfunction, as well as the contribution of small vessel disease (distal to the internal pudendal artery). The severity of disease by IIEF questionnaire will also be compared to the severity of disease by angiography. We will continue through 5-year follow-up of patients with yearly IIEF questionnaires to determine if changes in erectile dysfunction can be predicted by baseline internal pudendal artery disease.</description>

    <study_pop>
      <textblock>
        sexually active men, scheduled for cardiac catheterization or peripheral artery

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  As above, men with one risk factor for ED such as age&gt;55, diabetes, hyperlipidemia,
             smoking, hypertension, coronary disease or peripheral arterial disease

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with ED from a non-arterial cause, including hormonal, neurological, or
             trauma-related (as determined by past medical history routinely performed prior to
             catheterization)

          -  Patients requiring urgent catheterization (e.g. acute coronary syndrome or cardiogenic
             shock)

          -  Patients with a creatinine &gt;1.5 mg/dL and those deemed at increased renal risk (such
             as from receiving &gt;200 mL of dye during the primary procedure, post renal transplant
             or single kidney), as the additional contrast dye required for angiography would pose
             an undue risk of progressive kidney disease

          -  Patients with other illnesses that reduce their life expectancy to less than one year
