    <textblock>
      Microaspirations of the oropharyngeal ± gastric contents through the endotracheal tube cuff
      contribute to the constitution of VAP. The pepsin has been recently proved effective as a
      surrogate of gastric content and was assessed in tracheal secretions. However, the pepsin
      dosage is fastidious, expensive and only characterizes aspirations from gastric origin. The
      aim of our study is to asses whether the value of amylase, which is mostly secreted by
      salivary glands, may turn out to be a new and simpler surrogate for microaspirations in
      ventilated ICU patients. Thirty patients ventilated for an anticipated length &gt; 48h whose
      endotracheal tube includes a subglottic secretion device and producing sufficient
      endotracheal aspirations will be included. From H48, 4 sets of 3 aspirations each (oral,
      subglottic, tracheal) will be performed during one ventilation day for amylase dosage
      purpose. In ten of these patients, a comparison between pepsin and amylase will be assessed.
      In addition, 10 non intubated patients with an indication to bronchoscopy and necessitating a
      tracheal aspiration during the procedure will be included as a control group. The primary
      assessment criteria will be the oral/tracheal amylase ratio.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  intubated and ventlated patients group: patients ventilated with a tube including a
             subglottic secretion device for an anticipated length &gt; 48h and producing sufficient
             endotracheal aspirations

          -  non intubated patients group: patients with an study-independant indication to
             bronchoscopy and necessitating a tracheal aspiration during the procedure

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  patients ventilated for less than 48h
