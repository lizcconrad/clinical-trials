    <measure>Ratio of Pain-free Walking Distance After Period 2 in Comparison With the Findings at Baseline</measure>
    <time_frame>From Baseline to the end of 4 weeks of Interval Treatment (Period 2)</time_frame>
    <description>The ratio of pain-free walking distance was calculated by the pain-free walking distance after Period 2 divided by the pain-free walking distance at Baseline with determination of pain-free walking distances on the treadmill (12 % grade and 3 km/h). If a subject was not familiar with the treadmill, at least two test determinations were performed to accustom him/her to the treadmill. For all treadmill determinations the subject has been prevented from observing the treadmill display of the walking distance achieved.</description>

    <measure>Changes in Quality of Life (as Measured With the PAVK 86 Questionnaire) From Baseline to the End of Period 1</measure>
    <time_frame>From Baseline to the end of 4 weeks of Daily Treatment (Period 1)</time_frame>
    <description>Scores for subscales were calculated by summing non-missing item scores ranging from 1 (not at all; best possible outcome) to 4 (extremely; worst possible outcome) divided by the number of non-missing items. Hence each subscale score ranges from 1 (best possible outcome) to 4 (worst possible outcome). For subscales 'Mood' and 'Treatment expectation' five items each had to be reversed in order. Additionally, subjects were asked to assess their general health and quality of life on an ordinal scale between 0 (very good) and 10 (very poor).
Negative changes show a decrease from Baseline.</description>

        <description>The ratio of pain-free walking distance was calculated by the pain-free walking distance after Period 3 divided by the pain-free walking distance after Period 1 with determination of pain-free walking distances on the treadmill (12 % grade and 3 km/h). If a subject was not familiar with the treadmill, at least two test determinations were performed to accustom him/her to the treadmill. For all treadmill determinations the subject has been prevented from observing the treadmill display of the walking distance achieved.</description>

          <description>The ratio of maximum walking distance was calculated by the maximum walking distance after Period 3 divided by the maximum walking distance at Baseline with determination of maximum walking distances on the treadmill (12 % grade and 3 km/h). If a subject was not familiar with the treadmill, at least two test determinations were performed to accustom him/her to the treadmill. For all treadmill determinations the subject has been prevented from observing the treadmill display of the walking distance achieved.</description>

          <title>Changes in Quality of Life (as Measured With the PAVK 86 Questionnaire) From Baseline to the End of Period 3</title>
          <description>Scores for subscales were calculated by summing non-missing item scores ranging from 1 (not at all; best possible outcome) to 4 (extremely; worst possible outcome) divided by the number of non-missing items. Hence each subscale score ranges from 1 (best possible outcome) to 4 (worst possible outcome). For subscales 'Mood' and 'Treatment expectation' five items each had to be reversed in order. Additionally, subjects were asked to assess their general health and quality of life on an ordinal scale between 0 (very good) and 10 (very poor).
Negative changes show a decrease from Baseline.</description>
