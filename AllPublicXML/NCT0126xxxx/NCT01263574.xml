  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to determine if the use of 70% ethanol lock solution in central lines
      decreases the rate of central line infections in children with short bowel syndrome. While
      ethanol locks have been used safely in children, there has been no published research to date
      that clearly shows it is of definite benefit in this group of patients.

    <measure>Catheter associated blood stream infection (CABSI).</measure>
    <time_frame>Number of infections reported per 1000 catheter days.</time_frame>
    <description>Published data in intensive care unit (ICU) patients with CABSI has noted that central venous catheter cultures had a specificity of 98% and a negative predictive value of 97%. In our study, we will define CABSI as a positive central venous catheter blood culture in the face of clinical signs of infection, when the catheter has been used in the last 48 hours prior to infection, and without other obvious source of infection. CABSI rate will be reported as number of infections per 1000 catheter days after 12 months of follow up.</description>

    <description>Administration of the 70% ethanol lock solution will occur between cycles of parenteral nutrition. Randomized lock solutions will be administered three days per week.

    <description>Administration of the lock solution will occur between cycles of parenteral nutrition. Lock solutions will be administered three days per week. The pre-measured volume of lock solution will then be injected into the catheter for 4 hours. Prior to the next instillation of medications into the catheter, the lock solution will be aspirated and discarded. Another 5mL flush of saline will then be instilled into the catheter prior to medication or parenteral nutrition administration. Volume of lock solution administered will be determined by catheter size.</description>
