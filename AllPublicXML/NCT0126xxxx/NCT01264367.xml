        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patient is between 18~60 years

          2. Patient is HBV DNA positive with DNA levels ≥ 5 x 10^5 copies/mL within 30 days of
             baseline.

          3. Patient is documented to be HBsAg positive for &gt; 6 months and Patient is HBeAg
             positive.

          4. Patient has ALT levels &gt;=80IU/L, prothrombin time(INR)&lt;1.7 and a serum albumin level
             of at least 3.5 g/dL.

          5. Patient has hemoglobin levels &gt;=11.5g/dl(if woman) or &gt;=12.5g/dl(if man)

          6. Women of childbearing potential must have a negative urine pregnancy test(β-HCG) taken
             within 14 days of starting therapy.

          7. Patient is able to give written informed consent prior to study start and to comply
             with the study requirements.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patient is currently receiving antiviral, immunomodulatory, cytotoxic or
             corticosteroid therapy.

          2. Patients previously treated with interferon, peg-interferon, clevudine, lamivudine,
             adefovir, entecavir, telbivudine, tenofovir or any other investigational nucleoside
             for HBV infection.

          3. Patient is coinfected with HCV or HIV.

          4. Patient with clinical evidence of decompensated liver disease or HCC

          5. Patient has WBC levels &lt; 3.0x10^9/L

          6. Patient has Platelets levels &lt; 90x10^9/L

          7. Patient has alpha fetoprotein levels &gt; 100ng/mL

          8. Patient has a history of Thyroid disease.

          9. Patient has a history of autoimmune hepatitis.

         10. Patient is pregnant or breast-feeding.

         11. Patient is unwilling to use an &quot;effective&quot; method of contraception during the study
             and for up to 3 months after the use of study drug ceases.

         12. Patient has a clinically relevant history of abuse of alcohol or drugs.

         13. Patient has a significant immunocompromised, gastrointestinal, renal, hematological,
             psychiatric, bronchopulmonary, biliary diseases excluding asymptomatic GB stone,
             neurological, cardiac, oncologic or allergic disease or medical illness that in the
             investigator's opinion might interfere with therapy. The patient with a benign tumor,
             excluded if judged by an investigator that the continuation of study would be
             interfered by the tumor.

         14. Patient has creatinine clearance less than 60mL/min as estimated by the following
             formula: (140-age in years) (body weight [kg])/(72) (serum creatinine [mg/dL]) [Note:
             multiply estimates by 0.85 for women]
