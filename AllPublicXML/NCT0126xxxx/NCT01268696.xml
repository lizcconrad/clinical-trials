    <textblock>
      Metabolic syndrome is a combination of medical disorders that increase the risk of developing
      cardiovascular disease and diabetes. The exact mechanisms of the complex pathways of
      metabolic syndrome are not yet completely known. The pathophysiology is extremely complex and
      has been only partially elucidated. Most patients are older, obese, sedentary, and have a
      degree of insulin resistance. Stress can also be a contributing factor. The most important
      factors are:

      weight, genetics, aging, sedentary lifestyle,excess caloric intake. In our study we will
      assess the role of some polymorphisms in the pathology of metabolic syndrome.
