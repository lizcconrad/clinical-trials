    <textblock>
      Antiplatelet therapy is critical in the management of coronary artery disease.For patients
      undergoing off-pump coronary artery bypass graft,controversy remains regarding the safety of
      preoperative antiplatelet therapy.And there is little study about the effect of continuing
      aspirin until the surgery day on graft patency.So we would like to perform this study to
      evaluate the effects of preoperative aspirin on graft patency and cardiac events in off-pump
      coronary bypass.
