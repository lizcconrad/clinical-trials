  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Caesarean (CS) delivery rates in the Netherlands increased from 5 to 15% the last 20 years.
      CSs have no clear benefit for overall neonatal outcome and are associated with higher
      maternal complications and high costs. Dutch guidelines offer clear recommendations on
      factors that have a direct effect on the decision to perform a CS.

      Hypothesis: there is incomplete adherence to the recommendations from the guidelines on CS
      among Dutch gynaecologists.

      This study consists of four phases:

        1. Development of quality indicators: A set of quality indicators regarding the process,
           structure and outcome of care will be developed according to the RAND-modified Delphi
           method. A representative, national expert panel consisting of 12 to 15 obstetricians and
           midwives will participate.

        2. Current care study: The current Dutch care will be studied in 20 hospitals (N=80
           gynaecologists). 1000 files on performed CSs are analyzed regarding the adherence to the
           developed quality indicators. To get insight into Dutch practices compared to
           international data, basic obstetrical data will be extracted from the delivery database.

        3. Barrier analysis: A barrier analysis will be carried out based on the results of the
           current care study. Two groups of hospitals will be identified in the upper and lower
           extremes of the 'adherence distribution': 5 hospitals with the lowest and 5 hospitals
           with the highest adherence scores. Factors that determine the decision to perform a CS
           or not (barriers and facilitators) will be analyzed in both groups using semi-structured
           interviews among 15-20 professionals and 15-20 patients. A questionnaire will be used to
           study the 'prevalence' of these factors among all obstetric gynaecologists in the
           Netherlands and among 200 patients.

        4. Controlled before- and-after (CBA) study: Based on the outcomes of the current care
           study and the barrier analysis, a tailor made implementation strategy will be developed
           in order to increase adherence to the CS quality indicators. Target groups will be
           selected with focus on women with both a high incidence of the indicator and low
           indicator adherence. The strategy will be executed and evaluated in a CBA-study in 12
           hospitals (6 intervention, 6 control) in terms of effectiveness, experiences and costs.
           The sample size will be dependent on the target group and adherence to the quality
           indicators regarding this target group. These data will be available after performing
           the current care and the barrier study.

        1. Development of quality indicators: 12-15 obstetricians and midwives

          2. Current care study: All women (1000) who underwent a CS in one of the 20 participating
             hospitals during the study period (3-4 months). All hospitals participate in the Dutch
             consortium and consist of university teaching-, non-university teaching- and
             non-university-non-teaching hospitals.

          3. Barrier analysis: Qualitative: 15-20 professionals and 15-20 patients from the
             hospitals in the upper and lower extremes of the 'adherence distribution'.
             Quantitative: obstetricians in the Netherlands and 200 experienced patients.

          4. CBA study: depending on the outcome of phase 2 and 3 of the study, the implementation
             strategy will be designed for a target group with low guideline adherence and high
             incidence.
