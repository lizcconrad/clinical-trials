  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Interventions such as Relaxation Response appear to have widespread effects on physiology.
      Endothelial function, changes in genomic expression, several biomarkers have been associated
      with chronic stress and cardiovascular dysfunction, and there is some suggestion that
      elicitation of the Relaxation Response may lead to improvement in-or normalization of-these
      factors. By studying the impact of the Relaxation Response on endothelial function, genomic
      expression and biomarkers among subjects with hypertension, it may be possible to better
      understand the biologic underpinnings of Relaxation Response-type interventions. Furthermore,
      with a greater understanding of the physiologic mechanisms by which the Relaxation Response
      works, it may be possible to better target other symptoms and conditions that can be
      effectively treated by such an intervention.
