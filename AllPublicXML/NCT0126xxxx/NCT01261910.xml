  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this study is to test different methods by which kidney transplant
      centers can educate potential transplant candidates about living donor kidney transplant
      (LDKT).

      The most effective ways to educate kidney transplant candidates about LDKT remain unclear.
      The goal is to determine, among a diverse cohort of potential kidney transplant candidates,
      whether a transplant center-based intervention will increase understanding of the
      opportunities for and process, risks, and benefits of living kidney donation and LDKT. The
      investigators hypothesize that kidney transplant candidates' understanding of living kidney
      donation and LDKT will be increased by interventions implemented at the transplant center on
      the day of transplant evaluation.

      The investigators propose a single-center, 2-arm, cluster-randomized, controlled trial to
      compare the effects of two educational strategies upon transplant candidates' understanding
      of living kidney donation and LDKT:

        1. Usual transplant education implemented by the transplant center, on the day of the
           transplant evaluation (standard care); and

        2. Intensive initial transplant education implemented on the day of the transplant
           evaluation.

      Intensive initial transplant education will utilize videos of living donors' experiences as
      well as a session with a trained Transplant Educator, who will focus upon living donation
      education. One week after the transplant evaluation day and 3 months later, the investigators
      will assess transplant candidates' knowledge of LDKT (using questionnaires), identify
      correlates of increased understanding of LDKT, and assess racial/ethnic differences in the
      understanding of LDKT.
