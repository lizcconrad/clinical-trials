      Background Approximately 30 million children are treated in emergency departments each year
      in the United States, of which two to three million are children presenting with lacerations.
      Topical numbing medication is the standard of care in children with regard to pain control
      during laceration repair. While topical numbing medications are effective, children often
      require further pain control during laceration repair in the form of an injected numbing
      medication, which in itself is painful. No evidence currently exists regarding the concurrent
      use of oral pain medications to combat laceration procedural pain.

      Research Question Does the addition of ibuprofen or oxycodone to lidocaine, epinephrine, and
      tetracaine (LET) topical anesthetic provide more effective pain control than LET alone during
      laceration repair?

      Design This is a double-blinded, randomized-controlled study.

      Methods Subjects in all three groups will receive topical anesthetic. In addition to topical
      anesthetic, two groups of children will receive either of two oral analgesics, ibuprofen or
      oxycodone, while the third group will receive a placebo.
