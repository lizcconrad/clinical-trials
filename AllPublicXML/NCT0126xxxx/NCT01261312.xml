    <textblock>
      Phase 1-2 dose escalation randomized study in patients with intermediate or high risk
      myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) or acute myelogenous leukemia (AML). The Dose Escalation
      Segment will evaluate the biological activity, preliminary safety and efficacy of SGI-110
      with two dosing schedules in MDS and AML patients while the Dose Expansion Segment will
      further evaluate safety and efficacy at the biological effective dose (BED) or maximum
      tolerated dose (MTD)as defined in the Dose Escalation Segment.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Once the BED and MTD is determined in the Dose Escalation Segment, the Dose Expansion Segment
      will randomize patients with MDS, treatment naïve elderly AML, and relapsed/refractory AML
      patients to receive the BED or MTD dose. Relapsed/refractory AML patients may also receive
      SGI-110 on a daily x 10 schedule based on the total dose per cycle evaluated in the Dose
      Escalation Segment using the 5-daily regimen.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Men or women, 18 years of age or older, with a confirmed diagnosis of international
             prognostic scoring system (IPSS) intermediate-1, intermediate-2 or high-risk MDS
             including Chronic Myelomonocytic Leukemia (CMML) or AML.

               -  In the Dose Escalation Segment, patients who are refractory, relapsed, or
                  unresponsive to standard treatment.

                  subjects (including CMML), and intermediate-2 or high-risk MDS subjects
                  (including CMML) relapsed or refractory to prior HMA treatment are allowed, and

             organ system dysfunction which, in the investigator's opinion, could compromise the

          5. Known history of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) or active infection with hepatitis
             C virus (HCV) or hepatitis B virus (HBV).
