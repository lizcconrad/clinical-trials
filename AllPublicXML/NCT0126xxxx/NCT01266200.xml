      In this project, with unstable vertebral fractures, the microcirculation of the skin and
      muscle (O2C,Laser-Doppler/White-light -Spectroscopy and contrast-enhanced sonography) will be
      evaluated in both conventional and in percutaneous minimally invasive technique (XIA versus
      Mantis) at the thoracolumbar junction.

      In this project, with unstable vertebral fractures, the microcirculation of the skin and
      muscle (O2C,Laser-Doppler/Whitelight-Spectroscopy and contrast-enhanced sonography) will be
      evaluated in both conventional and in percutaneous minimal-invasive technique (XIA versus
      Mantis) at the thoracolumbar junction. And after placing a fixator, the inflammatory potency
      (laboratory chemicals, cytokines, immune status) and the muscular injury (EMG) of acess are
      examined.

      The study is planned as a randomized prospective study. In the study a total of at least 100
      patients should be included, 50 with minimally invasive fixation-implantation and 50 patients
      with conventional procedure.

      The radiological imaging (post-surgical control, possibly after mobilization, CT) ist
      routinely.

      The patient outcome is determined using established scores (clinical score, visual analogue
      scale, SF-12).

      The study also indicates by comparing the damage of the microcirculation of the two surgical
      techniques to make statements on wound healing and muscle blood flow heavily in order to
      filter out the less complications and tissue-method.

      In this research project, the limits in the microcirculation measurement with the O2C and
      contrast enhanced sonography be established at an early stage to help in future wound healing
      disorders can be treated so well.
