          -  A male or female aged ≥18 years at the time of vaccination

          -  Free of obvious health problems as established by medical history and clinical
             examination before entering into the study

          -  Written informed consent obtained from the subject

          -  If the subject is female, she must be of non-childbearing potential , i.e., either

             she must be abstinent or have used adequate contraceptive precautions for 30 days
             prior to vaccination, have a negative pregnancy test and must agree to continue such
             precautions for two months after completion of the vaccination series.

        For the annex phase of this study, subjects must meet the inclusion criteria mentioned
        above. In addition, subjects must have received either reduced-antigen-content
        diphtheria-tetanus or diphtheria-tetanus-acellular pertussis vaccine in the initial phase
        of the study and not responded to either the diphtheria or tetanus toxoid..

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Vaccination against diphtheria and/or tetanus within the previous five years

          -  Vaccination against pertussis since childhood

          -  History of diphtheria and/or tetanus

          -  Known history of pertussis within the previous five years

          -  Known exposure to diphtheria or pertussis within the previous five years

          -  Known history of non-response to diphtheria, tetanus or pertussis vaccine

          -  Use of any investigational or non-registered drug or vaccine other than the study
             vaccine(s) during the study period or within 30 days/ 5 half-lives preceding the dose
             of study vaccine

          -  Administration of chronic immunosuppressants or other immune-modifying drugs within
             six months/ 5 half-lives of vaccination.

          -  Planned administration/ administration of a vaccine not foreseen by the study protocol
             during the period starting from 30 days before vaccination and ending 30 days after

          -  Administration of immunoglobulins and/or any blood products within the three months
             preceding vaccination or planned administration/ administration during the study
             period

          -  Any confirmed or suspected immunosuppressive or immunodeficient condition

          -  Pregnant or lactating female

          -  History of allergic disease or reactions likely to be exacerbated by any component of
             the vaccine

          -  Hypersensitivity to any component of the vaccines

          -  Acute disease at the time of enrolment

          -  Oral temperature of ≥37.5°C (99.5°F)

          -  Any of the following having occurred after previous administration of
             diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis vaccine or diptheria and tetanus vaccines

          -  An immediate anaphylactic reaction

          -  Signs of encephalopathy

          -  Any of the following having occurred after previous administration of
             diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis vaccine alone or in combination with other antigens:

          -  Rectal temperature ≥40.5°C within 48 hours of vaccination and not due to another
             identifiable cause

          -  Collapse or shock-like state within 48 hours of vaccination

          -  Persistent, inconsolable screaming or crying lasting ≥3 hours within 48 hours of
