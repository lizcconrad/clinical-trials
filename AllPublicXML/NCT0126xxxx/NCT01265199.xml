  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main purpose of this study are to determine the maximum dose of AT-406 that can be safely
      given in combination with cytarabine and daunorubicin to humans. Other purposes are to
      determine how the drug is broken down in the body, and to see if there are any molecular
      interactions that can help determine how AT-406 works. Side effects will also be studied in
      an effort to make sure that this drug is safe to take.

      This is an open label, multi-center, dose escalation study to determine the MTD of oral
      AT-406 combined with daunorubicin and cytarabine in patients with poor-risk AML. Treatment
      with AT-406 will be administered to up to 60 patients at approximately 7 investigational
      sites in the US. Patients will be enrolled in open label sequential cohorts of up to 12
      patients to determine the MTD of AT-406 in combination with daunorubicin and cytarabine. Dose
      finding will occur during the induction cycle of the regimen. AT-406 will not be administered
      in consolidation cycles. Patients who require re-induction during initial treatment will be
      removed from the study and replaced (if needed) in order to assess at least 3 evaluable
      patients at each dose level.

      Clinical and laboratory parameters will be assessed to evaluate the toxicity of AT-406. In
      addition, pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic (PDy) blood samples will be analyzed for
      plasma concentrations and PDy effect of AT-406, respectively.
