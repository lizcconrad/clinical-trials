      Objective: At present, vestibular evoked myogenic potentials are analyzed only in the time
      domain. A technique to evaluate this potential in the frequency domain could provide more
      information, but has only been applied within the last year. Design and Study Sample: In this
      study we recorded vestibular evoked myogenic potential in the time domain, in 156 ears of 78
      normal-hearing young adults, at frequencies of 250, 500, 1000 and 2000 Hz, with intensity of
      90 dB nHL. Next, the steady state vestibular evoked myogenic potential was recorded at the
      same carrying frequencies, modulated at 20, 37, 40, 43, 70, 77 and 80 Hz. Results: The
      responses found by modulated frequency, regardless of carrier, recorded a higher presence of
      peaks and mean amplitudes between 20 and 70 Hz, especially at 40 Hz. Conclusions: The results
      show that the observation technique in the frequency domain is feasible and shows a strong
      association with the time domain for recording vestibular evoked myogenic potentials, at
      carrying frequencies of 250, 500, 1000 or 2000 Hz.
