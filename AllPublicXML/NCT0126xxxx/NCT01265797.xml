  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cranial electrotherapy stimulation (CES) may be a safe adjunct to medical treatment for pain
      relief in migraine patients. However, despite the number of CES studies done, many have been
      open label, single blinded, or have utilized a small group of patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the efficacy of the Fisher Wallace Cranial Stimulator in persons
      with chronic migraine who have not achieved satisfactory pain control on their current
      medications.

    <measure>Mean Headache Days</measure>
    <time_frame>28 day period during run-in month and blinded month</time_frame>
    <description>Mean change in headache days between 28 day run-in month and 28 day blinded month, i.e. run-in month mean minus blinded month mean. A good response is &gt;= 50% reduction in headache days (congruent with the Guidelines for Trial of Behavioral Treatments for Recurrent Headache).</description>

    <measure>Depression Score (PATIENT HEALTH QUESTIONNAIRE [PHQ] 9)</measure>
    <time_frame>14 days recall; measured at end of run-in month and blinded month</time_frame>
    <description>Mean difference of PHQ-9 score between the run-in month and blinded month, i.e. PHQ-9 score from run-in month minus blinded month. The PHQ-9 is a tool for assisting in diagnosing depression (over the prior 2 week period) as well as selecting and monitoring treatment. There are nine items, with responses each ranging from 0 (not at all) to 3 (nearly every day), for a total range of 0 to 27. The higher the total the more severe the depressive symptoms.</description>

    <measure>Headache Impact Test-6</measure>
    <time_frame>after run-in month, after blinded month</time_frame>
    <description>Mean difference in HIT-6 score between run-in month and blinded month. The HIT-6 is a tool for screening and monitoring change in headache disability. This disease-specific health survey is intended for adults 18 years of age and older, and is available with a standard four-week recall period. It is a 6 item questionnaire with scores for each item ranging from 6 (never) to 13 (always). The minimum overall score is 36 and the maximum is 78. Higher scores represent greater disability.</description>

This is a screening tool and severity measure for generalized anxiety disorder addressing symptoms over the prior 2 weeks. It is a 7 item questionnaire with response scores for each item ranging from 0 (not at all) to 3 (every day). The range for the total score is 0 to 21, with higher scores representing greater symptoms of anxiety</description>

    <description>Mean difference in PHQ 15 score between run-in month and blinded month. The PHQ-15 comprises 15 somatic symptoms experienced over the prior 4 weeks and their severity, each symptom scored from 0 (&quot;not bothered at all&quot;) to 2 (&quot;bothered a lot&quot;). The range for the overall score is between 0 and 30, with higher score representing more severe somatic symptoms</description>

    <time_frame>recorded at the end of run-in month and blinded month</time_frame>
    <description>Mean difference of Epworth Sleepiness Scale score between run-in month and blinded month. The Epworth Sleepiness Scale is used to measure excessive daytime sleepiness. This is an 8 item questionnaire, recalling probability of falling asleep in &quot;recent times&quot;. The subjects are asked to rate probability of falling asleep in eight different situations. The score for each item ranges from 0 (would never doze) to 3 (high chance of dozing), with the overall score range of 0 to 24. Higher scores represent higher probability of falling asleep.</description>

          <title>Depression Score (PATIENT HEALTH QUESTIONNAIRE [PHQ] 9)</title>
          <description>Mean difference of PHQ-9 score between the run-in month and blinded month, i.e. PHQ-9 score from run-in month minus blinded month. The PHQ-9 is a tool for assisting in diagnosing depression (over the prior 2 week period) as well as selecting and monitoring treatment. There are nine items, with responses each ranging from 0 (not at all) to 3 (nearly every day), for a total range of 0 to 27. The higher the total the more severe the depressive symptoms.</description>
          <population>The number of participants included the individuals who have completed the run-in period and the blinded period. The data was analyzed 'per protocol' based on the number of participants completing the blinded period.</population>

This is an 8 item questionnaire, recalling probability of falling asleep in &quot;recent times&quot;. The subjects are asked to rate probability of falling asleep in eight different situations. The score for each item ranges from 0 (would never doze) to 3 (high chance of dozing), with the overall score range of 0 to 24. Higher scores represent higher probability of falling asleep.</description>
