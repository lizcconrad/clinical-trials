    <textblock>
      The CANARY (Coronary Assessment by Near-infrared of Atherosclerotic Rupture-prone Yellow)
      Study is a pivotal trial to evaluate criteria for defining a Lipid Core Plaque (LCP) that is
      at high risk of rupturing during standard of care therapy and causing intra-procedural
      complications. If plaques that require treatment are at higher than normal risk of causing
      intra-procedural complications, some life threatening, the treating physician is better
      informed and may opt to take precautionary measures to mitigate the risk or result of a
      complication. The CANARY Study is also designed to evaluate the feasibility of using a distal
      embolization protection device (EPD) as a means to prevent heart attacks triggered by the
      embolization of plaque during standard care therapy. It is thought that the EPD will prevent
      plaque from going downstream during treatment and obstructing other heart vessels. These
      obstructions could cause heart attacks by preventing blood from reaching heart muscle tissue.

    <intervention_name>Embolic Protection Device (EPD)</intervention_name>
    <description>The embolic protection device consists of a protection wire, a delivery sheath, a retrieval sheath and various accessories (wire torque device, introducer, dilator tool). The wire of the EPD is used as a standard 0.014&quot; steerable guide wire. The filter is designed for embolic debris capture while maintaining continuous blood flow. At the completion of the procedure, the filter and its contents are removed using the retrieval sheath and then removed from the patient.</description>
