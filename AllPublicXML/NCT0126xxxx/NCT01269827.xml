      The aim of this study was to compare the effect of PTX vs placebo on serum concentrations of
      TNF-α, IL-6, and CRP in patients on hemodialysis.

      Patients were randomly selected from the total HD patients of our hospital. Once included,
      patients were randomly allocated (by a computer-generated randomization list) to a study or
      control group. Over a period of 4 months, patients of the study group received one PTX tablet
      (400 mg) orally once a day (at dinner time), whereas controls received one starch identical
      tablet on the same schedule.

      All patients had three HD sessions per week, with the same kind of single-use dialysis
      membrane and dialysate. Monthly visits were scheduled for clinical and biochemical
      evaluations. A blood sample was taken at baseline and every month for measurement of complete
      blood count, urea, creatinine, glucose, albumin, lipids, and electrolytes (measured by usual
      methods). In serum samples at 0, 2 and 4 months, TNF-α and IL-6 concentrations were measured
      by ELISA using high sensitivity kits (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Buckinghamshire, UK).
      Additionally, in the same serum samples, CRP concentrations were measured by nephelometry
      using high sensitivity kits (Dade Behring, Marburg, Germany) in a Nephelometry Analyzer II
      (Dade Behring, Marburg, Germany). All laboratory measurements, including inflammation
      markers, were performed in the Central Laboratory (Hospital de Especialidades, CMNO), by the
      same personnel blinded to patient's details.

      Treatment compliance was recorded by counting tablets left in the container at the end of
      each monthly visit.
