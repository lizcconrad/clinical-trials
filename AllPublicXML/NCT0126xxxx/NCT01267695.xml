  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Imatinib mesylate may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed
      for cell growth. Perioperative imatinib mesylate may shrink the tumor and may reduce the
      chance of relapse after surgery. This phase II trial is studying the effectiveness of
      perioperative imatinib mesylate in treating patients with locally advanced gastrointestinal
      stromal tumor.

    <textblock>
      Open-label trial in patients with locally advanced GISTs admitted to Department of Surgery,
      Beijing Cancer Hospital and Institute between April 2010 and May 2013 was carried out
      prospectively. Patients were planned to be treated with imatinib for duration of 6 months
      followed by surgical resection. Postoperative imatinib was planned to be administrated for
      1.5 years. The primary end point was recurrent free survival (RFS) at 2 years; the secondary
      end points included objective response rate (ORR), surgical outcomes and drug safety.

    <description>Patients receive oral imatinib mesylate once daily for 6 months in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients with disease progression or unacceptable toxicity are considered for immediate surgical resection. Within 2-6 weeks after completion of imatinib mesylate, patients with responding or stable disease undergo surgical resection. Two to four weeks after surgery, patients receive oral imatinib mesylate once daily for one and a half years.</description>
