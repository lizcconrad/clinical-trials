  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study was to evaluate the dose-response relationships of alogliptin, once
      daily (QD) to an α-glucosidase inhibitor, three times daily (TID), to determine the optimal
      clinical dose for type 2 diabetic patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Both insulin hyposecretion and insulin-resistance are considered to be involved in the
      development of type 2 diabetes mellitus.

      Takeda is developing SYR-322 (alogliptin) for the improvement of glycemic control in patients
      with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Alogliptin is an inhibitor of the dipeptidyl peptidase IV
      (DPP-IV) enzyme. DPP-IV is thought to be primarily responsible for the degradation of 2
      peptide hormones released in response to nutrient ingestion. It is expected that inhibition
      of DPP-IV will improve glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes.

      To evaluate the long-term safety and efficacy of alogliptin, participants in the present
      study could enter a long-term extension study SYR-322/OCT-001 (NCT01263496) that was planned
      separately.

          <title>Change From Baseline in C-peptide Measured by Meal Tolerance Testing (AUC(0-2).</title>
          <description>The change between the value of C-peptide collected at week 12 or final visit and C-peptide collected at baseline as measured by the meal tolerance test. Meal tolerance test measures blood glucose, insulin, C-peptide and glucagon through blood samples drawn before a meal and 2 hours after the start of the meal.</description>
          <population>Analysis based on last observation carried forward, where the last postbaseline double-blind observed value is carried forward and used for all subsequent scheduled time points where data is missing. Values are from the Full Analysis Set.</population>
