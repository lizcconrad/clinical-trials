      This study will invite two groups of volunteers to participate.

      The data from one group of volunteers will be used to find out how much study drug, known as
      GSK1325756, is in the blood after taking the drug twice in one day. Data will also collected
      to find out if the level of cetain blood cells, known as neutrophils, change significantly
      after taking the study drug twice in one day. This group of volunteers will be aged 40 to 64
      years of age.

      The data from the other group of volunteers will be used to find out if taking the study
      drug, GSK1325756, twice in one day with or without food, makes a difference to the level of
      study drug in the blood. This group of volunteers will also provide data to find out if any
      study drug metabolites are present in the bile, a fluid secreted by the liver. This group of
      volunteers will be aged 65 to 80 years of age.

      The current study will be conducted in two parts. In Part A - Cohort 1, healthy fed subjects
      aged 40 to 64 years (inclusive) will be enrolled to evaluate both the pharmacokinetics and
      pharmacodynamics of twice daily oral administration of GSK1325756 compared to matching
      placebo. In Part B - Cohort 2, healthy elderly subjects aged 65 to 80 years (inclusive) will
      be enrolled to evaluate the pharmacokinetic profile of twice daily oral administration of
      GSK1325756 for administered under fed and fasted conditions. Parts A and B may be performed
      in parallel.

      The approximate duration of the current study is expected to be between 64 and 74 days. The
      study will require subjects to complete a screening visit within 30 days, followed by Part A
      - Cohort 1 enrolment requiring 3 x (3 day treatment period + 7 day washout period) or Part B
      Cohort 2 enrolment requiring 2 x (3 day treatment period + 7 day washout period). All
      subjects will complete a follow up visit within seven to 14 days of last dose.
