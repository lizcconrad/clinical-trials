  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      GSK2251052 is a member of a novel mechanistic and structural class of antibiotics that
      inhibits the bacterial enzyme leucyl tRNA synthetase (LeuRS) by forming a boron adduct with
      tRNA and is currently in development for the treatment of hospital acquired Gram-negative
      infections (including E. coli, K. pneumoniae, and Enterobacter spp.).

      This is an open-label, randomized, single period, parallel-cohort pharmacokinetic study to
      evaluate serum and pulmonary pharmacokinetics following single dose and multiple dose
      administration of intravenous GSK2251052. In Cohort 1, approximately 15 healthy adult
      subjects will be randomized to receive a single IV dose of GSK2251052 1500 mg in the fasted
      state. Following the dose, bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid and serial plasma samples will
      be collected for determination of GSK2251052 parent and metabolite concentrations. In Cohort
      2, approximately 15 healthy adult subjects will receive GSK2251052 1500 mg IV BID x 5 doses
      (Cohort 2). Following the last dose in the fasted state, bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid
      and serial plasma samples will be collected for determination of GSK2251052 parent and
      metabolite concentrations. Vital signs, ECGs, and adverse events will be monitored throughout
      the study. A follow up visit will occur 10 to 14 days after the last dose of study drug.

      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  AST, ALT, alkaline phosphatase and bilirubin &lt; or = 1.5xULN (isolated bilirubin
             &gt;1.5xULN is acceptable if bilirubin is fractionated and direct bilirubin &lt;35%).
             Abnormal LFT tests may be repeated once at the discretion of the Investigator. If an
             abnormality is repeated, the subject would not be eligible for inclusion.

          -  Healthy as determined by a responsible and experienced physician, based on a medical
             evaluation including medical history, physical examination, laboratory tests and ECGs.
             A subject with a clinical abnormality or laboratory parameters outside the reference
             range for the population being studied may be included only if the Investigator and
             the GSK Medical Monitor agree that the finding is unlikely to introduce additional
             risk factors and will not interfere with the study procedures.

          -  Male or female between 18 and 55 years of age inclusive, at the time of signing the
             informed consent.

          -  A female subject is eligible to participate if she is of: Non-childbearing potential
             defined as pre-menopausal females with a documented tubal ligation or hysterectomy; or
             postmenopausal defined as 12 months of spontaneous amenorrhea. A follicle stimulating
             hormone (FSH) will be performed for confirmation. For this study, FSH level &gt; 40
             MlU/ml is confirmatory].

          -  Male subjects with female partners of child-bearing potential must agree to use one of
             the contraception methods listed in Section 8.1. This criterion must be followed from

             jeopardize the scientific integrity of the study, regulatory acceptability or subject
             safety. Therefore, adherence to the criteria as specified in the protocol is
             essential.

             criteria apply:

          -  Contraindications to bronchoalveolar lavage including hypercapnia &gt;50 mm Hg,
             refractory hypoxemia, reactive airway disease or asthma, unstable angina or acute

             average weekly intake of &gt;14 drinks for males or &gt;7 drinks for females. One drink is
             equivalent to 12 g of alcohol: 12 ounces (360 ml) of beer, 5 ounces (150 ml) of wine
             or 1.5 ounces (45 ml) of 80 proof distilled spirits.

          -  The subject has participated in a clinical trial and has received an investigational
             product within the following time period prior to the first dosing day in the current
             study: 30 days, 5 half-lives or twice the duration of the biological effect of the

             subject safety.

          -  History of sensitivity to any of the study medications, or components thereof or a
             history of drug or other allergy that, in the opinion of the investigator or GSK

             (≥3 consecutive ventricular ectopic beats) or any significant arrhythmia which, in the
             opinion of the principal investigator and GSK medical monitor, will interfere with the
