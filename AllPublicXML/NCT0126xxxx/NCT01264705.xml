    <textblock>
      This is a non-randomized, open-label, single-institution phase I/II therapeutic trial of
      bavituximab and sorafenib in patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). This
      study will be activated at the UT Southwestern Medical Center, comprised of The Harold C.
      Simmons Comprehensive Cancer Center, UT Southwestern Hospitals-St. Paul and Parkland Memorial
      Hospital System. Advanced HCC is defined as disease that is not amenable to surgical
      resection or orthotopic liver transplantation or is metastatic in nature.

    <textblock>
      The investigators are looking for men or women aged 18 years or older with hepatocellular
      carcinoma not suitable for surgical resection or hepatic transplantation. Prior locoregional
      therapy including but not limited to transarterial chemoembolization (TACE), radiofrequency
      ablation (RFA) or ethanol injection is allowed as long as the treatment was 4 weeks previous.
      Patients must be Child-Pugh A with no previous treatment with sorafenib or other vascular
      endothelial growth factor (VEGF) inhibitors.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients must have a diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma by at least one criterion
             listed below:

               -  Histologically confirmed.

               -  MRI or CT consistent with liver cirrhosis and at least one solid liver lesion &gt;2
                  cm with early enhancement and delayed enhancement washout regardless of AFP.

               -  AFP &gt;400 ng/ml and evidence of at least one solid liver lesion &gt;2 cm regardless
                  of specific imaging characteristics on CT or MRI.

          2. Locally advanced or metastatic disease.

          3. Patients with locally advanced disease must have disease deemed to be unresectable or
             not eligible for hepatic transplantation. Determination will occur in the weekly GI
             DMT meeting by surgical oncologists and transplant surgeons.

          4. Measurable disease, as defined as lesions that can accurately be measured in at least
             one dimension (longest diameter to be measured) according to Response Evaluation
             Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST, version 1.1) at least 2 cm with conventional
             techniques or at least 1 cm with spiral computed tomography.

          5. Child-Pugh Score A.

          6. Age ≥ 18 years.

          7. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance Score of 0-2.

          8. Absolute neutrophil count ≥ 1,500 cells/mm3.

          9. Platelet count ≥ 75,000 cells/mm3.

         10. Total bilirubin ≤ 3.0 mg/dl.

         11. Hemoglobin ≥ 8.5 g/dl.

         12. AST and ALT ≤ 5.0 times upper limit of normal.

         13. D-dimer ≤ 3 times upper limit of normal.

         14. INR ≤ 1.8 (therapeutic anticoagulation allowed as long as medically indicated.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. History of bleeding diathesis or coagulopathy.

          2. Symptomatic or clinically active brain metastases.

          3. Major surgery within previous 4 weeks.

          4. History of thromboembolic events (including both pulmonary embolisms and deep vein
             thrombosis); central venous catheter-related thrombosis &gt; 6 months prior is allowed.

          5. Prior adjuvant therapy with sorafenib or other Raf/MEK/RAS or VEGFR inhibitors. Prior
             adjuvant therapy is allowed provided it was completed &gt; 6 months ago and there is
             documented recurrence of hepatocellular carcinoma.
