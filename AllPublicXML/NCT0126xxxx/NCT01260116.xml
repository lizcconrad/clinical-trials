      This study is going to determine the efficacy, tolerability and safety of ziprasidone in 120
      schizophrenic patients with depressive symptoms. The study will be carried out at 2 mental
      centers in China. Subjects will be required to attend the center at screening, baseline,
      Weeks 1, 2, 4 ,6 and 8 or early termination visit.

      At screening, patients underwent psychiatric and physical examination, standard lab tests,
      and an Electrocardiograph.

      At baseline, if they continued to be eligible, they began ziprasidone 20 mg twice daily.

      Depending on response and tolerability, ziprasidone could be gradually escalated to a maximum
      of 80 mg twice daily.

      Primary objective The primary objective was to evaluate the efficacy of ziprasidone in the
      treatment of depressive symptoms in patients with schizophrenia.

      Secondary objectives The secondary objective was to evaluate the efficacy and the safety and
      tolerability of ziprasidone in the treatment of schizophrenic patients with depressive
      symptoms.

      Study design This study was going to determine the efficacy, tolerability and safety of
      ziprasidone in 120 schizophrenic patients with depressive symptoms. The study was carried out
      at 2 mental centers in China. Subjects were required to attend the center at screening,
      baseline, Weeks 1, 2, 4 ,6 and 8 or early termination visit.

      At screening, patients underwent psychiatric and physical examination, standard lab tests,
      and an Electrocardiograph.

      At baseline, if they continued to be eligible, they began ziprasidone 20 mg twice daily.

      Depending on response and tolerability, ziprasidone could be gradually escalated to a maximum
      of 80 mg twice daily.

      Dosage/Administration

      At baseline subjects received study drug according to the following regimen:

      Day 1-2: ziprasidone 20 mg twice daily. Day 3-4: ziprasidone 40 mg twice daily. Day 5-6:
      ziprasidone 60 mg twice daily. Day 7-Week 8: ziprasidone 40, 60 or 80 mg twice daily. At
      visit 3 (week 1) the dosage of study drug was titrated up or down based on the clinical
      status of the subject and the safety and tolerability of the study drug. Subjects received
      all study drugs with food and under supervision.

      Treatment Duration It's a 8 weeks' study. There are 7 visits in this study. Visit 1 is
      screening visit; Visit 2 is baseline visit; Visit 3 is Week 1; Visit 4 is Week 2; Visit 5 is
      Week 4; Visit 6 is Week 6; Visit 7 is Week 8.
