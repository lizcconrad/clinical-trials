      The purpose of the study is to assess the safety and immunogenicity of a GlaxoSmithKline
      (GSK) Biologicals' candidate tuberculosis vaccine (692342) administered to Human
      Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV)-positive adults aged 18 to 59 years, living in a tuberculosis
      endemic region.

      Subjects will be followed-up for 3 years.

      Subjects will be enrolled in 3 cohorts:

        -  HIV-positive adults on highly active antiretroviral therapy

        -  HIV-positive adults not on highly active antiretroviral therapy

        -  HIV-negative adults

      Each cohort will have 2 groups.
