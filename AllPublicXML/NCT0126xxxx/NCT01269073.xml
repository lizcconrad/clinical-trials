    <textblock>
      This trial is enrolling patients who are already being seen at OHSU sleep disorder center or
      have been referred for clinical reasons by their physician to the OHSU sleep disorder center
      and are going to have a sleep study that would be paid for by their insurance company for
      clinical reasons.

      The purpose of this study is to determine whether the Portland sleep apnea quiz has a higher
      specificity and negative predictive value then the Berlin Sleep Questionnaire in a patient
      population with a high predisposition to sleep apnea presenting to a sleep center.

      This trial is enrolling patients who are already being seen at OHSU sleep disorder center or
      have been referred for clinical reasons by their physician to the OHSU sleep disorder center
      and are going to have a sleep study that would be paid for by their insurance company for
      clinical reasons.

      400 consecutive adult subjects who have been referred by their doctor to the sleep disorder
      center and are undergoing a diagnostic sleep study at the OHSU sleep disorders center will be
      requested to fill out both a Berlin questionnaire and Portland sleep quiz on the night of the
      initial diagnostic polysomnography. The questionnaires will be collected and scored in a
      confidential manner. The predictive value of the questionnaires will be compared with the
      results of overnight polysomnography (Apnea Hypopnea Index).
