  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will assess safety and ergonomics/engineering design of a novel cancer treatment,
      Continuous Low Irradiance Photodynamic therapy (CLIPT). We will assess the effects on primary
      and metastatic tumors involving the skin, in particular to improve the functionality,
      efficiency and wearability of the light delivery device (LDD) as well as the overall
      treatment in subjects with chest wall recurrences of breast cancer. An ongoing study (IRB#
      8227), sponsored by a Susan G. Komen Breast Cancer Foundation grant, using a 1st generation
      LDD device has evaluated and determined a dose-limiting toxicity of CLIPT for subjects with
      chest wall recurrences of breast cancer.

      A Diomed laser will be the device used in this study. The Diomed laser will deliver 630 nm
      (red spectrum) light through a Fiber Optic Patch. The Fiber Optic patch will be compatible
      with the laser, delivering light to a designated region on the patient's skin.

        The study population will consist of 3 female patients. Eligible patients will be recruited
        from cancer centers in North America specializing in breast cancer. Recruitment has begun
        with the Hematology/Oncology, Dermatologic Oncology, and Radiation Oncology programs at
        Tufts Medical Center, Rhode Island Hospital and the teaching hospitals affiliated with
        Tufts and Brown Universities. All research related activity will only take place at the
        Tufts Medical Center.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients &gt; 18 years of age, with primary or metastatic cutaneous tumors that may or
             may not have been previously irradiated.

          -  ECOG performance status &lt; 3.

          -  Patients must not have received any systemic anti-cancer therapy within 30 days prior
             to enrolling in this study.

          -  Patients must not have received radiation therapy to the target site within 60 days of
             enrolling on this study.

          -  Skin of target site and control site must be grade 0 or 1 by Common Terminology

          -  Patients must have a target lesion and normal peri-umbilical skin that can be covered
             by the fiber-optic mesh used to deliver CLIPT (10 x 10 cm, or 3 x 3).

          -  If located on an extremity, the target lesion must not cover more than 50% of the
             diameter of the extremity at the level at which it is located.

          -  Absolute neutrophil count &gt; 1000.

          -  Adequate coagulation status as indicated by platelet count &gt; 50,000, PT and PTT &lt; 1.5
             time the upper limit of normal.

          -  Patients must sign informed consent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Male patients not considered for this study.

          -  Patients must have a target lesion in a location other than the hands, feet, genitals,
             or face. Lesions in those locations will be excluded.

          -  Patients with medical conditions associated with photosensitivity, such as cutaneous
             porphyria or a collagen vascular disease, or with known allergies to porphyrins will
             be excluded.

          -  Pregnant and nursing patients will be excluded. Women of child-bearing potential must
             have a negative serum or urine pregnancy test prior to enrollment.

          -  Patients taking medications known to cause photosensitivity (tetracyclines,
             sulfonamides, phenothiazines, sulfonylurea hypoglycemic agents, thiazide diuretics,
             griseofulvin, and fluoroquinolones, St. John's wort and amiodarone) will be excluded.

          -  Patients with severe hepatic dysfunction (total bilirubin, AST, or ALT &gt; five times
             upper limit of normal) will be excluded.
