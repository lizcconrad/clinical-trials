  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      P16 is a tumor suppressor protein implicated in serous papillary endometrial carcinoma.
      Evidence from previous trials indicates that it may be used as a diagnostic biomarker
      distinguishing this disease from endometrioid endometrial cancer. Additional evidence points
      to its prognostic value.

      The current study will evaluate p16 both as a diagnostic tool for serous papillary
      endometrial cancer and as a prognostic biomarker.

      following anonymization, histology blocks will be microtomed and stained for P16 and P53
      proteins.

      Blocks from endometrioid endometrial cancer will be used as a control group.
