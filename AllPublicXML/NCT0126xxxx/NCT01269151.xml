  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Multifocal-electroretinoram (ERG) and microperimetry are objective criteria to asses retinal
      function. No information besides visual acuity exist for the development of retinal function
      during the course of wet AMD during therapy with Lucentis. The aim of our study is to
      evaluate the value of multifocal-ERG and microperimetry as an sensitive tool and early
      predictor of recurrence of the disease. The second goal will be to evaluate the
      neuroprotective effects of an adequate therapy on retinal function using microperimetry and
      multifocal-ERG during the course of wet AMD.
