  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to explore the potential dose response relationship between the
      pharmacokinetics of GSK2141795 and [18F] FDG PET pharmacodynamic markers of glucose
      metabolism in tumor tissue. Three to six subjects will be enrolled in each cohort and dosed
      with repeat escalating doses of GSK2141795. [18F] FDG PET imaging and optional tumor biopsies
      will be done prior to initiation of dosing and sequentially at select time points during the
      first five weeks of dosing. The maximal dose of a given schedule evaluated in this study will
      not exceed the maximal tolerated dose established in the first-time-in-human trial PCS112689
      for the same schedule.
