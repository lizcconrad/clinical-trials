  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This feasibility study specifically addresses the issue of adapting US dietary guidelines
      physical activity recommendations to the population of the Lower Mississippi Delta. The
      hypothesis is that including a pedometer as a self-monitoring tool as part of adapted
      physical activity guidelines will result in greater immediate increases in physical activity
      (as monitored by an accelerometer) than an education program alone.

      The purpose of this study was to determine if a short-term pedometer-based intervention
      results in immediate increases in time spent in moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA)
      compared to a minimal educational intervention.A sample of 43 overweight adults 35 to 64
      years of age participated in a one week pedometer-based feasibility trial monitored by
      accelerometry. Participants were randomized into a one-week education-only group or a group
      that also wore a pedometer. Accelerometer-measured MVPA was measured over 7 days at baseline
      and post-intervention.

    <description>A GT3X accelerometer is used to monitor each participants physical activity levels for seven consecutive days at baseline and again following a 7-day intervention period. The amount of time per day spent above a threshold of 2200 accelerometer counts/min is averaged over at least three days as the measure of MVPA.</description>
