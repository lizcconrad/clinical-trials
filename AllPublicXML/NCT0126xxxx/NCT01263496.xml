    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study was to evaluate the long-term safety and efficacy of SYR-322, once
      daily (QD), to an α-glucosidase inhibitor, three times daily (TID), administered for 40
      consecutive weeks in participants who completed a phase 2 dose-ranging study.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Both insulin hyposecretion and insulin-resistance are considered to be involved in the
      development of type 2 diabetes mellitus.

      Takeda is developing SYR-322 (alogliptin) for the improvement of glycemic control in patients
      with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Alogliptin is an inhibitor of the dipeptidyl peptidase IV
      (DPP-IV) enzyme. DPP-IV is thought to be primarily responsible for the degradation of 2
      peptide hormones released in response to nutrient ingestion. It is expected that inhibition
      of DPP-IV will improve glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes.

      To evaluate the long-term safety and efficacy of alogliptin, this extension study was
      administered for 40 consecutive weeks (52 weeks from the start of treatment in the phase 2
      dose-ranging study) to participants who had completed the phase 2 dose-ranging study
      SYR-322/CCT-001 (NCT01263470).

    <description>A treatment-emergent adverse event (TEAE) is defined as an adverse event with an onset that occurs after receiving study drug and within 30 days after receiving the last dose of study drug. A TEAE may also be a pre-treatment adverse event or a concurrent medical condition diagnosed prior to the date of first dose of study drug, which increases in intensity after the start of dosing. Adverse events data with onset occurring more than 30 days after last dose of study drug (AE start date - last dose date &gt;30) will be listed, but not included in the summary tables below.</description>

        <description>A treatment-emergent adverse event (TEAE) is defined as an adverse event with an onset that occurs after receiving study drug and within 30 days after receiving the last dose of study drug. A TEAE may also be a pre-treatment adverse event or a concurrent medical condition diagnosed prior to the date of first dose of study drug, which increases in intensity after the start of dosing. Adverse events data with onset occurring more than 30 days after last dose of study drug (AE start date – last dose date &gt;30) will be listed, but not included in the summary tables below.</description>
