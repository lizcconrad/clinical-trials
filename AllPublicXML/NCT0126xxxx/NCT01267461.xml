  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Recently the general medical literature has become aware that the use of certain long-acting
      insulin analogues could potentially increase cancer risk.During the last few years the
      investigators group generated information of both scientific and clinical relevance on the
      proliferative and anti-apoptotic actions of insulin analogues. The goal of this project is to
      evaluate the hypothesis that the proliferative and signalling activities elicited by insulin
      analogues may have a impact on tumor behavior. In this study the investigators will asses the
      biological actions of insulin analogs in primary tumor cells of endometrial and colon cancer.
