      This is a Phase 2, randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, multicenter, prospective study to
      assess the efficacy, safety, and pharmacokinetics of two dose regimens of TP-434 compared
      with ertapenem in the treatment of adult community-acquired complicated intra-abdominal
      infections (cIAIs).
