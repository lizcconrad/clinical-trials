  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators carried out a randomized controlled trial comparing three methods of
      teaching. These three instructional methods consist of face to face lecture, interactive
      internet based teaching and computer based teaching (lecture synchronized with presentation).

      The hypotheses tested were: a) whether there is a difference between these three methods in
      knowledge achievement and b) whether there is a difference between Students satisfaction in
      three groups.

    <description>For providing materials for interactive internet-based group the professor's lecture was converted to an interactive electronic content. This content started with a case introduction followed with asking questions and then based on each student's answer a learning pathway would be assigned to his/her.</description>

    <description>For providing material for computer-based group the lecture of the same professor was recorded in studio environment and was synchronized with the slides that were similar to those for lecture-based group. Then the lecture and the slides were converted to a CD as a multimedia CD.</description>
