             recurrent or metastatic disease. NOTE: locally recurrent disease must not be amenable
             to surgery or radiation with curative intent.

          4. Measurable or evaluable disease according to RECIST v1.1 within 35 days prior to study
             registration.

          5. Disease must be amenable to biopsy (image-guided or via direct visualization of
             superficial lesions) with minimal risk to the patient. NOTE: Patients with disease
             limited to the lung and/or pleura are excluded.

          6. Disease must be HER2+ as defined by IHC 3+ or FISH ratio &gt; 2.0.

          7. Resistant to trastuzumab as defined as (1) progression within 12 months of completing
             adjuvant/neoadjuvant trastuzumab or (2) progression on trastuzumab administered for
             metastatic disease.

          8. Prior treatment with lapatinib or investigational HER2 targeted therapies is allowed
             but not required. There are no limits on the number of regimens or other prior
             anti-HER2 therapies patients have received.

             unstable angina History of symptomatic CHF (Grade &gt;3 by NCI CTCAE or Class &gt;II by NYHA
             criteria [see Appendix IV]) or serious cardiac arrhythmia requiring treatment within
             12 months of study registration, with the exceptions of atrial fibrillation and
             paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia History of myocardial infarction within 6
             months of study registration

         25. No history of cerebrovascular accident within 12 months of study registration

             require chronic steroids or anticonvulsants are eligible.

         27. Prior radiation therapy must not have involved &gt; 25% of bone marrow due to potential
             myelosuppression with GRN163L. See bone marrow chart in Appendix III
