    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is the increase of resection rate of primary cancer in rectal after
      short course radiotherapy without interrupt chemotherapy schedule during the period of
      chemotherapy. The subject should have the pathologically confirmed for unresectable
      (impossible to try Total mesorectal excision) rectal cancer with liver metastasis.

      This trial contributes to save the time for decreasing primary tumor in rectal and metastasis
      cancer to whole body after short course radiotherapy.
