    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the safety and efficacy of three doses (12.5, 25, and
      50 mg) of NBI-98854 for the treatment of the symptoms of tardive dyskinesia (TD) in subjects
      with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 2, open-label, dose titration study to assess the efficacy and safety of
      three once daily (q.d.) doses (12.5, 25, and 50 mg) of NBI-98854 administered once daily for
      up to 12 days consisting of three treatment periods of 4 days each (Periods 1, 2, and 3). The
      starting dose will be 12.5 mg q.d. (Period 1), and this dose will be escalated to 25 mg q.d.
      (Period 2) and then to 50 mg q.d. (Period 3) based upon each subject's ability to tolerate
      NBI-98854. Progression to the next dose level will be based upon the subject's ability to
      tolerate the previous dose and the Investigator's review of adverse events and safety data.
      For subjects who do not tolerate a dose increase, the dose may be decreased to the dose that
      was previously administered (i.e., 25 mg to 12.5 mg, 50 mg to 25 mg) and continued at that
      dose for the remainder of the study treatment. Up to 10 medically stable subjects with
      schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder who have moderate or severe symptoms of TD will be
      enrolled as outpatients.
