  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, phase 4 study to examine the safety and efficacy of vigabatrin
      (Sabril) in Tuberous Sclerosis patients, a subset of the larger refractory complex partial
      epilepsy population for which the drug is approved. While enrolled on this trial, subjects
      will continue to take all of their normally prescribed medications, including their other
      antiepileptic drugs (AEDs).

      Alternatively, there is a prospective observational arm that subjects who are about to take
      Sabril as treatment for seizures associated with Tuberous Sclerosis may join. Subjects who
      join this arm will not have any study visits and will not be asked to do anything
      specifically for the study. The study team will collect all study data from subjects' medical
      records only.

    <description>This is a single arm study. All subjects who are eligible for treatment will begin taking vigabatrin (Sabril) during the third month of the study. Treatment will be in accordance with the FDA-approved prescribing information: upward titration will happen at a rate of 500mg per week until subjects reach their maximum tolerated dose, or 3g per day (whichever is lower). This dose may be decreased if needed under the supervision of the study doctor. Subjects who need to lower their dose or who stop taking Sabril will have their dosage decreased at a rate of 1 gm/week for one month under the supervision of the study doctor.</description>

          -  Current, clinical diagnosis of a major depressive episode or suicidal ideation

          -  Patient is taking more than four concurrent AEDs. Note: VNS or ketogenic diet is

      <recruitment_details>Subjects were recruited for the treatment arm from within the Tuberous Sclerosis (TS) clinical at the University of Pennsylvania. Recruitment begain on 8/19/2010 and continued through 2013. All potential subjects had to be eligible to take Sabril (vigabatrin) under the FDA-approved prescribing information.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>Before taking Sabril, subjects were required to undergo visual field and depression screenings in response to the FDA's black box warning about Sabril causing vision loss, and an increased risk of suicidal ideation among patients taking antiepileptic drugs like Sabril. No potential subjects were excluded due to screening assessments.</pre_assignment_details>

          <description>The interventional arm of this phase 4 study involved subjects taking vigabatrin (Sabril) in accordance with standard of care, FDA approved dosing instructions. There were no planned arms; all subjects followed the FDA-approved prescribing label.
As there were not multiple treatment arms under investigation, per the FDA-approved prescribing label, the one and only subject who enrolled underwent upward titration happened at a rate of 500mg per week until she reached her maximum tolerated dose, or 3g per day. This dose was decreased as needed under the supervision of the study doctor. Again in accordance with standard of care, FDA-approved prescribing guidelines, when she stopped taking Sabril, her dosage decreased at a rate of 1 gm/week for one month under the supervision of the study doctor.</description>

Treatment will be in accordance with the FDA-approved prescribing information: upward titration will happen at a rate of 500mg per week until subjects reach their maximum tolerated dose, or 3g per day (whichever is lower). This dose may be decreased if needed under the supervision of the study doctor. Subjects who need to lower their dose or who stop taking Sabril will have their dosage decreased at a rate of 1 gm/week for one month under the supervision of the study doctor.</description>
