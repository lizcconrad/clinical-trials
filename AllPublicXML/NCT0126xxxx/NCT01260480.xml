  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether [18F]-ML-10 used in conjunction with PET
      imaging is effective as an imaging tool for the early detection of response of oncological
      tumors in the lungs,head and neck to chemoradiation therapy.

      The study will evaluate the potential of [18F]-ML-10 used in conjunction with PET imaging to
      distinguish early during the course of chemoradiation therapy between a tumor that responds
      to the therapy, and a tumor that does not respond to the therapy. Currently, this distinction
      is available to the physician several weeks or months after completion of therapy, using
      anatomical imaging (for example Computed Tomography [CT] or Magnetic Resonance Imaging
      [MRI]).

    <description>To assess the correlation between the changes in the uptake of [18F]-ML-10 in the target lesion following an accumulative radiation dose of 14.4-20.0 Gy, and the changes in the anatomical dimensions of the target lesion, as assessed by the follow-up anatomical imaging by CT, performed after completion of the concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CRT).</description>

             initiation of the concurrent CRT.
