  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      All subjects will be evaluated by the Research Nurse at the Clinical Translational Research
      Center (CTRC) Outpatient Clinic to obtain informed consent, a brief medical history, weight,
      body mass index, waist/hip circumference and vital signs. Additionally, blood will be drawn
      at this visit to screen for renal dysfunction (Chem 10), liver disease (liver function tests
      (LFT's)), thyroid dysfunction (TSH), diabetes mellitus (HbA1C), and chronic inflammatory
      states (erythrocyte sedimentation rate). Subjects recruited to the study will be placed on a
      low-carbohydrate diet (&lt;20 g/d without caloric restriction) designed either to promote weight
      loss or maintain weight stability for fourteen days prior to the protocol or they will
      consume a typical &quot;Western&quot; diet designed either to promote weight loss (restricted by 1300
      kcal/d in the final fourteen days) or maintain weight stability for twenty-one days. Subjects
      recruited to the study will be lean, overweight, or obese and also may carry a diagnosis of
      NAFLD. Target accrual for total enrollment for this project will be set to 80 subjects to
      accommodate attrition and screen failures. The details of the low-carbohydrate diet have been
      discussed in consultation with Linda Brinkley, nutrition staff of the CTRC. Subjects chosen
      to undergo carbohydrate-restriction will have a teaching session with a CTRC dietician.
      Subjects will then initiate dietary carbohydrate-restriction on their own and keep a daily
      dietary record for seven days. At the end of seven days, the dietary record will be analyzed.
      The CTRC will then prepare all meals for the final seven days of the diet in accordance with
      daily caloric intake calculated from the dietary record. Calorie-restricted participants will
      keep a dietary record for one week while eating a typical &quot;Western&quot; diet. The dietician will
      analyze this record and meals restricted by 1300 kcal/d will be prepared by the CTRC for the
      final fourteen days of the diet. Alternatively, some subjects eating a typical &quot;Western&quot; diet
      may consume prepared meals with a fixed content of carbohydrate, fat, and protein that is
      unrelated to their pre-study dietary intake. In this scenario, the dietary carbohydrate
      content may be varied between 30 and 60% to provide information on differences in hepatic
      metabolism under conditions of differing, but clinically sustainable, carbohydrate intake.
      All participants will be admitted to the CTRC the night prior to the study and begin an
      overnight fast after dinner. Between 18:00 and 09:00, subjects will receive two stable
      isotope tracers orally: [U-13C]propionate at 08:00 (three 400 mg doses given over 1 hour) and
      70% 2H2O at 22:00, 02:00, and 06:00. During the study subjects will also be given 0.5% 2H2O
      ad libitum. Two 500 mg acetaminophen tablets will also be given at 08:00. Between 08:00 and
      09:00 subjects will undergo measurement of their respiratory quotient (RQ) using the CTRC
      indirect calorimeter (Delta Trac II).. Subjects will then have an intravenous catheter placed
      and an infusion of tracer amounts of [3,4-13C2]glucose, [1,2-13C]β-hydroxybutyrate and
      [3,4-13C]acetoacetate will be initiated. At 1 ½ and 2 hours after initiation of the infusion,
      a 50 cc blood draw will be performed. Voided urine will be collected every hour after
      ingestion of acetaminophen until the protocol concludes. The subject will then be given a
      meal and discharged from the CTRC, marking the completion of the protocol. The collected
      blood and urine will be transported by the research coordinator to the Advanced Imaging
      Research Center lab for analysis by MRS. Another blood draw (approximately 10 cc) will be
      done in conjunction with the final MRI in order to measure changes in the lipid profile after
      the diet intervention. The visits in their entirety will be as follows:

      1 screening visit: 20 minutes

        1. dietician visit: 20 minutes

        2. MRS visits: 45 minutes each

      1 (optional) overnight visit: 20 hours

        Inclusion Criteria:

        The study will compare sources of hepatic glucose in individuals age 18 to 65 years matched
        for age, body mass index (BMI), gender, and ethnicity. Enrollment numbers will be higher to
        accommodate attrition and matching. The genders will be equally represented in both
        cohorts. The ethnicity of the participants will be chosen to match the general population
        in the Dallas area. Spanish speaking subjects will be eligible for enrollment. No cultural
        or ethnic background will be systematically excluded. The present study will be restricted
        to subjects who are overweight (25&gt;BMI&lt;35). All subjects will have a normal nutritional
        status and minimal ethanol intake (&lt; 10 g/d). Because activity level is known to alter
        hepatic metabolism, the subjects chosen will be those who do not participate in regular
        exercise above the amount of activity associated with daily living. Participation in
        concurrent studies will be determined on a case-by-case basis. Informed consent will be
        obtained from all participants.

        The investigators will also enroll subjects diagnosed with NAFLD from Dr. Browning's
        clinical hepatology practice.

        Based upon the need to study the effects of macronutrient manipulation under a variety of
        conditions, the targeted enrollment for this protocol will be open-ended. This will allow
        the present application to act as the basis for studying hepatic metabolism under a variety
        of conditions. The enrollment target is 80 subjects.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        In order to eliminate confounding variables, the participants chosen will have to be in
        stable health, on no medications known to alter hepatic glucose metabolism, on no weight
        loss diet or diet pills within the previous 6 months, and without baseline ketonuria. The
        present study will be restricted to subjects who are overweight (25&gt;BMI&lt;35). Subjects with
        a history of renal calculi, gout/hyperuricemia, renal insufficiency, will also be excluded
        from the study. Pregnant women, children, and institutionalized individuals will also be
        excluded. NAFLD subjects with metal in or on their body will be excluded.
