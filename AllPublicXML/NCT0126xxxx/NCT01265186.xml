  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Neonates treated on Neonatal Intensive Care Units are often critically ill, subject to
      numerous painful procedures and often dependent on mechanical ventilation. Mechanical
      ventilation as well as painful conditions require a sufficient analgesia and or an accurately
      regulated sedation. Newborns incapable of self-report are therefore dependent on the
      assessment of the infants level of pain and sedation by the treating team.

      The aim of this prospective, controlled, observer-blinded clinical trial is to compare the
      performance of two EEG based methods and a clinical sedation scale to measure the level of
      sedation in neonates. The Bispectral-Index (BIS) and the amplitude-integrated EEG (aEEG) are
      compared with the Neonatal Pain and Sedation Scale (N-PASS). We hypothesize a correlation
      between the clinical sedation score (N-PASS), the bispectral index (BIS) and the
      amplitude-integrated EEG (aEEG). Fifty-two mechanically ventilated term neonates and fifteen
      control patients are enrolled and observed for up to 72h.

    <description>The Bispectral-Index is continuously recorded for up to 72 hours in the group of ventilated newborns. Every 15 minutes, a value that was generated by averaging the BIS values of the last 15 minutes will be recorded (automatically calculated by the software of the readout device). The Bispectral-Index is continuously recorded for a minimum of 4 hours in the controls.</description>
