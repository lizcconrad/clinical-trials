    <textblock>
      Does the use of chlorhexidine scrub prior to cutaneous surgery on the face increase the
      chances of toxicity to the eyes or ears? In addition, does the us eof chlorhexidine scrub on
      the face prior to cutaneous surgery decrease the chances of a post-operative wound infection?

      The intent of this proposed prospective observational cohort study is to determine if there
      is a difference in the incidence of corneal toxicity and/or ototoxicity in study subjects
      undergoing Mohs micrographic surgery (MMS) on the face if a povidone-iodine preparation is
      used pre-operatively as compared to a chlorhexidine-alcohol preparation. It has recently been
      found that the use of a chlorhexidine-alcohol preparation is superior to the use of a
      povidone-iodine preparation in preventing post-operative surgical-site infections (SSI) in
      patients undergoing clean-contaminated surgery. However, the use of chlorhexidine on the face
      has previously been associated with corneal toxicity and ototoxicity. This study will help to
      further define previously reported risks of corneal toxicity and ototoxicity associated with
      the use of a chlorhexidine solution on the face.

        Consecutive patients 18 years of age or older undergoing Mohs micrographic surgery for a
        skin neoplasm(s) on the face at the Dermatology Surgery Center at the Mayo Clinic in
        Rochester, Minnesota, and at the University of Toronto in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, will be
        included. Exclusion criteria will include: those undergoing MMS for a lesion on the eyelid
        margin, patients with a history of ongoing eye pain, history of a pre-existing corneal
        ulcer within 12 months prior to surgery, history of a perforated tympanic membrane, and
        patients with an active infection at the operative site at the time of surgery. If
        post-operative follow-up is not completed, the study subject will be excluded from the
        study.
