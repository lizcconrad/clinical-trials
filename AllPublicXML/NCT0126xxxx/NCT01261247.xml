      Panobinostat may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for
      cell growth. This phase II trial is studying how well panobinostat works in treating patients
      with relapsed or refractory non-Hodgkin lymphoma

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To evaluate the proportion of confirmed response of LBH589 in patients
      with relapsed or refractory non-Hodgkin lymphoma. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To describe the
      toxicities associated with LBH589 in patients with NHL. II. To evaluate overall survival,
      progression-free survival, and duration of response in patients treated with LBH589. TERTIARY
      OBJECTIVES: I. To evaluate the pharmacokinetics of LBH589. II. To assess the correlation
      between clinical (toxicity and/or tumor response or activity) effects with the pharmacologic
      (pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic) parameters, and/or biologic (correlative laboratory)
      results. OUTLINE: Patients receive oral panobinostat 3 times weekly. Treatment repeats every
      28 days for up to 12 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 6 months for up to 2
      years.

    <time_frame>Every 28 days for up to 2 years</time_frame>
    <description>The primary endpoint of this phase II trial is the proportion of confirmed responses (complete response (CR) or partial response (PR)) noted as the objective status and will be considered synonymous with &quot;success&quot; for this study.Response will be evaluated using all cycles of treatment. A CR is defined using the Cheson et al. Revised Response Criteria for Malignant Lymphoma as Disappearance of all evidence of disease. A PR is defined as Regression of measurable disease and no new sites with ≥50% decrease in SPD of up to 6 largest dominant masses; no increase in size of other nodes. The proportion of successes will be estimated by the number of successes divided by the total number of evaluable patients.</description>

    <time_frame>Every 6 months for up to 2 years</time_frame>

    <measure>Median Progression-free Survival Time</measure>
    <time_frame>Every 6 months for up to 2 years</time_frame>
    <description>The median progression-free survival time is defined as the time from registration to progression or death due to any cause. The distribution of progression-free survival will be estimated using the method of Kaplan-Meier. Progression is defined using the Cheson et al. Revised Response Criteria for Malignant Lymphoma as: Any new lesion or increase by ≥50% of previously involved sites from nadir, Appearance of a new lesion(s) &gt; 1.5 cm in any axis, ≥50% increase from nadir in SPD of more than one node, or ≥50% increase in longest diameter of a previously identified node &gt; 1 cm in short axis, Lesions PET positive if FDG-avid lymphoma or PET positive prior to therapy, &gt; 50% increase from nadir in the SPD of any previous lesions, New or recurrent involvement.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Duration of Response</measure>
    <time_frame>Every 6 months for up to 2 years</time_frame>
    <description>Duration of response is defined for all evaluable patients who have achieved a confirmed response as the date at which the patient's objective status is first noted to be a CR or PR to the earliest date progression (PD) is documented. The distribution of duration of response will be estimated using the method of Kaplan-Meier. (CR: Disappearance of all evidence of disease, PR: Regression of measurable disease and no new sites, PD: Any new lesion or increase by ≥50% of previously involved sites from nadir).</description>

          -  Active bleeding tendency. NOTE: Patients on therapeutic anticoagulation should be
             monitored carefully to maintain therapeutic level of anticoagulation to avoid
             increased risk of bleeding due to concurrent drug induced thrombocytopenia. It is

A PR is defined as Regression of measurable disease and no new sites with ≥50% decrease in SPD of up to 6 largest dominant masses; no increase in size of other nodes. The proportion of successes will be estimated by the number of successes divided by the total number of evaluable patients.</description>
