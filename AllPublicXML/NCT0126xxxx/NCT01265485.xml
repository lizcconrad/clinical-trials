      This is an open label, dose-finding, 2-parts study. Approximately 6 subjects will be
      participating in this study. This study is composed of 2 parts:

      Part 1 is a dose finding study. Part 2 is a pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic study of an
      elected dose. A screening will be used to determine patients' suitability for inclusion in
      the trial. Within one week after the screening visit, subjects who meet all inclusion
      criteria and none of the exclusion criteria will enter part 1 of the study, one day of dose
      escalation. During this part, patients will undergo rectal manometry to determine anal
      pressure at baseline. Afterwards coated suppositories at various drug concentrations will be
      inserted and follow up manometries will be performed to determine response.

      Patients that presented with an increase in rectal resting pressure without adverse events
      will enter the second part of the study. In this part, patients will be administered with a
      coated suppository, at a dose found at part 1 of the study to cause significant anal
      contraction. Manometry studies will be performed before insertion (baseline) and at 1, 3 and
      5 hours after insertion.

      Blood levels for drug concentrations will be taken at times 0, 30, 60, 120, 180, 300 minutes
      after administration and rectal manometries will be done at times 0, 1, 3 and 5 hours after
      administration.
