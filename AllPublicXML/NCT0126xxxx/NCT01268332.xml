  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety of and adherence to a non-medicated IVR
      in HIV uninfected women over 12 weeks of use.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Women comprise a growing proportion of new HIV infections worldwide. Intravaginal rings
      (IVRs) used to deliver microbicides have the potential to significantly reduce the
      heterosexual transmission of HIV if found to be safe, acceptable, and effective against HIV
      infection. This study will investigate the safety and acceptability of a non-medicated
      silicone elastomer IVR in sexually active HIV uninfected women.

      The expected duration of this study for each participant is 16 weeks. Study participants will
      be randomly assigned to one of two arms. Participants in Group A will insert an IVR into
      their vagina at study entry. The IVR will remain in place for 12 weeks until removed by a
      physician. Follow up will continue for an additional 4 weeks after IVR removal. Participants
      in Group B will not receive an IVR, but will follow the same study schedule as those in Group
      A.
