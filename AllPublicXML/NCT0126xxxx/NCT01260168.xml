    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to confirm the sensitivity of a stool DNA test for detection
      of colorectal cancer and pre-cancer.

      Another objective is to provide anonymous, clinically characterized specimens for a
      bio-repository for future colorectal cancer-related test development.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients who have been recently diagnosed with colo-rectal cancer or pre-cancer will be asked
      to submit a stool sample(s)(at least 7 days AFTER colonoscopy) and will have the option of
      submitting blood and tissue samples for future colo-rectal cancer-related test development.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Subject is male or female, 40-90 years of age, inclusive.

          2. Subject has a diagnosis of CRC, at any stage, confirmed with a tissue biopsy and/or â‰¥1
             cm colorectal polyp/adenoma/mass identified on a colonoscopy that is of sufficient
             size to require surgical excision or complex colonoscopic polypectomy.

          3. Subject understands the study procedures and is able to provide informed consent to
             participate in the study and authorization for release of relevant protected health
             information to the study Investigator.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Subject has active synchronous extra-colonic aerodigestive tract cancers (e.g., lung,
             esophagus, stomach, or pancreatic cancer).

          2. Subject has a history of any inflammatory bowel disease.

          3. Subject has familial adenomatous polyposis, hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer
             (Lynch) syndrome, or other hereditary cancer syndromes.

          4. Individual has a condition the Investigator believes would interfere with his or her
             ability to provide informed consent, comply with the study protocol, which might
             confound the interpretation of the study results or put the person at undue risk.
