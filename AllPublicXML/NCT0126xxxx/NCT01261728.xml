  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to see if getting chemotherapy with Gemcitabine and Cisplatin
      for four 21 day cycles for a total of 12 weeks can help shrink the tumor before undergoing
      surgery for kidney cancer.

             on imaging or biopsy will be considered invasive by definition.

          -  Age ≥ 18 years of age

          -  Required Initial Laboratory Values:

               -  Absolute neutrophil count ≥ 1500 cells/mm3

               -  Alkaline phosphatase ≤ 2.5 x ULN for the institution

               -  Serum creatinine ≤ 1.3 mg/dL if male or ≤ 1.1 mg/dL if female OR calculated
                  creatinine clearance ≥ 55 ml/min/1.73m^2 If female of childbearing potential,
                  serum pregnancy test is negative.

          -  Patients with reproductive potential must use an effective method to avoid pregnancy
             for the duration of the trial.

        ml/min/1.73m2 using the formula: CKD epi : GFR = 141 X min(Scr/κ,1)α X max(Scr/κ,1)-1.209 X
        0.993Age X 1.018 [if female] X 1.159 [if black]

          -  Scr is serum creatinine, k is 0.7 for females and 0.9 for males, a is -0.329 for
             females and -0.411 for males, min indicates the minimum of Scr/k or 1, and max

          -  Concurrent treatment on another clinical trial involving an intervention which may
             affect the primary endpoint. Supportive care trials or non-treatment trials, e.g. QOL,
             are allowed.

          -  Ongoing treatment with therapeutic doses of warfarin or low molecular weight heparin
             (low dose warfarin up to 2 mg po daily or use of subcutaneous low molecular weight

          -  Pregnancy or breast-feeding. Patients must be surgically sterile or be postmenopausal,
             or must agree to use effective contraception during the period of therapy. The
             definition of effective contraception will be based on the judgment of the MSKCC and
