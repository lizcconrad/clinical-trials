  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Blood transfusion requirement represents one of the most significant cost driver associated
      with acute myeloid leukemia (AML). In addition to an increase prevalence of co morbidities in
      older patients, AML in older patients is more often associated with adverse features than in
      younger adults. Physicians might therefore decide to offer palliative or supportive care
      rather than intensive chemotherapy. An alternative treatment could be low-intensity therapy,
      such as LD-AraC or hypomethylating agents, which demonstrated better results than only Best
      Supportive care (BSC). Blood transfusion requirement represents one of the most significant
      cost driver associated with AML.

      The present study assesses the cost-effectiveness of intensive chemotherapy versus Best
      Supportive Care (BSC) versus alternative therapies (hypomethylating agents, low-dose cytosine
      arabinoside (LD-AraC), or other investigational drugs) in elderly patients aged 70 years or
      older regarding blood product transfusions from a French payer perspective. Intensive
      chemotherapy and BSC were the comparators in this analysis, since they continue to represent
      the most commonly used treatment for elderly AML according to the defined status of patients
      considered as 'fit' or 'unfit' for intensive chemotherapy.

    <time_frame>From starting treatment to death from any cause (up to 21 months)</time_frame>
    <description>The cost-effectiveness of blood product transfusion was determined among initial treatment subgroups: patients receiving intensive chemotherapy, patients receiving low-intensity treatments, and patients treated only by BSC.</description>

    <measure>Complete remission (CR) rate</measure>
    <time_frame>Duration of study (Month 21)</time_frame>
    <description>Complete remission (CR) was defined by bone marrow aspiration, which was required to consist of more than 50% normal cellularity with evidence of trilineage maturation and less than 5% bone marrow blasts, no evidence of extramedullary disease, and regeneration of the peripheral neutrophil count to 1.0 × 109/L and the platelet count to 100 × 109/L. The persistence of myelodysplastic features did not exclude the diagnosis of CR.</description>

    <time_frame>Duration of study (Month 21)</time_frame>
    <description>Decisions concerning transfusion indications were based on institutional policy and the clinical judgment of treating physicians. Transfusion practice was consistent during the period of study. Prophylactic transfusions were consistently given at morning platelet counts of &lt; 20 ×109/L and haemoglobin level &lt; 80 g/L. Protocol Blood products were leukoreduced through discarding the buffy coat and administered through a standard 140 to 170 µm blood filter but were not irradiated</description>

Azacitidine was given at the dose of 75 mg/m2/day for 7 consecutive days by sc injection. Decitabine was administered by intravenous route once daily at 20 mg/m2 for 5 consecutive days. Tipifarnib was given at 600 mg administered orally twice daily for 21 consecutive days in 4-week cycles.
