      Primary Objective:

      Part 1:

        -  Evaluate central nervous system (CNS) biomarkers in adult Gaucher disease (GD) type 3
           (GD3) patients that distinguish GD3 from Gaucher disease type 1 (GD1).

        -  Screen adult GD3 patients who qualify for treatment with GZ/SAR402671 in Part 2.

      Part 2:

        -  Evaluate the safety and tolerability of GZ/SAR402671 in adult GD3 patients.

        -  Evaluate the change in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) central nervous system (CNS) biomarkers
           from adult GD3 patients receiving GZ/SAR402671.

      Secondary Objectives:

        -  Evaluate the pharmacokinetics of GZ/SAR402671 in adult GD3 patients.

        -  Explore the efficacy of GZ/SAR402671 in infiltrative lung disease (IDL) in adult GD3
           patients.

        -  Explore the efficacy of GZ/SAR402671 in systemic disease in adult GD3 patients.

        -  Explore the efficacy of GZ/SAR402671 in neurological function and on exploratory CSF
           biomarkers in adult GD3 patients.
