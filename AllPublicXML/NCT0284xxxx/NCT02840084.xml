      Purpose: The purpose of this investigation is to test the safety and effectiveness of the
      Aspen System™ and Aspen Rehabilitation Technique. The device is intended for the therapeutic
      treatment of capsular contracture of the breast in conjunction with the Aspen Rehabilitation
      Technique. The hypothesis of the proposed study is that external ultrasound with the Aspen
      System™ device in conjunction with the Aspen Rehabilitation Technique is safe and effective
      in the reduction by at least one level of Baker Grade III capsular contracture in cosmetic
      breast augmentation patients, maintained at one year from the final treatment. Potential
      benefits of the study to subjects include improvement in the grade of capsular contracture of
      the breast without surgical treatment. The investigation is planned to last 12 months.

      Protocol:

      Objectives: Two stages are proposed for this study. In Stage I, the objective is to
      demonstrate the safety of the Aspen System™ and Aspen Rehabilitation Technique in the
      treatment of Baker Grade III capsular contracture of the breast following subglandular
      placement of saline implants for cosmetic breast augmentation. The endpoint will be the
      determination of safety as defined by no adverse events, including implant rupture. Following
      review of interim data and approval by the FDA, Stage II will commence. In Stage II, the
      objective will be to demonstrate safety and efficacy of the Aspen System™ and Aspen
      Rehabilitation Technique in the treatment of Baker Grade III capsular contracture of the
      breast following subglandular or submuscular placement of saline or silicone implants for
      cosmetic breast augmentation. The endpoint will be the documentation of efficacy as
      demonstrated by the reduction of at least one Baker Grade following treatment with the Aspen™
      System and Aspen Rehabilitation Technique.

      Description: This is a prospective, non-randomized trial.

      Conduct: The trial will be conducted as follows:

      Study Subjects: Patients will be recruited from the investigator's private practice and the
      local community. In stage I, 10 women aged 22 years or older who have received saline breast
      implants for subglandular breast augmentation, and who subsequently developed Baker Grade III
      capsular contracture, will be invited to participate. Upon completion of the first stage of
      this study, the data will be submitted to the FDA for review. The second stage of the study
      will not commence until approval has been obtained by the FDA. At this time, for the second
      stage of the study, the study group will be expanded to include an additional 50 patients who
      have received saline or silicone gel implants, placed in either the subglandular or
      submuscular position, with Grade III capsular contracture of the breast.

    <intervention_name>Aspen(TM) Ultrasound System</intervention_name>
    <description>Two transducers per breast are applied. There will be 10 30 minute sessions, with 2 sessions per week for five weeks. The transducers will be placed on the medial and lateral positions of the affected breast, and then rotated to the superior and inferior aspects, and finally directly over the nipple-areolar complex. Following treatment, the affected breast will be massaged and bandaged per the Aspen Rehabilitation protocol, and the patient will be provided with home exercises as part of the Aspen Rehabilitation Technique.
The treated breast(s) will be examined both prior to and immediately following each treatment session. To evaluate safety, any adverse events such as swelling, redness, or pain will be assessed. To determine efficacy, any change in the Baker Grade level will be assessed by physical examination. The breasts will be photographed prior to treatment at each visit to assist in evaluation of any visible change in the breasts.</description>
