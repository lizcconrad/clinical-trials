  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to evaluate the safety, tolerability, immunogenicity, and
      pharmacokinetics of up to 3 dose levels of EBI-031 given as an intravitreal injection in
      subjects with diabetic macular edema. There are two arms to the study, a single dose arm (1
      dose) and a repeat dose arm (1 dose each month for 3 months). Eligible subjects will
      initially enroll in the single dose arm and 3 to 6 subjects will be dosed at each of the 3
      dose levels. Safety will be assessed over the 28 days after the single dose prior to moving
      to the next higher dose level. Once all subjects in the single dose arm have been dosed with
      EBI-031 and the safety has been assessed eligible subjects will begin enrolling in the repeat
      dose arm. Subjects in the repeat dose arm will receive one dose each month for 3 months and
      will be assessed for safety. Escalation to the next higher dose will occur once it is
      determined safe to proceed to the next dose level. Six subjects will be dosed at each of the
      3 dose levels.
