      Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is characterized by a progressive increase in pulmonary
      vascular resistance leading to right ventricular (RV) failure and eventually to death. The
      therapeutic strategy has become complex and needs to perform recurring follow up evaluations
      including a right heart catheterization (RHC).

      Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (cMRI) has the advantage to accurately assess right
      ventricular (RV) volumes and important prognostic predictors such as cardiac index, stroke
      volume (SV) and right ventricular ejection fraction (RVEF).

      The main objective is to assess the hemodynamic diagnosis performances (sensibility and
      specificity) at baseline and at follow up visits of cMRI to detect an unfavorable hemodynamic
      status in comparison with the results of the RHC (current guidelines).

      The primary endpoint is: sensitivity and specificity of cMRI for the diagnosis of an
      unfavorable status defined by the current RHC criteria (with 95% confidence interval).

      The secondary objectives are: to identify clinical and hemodynamic variables independently
      contributing to prognosis, to quantify complications due to cMRI and to RHC and to compare
      acceptability and tolerability of cMRI over RHC for the patient.

      PAH patients will be recruited in 18 centers of the French network of severe pulmonary
      hypertension in a prospective cohort study.

      180 subjects will be enrolled in the study: that size will give the study 90% power to find
      significant at the 5%-level.

      If the primary endpoint were reached, since first, strategies and procedures planed in this
      project are consistent with those currently used in routine and second, inclusion criteria
      are not limited to a sub-population of PAH patients, positive results could allow to broadly
      extending our findings. Therefore, it will be possible to decrease the number of RHC, an
      invasive and cumbersome procedure without altering the prognosis. Moreover all clinical
      procedures would be performed in outpatient clinics and thereby would reduce the cost to
      assess the severity of the disease. Current recommendations for evaluation of severity and
      follow-up being mainly derived from consensus of opinion of the experts, positive results
      will also improve the level evidence of severity assessment of PAH patients.

      EValuation of cardiac magnetic resonance Imaging (cMRI) in follow up assessmenT of patients
      with pulmonary Arterial hypertension (PAH).

      Prospective cohort study of cMRI in PAH. Biomedical research 18 centers: CHRU de Nancy, APHP
      Bicetre hospital, CHRU de Bordeaux, CHRU de Brest, CHRU de Caen, CHRU de Dijon, CHRU de
      Grenoble, CHRU de Lille, CHRU de Lyon, CHRU de Marseille, CHRU de Montpellier, CHRU de Nice,
      CHRU de Poitiers, CHRU de Rennes, CHRU de Rouen, CHRU de Strasbourg, CHRU de Toulouse, CHRU
      de Tours.

      Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is characterized by a progressive increase in pulmonary
      vascular resistance leading to right ventricular (RV) failure and eventually to death. The
      therapeutic strategy has become complex and needs to perform recurring follow up evaluations
      including a right heart catheterization (RHC). Although, RHC performed in experience centers
      has low mortality and low morbidity, repeated invasive pulmonary hemodynamic measurements are
      burdensome and still presents some risk of complications. Once the diagnosis of PAH is
      established, follow up evaluation devoted to modify specific therapy relies mainly on RV
      function parameters. Thus, echocardiography and cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (cMRI)
      meet many of the criteria of ideal monitoring tools.

      Echocardiography is safe, inexpensive and widely available. However, this test has several
      limitations. Firstly, due to the complexity of the right ventricle chamber, the measurement
      of RV volumes is difficult. Secondly, criteria are numerous and for quantitative measurements
      different thresholds are applied without accepted definition. Thirdly, operator dependency
      could make it difficult to obtain reproducible images.

      Cardiac MRI has the advantage to accurately assess RV volumes and important prognostic
      predictors such as cardiac index, stroke volume (SV) and right ventricular ejection fraction
      (RVEF).

      It has been demonstrated that inter-observer and intra-observer variability for cMRI right
      ventricle measures in PAH patients were low. In addition, MRI-derived cardiac index, SV and
      RVEF significantly improved after few months of PAH specific therapy and had prognostic
      values regardless of changes of pulmonary vascular resistance in few trials of small size.

      In a preliminary study performed in the CHRU-Nancy the investigators found a significant
      correlation between cardiac outputs measured with cMRI and RHC (0.85, p&lt;0.001) in 21 PAH
      subjects. The agreement between the 2 methods was correct according to Bland-Altman plot.

      The purpose of the present study is to investigate a strategy for assessing PAH severity. The
      investigators propose to replace a currently recommended method, RHC, by cMRI.

      The investigators intend to use validated measurements of RV volumes and cardiac output with
      cMRI in order to demonstrate that cMRI can accurately evaluate the severity of the disease in
      a follow up strategy.

      The objectives of this project are to show that a non-invasive pulmonary hemodynamic
      evaluation of the disease severity using the cMRI is as effective as RHC, reliable and safe.
      The originality of this study is to compare in a multicenter study cMRI-derived variables
      with the currently recommended measurements requiring a RHC.

      The main objective is to assess the hemodynamic diagnosis performance (sensibility and
      specificity) at baseline and at follow up visits of cMRI to detect an unfavorable hemodynamic
      status in comparison with the results of the RHC.

      Diagnostic trial: cardiac MRI compared to RHC (current guidelines).

      The secondary objectives are 1) to 5):

        -  1. To assess the predictive value of the first occurrence of morbi-mortality events in 2
           different analyses derived, firstly from RHC criteria (cardiac index (CI)&lt; 2.5 l/min/m²
           or a right atrial pressure &gt; 8 mm Hg) and secondly from cMRI criteria (CI &lt; 2.5 l/min/m²
           or RVEF &lt; 35% or an absolute decrease of 10% of RVEF at a follow-up evaluation).

        -  2. To assess the univariable association between first morbi-mortality events occurrence
           and New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class, 6-minute walk distance, plasma
           level of B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP)/N-terminal(NT)-proBNP, and continuous
           hemodynamic variables from cMRI, RHC and echocardiography data collected at baseline and
           after 4-6 months of follow-up.

        -  3. To assess the multivariable association between first morbi-mortality events
           occurrence and the above factors, identifying clinical and hemodynamic variables
           independently contributing to prognosis. Using the results of this analysis the
           investigators plan to build a multiparameter prognostic score.

        -  4. To quantify complications due to cMRI and to RHC.

        -  5. To compare acceptability and tolerability of cMRI over RHC for the patient.

      Primary endpoint:

      Sensitivity and specificity of cMRI for the diagnosis of an unfavorable status defined by the
      current RHC criteria (with 95% confidence interval).

      Unfavorable hemodynamic status in RHC are a cardiac index&lt; 2.5 l/min/m² or a right atrial
      pressure &gt; 8 mm Hg (currently accepted criteria) versus MRI CI &lt; 2.5 l/min/m² or RVEF &lt; 35%
      or an absolute decrease of 10% of RVEF at a follow-up evaluation.

      Secondary endpoints:

      In relation to each secondary objectives 1) to 3):

      Morbi-mortality events will be defined as one of the first following events, which will be
      adjudicated by an independent committee: a) death from any cause, b) lung transplantation, c)
      atrial septostomy, d) worsening of PAH defined by all three following criteria: a decrease in
      the 6-minute walk distance of at least 15 % from baseline, a worsening of PAH symptoms and an
      unscheduled hospitalization due to PAH, e) unsatisfactory status from non-hemodynamic
      parameters at a follow up visit: clinical evidence of right ventricular failure unresponsive
      to oral diuretic therapy, or NYHA functional class IV or a worsening of functional class from
      II to III or a 6-minute walk distance &lt; 300 m (in the absence of other causes than PAH), or a
      very elevated and rising BNP/NT-proBNP.

      Adjudication of this morbi-mortality endpoint will be performed blinded of pulmonary
      hemodynamic follow-up data.

      In relation to secondary endpoints 4) and 5) of secondary objective: All adverse events will
      be collected, physical and psychological distress due to cMRI and RHC will be assessed by
      questionnaires using Likert scales. The patient will complete these questionnaires few
      minutes after undergoing cMRI and RHC.

      Prospective cohort study PAH patients will be recruited in 18 centers of the French network
      of severe pulmonary hypertension.

      A routine search for conditions known to cause pulmonary hypertension will be performed
      according to current guidelines. Therefore all patients will undergo at baseline an
      echocardiography, a RHC and other current routine tests. This will be the screening period.
      Then all patients selected will sign the written informed consent. Subsequently, in the
      context of the study, a cMRI will be performed.

      According to the current guidelines at the end of the baseline visit PAH-specific drug
      therapy will be initiated or associated to the treatment already in progress in incident
      cases and prevalent cases, respectively.

      The inclusion phase will last 24 months. A comprehensive severity evaluation will be
      performed at 4-6 months, after 24 months of follow-up and in case of clinical worsening.
      According to current guidelines, these assessments will include NYHA functional class,
      6-minute walk distance, plasma level of BNP/NT-proBNP and RHC. As part of an ancillary study,
      30 ml of venous blood will be collected during all RHC. An echocardiography will be performed
      at the discretion of the investigator. According to the purpose of the present study, at all
      these visits a cMRI will also be performed.

      All clinical procedures except cMRI are those of standard care.

      Morbi-mortality will be collected prospectively until the last patient has completed his
      24-month follow up visit.

      RHC will be done according as currently recommended.

      MRI data interpretation:

      MRI protocol and post-processing guidelines will be sent prior to site initiation in order to
      apply the same method of cMRI in all centers. This will avoid important measurement error.

      RV contouring and indexed aortic flow measurement will be performed locally with the
      dedicated software used in clinical practice by the physicians of each center. Cardiac index
      and RVEF will be derived from these measures. All cMRI images will be sent and stored at the
      CHRU Nancy. MRI interpretation will be performed blindly with respect of clinical and RHC
      data.

      All adverse events will be collected during the follow up.

      The questionnaire assessing physical and psychological distress will be presented a few
      minutes after all RHC and all cMRI.

      180 subjects will be enrolled in the study: that size will give the study 90% power to find
      significant at the 5%-level a sensitivity or specificity of:

        -  90% with a lower 95% confidence limit of 75%,

        -  60% with a lower 95% confidence limit of 40%.

      General considerations:

      Analysis of primary and secondary endpoints will be performed in the intention-to-treat and
      confirmatory analyses in the per-protocol populations. The 2-tailed significance level will
      set to p&lt;0.05.

      Complications of cMRI and RHC (secondary objective 4) The frequency of adverse events
      reported during the follow-up will be compared between groups using the Chi-Square test (or
      Fisher's exact test where requested).

      Relative tolerability of cMRI and RHC (secondary objective 5) The investigators will use the
      Kruskal-Wallis test to determine if the overall physical and psychological distress scores
      are different across the two groups.

      If the primary endpoint were reached, positive results could allow to broadly extending our
      findings. Therefore, it will be possible to decrease the number of RHC, an invasive and
      cumbersome procedure without altering the prognosis. Positive results will also improve the
      level evidence of severity assessment of PAH patients.

      According to the secondary objectives the investigators expect to better predict
      morbi-mortality events with cMRI compared to RHC. Thus a composite score will be constructed
      including cMRI parameter and will be internally validated. Such a score can then be easily
      externally validated and widely used.

      A biological repository will be carried out including DNA, plasma and serum at baseline and
      plasma and serum at follow up evaluations. The investigators will apply to other grants for
      funding this biobank.
