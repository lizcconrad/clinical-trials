  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective is to determine feasibility and acceptability of a text message (SMS)-based
      relapse prevention intervention as measured through: (1) study retention and SMS query
      completion rates and (2) participant ratings of PIER1 interest, perceived efficacy, and ease
      of use. Methods: A mixed methods study of adult (age &gt;=18) ED patients who seek treatment for
      opioids and have evidence of dependence based on Rapid Opioid Dependence Screen (RODS) score
      of &gt;3 and are being discharged to outpatient (community) resources. All participants receive
      standard of care in the ED, complete a baseline web survey, are asked to text with us for at
      least 7 days (up to a max of 28 days) and are asked to complete a follow-up phone call
      between day 8 and 14. Investigators expect preliminary findings to support a relapse
      prevention intervention delivered through SMS. Based on feedback from this mixed methods
      study, investigators plan to test a refined SMS program in a randomized trial.

    <textblock>
      The vast majority of those with opioid dependence do not receive treatment. This may be due
      to the limited availability of existing treatment programs and to a range of societal and
      individual-level barriers, including the stigma associated with identifying oneself as a
      substance user and difficulty attending a treatment program on a regular basis.
      Technology-based interventions have potential to help address these barriers and to expand
      access to evidence-based psychosocial treatment. Automated, computer-based interventions have
      found high user acceptance and utilization and shown promise in treating substance use
      disorders. The current study will evaluate a text-message-based psychosocial program called
      PIER1 (Preventing and Interrupting Early Relapse 1) when delivered to treatment-seeking
      opioid-dependent emergency department (ED) patients. PIER1 is an interactive program based on
      the Relapse Prevention Model. It is also informed by cognitive behavioral therapy and
      motivational interviewing.

    <description>The program will help participants learn to recognize the presence of craving and how it can be reduced through environmental, self-regulatory and mood management. Each day, the PIER1 program sends (1) a morning reflection focused on positive thinking, (2) two random prompts assessing severity of craving, (3) feedback specific to managing withdrawal symptoms, mood management, and environmental triggers that are affecting craving, (4) evening assessments of drug use with feedback, (5) goal commitment prompt with feedback, and (6) user-triggered craving assessments with feedback</description>
