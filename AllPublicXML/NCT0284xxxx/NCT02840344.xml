  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to improve relationship, psychological, and physical adjustment among young
      breast cancer survivors (YBCS; diagnosed at age 45 or younger) and their committed/life
      partners. A mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) intervention has been designed to meet
      the specific needs for young breast cancer survivors and their partners. The intervention
      will be administered in your home by using recorded videos of a trained MBSR instructor.
      Before, during, and after the 8-week intervention, participants will be asked to complete
      surveys.

      Participants will be young breast cancer survivors (YBCS) and their partners. Young breast
      cancer survivors are those diagnosed at age 45 or younger. This study includes stress
      reducing interventions known to have a positive influence on physical and psychological
      functioning that will be administered through recorded videos. The interventions include
      watching an hour-long video stress-reduction class, each week, for 8 weeks and practicing
      guided meditations. YBCS participants will be randomly assigned to either an 8-week
      mindfulness-based stress reduction course designed for couples (C-MBSR) or an 8-week
      mindfulness-based stress reduction course for individuals. At the end of the study all
      participants (regardless of what assignment) will receive both sets of stress-reducing
      videos. Partners of the YBCS assigned to the couples condition will also be asked to watch
      the 8 C-MBSR videos. Some young breast cancer survivor participants and their partners will
      be asked to complete provide salivary cortisol and all survivors and partners will be asked
      to complete the 4 surveys.

    <description>Young breast cancer survivors and their partners take part in an 8-week Couples Mindfulness-Based Stress reduction (C-MBSR) intervention. The course will be taught through recorded videos of a trained MBSR instructor. The young breast cancer survivor and partner will be asked to watch a video module, together, each week for a total of 8 weeks. The C-MBSR course consists of practicing mindful stress reduction techniques and filling out handouts.
Both members of the couple will be asked to complete surveys assessing primary and secondary outcome measures administered at baseline and after final session. Participants will be asked to provide a Salivary Cortisol sample at baseline and after the 8th session. Follow up Surveys will be administered at one and three months after intervention.</description>
