  <brief_title>Closed-loop Control of Glucose Levels (Artificial Pancreas) for 15 Weeks in Adolescents and Adults With Type 1 Diabetes</brief_title>

  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Closed-loop strategy is composed of three components: glucose sensor to read glucose levels,
      insulin pump to infuse insulin and a dosing mathematical algorithm to decide on the required
      insulin dosages based on the sensor's readings. A dual-hormone closed loop strategy regulates
      glucose levels through the infusion of two hormones: insulin and glucagon.

      The objective of this study is to compare, in a randomized multicenter trial, the
      effectiveness of single-hormone closed-loop, dual-hormone closed-loop, and sensor-augmented
      pump therapy with low-glucose suspend in regulating day-and-night glucose levels in
      outpatient settings for 15 weeks in adolescents and adults.

      The investigators hypothesize that dual-hormone closed-loop will reduce time spent in
      hypoglycemia compared to single-hormone closed-loop, which in turn will be more effective
      than sensor-augmented pump therapy with low-glucose suspend.

    <description>Participants will use sensor-augmented pump therapy with low-glucose suspend to regulate glucose levels. The low-glucose suspend feature available in the MiniMed® Paradigm® Veo™, Medtronic combined with the Enlite sensor® will be used. This feature allows for suspension of insulin delivery at a pre-set sensor glucose value for up to 2 hours.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Males and females ≥ 12 years of old.

          2. Clinical diagnosis of type 1 diabetes for at least one year.

          3. The subject will have been on insulin pump therapy for at least 3 months.

          4. HbA1c ≤ 11%.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Clinically significant nephropathy, neuropathy or retinopathy as judged by the
             investigator.

          2. Recent (&lt; 6 months) acute macrovascular event e.g. acute coronary syndrome or cardiac
             surgery.

          3. History of pheochromocytoma or insulinoma (glucagon could induce a hormonal response
             of these tumors)

          4. Beta‐blockers at high dose based on investigator's evaluation of dosage interference
             with glucagon (glucagon can modify effect of beta-blockers, mostly evident at very
             high doses)

          5. Chronic indometacin treatment (can prevent glucagon effect on liver thus its ability
             to raise glucose)

          6. Chronic acetaminophen treatment (can interfere with glucose sensor measurements)

          7. Warfarin chronic treatment if INR monitoring cannot be evaluated (can increase the
             risk of bleeding)

          8. Anticholinergic drug (risk of interaction)

          9. Pregnancy.

         10. Severe hypoglycemic episode within two weeks of screening.

         11. Current use of glucocorticoid medication (except low stable dose and inhaled
             steroids).

         12. Known or suspected allergy to the trial products

         13. Other serious medical illness likely to interfere with study participation or with the
             ability to complete the trial by the judgment of the investigator.

         14. Anticipating a significant change in exercise regimen between admissions (i.e.
             starting or stopping an organized sport).

         15. Treatments that could interfere with glucagon
