      Introdution: The Kangaroo Mother Care is a perinatal care model for preterm and low weight
      newborn. The Kangaroo Position is the main feature of this method. The infant should be
      lightly dressed, in prone position and upright against the torax of the parents. Researches
      provides evidence that the Kangaroo Position induces an increase in myoelectric activity of
      preterm newborn. However, it is unknown how long the newborn should remain in the kangaroo
      Position so that ocurr changes in electromyographic. An increase in electromyographic
      activity was observed after 24 hours or more of submission to the Position Kangaroo, however
      period lower of submission to the Position Kangaroo have not been evaluated yet. Also unknown
      are the physiological mechanisms that cause this muscle response. One hypothesis would be the
      increase in temperature caused by skin to skin contact which could improve circulation in
      small vessels with direct influence on the infusion and nutrition of muscle tissue.
      Objective: Evaluate the immediate effect of Kangaroo position in the electromyographic
      activity and microcirculation of preterm newborn. Method: It will be a randomized and
      controlled trial from August 2016 to February 2017 with newborn preterm admitted at the
      Kangaroo Unit, IMIP. Newborns eligible according to the inclusion and exclusion criteria will
      be randomized into two groups: Kangaroo Group (experimental group) and Not Kangaroo Group
      (control group). The data of the electromyographic activity and the microcirculatory
      parameters will be assessed and recorded in three stages: before the Kangaroo position, one
      and three hours after of continuous submission in the Kangaroo Position (for the group of
      cases) and before the Kangaroo position, one and four after the three assessments (for the
      control group). In the control group, the preterm newborns will be not submitted to Kangaroo
      position until the completion of the last and third evaluation. The acquisition of the
      electromyographic signal will be conducted through an equipment electromyography Miotool 400®
      brand (Miotec Equipamentos Biomédicos - Brasil). To assess microcirculation will be used for
      the white light spectroscopy method through the drive moorVMS-OXY®. The project was submitted
      and approved by Ethics Committee for Research on Human Beings of IMIP (52381915.5.0000.5201).
      This study is part of a anchor project approved by Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento
      Científico e Tecnológico- CNPq (process 458163/2014-7).
