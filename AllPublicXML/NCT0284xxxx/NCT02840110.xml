    <textblock>
      Subjects treated with ACTR087 may participate in this long-term follow-up study after the
      completion of the final scheduled visit in the parent clinical study or other investigational
      setting, such as compassionate use, named patient IND, expanded access program, or equivalent
      setting. No investigational product or treatment will be administered in this study. These
      subjects will be followed for safety monitoring on a schedule of decreasing frequency through
      15 years post-ACTR087 treatment, in accordance with US FDA Regulatory guidance pertaining to
      long-term safety follow-up for study subjects receiving recombinant DNA-containing
      investigational products.

      Blood for replication competent retrovirus (RCR) testing

      Remaining biological samples from other protocol procedures (e.g., blood for presence of
      ACTR+ T cells) may also be stored, at the discretion of the sponsor, for potential future
      biomarker analyses of T cells, DNA, RNA, and other cells or molecules to study immunology or
      gene therapy.

      Optional blood, bone marrow, and tissue samples also may be collected in the event of a
      subject's death if an autopsy is performed.
