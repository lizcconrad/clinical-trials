  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether a supervised exercise-training program,
      initiated prior to chemotherapy induction (pre-conditioning) and continued throughout
      chemotherapy treatment, can preserve short- and long-term cardiovascular performance,
      skeletal muscle function, cognitive ability and quality of life better than current standard
      or care recommendations for exercise during chemotherapy.

      The primary aim of this study is to determine the efficacy of a novel, high-intensity aerobic
      interval exercise preconditioning protocol to ameliorate anthracycline-mediated cardiac and
      skeletal muscle toxicity in women with breast cancer undergoing de novo chemotherapy.

      Research Design:

      Women with breast cancer scheduled to undergo de novo chemotherapy with anthracyclines will
      be enrolled. Qualified patients will be randomized to either 1) a high-intensity interval
      exercise group, or 2) an attention-control group.

      Supervised exercise training will be carried out at the Mayo Clinic Cardiac rehabilitation
      center in Arizona on cycle ergometers using Electrocardiogram (EKG) telemetry. Patients in
      the high-intensity interval exercise group will perform four, 4-min intervals at 85-90% peak
      heart rate (PHR), separated by 3 min at 50% PHR. Each training session will begin with a
      10-minute warm-up at 50% of PHR and end with a 5-min cool down at 50% PHR.

      The attention-controls will receive counseling consistent with standard of care regarding
      physical activity during chemotherapy. Attention-control group will receive a weekly phone
      call to maintain physical activity during chemotherapy and compliance will be verified using
      physical activity diaries and pedometers.

      Treatment for each group will commence 1-week prior to chemotherapy induction. The first dose
      of chemotherapy will be given within 16-18 hours of the last bout of exercise. High-intensity
      intermittent exercise (HIIE) training will be continued throughout four, 2-week cycles of
      chemotherapy (total training time = 9 weeks, 3 days/week).
