    <textblock>
      Preterm birth (PTB), defined as birth between 20 and 36 6/7 weeks, is responsible for the
      majority of the neonatal morbidity and mortality in the United States, and 35% of all U.S.
      healthcare spending on infants. Globally, about 28% of the 4 million annual neonatal deaths
      are directly attributable to PTB.

      Preterm labor (PTL) is the final pathway for about 50% of all PTB. Tocolytic agents are drugs
      that can slow or stop labor contractions in the attempt to delay births preceded by PTL.
      Primary tocolysis is defined as tocolysis given on initial presentation of women with PTL. In
      most of these women, PTL stops, but as their risk of PTB remains high, some have advocated
      use of maintenance tocolysis, i.e. tocolysis after arrested PTL. So far, no maintenance
      tocolytic agent has been shown to be beneficial in preventing PTB.

      The aim of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of maintenance tocolysis with Arabin
      pessary compared to standard care in singleton gestations with arrested PTL and with short
      transvaginal ultrasound (TVU) cervical length (CL) &lt;25mm
