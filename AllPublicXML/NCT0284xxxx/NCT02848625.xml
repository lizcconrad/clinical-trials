      This study will evaluate whether regular yoga exercises designed specifically for patients
      with Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis is associated with any change in quality of life. Half of
      the participants will be randomized to yoga, half to usual care. After the first group
      completes 12 weeks of yoga, the patients who were randomized to usual care will completed 12
      weeks of yoga.

    <textblock>
      Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF) is a chronic progressive fibrotic (scarring) disease of
      the lung of unknown cause. Approximately 100,000 Americans will die from IPF this year. There
      is no cure for IPF other than lung transplantation, which only 1% of patients will receive.
      Recently, 2 drugs were approved by the FDA to slow the rate of decline in lung function among
      patients with IPF. These drugs do not decrease symptoms or improve quality of life.

      Symptoms of IPF include shortness of breath, cough, and fatigue, all of which may also
      adversely affect quality of life. Yoga is a practice of exercises, including breathing
      exercises, that has been shown to be relatively safe and to improve quality of life in some
      patients with other advanced lung diseases. We hypothesize that regular yoga and breathing
      exercises, specifically designed for patients with Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis, over a
      period of 12 weeks will lead to improved quality of life as measured by several different
      quality of life questionnaires.

        Inclusion Criteria: Adults 18 years of age or older. We will include all consecutive
        consenting patients with IPF who are able to provide informed consent and are seen and
        followed at the Center for Interstitial Lung Disease at the University of Washington
        Medical Center.

        Exclusion Criteria: Subjects with comorbid diseases that would prohibit them from taking
        part in yoga will be excluded at the discretion of the clinical-investigators. Such
        comorbid diseases would include paralysis, musculoskeletal discomfort that would interfere
        with participation or broken limbs. Since we are interested in the effect of yoga among
        subjects with IPF, we will exclude subjects who have previously received lung
        transplantation. To assess the effect &quot;new&quot; or &quot;initial&quot; participation in a yoga program
        with breathing exercises on quality of life, subjects who are regularly participating in
        yoga (outside of the study) will be excluded.
