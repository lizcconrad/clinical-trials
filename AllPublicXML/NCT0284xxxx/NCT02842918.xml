  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      No studies have investigated the effects of a supine thoracic spine manipulation (TSM) on
      neurodynamic mobility, as compared to a sham intervention. This study aims to determine the
      immediate effects of TSM on the Upper Limb Provocation Test (ULPT) and Seated Slump Test
      (SST) compared to a sham intervention in asymptomatic subjects with neurodynamic limitations.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A convenience sample will be utilized to obtain subjects. Subjects will be given a brief
      questionnaire to identify possible contraindications for spinal treatment techniques and
      exclude individuals if necessary. Subjects will be randomized into one of two groups (spinal
      manual therapy or spinal range of motion which will serve as the name for the placebo group)
      and participate in neurodynamic testing procedures of the upper extremity (Upper Limb
      Provocation Testing) as well as lower extremity (Seated Slump Test). Subjects who are
      determined to be positive for one or more limbs will receive either a thoracic spine
      manipulation technique (spinal manual therapy) or a thoracic spine sham manipulation
      technique (spinal range of motion/placebo). After application of the technique, previously
      positive limbs will be retested. In attempt to determine validity and believability of the
      sham procedure and perception of its effect, subjects will be asked if they believe their
      upper/lower quarter mobility will change based on the group name and after the technique is
      applied. Subjects will also be asked if they believed they were in the treatment or placebo
      group.

    <time_frame>Pre and Immediately Post Intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Subjects will lie on their back with their shoulder slightly off the edge of a treatment table. The investigator will then bend the subjects neck away from the shoulder being tested and position the arm into the starting test position. The investigator will then straighten the subjects elbow until it is fully extended, or until the subject reports discomfort or an abnormal feeling in their arm. This procedure will be completed before and immediately after either the treatment intervention (manipulation) or the sham intervention is completed.</description>

    <measure>Seated Slump Test Range of Motion Change (measured in degrees of knee extension)</measure>
    <time_frame>Pre and Immediately Post Intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Subjects will sit at the edge of treatment table. Subjects will be asked to flex then neck towards their chest. The investigator will then apply a gentle force to their upper back and will ask the subject to remain in this position. The investigator will move the subjects foot upwards and straighten their leg until it is fully extended or until the subject reports discomfort or an abnormal feeling in their leg.This procedure will be completed before and immediately after either the treatment intervention (manipulation) or the sham intervention is completed.</description>
