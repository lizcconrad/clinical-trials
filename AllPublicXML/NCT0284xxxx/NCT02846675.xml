  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      it's a self-control, double blind study of autologous adipose-derived stromal vascular
      fraction (SVF) to treat 50 osteoarthritic knees of grade II or III (K-L scale) under
      IRB-approved protocol in a feasibility and safety study.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The adipose-derived SVF was obtained through disaggregation of lipoaspirate and resuspension
      of the SVF in 2 ml saline, with at least 50 million nucleated SVF cells and a mean viability
      of 85%, injected per single knee and the other knee treated with placebo.

      Cell suspension and placebo will be injected using ultrasound guidance. Safety and knee
      function will be evaluated by questionaires monthly and MRI in every three months post-op.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Grade II or Grade III osteoarthritis using Kellgren-Lawrence grading scale (K-L Grade)
             as diagnosed using weight bearing X-ray, physician review, and/or pre-op MRI.

          -  Study Subjects must have failed a minimum of at least two conservative therapies,
             spanning a period of at least 3 months.

          -  Study Subjects must be willing to voluntarily give written Informed Consent to
             participate in the study and sign the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability
             Act (HIPAA) authorization before any study procedures are performed.

          -  Subjects will be in good health (ASA Class I-II) with a BMI &lt; 35.

          -  Subjects must have continued pain in the knee despite conservative therapies for at
             least 3 months.

          -  Subjects with unilateral disease must present with symptomatic knee pain using the
             WOMAC subscale for pain.

          -  Subjects must speak, read and understand English.

          -  Subjects must be reasonably able to return for multiple follow-up visits.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Any illness which, in the Investigator's judgment, will interfere with the patient's
             ability to comply with the protocol, compromise patient safety, or interfere with the
             interpretation of the study results

          -  Patients on chronic immunosuppressive transplant therapy
