        Recruitment strategies included attendance at the outpatient obesity clinics at the
        investigators Department or the outdoor hospital of the Campus Salute. The study is part of
        a large database started in 2010 to investigate the health status of the general population
        of Campania Region as analysed by the free consultation, visit, and diagnostics for people

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Caucasian Subjects

          -  Healthy Subjects (defined as absence of a clinical condition that potentially
             influences fluid balance, ie, renal, endocrine, or myocardial disease, ascertained by
             participant questionnaire)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Hypocaloric diet in the last three months or specific nutritional regimens, including
             vegan or vegetarian diets,

          -  Vitamin/mineral or antioxidant supplementation,

          -  Clinical conditions that could influence fluid balance, including liver or renal
             failure, cancer, and acute or chronic inflammatory diseases, based on a complete
             medical examination and laboratory investigations,

          -  Occasional or current of use of drugs that could influence fluid balance, including
             non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, hormone replacement therapy, diuretics
             weight-loss medications, anticonvulsivants and psychotropic agents, laxative use,

          -  Altered thyroid hormone function tests or thyroid hormone treatment,

             (DSM)-V diagnostic criteria,

          -  Patients with implanted pacemakers or defibrillators because of the theoretical
             possibility of interference with the device activity due to the field of current
             induced by the impedance measurements,

          -  Subjects underweight with BMI&lt;18.5,

          -  Subjects dropped out from the study since they refused to participate.
