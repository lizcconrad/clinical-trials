        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients must have histologically confirmed head and neck cancer (Squamous cell
             histology as well as HPV+ and/or EBV+ head and neck tumors), Stages IVA, IVB, and
             select cases of Stage III (see additional criteria below).

          2. Completed curative intent therapy, without additional standard of care curative intent
             therapy feasible (see below for additional details).

          3. After prior curative intent treatment for HNC have estimated risk of recurrence
             ≥40-50% and fall into one of the below categories (A, OR B, OR C, OR D, OR E). While
             exact estimation of the risk of recurrence can be difficult the following categories
             will be included reflecting patients at substantial risk for tumor recurrence or
             already with early evidence of recurrence:

               -  A- Any of the below HNC patients are eligible for adjuvant treatment on this
                  protocol AFTER completion of curative intent therapy:

               -  HPV(-) HNC: N2C, N3, bulky N2B disease (≥5cm LN/tumor conglomerate).

               -  HPV(+) HNC: N2C, N3, AND ≥10 pack years of tobacco use

               -  HPV(+) HNC with multilevel nodal involvement, AND bulky N2B disease (≥5cm
                  LN/tumor conglomerate), AND ≥ 10 pack years of tobacco use

               -  EBV(+) NPC may be eligible if other criteria under A, or alternative criteria B,
                  or C, or D, or E are met.

               -  HNC with supraclavicular or mediastinal nodal involvement (either HPV+ or HPV- or
                  EBV+) at time of curative intent treatment

               -  Residual mass in area of prior tumor that on biopsy does not show residual tumor,
                  but remains of concern and requires close follow-up AND is not
                  resected/resectable.

               -  Non-responders to induction chemotherapy (PD on induction, or lack of tumor
                  shrinkage (&lt;15% per RECIST)

               -  Interrupted treatment course or lower than intended radiation dose - i.e.
                  interruption of radiation by ≥3 weeks (cumulative), or delivery of ≤50 Gy as part
                  of a radiation based treatment (that was NOT a de-escalation approach).

               -  Persistence of EBV+ or HPV+ DNA from blood post treatment and meets criteria C OR
                  E

               -  B- Patient treated with salvage treatment (i.e. salvage surgery or
                  re-irradiation) for residual or recurrent tumor after prior radiation based
                  therapy (either HPV+ or HPV- or EBV+) AND not a candidate for additional curative
                  intent therapy (for various reasons including poor performance status,
                  comorbidities, refusal of patient, prior radiation or re-irradiation, etc).
                  Positive margins or residual tumor may still be acceptable (see D))

               -  C- Mx (≤2cm longest diameter) or indeterminate distant lesion that was present
                  before curative intent therapy and either shrunk with therapy or remains
                  visible/stable post therapy (may include SBRT treatment to such lesions).

               -  D- Oligometastatic disease treated with SBRT or other curative-intent therapy
                  (e.g. surgery or RFA, etc) for oligometastatic disease.

               -  E- Microscopic or low volume residual tumor after surgery or radiation based
                  treatment (including salvage treatment or oligomet/SBRT), AND not a candidate for
                  additional curative intent therapy (for various reasons including feasibility,
                  poor performance status, comorbidities, refusal of patient, prior radiation or
                  re-irradiation, etc). Low volume disease is defined as no more than 5 lesions,
                  which are ≤2 cm in longest diameter, OR difficult to assess tumor measurement
                  that is roughly equivalent in volume to a tumor ≤2cm in diameter (up to 5
                  lesions).

                    -  Please note - measurable disease is NOT required, but as a general guidance
                       patients with measurable disease may be better served on a dedicated
                       treatment trial.

                    -  There may be additional scenarios for patients that are considered very high
                       risk for disease recurrence and such patients can be considered for
                       enrollment after discussion and approval by the PI and/or co-PI.

          4. Availability of tumor tissue (≥10 slides) for PD-L1, gene expression profiling (GEP),
             and additional testing.

          5. Be willing and able to provide written informed consent/assent for the trial.

          6. Be 18 years of age on day of signing informed consent.

          7. Have a performance status of 0 or 1 on the ECOG Performance Scale. An ECOG performance
             status of 2 is acceptable if the patient was ECOG 0/1 prior to curative intent therapy
             and is in the midst of recovery from curative intent therapy

          8. Demonstrate reasonable organ function, all screening labs should be performed within
             10 days of treatment initiation.

          9. Female subject of childbearing potential should have a negative urine or serum
             pregnancy test within 72 hours prior to receiving the first dose of study medication.
             If the urine test is positive or cannot be confirmed as negative, a serum pregnancy
             test will be required.

         10. Female subjects of childbearing potential should be willing to use 2 methods of birth
             control or be surgically sterile, or abstain from heterosexual activity for the course
             of the study through 120 days after the last dose of study medication. Subjects of
             childbearing potential are those who have not been surgically sterilized or have not
             been free from menses for &gt; 1 year.

         11. Male subjects should agree to use an adequate method of contraception starting with
             the first dose of study therapy through 120 days after the last dose of study therapy.

             due to agents administered more than 4 weeks earlier.

          6. Has had prior chemotherapy, targeted small molecule therapy, or radiation therapy
             within 2 weeks prior to study Day 1 or who has not recovered (i.e., ≤ Grade 1 or at
             baseline) from adverse events due to a previously administered agent.

               -  Note: Subjects with ≤ Grade 2 neuropathy or typical side effects from
                  radiotherapy are an exception to this criterion and may qualify for the study.

               -  Note: If subject received major surgery, they must have recovered adequately from
                  the toxicity and/or complications from the intervention prior to starting
                  therapy.

             Exceptions include basal cell carcinoma of the skin or squamous cell carcinoma of the
             skin that has undergone potentially curative therapy or in situ cervical cancer or any
             tumors that are not likely to influence live expectancy in the subsequent 3 years

             form of systemic treatment.

         10. Has known history of, or any evidence of active, non-infectious pneumonitis.

         11. Has a history or current evidence of any condition, therapy, or laboratory abnormality
             that might confound the results of the trial, interfere with the subject's
             participation for the full duration of the trial, or is not in the best interest of
             the subject to participate, in the opinion of the treating investigator.

         12. Has known psychiatric or substance abuse disorders that would interfere with
             cooperation with the requirements of the trial.

         13. Is pregnant or breastfeeding, or expecting to conceive or father children within the
             projected duration of the trial, starting with the pre-screening or screening visit
             through 120 days after the last dose of trial treatment.

         14. Has received prior therapy with an anti-PD-1, anti-PD-L1, or anti-PD-L2 agent.

         15. Has a known history of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) (HIV 1/2 antibodies).

         16. Has known active Hepatitis B (e.g., HBsAg reactive) or Hepatitis C (e.g., HCV RNA
             [qualitative] is detected).

         17. Has received a live vaccine within 30 days of planned start of study therapy. Note:
             Seasonal influenza vaccines for injection are generally inactivated flu vaccines and
             are allowed; however intranasal influenza vaccines (e.g., Flu-Mist®) are live
             attenuated vaccines, and are not allowed within 30 days prior to initiation of
