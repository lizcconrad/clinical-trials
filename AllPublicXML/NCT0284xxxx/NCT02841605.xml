    <textblock>
      The close homology between the central and enteric nervous systems suggests that a disease
      process affecting the central nervous system could also involve its enteric counterpart. The
      investigators have recently shown in that the enteric neurons can be readily analyzed using
      routine colonic biopsies. This led us to propose that the enteric nervous system could
      represent a unique window to assess the neuropathology in living patients with a
      neurodegenerative disorder. The investigators have already used this approach to show that
      Parkinson's disease pathology was recapitulated in a single colonic biopsy. By contrast to
      Parkinson's disease, the detection of Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology in the enteric
      neurons has so far failed. This may be due to the low number of human tissue samples in
      addition to the low sensitivity of the immunohistochemical methods that were used. The aim of
      the current research project will be therefore to reevaluate AD pathology in a large number
      of human colonic samples using both a morphological and biochemical approach .

      The enteric nervous system could represent a unique window to assess the neuropathology in
      living patients with AD. This might open the way to the development of novel AD biomarkers
      that will directly assess the neuropathological process.

      Main Aim : To Analyze the presence of beta-amyloid pathology in the enteric nervous system
      (ENS) in AD patients

      Secondary Aim(s):

        1. To analyze and describe the presence of tau in the enteric nervous system (ENS) in AD
           patients

        2. To assess neuronal loss in submucosal tissue in AD patients.

        3. To examine Glia cells in the enteric nervous system in AD patients..
