      The various causes of bleeding Proctological are well known to gastroenterologists in
      clinical practice but their proportions have not, to our knowledge, been dedicated
      epidemiological studies. Investigators wanted to evaluate this data as part of a specialized
      consultation. Investigators have prospectively collected the causes of gastrointestinal
      bleeding down the patients seen two of us in specialized proctology center. A clinical
      examination including an inspection, palpation and feel, and a anoscopy (when possible) were
      made during the consultation. Local levies referred (s) histological and / or infection were
      also carried out if necessary. When she had not been made, a colonic exploration was offered
      to all patients over 45 years and / or when indicated by the pathological context. When there
      were several possible causes, the clinician holding one that seemed to be the main. Patients
      consulting within four months postoperatively a proctology action were not included. The
      study period extended from September 2013 to July 2014 inclusive. The collection of anonymous
      data.
