  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this clinical study is to evaluate the safety and the efficacy of BonoFill-II
      as a bone filler containing the patient's own (autologous) adipose (fat) tissue-derived cells
      in reconstructing bone in two clinical indications:

        1. Bone augmentation (e.g. sinus augmentation)

        2. Bone grafting after removal of cysts from jaws
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Primary endpoint:

      The transplantation of BonoFill-II to the maxillary or mandible defect/void is safe under the
      following conditions: No chronic bone infection (Osteomyelitis); no significant changes in
      complete blood count (CBC) and in general health.

      Secondary endpoint:

      The transplantation of BonoFill-II to the maxillary or mandible void is efficient under the
      following conditions: Following BonoFill-II implantation, the bone regeneration in the
      operated site was significantly accelerated. Also, the bone defects/voids were filled with a
      significant amount of bone tissue.

    <time_frame>6-month clinical Follow Up (FU)</time_frame>
    <description>Subjects will be followed up for chronic bone infection (Osteomyelitis) and significant changes in blood profile by Computerized tomography (CT), X-ray, blood tests and visual examination of the treated site.
The presence of any findings, such as chronic bone infection (Osteomyelitis) and/or significant changes in blood profile will be treated as necessary and documented accordingly.
The results will be aggregated into one single value indicating the number of participants displaying Osteomyelitis and/or significant changes in blood profile.</description>

    <time_frame>6-month clinical FU</time_frame>
    <description>Subjects will be followed up for augmentation of the bone tissue in the bone void. This will be reviewed by X-ray images and measured by CT radio-graphs.
The bone height at the operated site will be measured before the transplantation and after the transplantation, during the follow-up visits. Measurements will be taken and reported in mm.
Outcome measures will be reported by number of participants with augmented bone tissue at the operated site.</description>

    <description>Subjects will be followed up for augmentation of the bone tissue in the bone void in relation to the timeline. This will be reviewed by X-ray images and measured by CT radio-graphs.
The bone height at the operated site will be measured before the transplantation and after the transplantation, during the follow-up visits. Measurements will be taken and reported in mm whereas timeline will be reported in weeks/months as per the visit schedule.
Outcome measures will be reported by time to augmentation (weeks/months)</description>

Single transplantation of Investigational Medicinal Product (IMP) BonoFill-II in maxillofacial deficient bone

    <description>Sinus augmentation - Surgery will be performed by either open or close sinus augmentation as per investigator discretion and as per common medical practice. After the elevation, BonoFill-II will be transplanted on the residual sub-antral bone.
Bone grafting after removal of cysts from jaws - Treatment will be performed according to the size of the cyst: in relatively small cyst total enucleation will be performed. In large cysts, a process of marsupialization will be performed. The entire cyst will be removed, including the epithelium layer, and the BonoFill-II product will be used for filling.</description>
