      This survey took a representative sample from each county and municipality in Taiwan using a
      stratified multi-stage systematic sampling procedure. Within each county/municipality
      (stratum), samples were selected with probability proportional to population size.
      Questionnaire design was based on the needs of the Department of Health and Welfare and the
      public health professionals. Due to different age has different health problems, the
      questionnaires were divided into 3 parts: under 12, 23-64, and 65+ years. The response rate
      was 75% in 2013.
