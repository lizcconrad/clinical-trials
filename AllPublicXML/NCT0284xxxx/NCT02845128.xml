      Multicentric cohort study recruiting patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) with
      acute respiratory failure (ARF) and receiving treatment with high-flow nasal cannula (HFNC).

      This is a second part of the initial study PF(AG)101/2011 where the investigators created the
      ROX index to predict the need of failure with HFNC treatment in patients with ARF secondary
      to pneumonia, and the investigators want to validate ROX index with this second prospective
      cohort results.

      This is a second part of the initial study PF(AG)101/2011 where the investigators created the
      ROX index to predict the need of failure with HFNC treatment in patients with ARF secondary
      to pneumonia, and the investigators want to validate ROX index with this second prospective
      cohort results.

      The recruitment period is over. One hundred ninety one patients treated with HFNC in the
      valitaditon cohort were included. ROX index &gt; or equal to 4.88 measured at 2, 6 or 12 hours
      afther HFNC initiation was consistently associated with a lower risk of MV. CART analysis
      provided a simple algorithm to discriminate high-intermediate-low risk groups.

      ROX index has, therefore, been validated to classify risk patients with ARF secondary to
      pneumonia treated with HFNC according to their risk for intubationl.
