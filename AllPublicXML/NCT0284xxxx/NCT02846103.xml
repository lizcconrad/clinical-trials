      Increasing evidence suggests that immune responses might be a determining factor in lung
      cancer tumor progression.

      The impressive clinical responses obtained with immune checkpoint inhibitors
      (anti-PD-1/PDL-1, anti-CTLA-4) indicate that the presence of preexisting antitumor immune
      response is required for their efficacy and highlight the critical role of antitumor T cell
      immunity. Recent progress on the fields of tumor immunology underlines the critical role of
      CD4 helper 1 T lymphocyte (TH1) in the control of innate and adaptive anticancer immunity.
      Therefore, monitoring tumor specific TH1 response could be relevant in cancer patients.

      In order to monitor tumor-specific CD4 Th1 responses in most cancer patients, the
      investigators group have previously described novel promiscuous peptides (referred as
      UCP:Universal Cancer Peptides) derived from human telomerase (TERT), a prototype of shared
      tumor antigen.

      By using UCP-based immuno-assay, pre-existing UCP-specific Th1 responses have been detected
      in the blood of lung cancer patients (Telocap01). The frequency and magnitude of this
      response were inversely correlate to the disease stage. Furthermore, UCP-specific responses
      were significantly found in patients with low PD1+ and TIM3+ T cells.

      Then in TeloCap02 study, UCP specific Th1 immune responses will be evaluated in lung cancer
      before and after treatment (chemotherapy, immunotherapy).
