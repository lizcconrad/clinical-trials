  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will seek to determine if the downstream effects of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2)
      inhibition suggested by preclinical systems occur in human prostate cancer. To answer this
      question, men who have chosen prostatectomy will be randomly assigned to preoperative
      treatment with celecoxib or placebo for four weeks. Carefully collected tumor, premalignant,
      and benign prostate tissue will then be examined for apoptosis, androgen receptor and
      prostaglandin E2 levels. Tumor COX-2 expression will be correlated with observed treatment
      effects. The data generated by this study will serve as a foundation for the development of
      COX-2 targeted therapies for prostate cancer, will provide preliminary evidence for larger
      scale clinical trials aimed at treatment and prevention of prostate cancer, and will validate
      current preclinical models used to study COX-2 in prostate cancer.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE

      I. To determine if COX-2 inhibition with celecoxib significantly increases apoptosis in human
      adenocarcinoma of the prostate.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES

      I. To determine if COX-2 inhibition with celecoxib reduces levels of Prostaglandin E2 and
      androgen receptor in fresh tumor tissue collected at prostatectomy

      II. To collect pre- and postoperative serum Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA) for exploratory
      analyses

      III. To determine the effect of celecoxib on adverse effects, perioperative surgical
      complications and post surgery analgesic use
