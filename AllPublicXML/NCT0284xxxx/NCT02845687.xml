    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to conduct an observational assessment of natural outcomes
      within the Duke Smoking Cessation Program (DSCP), &quot;Quit at Duke.&quot; This assessment will
      include information regarding abstinence rates, changes in patient emotional state following
      treatment, and costs of operations. Primarily, this study will assess the financial
      sustainability and the cost-effectiveness of the program.

      The purpose of this study is to conduct an observational assessment of natural outcomes
      within the DSCP, &quot;Quit at Duke.&quot; This is an observational study (n=3000) on patients being
      treated at the DSCP. No interventions are conducted, and data analyzed is collected in the
      course of clinical care at clinic visits to the Duke Smoking Cessation Program (DSCP). Phone
      calls are also conducted to determine response to medications and abstinence status up to 12
      months following a quit attempt. Outcomes of variables including: demographic variables,
      evaluation responses, feasibility data, and abstinence rates will be analyzed using general
      regression models using an ANOVA-based design. Because no intervention is being conducted,
      there are no safety concerns related to the study.

        This study will recruit participants through Quit at Duke, also called the Duke Smoking
        Cessation Program (DSCP). The DSCP is a growing multi-clinic tobacco use treatment program.
        The initial clinic site is at Duke Cancer Center, but it is positioned to expand over the
        next several years to include several other clinic sites within the Duke University Health
        System (DUHS). There are no exclusion criteria for this study.
