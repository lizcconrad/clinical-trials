      The objective of this study is to assess the reduction in insulin dose from baseline at Week
      24 while keeping the blood glucose levels controlled (maintaining HbA1c values) when
      ipragliflozin is administered once daily for 24 weeks in patients with type 2 diabetes
      mellitus receiving insulin therapy.
