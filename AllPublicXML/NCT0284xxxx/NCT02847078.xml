      The purpose of the study is to investigate the effects of smart phone app on the secondary
      prevention for patients with coronary heart disease post percutaneous coronary intervention.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The secondary prevention for patients with coronary heart disease post percutaneous coronary
      intervention (PCI) proved associated with a significant reduction in mortality rates and
      improvement in quality of life. For the limitation of socio-economic conditions, not all
      patients post PCI are in a position to receive continuous standardized secondary prevention
      management. Therefore a smart phone app for secondary prevention management post PCI will be
      installed on patients' smart phones in order to investigate its effects on risk factors
      control, medication compliance, as well as quality of life and adverse cardiac events in the
      next six months post discharge. Participants allocated to the control group will receive a
      booklet with general advice on secondary prevention of coronary heart disease. Patients in
      app group and control group will be interviewed by telephone at the 2nd week and the 3rd
      month, and at the 1st month and 6th month they will return our hospital for face to face
      follow-up and to compliance and medication adjustment, assessment of life quality, risk
      factors control and medication adherence.

    <description>The app contains education materials for secondary prevention of coronary artery disease. So patients can access them very easily. The app pushes heath management recommendation information on the timeline after percutaneous coronary intervention, and also provides health care lecture to help patients to improve their secondary prevention. And online or telephone consultation ways are integrated into the App to provide convenience for patients to communicate with health care professionals.</description>
