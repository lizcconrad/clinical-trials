  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Dipeptidyl-peptidase-4 (DPP4) is an important regulator of incretins and inflammation, and
      participates in the pathophysiological process of acute myocardial infarction (AMI). However
      clinical data of DPP4a in AMI patients is sparse. This study was to investigate the role of
      plasma DPP4 activity (DPP4a) in patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction
      (STEMI) treated with percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). This was a analysis of
      consecutive patients conducted at a tertiary referral center from January 2014 to October
      2015. The investigators included 747 STEMI-patients, treated with PCI from January 2013 to
      October 2015. Blood samples were collected immediately at admission. The patients were
      divided into four groups according to DPP4a quartile.

      ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) is an acute manifestation of coronary
      heart disease, remaining a frequent cause of death.A better understanding of risk factors and
      pathogenic mechanisms underlying STEMI may help improve the prognosis and life quality of
      these patients.Dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) is an exopeptidase expressed on the surface of
      diverse cells, cleaving off amino-terminal dipeptides with either L-proline, L-alanine or
      serine at the penultimate position. As a cell surface protein, it participates in immune
      regulation, signal transduction and apoptosis. DPP4 also circulates as a soluble form in the
      plasma. Soluble DPP4 came from either membrane type clearance or secreted by cells like
      endothelial cells, with enzymatic activity. Plasma DPP4 activity (DPP4a) are elevated in
      several diseases, including type 2 diabetes, obesity, atherosclerosis and osteoporosis. Basic
      studies have showed that DPP4 inhibition leads improved survival and heart function after
      cardiac ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) injury, and this is partly due to activation of AKT
      (pAKT), pGSK3 and ANP pathways. Also inhibition of DPP4 can alleviate atherosclerosis and
      heart failure. Accordingly, one could hypothesize that high DPP4a may worsen myocardial I/R
      injury, causing poorer cardiovascular outcomes. However, no study has evaluated whether DPP4a
      is associated with adverse clinical outcomes in STEMI patients.
