  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This Phase 2 clinical trial is a multi-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled,
      multiple-dose, parallel-cohort study to assess the efficacy, safety and tolerability of
      VDA-1102 in the treatment of actinic keratosis (AK) on the head of male and female adult
      subjects.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Approximately 84 subjects who meet the study's enrollment criteria at the completion of the
      Screening Period will be randomized to receive 5% or 10% VDA-1102, or matched-placebo. During
      the Treatment Period, study drug will be applied once-daily for 28 days to a 25 square
      centimeter area of skin containing 4-8 actinic keratosis lesions on the face or scalp.
      Subjects will be followed for an additional 28 days (Observation Period) wherein no study
      drug will be applied.

      The purpose of the study is to determine whether once-daily application of VDA-1102 ointment
      for 28 days is effective and well-tolerated in the treatment of actinic keratosis of the face
      and scalp.
