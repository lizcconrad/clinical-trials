    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the usefulness of 3D echocardiography to guide pacemaker therapy in the
      operating room in cardiac surgical patients. Each patient will serve as his own control,
      following a paired design.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cardiac surgical patients sometimes require temporary pacing wires to optimize cardiac
      function during weaning from cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB), and/or to treat hemodynamically
      significant brady-arrhythmias. The available patient series report that 8.6% to 23.9% of
      patient undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) or valve surgery require temporary
      pacing at some time after CPB. The site of pacemaker wire placement seems to be a crucial
      determinant of cardiac output. In non-surgical patients isolated right ventricular (RV)
      pacing seems to induce electromechanical dyssynchrony of the RV and the left ventricle (LV).
      A normal ventricle in sinus rhythm displays a simultaneous contraction of all segments of the
      heart, so that regional minimal volume (i.e. maximal contraction) will occur at the same
      time. Isolated RV pacing seems to result in a left bundle branch type electrical activation
      sequence, with delayed contraction of some of the segments. The LV, but not the RV, seems to
      negatively affected by this state of dyssynchrony, resulting in decreased cardiac output. In
      surgical patients however, there is not such data available yet. Since isolated RV epicardial
      wire placement is still widely practiced in cardiac surgery, and in our own institution, we
      would like to study the effect of RV pacing on LV synchrony and LV output.

      Again from studies in non-surgical patients receiving resynchronization therapy, we know that
      real-time three-dimensional (3D) echocardiography is very useful to pick up subtle changes in
      LV synchrony and thereby guide synchronization of ventricular contraction. However, to date
      the usefulness of real-time 3D echocardiography to guide pacemaker therapy in cardiac surgery
      is unknown. In the present feasibility study in cardiac surgical patients, we want to
      investigate the acute effects of isolated RV pacing on LV synchrony, and LV output.

    <description>For each segment of 16 segments excluding the apical cap in a standard 17-segment model, the time to reach regional minimal volume is calculated as a fraction of the total cardiac cycle (RR interval) and expressed as a percentage.10 The standard deviation of these measurements is defined as the SDI. Three-dimensional SDI is therefore the dispersion time to reach the minimum systolic volume (as recommended).</description>

    <description>The patient's own heart rate at that moment will be the starting point for the study. Right ventricle pacing will be instituted by selecting a rate that is 5 beats above the patient's own heart rate. We will use a stepwise approach where we increase the pacermaker's rate with steps of 5 beats until we have 100% capture of the pacemaker beats. After waiting for at least one minute of pacing we will obtain a set of measurements.</description>
