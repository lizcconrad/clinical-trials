  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Symptoms related to the disease and/or treatment are common in cancer patients and can affect
      patient health-related quality of life (HRQol). Unfortunately these symptoms can be
      underestimated and underreported by the physician. Measure of the HRQoL has been
      significantly developed in clinical trials and has become a key endpoint to assess clinical
      benefit of new therapeutic strategies and as prognostic factor of overall survival for
      several cancer as in women breast cancer, glioblastomas, metastatic colorectal cancer,
      prostate cancer and hepatocellular carcinoma.

      Moreover, a recent study conducted in patients receiving routine outpatient chemotherapy for
      advanced solid tumors showed that clinical benefits were associated with symptom
      self-reporting during cancer care, including the improvement of the overall survival.

      The aim of the QOLIBRY project is to introduce the collection of HRQoL of cancer patients in
      daily clinical practice in the University Hospital of Besançon. Indeed, the goal is to make
      the HRQoL data accessible and exploitable in real time to physician, to help medical
      professionals to optimize their practices by adopting a holistic and personalized approach
      based on the perception of the patients of their HRQoL and symptoms.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the feasibility of using in routinely clinical
      practice a systematic assessment of HRQoL in patients treated for a newly diagnosis cancer at
      the University Hospital of Besançon. It aims to define the logistic resources needed to
      implement this data collection and to assess its acceptability by clinicians, healthcare team
      and patients. This involves asking patients to complete HRQoL questionnaires at the time of
      an outpatient visit and generating a summary of the results made available to the healthcare
      provider immediately before the consultation.

      In this pilot study, three cancer sites were selected: breast cancer in women, colorectal
      cancer and lung cancer. Patients included will be invited to complete the European
      Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) QLQ-C30 cancer specific
      questionnaire and the specific module of their cancer site (QLQ-BR23, QLQ-CR29, QLQ-LC13)
      before each visit with their physician. Results from HRQoL questionnaires will be immediately
      available to physician through a web-based portal during the visit. As part of the pilot
      phase, patients will be followed during four months while HRQoL will be pursued.

      Questionnaires completion will be administrated by digital tablets and/or computer terminals
      via the CHES software (Computer-based Health Evaluation System; http:// www.ches.pro/) at the
      University Hospital of Besançon just before the visit with physician or at home via secured
      web-portal. This tool provides a didactic and attractive presentation of the HRQOL evaluation
      allowing physician a better understanding and consideration of HRQoL results. Indeed, results
      of a routinely assessment of HRQoL will be incorporated into the patient's electronic medical
      record. Physicians will be alerted if a clinically significant deterioration of at least one
      HRQoL dimension is observed over time and/or if the HRQoL level is significantly lower than
      reference/ normative data. In case of deterioration of HRQoL, physician may adapted the
      treatment or prescribed adapted supportive cares.

      This feasibility study aims to assess the acceptability of the HRQoL assessment in routinely
      practice: to quantify the attrition, to observe the exhaustiveness of the measure, the
      compliance and the ability of the patient to complete HRQoL questionnaires and finally to
      evaluate both patient and clinician's satisfaction. The difficulties eventually encountered
      by the clinical research associate and by physicians will be also collected.
