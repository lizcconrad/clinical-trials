  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1 open label study of the dose and duration of an orally administered LSD1
      inhibitor, IMG-7289, in patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and myelodysplastic
      syndrome (MDS). Some participants may also receive all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA; also known
      as tretinoin and Vesanoid®) in combination with IMG-7289. This study investigates the
      following:

        -  The safety and tolerability of IMG-7289, with and without ATRA

        -  The pharmacodynamic effect of different IMG-7289 doses and treatment durations, as well
           as IMG-7289 administered in combination with ATRA

        -  The pharmacokinetics of IMG-2789, with and without ATRA
