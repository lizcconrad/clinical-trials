      Primary objective of this study is to compare diabetes-related healthcare utilization and
      costs in patients initiating exenatide once weekly vs insulin glargine.

    <textblock>
      This retrospective, observational cohort analysis will assess medical and pharmacy claims for
      adult patients with type 2 diabetes from the Truven Health MarketScanÂ® Commercial and
      Medicare Supplemental claims databases between 2011 and 2015. Diabetes-related healthcare
      utilization and costs will be measured as a primary outcome. Secondary outcomes include
      all-cause healthcare utilization and costs, major adverse cardiovascular event (MACE)-related
      utilization and costs, and medically attended hypoglycemia events.

This will be conducted among a subset of patients with available laboratory data.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. One or more outpatient prescription claim for EQW (Exenatide Once Weekly) vs. IG
             (Insulin Glargine) between February 1, 2012, and June 30, 2014 (date of first claim =
             index date; medication to which first claim corresponds = index therapy).

          2. Aged 18 or older as of the index date.

          3. Continuous enrollment in medical and pharmacy benefits for 12 months before (baseline
             period) and 12 months after (follow-up period) the index date. (6 months follow-up
             will be provided to determine the effect on sample size.)

          4. One or more medical claims with a diagnosis code for T2DM (ICD-9-CM 250.x0 or 250.x2)
             in the baseline period or on the index date.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. No outpatient prescription claims for any injectable glucose-lowering medication
             during the baseline period (GLP-1RA or insulins).

          2. No medical claims with a diagnosis (or procedure, where appropriate) code indicative
             for type 1 diabetes mellitus (ICD-9-CM 250.x1 or 250.x3), gestational diabetes
             (ICD-9-CM 648.8x), or pregnancy or childbirth in the baseline or follow-up periods.
