      The Irish Omega-3 study is a clinical trial designed to investigate the potential of Omega-3
      fatty acids in the reduction of risk of psychosis.

      The study is being coordinated by the HRB Clinical Research Facility at University College
      Cork. The Principal Investigator is Dr Maeve Rooney, Consultant Psychiatrist in the Mercy
      University Hospital, Cork. The study will be carried out in collaboration with the HRB
      Clinical Research Facility in Dublin in prior to rolling out to other centres around Ireland.

      The Study is funded by Stanley Medical Research Institute, a non-profit organization
      supporting research on the causes of, and treatments for, schizophrenia and bipolar disorder.
      It is the largest provider of funding for research in serious mental illness outside of the
      U.S. government.

    <description>Subjects will receive food supplements in the form of 200ml juice drinks, containing either the active component, 1000mg of eicosapentaenoic acid and 1000mg docosahexaenoic acid, or matching placebo for a duration of six months. Neither the active nor the placebo food supplements taste of fish, so the subject will be blind to whether he/she is receiving the active intervention or placebo.</description>
