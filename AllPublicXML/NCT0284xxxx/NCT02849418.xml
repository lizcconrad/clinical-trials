    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the efficacy and safety of GSK1358820 in Japanese patients with
      neurogenic detrusor overactivity (NDO) with urinary incontinence, whose symptoms have not
      been adequately managed with medications for urinary incontinence due to NDO.

      This study consists of a screening phase up to 28 days followed by a double-blind Treatment
      phase 1 of 12 to 48 weeks wherein subjects will receive a single treatment of either
      GSK1358820 200 Units (U) injection or placebo injection. After the first treatment, subjects
      who meet the re-treatment criteria between 12 to 36 weeks can enter an open-label Treatment
      phase 2 to receive a second treatment with GSK1358820 200 U. Subjects will be permitted to
      receive re-treatment up to 2 times, and there should be a gap of minimum of 12 weeks since
      the previous treatment. The duration of overall treatment phases is 48 weeks. The total
      duration of participation for any subject will not exceed 52 weeks, including screening.

                  study, and this male is the sole partner for that subject.

                  These allowed methods of contraception are only effective when used consistently,
                  correctly and in accordance with the product label. The investigator is
                  responsible for ensuring that subjects understand how to properly use these
                  methods of contraception.

          -  Subject has given signed informed consent, including compliance with the requirements
             and restrictions listed in the consent form and in this protocol (e.g., complete
             bladder diaries and questionnaires, is able to collect volume voided per micturition
             measurements over a 24-hour period, and attend all study visits in the opinion of the
             investigator(or subinvestigator).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject has a history or evidence of any diseases, functional abnormalities or bladder

             screening

          -  Subject has current active liver or biliary disease (with the exception of Gilbert's
             syndrome or asymptomatic gallstones or otherwise stable chronic liver disease per
             investigator assessment). Notes:

               1. Stable chronic liver disease should generally be defined by the absence of
                  ascites, encephalopathy, coagulopathy, hypoalbuminaemia, oesophageal or gastric
                  varices, or persistent jaundice, or cirrhosis

               2. Chronic stable hepatitis B and C (example, presence of hepatitis B surface
                  antigen [HBsAg] or positive hepatitis C antibody [HCVAb] test result within 3
                  months prior to first dose of study treatment) are acceptable if subject
                  otherwise meets entry criteria

          -  QTc &gt;450 milliseconds (msec) or QTc &gt;480 msec in subjects with Bundle Branch Block
             from the result of ECG at screening. Notes:

               1. The QTc is the QT interval corrected for heart rate according to Bazett's formula
                  (QTcB), Fridericia's formula (QTcF), and/or another method, machine-read or
                  manually over-read

               2. The specific formula that will be used to determine eligibility and
                  discontinuation for an individual subject should be determined prior to
                  initiation of the study. In other words, several different formulae cannot be
                  used to calculate the QTc for an individual subject and then the lowest QTc value
                  used to include or discontinue the subject from the trial

             urine culture and/or investigator opinion, has not initiated prophylactic antibiotic
             medication 1 to 3 days prior to the initiation of Treatment phase 1 (Week 0). Subject
             with a UTI as determined from the urinalysis or urine culture and/or investigator
             opinion, has not initiated antibiotic medication at least 5 days prior to the
             initiation of Treatment phase 1 (Week 0)

          -  Subject is symptomatic for UTI on day of treatment

          -  Subject has a history of sensitivity to any of the study medications, medications used
             in the study (including anesthesia), or their components or a history of drug or other
             allergy that, in the opinion of the investigator or Medical Monitor, contraindicates
             their participation

          -  Subject has any medical condition that may put them at increased risk with exposure to
             GSK1358820 including diagnosed myasthenia gravis, Eaton-Lambert syndrome, or

          -  Females who are pregnant, nursing or planning a pregnancy during the study

          -  Subject has a post void residual urine volume above 200 mL for subjects who micturate
             or have a mixed catheterization/spontaneous micturition pattern. The post void
             residual measurement can be repeated once; the subject is to be excluded if the
             repeated measure is above 200 mL.

          -  Subject has a 24-hour total volume of urine voided &gt;3000 mL of urine collected over 24
             consecutive hours during the 3-day bladder diary collection period in the Screening
             phase

          -  Subject is currently participating in or has previously participated in another
             therapeutic study within 30 days prior to the start of the Screening phase
