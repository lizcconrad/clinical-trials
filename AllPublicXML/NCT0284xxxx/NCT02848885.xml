  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a novel study that seeks to explore the clinical and functional imaging effects of
      transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) on illness awareness or anosognosia in
      schizophrenia, arguably the most treatment-resistant manifestation of the disorder.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Transcranial DCS is a novel, non-invasive and non-convulsive technique for altering brain
      function. To our knowledge, no research has investigated the functional and behavioural
      effects of tDCS on anosognosia in schizophrenia. As such, we aim to improve impaired illness
      awareness in schizophrenia with tDCS by inhibiting left hemisphere regions (i.e.
      temporoparietooccipital cortex) shown by our group to be activated during illness denial.

      Positive results will demonstrate that impaired illness awareness in schizophrenia involves a
      similar brain network to impaired illness awareness in patients with brain lesions and can be
      similarly modulated with non-invasive techniques, such as tDCS. If proven effective, this
      easy to administer, safe, non-invasive intervention would have the potential to alter
      individuals' attitude towards their illness and medication, leading ultimately to an
      improvement in individuals' capacity for illness recognition and treatment engagement, which
      would undoubtedly have a significant impact on the management of this devastating mental
      disorder.

    <description>The primary aim of this study is to determine if dual hemisphere tDCS daily for 10 days will lead to an improvement in illness awareness versus a control condition (sham tDCS), as measured by changes in illness awareness scores post intervention (10 days post tDCS and weekly x 4 weeks post tDCS) in participants with schizophrenia.</description>
