    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the nutritional supplement arginine as supportive measure for patients
      with unresectable metastatic brain tumors that receive radiation therapy with palliative
      intent

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Brain metastasis, the most common intracranial tumor, is associated with neurological
      disability and short survival time. For selected patients this outcome can be improved by
      achieving greater local control. Virtually all cancer patients with brain metastases receive
      radiotherapy; a majority as part of their primary treatment while others in connection with
      surgery or palliation. Agents that increase the sensitivity of cancer cells to radiation may
      improve the control of the disease. Previous data indicates that arginine supplementation can
      modify the metabolism of cancer and immune cells making tumors more susceptible to standard
      treatments liked radiation. In this phase 1/2 comparative study the investigators will
      investigate whether 10 mg of arginine oral supplementation (compared to placebo
      administration) administered twice a day prior to the radiation therapy can modify tumor
      metabolism, immune response and effect of radiation. The primary end-points are safety and
      toxicity of arginine, quality-of-life and clinical response. The secondary end-points are
      imaging response and neurological progression-free survival. Additional exploratory
      end-points include intensity of radiation administered, effects on tumor metabolism by
      magnetic resonance spectroscopy, immune response by cytokine pattern in serum, body
      composition and nutritional parameters , overall survival and progression free survival
