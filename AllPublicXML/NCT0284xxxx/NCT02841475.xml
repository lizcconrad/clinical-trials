    <textblock>
      Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a common condition whose prevalence increases with advancing age
      . One of the main complications of this arrhythmia is the occurrence of systemic
      thromboembolism, the first of which the occurrence of cerebrovascular accident (CVA) . The
      advanced age itself is an independent risk factor for occurrence of stroke in the context of
      AF , evidenced by the score awarded to the age over 75 years in the risk estimate
      thromboembolism in the score CHA2DS2-Vasc . Making the elderly a priority target for the
      prevention of thromboembolism, both because of the increased thromboembolic risk and
      prevalence of AF in this population. For many years, vitamin K antagonists (VKA) have proven
      their effectiveness in this context . But the effectiveness and safety of thromboembolism
      prevention by anti-vitamin K treatment involves maintaining the INR (International Normalized
      Ratio) in the therapeutic range. Indeed occurred of a thromboembolic or haemorrhagic adverse
      event directly correlates to having an INR outside the therapeutic range and maintaining the
      INR in the therapeutic range is subject to many variations inter- and intra-individual. They
      include, genetic factors , food , drug interactions , as well as disease processes . Or one
      of the elderly characteristics is the coexistence of multiple pathological processes or
      comorbidities . The supposed interaction between comorbidities and variability of INR has
      been little studied: Only a few studies have examined the factors associated with the
      stability of the INR and unstable . The identification of patients at risk of instability INR
      yet allow clinicians greater vigilance and better identification of patients for whom the
      initiation of treatment with vitamin K does not appear the best therapeutic strategy.

      Our study seeks to determine whether comorbidity, assessed by the Charlson comorbidity index,
      are associated with instability of the INR, among more than 80 years for patients treated
      with AVK atrial fibrillation.
