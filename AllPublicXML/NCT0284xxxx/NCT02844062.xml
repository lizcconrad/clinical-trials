  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-modified T cells can mediate long-term durable remissions in
      recurrent or refractory CD19+ B cell malignancies, and are a promising therapy to treat
      glioblastoma, which is the most dangerous and aggressive form of brain cancer. EGFRvIII
      mutation (epidermal growth factor receptor variant III, EGFRvIII) is the results of tumor
      specific gene rearrangement naturally happened in about 30% of glioblastoma patients and
      produces a mutated protein with neo-antigen that is tumor specific and is not expressed in
      normal human tissues. Therefore, EGFRvIII is an attractive target for CAR T cell therapy. We
      have constructed a lentiviral vector that contains a chimeric antigen receptor that
      recognizes the EGFRvIII tumor antigen. A truncated EGFR (tEGFR) which lacks of the ligand
      binding domain and cytoplasmic kinase domain of wildtype EGFR is incorporated into the CAR
      vector and is used for in vivo tracking and ablation of CAR T cells in necessary. This pilot
      study is to determine the safety and efficacy of autologous anti-EGFRvIII CAR T cells in
      patients with recurrent glioblastoma.
