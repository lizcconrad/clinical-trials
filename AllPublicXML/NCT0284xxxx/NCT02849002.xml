    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to collect un-blinded BrainPulse recordings from youth
      and adults that have a confirmed diagnosis of concussion per protocol guidelines in order to
      improve a concussion detection algorithm previously developed by Jan Medical, Inc. Subjects
      will be followed for 21 days after the initial injury with BrainPulse recordings to study the
      subject's recovery process. The symptomatic evaluation, physical examination, and BrainPulse
      recordings will be entered in a database to assess clinical outcome and device
      utilization.BrainPulse(TM)

    <textblock>
      Jan Medical is conducting a data collection study with the goal of developing further insight
      into understanding the signal features within a BrainPulse recording that are only present
      when the subject has a confirmed concussion. The initial pilot blinded study with Stanford
      University showed that there is increased energy in the 8-15 Hz range for BrainPulse
      recordings from adolescent male football players with a confirmed concussion. The current
      un-blinded study is designed to record the BrainPulse signal from a more diverse subject
      population to represent patients who have been diagnosed with a concussion in clinic setting.
      Subjects will include males and females ages 13 and older.

    <description>collect un-blinded BrainPulse recordings from youth and adults that have a confirmed diagnosis of concussion per protocol guidelines in order to improve a concussion detection algorithm previously developed by Jan Medical, Inc.The primary endpoint is to enroll and record BrainPulse signals from 500 subjects with a suspected concussion. To gather sufficiently diverse data, at least 300 participants will have had a confirmed diagnosis of concussion. The data will be used to improve the algorithm for aiding in the diagnosis of concussion.</description>

    <description>The BrainPulse is used on a patient's head to non-invasively detect, amplify and capture the brain motion caused by pulsatile blood flow from the cardiac cycle.
The BrainPulse consists of a reusable headset that contains the accelerometers used to measure motion caused by pulsatile blood flow. The system is powered by rechargeable battery pack. The headset is placed on the subject's head and outputs data to a data collector that forwards the data to the computer. Each accelerometer has an attached tip that makes contact with the subject's head through hair. The headset also includes a photoplethysmograph (PPG) that simultaneously captures the subject's heart-rate information. There is no energy delivered to the brain or subject by these highly sensitive sensors.</description>
