    <description>To prospectively determine the effect of a customized preoperative inspiratory muscle training (IMT) and brief pulmonary rehabilitation program on the incidence of postoperative pneumonia in patients that undergo an esophageal surgical resection. The investigators will consider the following as pneumonia: new infiltrate + either fever (&gt;38.5 C) and white cell count &gt;11,000 or fever and purulent secretions.</description>

    <description>To prospectively determine the effect of a customized preoperative inspiratory muscle training (IMT) and brief pulmonary rehabilitation program on the incidence of postoperative pulmonary complications in patients that undergo an esophageal surgical resection.The investigators will consider the following events as post-operative pulmonary complications: severe atelectasis (requiring bronchoscopy) and respiratory failure (intubation or prolonged mechanical ventilation (&gt;24hours).</description>

    <description>Patients will start the IMT-R, following their consent and within 2 weeks of their scheduled surgery: 10 sessions lasting about 90 minutes. Participants who completed their initial IMT greater than 2 weeks prior to surgery will have an additional visit prior to surgery. Participants will receive a Participant Manual demonstrating and explaining the rehabilitation process. Participants will also receive a log for recording their efforts and notes. A DVD of the rehabilitation is available to the participant. Participants will complete questionnaires at baseline and 3 months.</description>
