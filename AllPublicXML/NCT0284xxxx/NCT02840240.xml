  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Opioids are effective analgesics, but cause side effects including sedation, respiratory
      depression, low blood pressure, nausea, and constipation. Gabapentin enacarbil, which is a
      FDA approved drug for post herpetic neuralgia (nerve pain related to shingles) and restless
      leg syndrome, may decrease your need for narcotics and thus decrease the risk of side
      effects. The investigator hopes this study will determine if gabapentin enacarbil decreases
      opioid consumption and pain after surgery.

      Patients having elective hip and knee surgery will be asked to participate in the study.
      Patients will be randomized to Gabapentin enacarbil 600mg twice per day for 5 days or Placebo
      twice per day for 5 days.

      One day prior to surgery the patient will take Gabapentin enacarbil 600mg or placebo 600mg
      twice a day with meals. On the day of surgery, the patient will take Gabapentin enacarbil
      600mg or placebo 600mg two hours before the surgical procedure. Six hours after the
      completion of surgery, the patient will receive Gabapentin enacarbil 600mg or placebo 600mg.
      If the patient is sent home, the patient will be given 6 Gabapentin enacarbil 600mg or
      placebo 600mg pills to take home along with instructions. However, if the patient remains
      hospitalized, on the first day after the surgery, the patient will have pain assessed in the
      morning using a numerical rating score. The patient's quality of recovery will be evaluated
      using a questionnaire and the patient will receive Gabapentin enacarbil 600mg or placebo
      600mg twice a day with meals. The second and third day the patient is in the hospital, the
      patient will have pain assessed in the morning using a numerical rating score and the patient
      will receive Gabapentin enacarbil 600mg or placebo 600mg twice a day with meals. Then, three
      months after surgery, the patient will receive a phone call to follow-up with possible pain
      or discomfort the patient may be feeling.
