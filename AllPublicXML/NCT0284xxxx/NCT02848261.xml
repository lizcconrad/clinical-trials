      <textblock>
        To be eligible for the study, a child must meet the following criteria:

          1. Diagnosis of type 1 diabetes according to American Diabetes Association diagnostic
             criteria

          5. No severe medical conditions, which in the opinion of the investigators are likely to
             hinder participation in this clinical trial.

          6. If current use of CGM, A1c has to be above 7.5%; value obtained within 3 months of
             enrollment

          7. Own and use an iPhone, or be willing/able to carry a study-supplied wi-fi enabled iPod

        To be eligible for the study, a parent must meet the following criteria:

          1. Parent or legal guardian of a child with type 1 diabetes meeting the &quot;child&quot; criteria
             outlined above

          2. Age of 18.0 years or older

          3. Parent comprehends written English

          5. Parent has access to a personal computer to upload diabetes devices and send to
             research team

        The presence of any of the following is an exclusion for the study:

          1. Child has a medical disorder that in the judgment of the investigator will interfere
             with completion of any aspect of the protocol (e.g., pregnancy, kidney disease,
             adrenal insufficiency, skin condition that may hinder sensor application).

          2. Child has a neurologic disorder that in the judgment of the investigator will affect
             completion of the protocol

          3. Current use of oral glucocorticoids or other medications, which in the judgment of the
             investigator would be a contraindication to participation in the study
