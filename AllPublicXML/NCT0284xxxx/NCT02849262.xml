    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Healthy male and female subjects â‰¥ 18 years of age, with external genital warts. The
             health status is verified by absence of evidence of any clinical significant active or
             uncontrolled chronic disease other than genital warts following a detailed medical
             history and a complete physical examination including vital signs and 12-lead ECG. In
             the case of uncertain or questionable results, tests performed during screening may be
             repeated before randomization to confirm eligibility or judged to be clinically
             irrelevant for healthy subjects.

          2. Clinically diagnosed and biopsy confirmed external genital warts. Subject has at least
             3 external genital warts.

          3. Willing to give written informed consent and willing and able to comply with the study
             protocol.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Eligible subjects must meet none of the following exclusion criteria at screening:

          1. Clinically significant abnormalities, as judged by the Investigator, in laboratory
             test results including haematology, blood chemistry panel, virology or urinalysis. In
             the case of uncertain or questionable results, tests performed during screening may be
             repeated before randomization to confirm eligibility or judged to be clinically
             irrelevant for healthy subjects.

          2. Current clinically significant skin conditions in the anogenital area (e.g. atopic
             dermatitis, lichen sclerosus, lichen planus or psoriasis).

          3. Pregnant, breast feeding or trying to conceive.

          4. Participation in an investigational drug or device study within 3 months prior to
             screening or more than 4 times a year.

          5. Loss or donation of blood over 500 mL within three months (males) or four months
             (females) prior to screening.

          6. Use of active treatment (i.e. cryotherapy, laser therapy, topical medication and/or
             surgical treatments) for genital warts within 28 days prior to first study drug
             administration.

          7. Immunosuppressed patients, having an immunodeficiency (primary or secondary, like HIV)
             or receiving immunosuppressive therapy (i.e. Transplant patients).

          8. Males or Females who received a vaccination with Gardasil or Cervarix.

          9. Any (medical) condition that would, in the opinion of the Investigator, potentially
             compromise the safety or compliance of the patient or may preclude the patient's
             successful completion of the clinical trial.
