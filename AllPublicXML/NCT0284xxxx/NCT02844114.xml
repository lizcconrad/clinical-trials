      This study evaluates the effect of the serum level of Superoxide Dismutase (SOD),
      Malondialdehyde (MDA), pro-inflammatory factors, stress hormones and Glutathione peroxidase
      (GSH-PX)in tumor patients with the treatment of Ganoderma lucidum spore based combination
      chemotherapy. Half of participants will receive Ganoderma lucidum spore and chemotherapy in
      combination, and the other half will receive a placebo and chemotherapy.

      Study design: Phase 2. Experimental: Ganoderma lucidum spore &amp; Chemotherapy; Placebo
      Comparator: Placebo &amp; Chemotherapy.

      Outcome Measure:

        1. The life quality of participants was assessed with use of the Functional Assessment of
           Cancer Therapy-General (FACT-G) questionnaire at the initial diagnosis (baseline) and at
           42 days after the treatment;

        2. Investigators assessed Procedural mortality factor ligand 1(PD-L1)expression
           prospectively on tumour cells and tumour-infiltrating immune cells with the VENTANA
           PD-L1 immunohistochemistry assay;

        3. National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria.

      Statistical analysis: All experiment results were analyzed with Statistical Product and
      Service Solutions (SPSS) software (version 16.0). Data are presented as mean±standard
      deviation and analysed by one-way ANOVA. Semi-quantitative data were compared using the
      Kruskal- Wallis nonparametric analysis. The results were considered statistically significant
      at P&lt;0.05.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Ganoderma lucidum spore, as a natural substance is widely recognized and used in tumor
      patients for its nutritive value. The effect has proved that Ganoderma lucidum spore which
      has polysaccharide, triterpene compounds and the other trace elements, combined with
      chemotherapy can reduce toxicity and enhance efficacy in patients.

      Ganoderma lucidum spore can reduce bone narrow depression, gastrointestinal mucosal damage
      and enhance the immunity. Previous studies have reported that Ganoderma lucidum spore have
      antivirus, antineoplastic, decreasing blood lipids, hypoglycemic and anti-hypoxic activities.
      The objective of this study is to observe the effect of Ganoderma lucidum spore based
      combination chemotherapy in treatment of patients. And then to detect the serum level of SOD,
      MDA, pro-inflammatory factors, stress hormones and GSH-PX.
