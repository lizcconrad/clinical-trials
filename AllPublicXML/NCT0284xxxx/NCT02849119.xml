    <textblock>
      Both laparoscopic partial nephrectomy (LPN) and robotic partial nephrectomy (RPN) can be
      performed through transperitoneal (TP) or retroperitoneal (RP) approach. RP approach is less
      utilized than TP approach because of technical difficulties when using rigid laparoscopic
      instruments in the small space of retroperitoneum cavity. However, with advanced surgical
      skills and thoughtful patient selection, RP approach may be associated with shorter operative
      time (OT), less estimated blood loss (EBL), shorter length of hospital stay (LOS) compared
      with TP approach.

      Therefore, the investigators performed randomized control trial to compare the outcomes of
      the two approaches (TP-LPN or RPN vs RP-LPN or RPN).

    <textblock>
      Partial nephrectomy is the standard treatment for small renal masses. The evolution of
      minimally invasive partial nephrectomy led to widespread utilization of laparoscopic (LPN)
      and robotic partial nephrectomy (RPN). Both LPN and RPN can be performed through
      transperitoneal (TP) or retroperitoneal (RP) approach. RP approach is less utilized than TP
      approach because of technical difficulties when using rigid laparoscopic instruments in the
      small space of retroperitoneum cavity. However, with advanced surgical skills and thoughtful
      patient selection, RP approach may be associated with shorter OT, less EBL, shorter LOS
      compared with TP approach.

      Therefore, the investigators performed randomized control trial to compare the outcomes of
      the two approaches (TP-LPN or RPN vs RP-LPN or RPN).

      The purpose of this study To compare the treatment outcomes of the transperitoneal and
      retroperitoneal approach during LPN or RPN in treatment of small renal masses.

      Inclusion criteria During the study period, a small renal mass (less than 4cm, T1a stage)
      patients are going to underwent LPN or RPN.

      Exclusion criteria

        1. Patients who underwent radical nephrectomy

        2. Patients with bilateral renal masses

        3. Patients with a solitary kidney

        4. Patients reject a written informed consent

        5. Pregnancy

      The number of target subjects More than 106 patients who meet the inclusion criteria
