  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an expertise-based randomized controlled trial. The hypothesis of this study is that
      the differences in expertise of acupuncturist may impact clinical effect. In this study,
      patients will be randomized to 4 group, receiving the treatment from senior acupuncturist,
      junior acupuncturist, junior acupuncturist by only acupuncture Neiguan(P6), or not receive
      the acupuncture. All patients receive the basic cisplatin chemotherapy. The duration of
      treatment is from the first day receiving cisplatin until two days after cisplatin on each
      group. NCI and Rhode scale will be used to measure the control of nausea and vomiting.

      This is an expertise-based randomized controlled trial. The hypothesis of this study is that
      the differences in expertise of acupuncturist may impact clinical effect. In this study, 102
      patients will be randomly divided into 4 groups which separately receiving the treatment from
      senior acupuncturist(clinical experience&gt; 15 years, considered in this trial as highly
      expertised), junior acupuncturist(clinical experience&lt; 5 years, considered in this trial as
      lower expertised), junior acupuncturist only acupuncture Neiguan(P6), or not receiving the
      acupuncture. All participants receive the cisplatin-based chemotherapy and 5-HT3 as
      antiemetic treatment will be included. Acupuncture treatments are given once daily, the
      duration of treatment is from the first day receiving cisplatin until two days after
      cisplatin. NCI and Rhode scale will be used to measure the control of nausea and vomiting.
      only outcome assessors are blinded. Generalized estimating equations will be used to compare
      the effects among groups.
