      This study explores the feasibility of a mindfulness-based intervention for people with a
      diagnosis of borderline personality disorder.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an uncontrolled feasibility trial of an eight-week mindfulness-based intervention for
      people with a diagnosis of borderline personality disorder. A battery of measures will be
      administered at baseline, in a time window of six to zero weeks prior to the start of the
      intervention. Outcome measures will be repeated in the two weeks after the end of the
      eight-week intervention, along with a qualitative interview.

    Unforeseen feasibility issues arose that meant the study did not seem viable in the current
