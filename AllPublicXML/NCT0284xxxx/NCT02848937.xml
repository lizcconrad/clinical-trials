      This study aimed to evaluate the effect on the calcium balance of a concentrate with 1 mM
      citrate and locate the equivalent concentration of calcium (Ca_eq) at a concentration of 3 mM
      acetate and traditional with 1.5 mM calcium in HD. The secondary objective is to evaluate the
      performance in the medium term of purifying the concentrate with 1 mM citrate and Ca_eq,
      compared to traditional concentrated with 3 mM acetate and 1.5 mM calcium in HD.

      Primary Objective The primary objective of this study is to find the formulation of calcium
      (1.50, 1.65 and 1.75 mM) in the bath with 1 mM citrate which allows the equivalence of
      calcium balance (Ca_eq) in a sitting HD compared to traditional concentrated with 3 mM of
      calcium acetate and 1.5.

      Secondary objectives

        -  Evaluate the purifying performance of small and medium-sized molecules in HD with
           concentrated with 1 mM citrate and Ca_eq compared to traditional concentrated with 3 mM
           calcium acetate and 1.5.

        -  Observe the effects on hemodynamic of the concentrate through the variation of the pre
           and post-dialysis blood pressure and intradialytic symptoms (cramps, hypotension,
           headache).

        -  Evaluate the variations of the parameters of mineral metabolism: Predialytic values of
           PTH, alkaline phosphatase treatments with concentrated Cit (1 mM citrate and Ca_eq) and
           concentrated with traditional Ac (3 mM calcium acetate and 1.5).

    <description>Each patient will participate in two phases of the study. The first phase has the aim to identify the concentration of calcium in the bath with citrate which allows the equivalence of mass balance (Ca_eq) compared to the concentrate with 3 mM acetate and 1.5 mM of calcium (4 weeks). Each week, the concentration of calcium in the bath with citrate is increased from 1.5-, to 1.65, to 1.75 mM.
•Concentrate SelectBag One (with 3 mM acetic acid) and SelectBag Citrate (with 1 mM of citric acid). The potassium in the bath will be chosen on the basis of the needs of the patient (2 to 3.5 mM) and will be maintained in all concentrates.•All treatment parameters (Qb, time of treatment, weight loss and anticoagulant dose) should be overlapped at all stages of the study</description>

In the second phase will evaluate the effectiveness of the purification concentrate with 1 mM citrate and Ca_eq compared to the concentrate with 3 mM acetate and 1.5 mM calcium. For each of the sessions will be used the following materials:
Filter high permeability (Kuf&gt; 20ml/mmHg);
Concentrate SelectBag One (with 3 mM acetic acid) and SelectBag Citrate (with 1 mM of citric acid). The potassium in the bath will be chosen on the basis of the needs of the patient (2 to 3.5 mM) and will be maintained in all concentrates.
