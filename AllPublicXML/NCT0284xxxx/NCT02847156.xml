  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Respiratory Viral Infections (RVI) are particularly frequent in young children. Old data
      mention the deleterious role of some viruses such as the Respiratory Syncytial Virus in young
      children with cystic fibrosis (CF). However, recent epidemiological data on RVI in CF
      children are rare and the impact of most frequent viruses such as human rhinoviruses is
      usually not correctly evaluated.

      The aim of this study is to assess the frequency of lower and upper RVI during a 1 year
      follow-up in CF infants and to evaluate the impact of RVI at a clinical, microbiological and
      therapeutic level.

      Our hypothesis is that frequent and/or clinically severe RVIs have the worst impact in the
      short term and without any particular link with a specific virus as previously described.
