  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is to test the hypothesis that an opioid used to treat postsurgical pain, IV
      morphine, will impact the absorption of coadministered oral acetaminophen and result in
      altered pharmacokinetics in healthy subjects.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Acetaminophen can significantly reduce the use of opioid analgesics when both are used
      concomitantly for treating moderate to severe pain. The use of IV acetaminophen used
      concomitantly with opioids has increased in practice for postsurgical pain relief over orally
      administered acetaminophen because it provides an immediate peak plasma concentration and is
      believed to provide a faster analgesic effect. Opioids used to treat pain inhibit
      gastrointestinal motility, including delaying gastric emptying. In patients receiving opioids
      the absorption of orally administered acetaminophen may be delayed and could result in
      gastric accumulation of acetaminophen thereby markedly changing the pharmacokinetic profile.
      The opioid-induced inhibition of gastrointestinal motility would not be expected to affect IV
      acetaminophen pharmacokinetics. Thus coadministered IV acetaminophen with opioid would yield
      better outcome in efficacy and reduced risk of side effects comparing with coadministration
      of oral acetaminophen and opioids.
