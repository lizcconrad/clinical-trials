      This study take place in the palliative care units of Burgundy-Franche-Comté regions and at
      the Maison Médicale Jeanne Garnier. The main aim of this project is to analyze and understand
      the meaning of explicit requests to hasten death (euthanasia and assisted suicide).

      This involves conducting interviews with patients, carers to whom the request has been
      expressed and a relative chosen by the patient. This study aims to describe the request over
      time. This will be done through two series of interviews, one as soon as it is first
      expressed, then one week later.
