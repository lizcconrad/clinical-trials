  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to estimate the capacity of the multimodal imaging parameters
      measured at 15 days and 2 months of initiation of treatment with bevacizumab, to measure
      changes in clinical status (sensitivity to measure changes) in patients treated for recurrent
      glioblastoma.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Glioblastomas are tumors with poor prognosis. The treatment of recurrent glioblastoma after a
      standard first-line treatment is not clearly codified, however, many results in the
      literature show the benefit of bevacizumab (anti- angiogenic therapy) and it is often
      proposed in this indication . Tissue action, response mechanisms and therapeutic escape
      remain is poorly understood.

      The investigators hypothesize that these response mechanisms are controlled by changes in
      some parameters in the tumor tissue, such as hypoxia, neoangiogenesis, cell density and that
      multimodal imaging can help us to better understand these mechanisms.

      To identify which parameters of imaging would best measure response mechanisms, the
      investigators want to evaluate in the first study and for this particular indication , a
      property of the measure called by the Anglo -Saxon ' sensitivity to change &quot; that is to say,
      its sensitivity or ability to measure changes. This is an additional property to the
      reproducibility of the measurement.

    <description>The fluoro-misonidazole is a positron emission tomography tracer (labeled with Fluorine-18)-specific hypoxia. This compound penetrates into cells where it is reduced by a nitroreductase enzyme. It is rapidly regenerated by reoxidation when the cell is properly oxygenated. This metabolite can accumulate in viable hypoxic cells (necrotic cells that can provide initial reduction reaction of F-MISO).
Moreover, the fixing of this tracer appears to be independent of blood flow. The advantage of this technique is to provide a direct image of hypoxic cells by directly targeting under stress hypoxic.</description>
