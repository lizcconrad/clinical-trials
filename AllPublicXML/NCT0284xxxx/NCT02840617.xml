  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to evaluate the feasibility of indocyanine green (ICG)-based fluorescence
      imaging in the detection of prostate tumors and metastatic lymph nodes. By correlating the
      ICG fluorescence patterns with pathologically confirmed tumor and nodal status, it would be
      possible to use fluorescence navigation system in helping prostate biopsy and lymph node
      dissection in the future.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators will conduct an in vivo and in vitro pilot study in order to evaluate the
      diagnostic performance of fluorescence in the detection of prostate cancer and metastatic
      lymph nodes. All the patients included in this study will receive a radical prostatectomy
      after intravenous injection of 0.4 mg/Kg of ICG. ICG will be administered immediately after
      the patient is anesthetized. The fluorescence analysis will be performed intraoperatively by
      laparoscopic imaging and after surgery by hand-held imaging. The prostate or lymph nodes
      specimen with or without fluorescence signal will be sent to the Department of Pathology for
      pathological analysis. The histopathological procedure will be performed without knowledge of
      fluorescence analysis.
