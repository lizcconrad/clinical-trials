  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The &quot;gold standard&quot; for diagnosing a bacterial infection is isolation of the pathogenic germ,
      which is not easy in routine clinical practice.

      Conventional markers do not have sufficient diagnostic value for making a rapid diagnosis on
      admission. A 2004 literature calculated the diagnostic values of C-reactive protein (CRP) and
      procalcitonin (PCT) levels for the diagnosis of bacterial infections, relative to other
      causes of inflammation. For CRP, the sensitivity was 75% (95% CI: 62%-84%) and the
      specificity was 67% (95% CI: 56%-77%). For PCT, the sensitivity was 88% (95% CI: 62%-84%) and
      the specificity was 81% (95% CI: 67%-90%).

      The first cellular immune response to infection consists of the mobilization of polynuclear
      neutrophils from the bone marrow to the infection site under the effect of pre-inflammatory
      cytokines, as well as the apoptosis of lymphocytes and their sequestration at the infection
      site. This results in lymphopenia and the elevated polynuclear neutrophil count (PNN)
      observed in bacterial infections.

      Hence, it is legitimate to hypothesize that the neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR) can be
      used in the diagnosis of bacterial infection. This ratio's value in the diagnosis of sepsis
      in the emergency department was studied and the researchers found higher diagnostic values
      than for CRP and PCT.

      The NLR's potential value in the diagnosis of a bacterial infection in a context of fever or
      hyperthermia (regardless of the presence or absence of bacteraemia) has not been studied
      before. This ratio could also be compared with standard biomarkers (CRP and PCT levels, the
      white blood cell count and the PNN).
