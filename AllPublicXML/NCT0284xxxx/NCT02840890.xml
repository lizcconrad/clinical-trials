  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Adjuvant chemotherapy with the protocol 3 cure of 5-FU + Epirubicine + Cyclophosphamide
      (FEC100) and 3 cure of Taxotere is a standard treatment in the management of patients with
      breast cancer and in adjuvant situation.

      The efficacy of 3 FEC100 and 3 Taxotere protocol in adjuvant situation for women treated for
      breast cancer is associated with several invalidating side effects for the quality of life of
      patients. 92% of women treated will present gastrointestinal toxicities of any grade. 11%
      will present nausea and vomiting of grade 3-4. Current treatments to prevent these
      gastrointestinal toxicities include Emend from Day 1 to Day 3 in association with setrons at
      Day 1 and corticosteroids from Day 1 to Day 3. Despite the marked improvement in
      gastrointestinal toxicities with preventive treatments, 83% of patients would use
      alternatives medicine: homeopathy, herbal medicine, acupuncture, hypnotherapy and / or
      osteopathy.

      Osteopathy is a method of care and unconventional therapeutic approach. In France, the
      professional title of osteopath is recognized. It aims to prevent and treat functional
      disorders, especially those related to adverse effects of treatment. In oncology, this
      discipline may have additional support for the patient by limiting the mechanical and
      physical constraints of sensitive areas to the toxicity of the treatment. In the case of
      gastrointestinal toxicities of myofascial and musculoskeletal techniques are used in
      abdominal areas to relieve symptoms. The investigators hypothesis is that osteopathy could
      have an interest in the management of gastrointestinal toxicities related to chemotherapy in
      women with breast cancer and in adjuvant treatment situation.
