  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Mediterranean diet (MD), a healthy dietary pattern based on some common dietary
      characteristics in Mediterranean countries, is associated with high antioxidant capacity
      linked to the low saturated fat intake that might contribute to reduce free fatty acid (FFA)
      availability and oxidation in mitochondria, thus reducing the production of the reactive
      oxygen species (ROS) superoxide, and promoting cellular health. To assess the adherence to
      the MD, a simple 14-item questionnaire had been tested in different settings by the PREDIMED
      (PREvención con DIeta MEDiterránea) multicenter, randomized, primary prevention trial. On the
      other hand, to allow a more an accurate measurement of the actual macro and micronutrient
      intakes, including dietary anti-oxidant micronutrients, the 7-day food records is considered
      as the &quot;gold standard&quot; of self-administered food frequency questionnaires.

      Circulating levels of Sirtuin 4 (Sirt4), part of a complex of proteins that control diverse
      biological processes, including lipid metabolism, are low in obese patients, as a possible
      attempt to decrease fat oxidative capacity and mitochondrial ROS production, however
      promoting ectopic liver fat storage.

      The phase angle (PA), a measure determined by bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA), and the
      visceral adiposity index (VAI), a gender-specific mathematical index based on simple
      anthropometric and metabolic parameters, represent well-validated, reliable and widely used
      markers of cellular health and ectopic adipose distribution and function, respectively. The
      fatty liver index (FLI) is a surrogate measure for fatty liver recently proposed as an
      independent predictor for diabetes mellitus.

      Aim of the present study was to investigate in adult obese individuals the levels of Sirt4
      according to the adherence to the MD evaluated by PREDIMED questionnaire, focusing on the
      possible association with single dietary components evaluated by 7-day food records, and to
      evaluate the association between circulating levels of Sirt4 and PA, as marker of cellular
      health, VAI, as index of adipocyte dysfunction, and FLI, as a predictor of fatty liver.
