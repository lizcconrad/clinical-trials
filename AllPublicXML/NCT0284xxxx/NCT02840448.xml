      Background:

      People with Williams Syndrome (WS) and supravalvular aortic stenosis (SVAS) have less
      elasticity in their blood vessels. This is called blood vessel stiffness. Blood vessels may
      have focal narrowings called stenoses or may just be globally more narrow.

      Objectives:

      Researchers want to see how blood vessel differences in people with Williams Syndrome and
      supravalvular aortic stenosis affect organs in the body including the heart, gut, kidneys,
      and brain.

      Eligibility:

      People ages 3-85 who have WS or SVAS

      Healthy volunteers ages 3-85

      Design:

        -  Participants will have yearly visits for up to 10 years. All participants will be
           offered the same tests.

        -  Participants will give consent for the study team to review their medical records. If
           the participant is a child or an adult with WS, a parent or guardian will give the
           consent.

        -  Participants will visit the NIH where they will have a physical exam and medical
           history. Based on their health history, participants will undergo a series of imaging
           tests and measures of blood vessel function over the course of 2-4 days. Tests of
           cognitive abilites will also be performed. Blood will be drawn and an IV may be placed
           for specific tests.

    <textblock>
      Elasticity in the aorta buffers the body from damage due to pulsatile blood flow. Data from
      humans and mice show that with increasing age, vessels lose elasticity and become stiff.
      Vascular stiffness is associated with progressive cognitive impairment and dementia in aging
      adults, but little is known about the effects of early-onset/congenital vascular stiffness.
      Similarly, elastin-mediated arteriopathy in the form of stenosis has the potential to impact
      additional end organs such as the heart, lungs, gut, skeletal muscle and kidney causing
      feeding and exercise intolerance, as well hypertension. This study evaluates the impact of
      elastin arteriopathy and vascular stiffness on end organs.

      Following consent, the investigators will work with the subjects and their caregivers to
      determine which tests are most appropriate for the patient based on their age/capabilities
      and preferences and may include:

        -  complete formal testing of cognitive and neurobehavioral abilities

        -  undergo non-invasive measurements of vascular stiffness

        -  undergo brain imaging by MRI

        -  undergo echocardiogram

        -  undergo ECG

        -  undergo 24-hour ambulatory electrocardiogram monitor

        -  undergo ultrasound imaging and flow studies of various vascular beds and tissues

        -  undergo CT angiogram of relevant vessels

        -  undergo non-invasive tissue oxygenation and endothelial functional assessment with near
           infrared spectroscopy (NIRS)

        -  perform a 6 minute walk test

        -  perform pulmonary function tests

        -  receive an eye exam and Optical coherence tomography (OCT)

        -  give blood/urine for relevant laboratories

        -  evaluate biomechanical properties of skin

        -  complete medica photography evaluating relevant features of the condition

      Additionally, the study will request permission to review the participant's medical records
      to obtain additional information about general and cardiovascular health. For individuals
      with supravalvular aortic stenosis (SVAS) or Williams syndrome (WS), the clinical report
      confirming the individuals diagnosis will be reviewed when available.

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:

        We will recruit individuals with WS or SVAS and demographically similar control
        (unaffected) participants.

             research study).

             clinical features of SVAS or an SVAS-like condition but have genetic testing results
             that imply affected status (SVAS has decreased penetrance).
