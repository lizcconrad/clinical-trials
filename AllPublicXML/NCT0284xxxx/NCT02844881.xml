      Angiogenesis is a hallmark of cancer, together with vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)
      as one of the most important angiogenic drivers. Inhibitors targeting the VEGF/VEGFR-pathway
      have shown beneficial effects in many cancer patients, but they are transient and followed by
      fast regrowth. Similarly, the effectiveness of tumor immunotherapies has been limited by
      tumor-mediated escape mechanisms and immune suppression. By combining the two strategies,
      antiangiogenic immunotherapy offers the possibility to more vigorously inhibit tumor
      angiogenesis and promote an enduring immune-stimulatory milieu that leads to prolonged
      survival benefits in cancer patients.

      Apatinib is a small-molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) that highly selectively binds to
      and strongly inhibits vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (VEGFR-2). Apatinib has
      been demonstrated as monotherapy prolongs OS in patients with gastric or gastroesophageal
      junction adenocarcinoma after two or more lines of chemotherapy with moderate, reversible,
      and easily managed adverse events.

      Multiple antigens specific cellular therapy (MASCT) is a new immunotherapy that dendritic
      cells(DC) was induced from autologous peripheral blood. The DC can then be loaded with 17
      antigens and re-infused. In vitro, antigen-pulsed DC can stimulate autologous T-cell
      proliferation and induction of autologous specific cytotoxic T-cells(CTL)，similarly
      re-infused. The previous research data showed that MASCT had the modest overall response and
      less adverse effects for Hepatocellular Carcinoma patients.

      The study is aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Apatinib and MASCT in patients with
      advanced solid tumors.
