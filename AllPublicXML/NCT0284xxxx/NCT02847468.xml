  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the third cause of death by cancer. For patients with
      inoperable advanced HCC, systematic therapy with Sorafenib, a multikinase inhibitor that has
      both antiangiogenic and antiproliferative effect, is the only therapeutic with proven
      survival benefits. However, the efficacy of Sorafenib remains inconstant with a media overall
      survival of 10,7 months and a disease control rate only 35 to 43%; moreover, the overall
      incidence of treatment-related adverse event is 80%. Thus, it appears essential to find an
      early and accurate way to determine which patients are best responding to therapy in order to
      avoid the toxicity and cost of ineffective therapy.

      Positron Emission Tomography (PET) with 18F-Fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) has shown limited
      performance in the setting of HCC because of lack of sensitivity, in particular for
      well-differentiated tumours. However FDG uptake is related to proliferation rate and is an
      efficient marker survival following liver transplantation and selective internal radiation
      therapy. Moreover, the addition of a dynamic first-pass acquisition to the standard static
      scan provides better characterization of the tumour by adding information on tumour
      perfusion.

      FCH which reflects lipids metabolism and specifically choline kinase activity, has shown
      promising results for detection of HCC when compared with FDG alone. Moreover, choline
      activity is related to a kinase pathway in mammalian cells, which is specifically inhibited
      by Sorafenib. However FCH uptake remains inconstant in HCC, and is related to tumour
      differentiation, by opposition to FDG. Therefore, several studies have suggested that
      combined evaluation of tumour glucose and lipid metabolism could play a complementary role
      for the evaluation of HCC in the setting of detection, staging and to predict recurrence
      following surgical resection. Thus, the investigator hypothesize that the combination of FDG
      and FCH may be the most accurate imaging evaluation of HCC.

      Thus the aim of the present study is to determine the predictive performance of survival of
      lipid and glucose metabolism and perfusion changes during Sorafenib therapy in patients with
      advanced HCC.
