  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) is the leading cause of neonatal viral infection and can have a
      significant impact on the neurosensory development of newborns and especially preterm
      infants. HCMV infection may result from maternal-fetal transmission during pregnancy or
      postnatal transmission. While congenital HCMV infection affects about 2-5% of very preterm
      infants, the risk of postnatal infection, particularly through breast milk, is much higher in
      this population (prevalence of about 20%). Many learned societies wonder about the interest
      to inactivate HCMV (by freezing or pasteurization) in breast milk in order to reduce or
      eliminate contamination of these children. However, freezing is relatively inefficient to
      reduce contamination and pasteurization drastically alters the nutritional quality of the
      milk. Therefore, a systematic preventive treatment of breast milk for very preterm infants is
      not currently recommended. An alternative approach could consist in detecting HCMV in breast
      milk to target at-risk situations. This detection can be performed by PCR but its cost and
      the time required to obtain the result prohibits its use for a mass detection. Currently,
      viral status of breast milk is not explored in practice and, depending on the health centers,
      breastfeeding is continued as such or milk is systematically inactivated.The main objective
      of VIRUMILK is to study the feasibility of the CMV detection in breast milk from lactating
      mothers with a biochip.The ultimate goal is to prevent postnatal HCMV infection of preterm
      newborns less than 33 weeks.

        The study will be proposed to mothers meeting the criteria described in part &quot;Eligibility
        criteria&quot; during an investigators' visit of the newborn infant in the Department of
        Neonatal Medicine of the Besancon University Hospital. They will then receive information
        on the study. The practitioner responsible for the study will also collect non-opposition
        of mothers.
