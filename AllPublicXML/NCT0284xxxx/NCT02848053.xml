      Objectives: This study is aimed to assess whether Tianqi Capsule interventions have a
      long-term effect on the risk of diabetes and provide evidence that early intervention by
      traditional Chinese medicine could delay the progression from impaired glucose tolerance to
      diabetes.

      Study contents: 1.420 participants were followed up for 8 years to assess the long-term
      effect of Tianqi Capsule. Phone-call followed up was applied to investigate the status of
      impaired glucose tolerance and orthoglycemic survivors until the end of REDUCES study. 2.To
      participants that determined the status of glucose metabolism, a variety of ways were used to
      find the evidence of diagnosis of glucose metabolic status, such as glycemia laboratory
      sheets from normal hospitals, medical records, the use of antidiabetic drugs or insulin
      injection, etc. 3. To participants that undiagnosed the status of glucose metabolism, oral
      glucose tolerance test, blood pressure, weight and blood biochemical analysis were performed
      to assess the state of glucose metabolism. 4. Questionnaires were given to all the
      participants to investigate their condition of treatment, diet, exercise and other lifestyle.
