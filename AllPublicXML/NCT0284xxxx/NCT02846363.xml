  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Acute stroke management represents a true medical emergency that requires prompt diagnosis
      and urgent treatment. In a previous exhaustive cohort study conducted in the Rhône region,
      France (AVC69) the investigators observed that only a small percentage of patients could
      access to thrombolysis in time. In this cohort of 1306 patients treated in one of the
      emergency department of the Rhone region for a suspected stroke, 84% of patients reached
      hospital through an emergency department instead of going directly to a stroke unit. Among
      those patients, only 8% were finally thrombolysed, because of extended management times.. Our
      hypothesis was that public awareness campaign designed to improve public's knowledge and
      skills would consequently reduce prehospital time and favour call to prehospital emergency
      medical services (EMS).

      The investigators will conduct an awareness campaign aimed at the general population, using
      different communication media, the content will be developed based on the results of a
      qualitative study with focus groups (Quali-AVC), and using a diffusion plan established with
      communications professionals. To assess the effects of this campaign, a comparative
      quasi-experimental before-after study will be conducted. A control region where no awareness
      stroke program has been set up has been selected, data will be collected in the two regions.
      The assessment of the impact of the campaign will focus on the comparison of the evolution of
      indicators between these two regions. Three assessment time will be provided: before starting
      the program, at 3 months and at the end of the program.

    <description>Comparison between the two regions of the changing number of calls to EMS for suspected stroke between 1 month before the start of campaign and 12 months after campaign. Calls to EMS for suspicion of stroke will be collected over a period of 60 consecutive days at each assessment period. Suspicion of stroke will be defined as the presence of a positive test FAST, which mean at least one of the three symptoms: Face, Arm or Speech disability, identified by phone by the EMS triage officer or emergency physician.</description>

    <description>The public awareness campaign was based on improving knowledge and skills of public to recognize stroke symptoms. The campaign materials were:
3 posters presenting the three main symptoms of stroke and the need to call the EMS immediately
A leaflet on stroke will be created
3 participatory movies: These films will be posted on YouTube and broadcast on the website and the Facebook campaign page
Actions on social networks: A Facebook group will be created (&quot;AVC: votre appel peut sauver des vie).
A website developed with ICAP - UCBL Lyon1 (http://avc.univ-lyon1.fr/)
On the occasion of World Stroke Day, held annually on 29 October, will be organized an event in Lyon in order to educate and inform the general public about stroke: the main symptoms and reflexes to adopt in case of stroke: call the EMS urgently</description>
