    <textblock>
      Neonatal intensive care is necessary for the survival of preterm baby. Several studies show
      the deleterious effect on the immature brain due to stimulations caused by the environment
      and hospital care.

      However, a specific and individualized support to the development during the first weeks of
      this preterm patient has a positive effect on newborn development.

      A new practical newborn behavioral observation scale has been developed by the investigators
      care unit in order to adapt care and individualized support to the development for each
      patient.

      The goal of this study is to estimate the external reproductibility of this scale by
      experimented nurse in order to implement an individualized care program.
