  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Basic animal research has demonstrated that exercise training can protect the myocardium from
      ischemia-reperfusion injury through several biological mechanisms . This effect of exercise
      training may be beneficial in the perioperative period when cardiac complications may arise.
      However, exercise induced cardioprotection is lost completely within 18 days of stopping the
      training program. This finding from animal research will be used to test the hypothesis that
      3 days of consecutive exercise with the last bout conducted within the last 24/48 hours prior
      to surgery, will have a cardioprotective effect . Specifically, exercise has been shown to
      protect cardiac myocytes against reperfusion induced oxidative stress and mitochondria
      against reperfusion induced damage. This exercise mediated cardioprotection is observed in
      short moderate duration ischemia (i.e. 5-20 min) and moderate to severe (i.e.20-60 min)
      ischemic insults. The effects of exercise induced cardioprotection have only been
      investigated at cell level and it has not been shown whether this will translate into a
      reduction in postsurgical reperfusion injury and associated complications. To study this
      potential cardioprotective effect the investigators will aim to recruit patients who have a
      high risk of receiving reperfusion injury during surgery. Specifically, the investigators
      will recruit abdominal aortic aneurysm patients where the risk of heart complications is
      high. There is also currently no evidence in the published literature with regard to the
      effect of preoperative supervised exercise.
