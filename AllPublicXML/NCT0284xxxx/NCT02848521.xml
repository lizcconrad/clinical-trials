      This is a prospective, non-interventional study (NIS) measuring health-related quality of
      life (HRQoL), treatment satisfaction, and other patient-reported outcomes (PROs) of ADPKD
      patients in Europe.

    <description>A descriptive of discrete-choice experiment (DCE) will be presented at baseline and at 18 months. Data from the DCE survey will be analysed using a conditional logit model. This explores the impact of each attribute (independent variable) on the patients' choice (dependent variable). Overall odds ratio of DCE for preference to the addition of a disease modifying treatment versus no change to local SoC will be displayed. The relationship between attributes of treatment and overall treatment preference as captured in DCE and relationship between stated DCE attribute preferences and persistence to ADPKD treatments will also be analysed.</description>
