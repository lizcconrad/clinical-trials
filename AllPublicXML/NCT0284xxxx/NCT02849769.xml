      Following product approval, further confirmation of the MR Conditional Tachyarrhythmia
      Therapy Systems sensing and detection performance post MRI exposure will be obtained by
      actively monitoring de-identified device data obtained through the Medtronic CareLink®
      Network.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Pre-clinical testing and clinical data has demonstrated the safety and effectiveness of
      magnetic resonance (MR) Conditional Tachyarrhythmia Therapy Systems in the MR environment
      when used according to labeling requirements. Following approval, further confirmation of the
      MR Conditional Tachyarrhythmia Therapy Systems sensing and detection performance post MRI
      exposure will be obtained by actively monitoring de-identified device data obtained through
      the Medtronic CareLink® Network. MR conditional tachyarrhythmia therapy system enrolled in
      the Medtronic CareLink® Network (CL) will be used to prospectively assess spontaneous
      Ventricular Fibrillation (VF) episode detection following MRI exposure.
