    <textblock>
      This trial is conducted in Europe. The aim of the trial is to investigate the influence of
      oral semaglutide on pharmacokinetics (the exposure of the trial drug in the body) of
      ethinylestradiol and levonorgestrel in an oral contraceptive combination drug in healthy
      postmenopausal females.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Postmenopausal female, age at least 45 years at the time of signing informed consent.
             With at least 12 consecutive months since the last spontaneous menstrual bleeding (if
             there was any uncertainty of the time of the last spontaneous bleeding, the
             postmenopausal status is to be confirmed with follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) 40
             mIU/mL)

          -  Body mass index (BMI) between 20.0 and 29.9 kg/m^2 (both inclusive)

          -  Considered to be generally healthy based on the medical history, physical examination,
             and the results of vital signs, electrocardiogram and clinical laboratory tests
             performed during the screening visit, as judged by the investigator

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Smoker (defined as a subject who is smoking at least one cigarette or the equivalent
             per day). A subject smoking less than one cigarette or the equivalent per day must be
             able or willing to refrain from smoking and use of nicotine substitute products during
             the trial

          -  Any blood draw in excess of 25 mL in the past 30 days, or donation of blood or plasma
             in excess of 400 mL within the 90 days preceding screening

          -  Sitting blood pressure at screening (after resting for at least 5 minutes) outside the
             range of 90-139 mmHg for systolic or 50-89 mmHg for diastolic. If white-coat
             hypertension is suspected a single repeat measurement is allowed, last measurement
             being conclusive

          -  History of major surgical procedures involving the stomach potentially affecting
             absorption of trial product (e.g. subtotal and total gastrectomy, sleeve gastrectomy,
             gastric bypass surgery)
