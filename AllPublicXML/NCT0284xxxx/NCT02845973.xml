  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to identify and verify one or more gut bacteria of which the
      abundance in feces may help to early diagnosis colorectal cancer.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Gut microbiota is closely related to human gut neoplasm. According to recent statistics, the
      abundance of FN (Fusobacterium Nucleatum) is connected with the development and progression
      of CRCs (colorectal cancers). Subsequent research shows identifying multiple
      microbial-specific genes in human feces using qPCR (quantitative Polymerase Chain Reaction)
      may help diagnosis of early stage colorectal cancer. Currently little is known about the
      relationship between single abundance of specific gut microbiota and colorectal cancer in
      different stage. Moreover, finding early-stage CRCs is still of great challenge partially due
      to precancerous diseases like colorectal adenoma which remain difficult to differentiate from
      early-stage CRC under endoscope. Conventional clinic methods predicting CRCs largely depend
      on serum CEA (serum Carcino Embryonic Antigen) and OB(fecal occult blood test), which lack of
      adequate sensitivity and specificity especially in early stage CRCs. The investigators' work
      focuses on the abundance of gut microbiota in feces from people with colon neoplasm and its
      comparison with classical indicators such as CEA and OB, aiming to reveal and testify its
      potential role on assisting diagnosis of CRCs in different stage as a none-invasive
      cost-effective method.
