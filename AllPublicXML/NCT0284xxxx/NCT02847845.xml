  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Verify the efficacy and safety after taking red ginseng for chronic fatigue syndrome or
      idiopathic chronic fatigue patient. They were verified through not only survey like VAS
      change about fatigue, fatigue severity scale, Chalder fatigue severity questionnaire,
      SRI-short form , BDI , ISI EQ-5D-5L, ginseng subjective symptoms questionnaire but also an
      anti-oxidant test and a salivary cortisol test after 6 weeks after taking red ginseng or
      placebo drugs.

    <description>The patient is asked to indicate their perceived fatigue intensity along a 100 mm horizontal line, where '0' represents 'no fatigue' and '100', 'unbearable fatigue'</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>fatigue severity scale change</measure>

    <description>The FSS is a self-administered questionnaire with 9 items (questions) investigating the severity of fatigue in different situations during the past week. Grading of each item ranges from 1 to 7, where 1 indicates strong disagreement and 7 strong agreement, and the final score represents the mean value of the 9 items</description>

    <description>The Chalder fatigue severity questionnaire is composed of 11 questions about fatigue. Grading of each item ranges from 0 to 9, where 0 indicate non-fatigue and 9 strong fatigue</description>

    <measure>beck depression inventory, BDI change</measure>
    <time_frame>at 2(baseline),5(after 6 weeks of administration) and 6(follow up evaluation after 10 weeks of administration) visit</time_frame>
    <description>When the test is scored, a value of 0 to 3 is assigned for each answer and then the total score is compared to a key to determine the depression's severity.</description>

    <measure>insomnia severity index, ISI change</measure>
    <time_frame>at 2(baseline),3(after 2 weeks of administration), 4(after 4 weeks of administration), 5(after 6 weeks of administration) and 6(follow up evaluation after 10 weeks of administration) visit</time_frame>
    <description>The ISI is composed of seven items assessing recent problems with sleep onset, sleep maintenance and early morning awakening, interference of sleep problems with daily functioning and perceived prominence of impairment attributed to the sleep problem, concern about sleep problems and satisfaction with sleep patterns. Perceived severity of each item is rated on a 0-4 scale and a total score, which ranges from 0 to 28 obtains from summing the items ratings</description>

    <description>The EuroQOL - 5 Dimensions (EQ-5D) was employed for measuring health-related quality of life. It consisted of a weighted sum of five dimensions: Mobility, Self-care, Usual activities, Pain/Discomfort and Anxiety/Depression, which provided a simple descriptive profile and a single index value for health status . We used a recently developed version, the EQ-5D-5L, which includes five-level response options: no problems, slight problems, moderate problems, severe problems, and extreme problems</description>
