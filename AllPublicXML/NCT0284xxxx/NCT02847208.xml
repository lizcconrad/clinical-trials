  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Little is known about gynaecological follow-up and cervical screening in Cystic Fibrosis
      (CF). Only few studies have described contraceptive practices in cohorts of CF women.

      The investigators did a cross-sectional study in a cohort of 155 CF women attending the Lyon
      adult centre. Women attending the CF adult centre in 2014 completed a written questionnaire
      about their contraceptive choices, frequency of gynaecological follow-up and cervical
      screening. Other clinical data were collected from the CF adult centre registry.

      One hundred and twenty women (100%) answered the questionnaire, among whom two were
      post-menopausal (46 and 59 years of age), and five were pregnant.

      Seventy-four per cent of the women declared they had undergone gynaecological followup (89%
      of the women with transplantation), and only 55% reported having at least one previous Pap
      smear test. Among the transplanted patients, only 58% had had a Papsmear test, despite
      immunosuppressive treatment. The overall rate of contraception was only 64% and in diabetic
      women, it was 61%. Among contraception users; 65% used oral contraception, predominantly
      combined estrogen-progestagen (47%); among diabetic patients, 26% used progestin-only
      contraception. Intrauterine device accounted for 10% of patients using contraception, and
      tubal ligation only 4%.

      This study is limited by its cross-sectional design. Despite an internal validation of the
      questionnaire showing an almost perfect agreement, the risk of recall bias has to be taken
      into account.

      This study of practices highlights the importance of improved information regarding
      sexuality, fertility and reproductive health in young women with CF. A regular gynaecological
      follow-up and cervical screening is mandatory in this population.

      Better gynaecological care and contraceptive advice would help to avoid unplanned
      pregnancies, and optimize contraceptive selection in relationship to specific clinical
      conditions.

    <description>The questionnaire was filled-in by the patients in presence of a clinical nurse. The gynaecological healthcare options and contraceptive choices were recorded. All following questions were closed-ended (answer yes/no): use of contraception; use of contraceptive pill; use of contraceptive implant; use of intrauterine device; use of tubal sterilization; use of mechanical contraception; use of other type of contraception; previous delivery (term pregnancy); gynaecological follow-up; previous Pap smear. In case of a positive answer to one of these questions, more details were requested (depending on the situation: name of the contraception, date of delivery, frequency of the gynaecological follow-up, date of the last pap smear). An internal validation of the questionnaire was performed on a subgroup of patients.</description>
