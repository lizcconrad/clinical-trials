  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the accuracy of Confocal Laser Endomicroscopy (CLE) in the diagnostic of
      non-invasive flat and exophytic bladder neoplasia. CLE results are compared to histopathology
      results.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Confocal Laser Endomicroscopy (CLE) is a technique which during endoscopic examination of the
      bladder (cystoscopy) gives magnified, microscopic-like images of tissues and cells, by
      inserting a laser fiber through the cystoscope. CLE aims to target biopsies during cystoscopy
      and reduce the number of biopsies, and the need for additional cystoscopies i general
      anesthesia.

      This study evaluates the ability of CLE to assess tissue in the bladder. The ability to
      diagnose normal mucosa, inflammation and tumors of the bladder by the CLE is compared to the
      histopathological examination of selected tissues (biopsies).

      Patients scheduled for cystoscopy with biopsies in general anesthesia are recruited for the
      study. After standard cystoscopy where suspicious mucosal areas are located and marked, A
      contrast agent (Fluorescein) is administrated intravenously. CLE fiber is introduced through
      the cystoscope and the marked mucosal areas are examined by direct contact with the laser
      fiber. The pathologist assesses the CLE video and registers the results. Biopsies are then
      taken from the selected, suspicious areas. The results of CLE assessment are compared with
      the histopathological results.

    <description>Patients scheduled for bladder endoscopic surgery under general anesthesia are offered to be included in our study. The suspicious mucosal areas are marked then examined with CLE. Tissue samples are taken based on the usual standard criterias. The samples are evaluated microscopically and compared with the results of the CLE technique. A single surgeon performs all surgeries. Biopsies are anlysed by a pathologist from Herlev and Gentofte Hospital's Pathology Department, which is affiliated CLE- study.</description>
