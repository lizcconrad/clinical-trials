    <textblock>
      Data about aspirin desensitization for patients with coronary artery disease undergoing
      percutaneous coronary intervention are sparse.

      This is a prospective, multicenter, observational study including 7 italian centers, to
      assess safety and feasibility of a standard desensitization protocol in patients with aspirin
      sensitivity undergoing coronary angiography. Patients with history of aspirin sensitivity
      undergoing coronary angiography are prospectively enrolled.All patients underwent the
      desensitization procedure with six sequential doses of aspirin (1, 5, 10, 20, 40, and 100 mg)
      administered orally at predefined intervals, with the procedure lasting 5.5 hours.All
      patients are followed for desensitization procedure success, description of reactions due to
      the desensitization procedure, and in hospital major adverse cardiac events (MACE). All
      patients are also followed-up for 12 months in order to assess their long-term risk of MACE,
      compliance with ASA therapy, and late occurrence of side reactions due to ASA sensitivity.
