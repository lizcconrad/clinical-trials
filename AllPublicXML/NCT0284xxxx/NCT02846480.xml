  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To find out the effectiveness of physical therapy associated with the surgical treatment over
      the simptoms and quality of life in III and IV grades of pelvic organ prolapse, patients will
      be randomly assigned to one of these groups: experimental group: pre-surgical and
      post-surgical physical therapy + behavioral education + surgical therapy. Control group:
      surgical treatment + behavioral education.

      In both groups several physical therapy assessments will be undertaken: 1st before surgery;
      2nd immediately after surgery; and after 6 weeks, 3th, 6th, 12th and 24th months
      post-surgery.

      Intervention in the experimental group, patients assigned to this group will receive:

        -  Pre-surgical physical therapy: 9 sessions of physical therapy aimed at correcting
           posture, to the awareness and the strengthening of the pelvic floor muscles. They will
           be also informed and instructed on hygienic and behavioral education to prevent pelvic
           organ prolapse and urinary incontinence. Each session will be about 45 minutes and 3
           sessions will be held a week for 3 weeks.

        -  Post-surgical Physical Therapy:

           2. Hospital discharge patients will receive the same fact sheet on sanitary and
           behavioral measures recommended for the prevention of pelvic organ prolapse and urinary
           incontinence.

           3. 6th weeks after surgery: 8 physical therapy sessions (2 per week for 4 weeks) about
           30 minutes to review hypopressive exercises and contractions of the pelvic floor.

      Intervention in the control group, patients assigned to this group will receive:

      After surgical correction of pelvic organ prolapse, at hospital discharge, patients will
      receive a fact sheet on the sanitary and behavioral measures recommended for the prevention
      of pelvic organ prolapse and urinary incontinence (proper weight, prevent constipation, avoid
      weight bearing and cough and high impact exercise). No physical therapy intervention will be
      performed.
