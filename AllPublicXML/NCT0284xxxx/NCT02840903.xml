  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to evaluate the image quality for different iodine delivery
      rates at different low voltage scanning protocols (80 or 100 kV ) under the modern advanced
      Multi-Detector Computed Tomography (MDCT) considering the body weight of patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the image quality of different acquisition protocols
      in patients weighing less than 90 kg using low voltage 80 or 100 kV with a lower Iodine
      Delivery Rate based on the body weight of the patient, who will undertake coronary or
      craniocervical CTA (Computed Tomography Angiography) in routine procedures.
