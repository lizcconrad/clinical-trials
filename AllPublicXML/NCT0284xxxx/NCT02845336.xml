  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Thyroid eye disease (TED) is an autoimmune disorder in which the immune system attacks
      orbital tissues, resulting in characteristic changes in eyelid position, globe position in
      the orbit, extraocular muscle balance, and optic nerve function. TED is a potentially
      blinding disease, and current treatments largely consist of nonspecific reduction of
      inflammation using corticosteroids or radiation therapy. Regardless of treatment, once TED
      progresses from its inflammatory phase to a more fibrotic, resolution phase, the orbital
      changes become fixed and can be modified only by surgery.

      The investigators propose to treat a cohort of patients with active TED using a selective
      COX-2 inhibitor, celecoxib, and to compare these patients to an observational control group.
      The investigators hypothesize that celecoxib will reduce the severity of disease and/or
      prevent progression to proptosis, diplopia, and corneal exposure or compressive optic
      neuropathy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators intend to use celecoxib, a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug approved by
      the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of pain, osteoarthritis, rheumatoid
      arthritis, and ankylosing spondylitis, as a treatment for active TED. In vitro data have
      shown that transformation of orbital fibroblasts into adipocytes is mediated by
      cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), and a case report suggests that COX-2 inhibition can improve TED in
      the acute phase. Thus, the investigators intend to evaluate the efficacy of COX-2 inhibition
      in the treatment of active TED and its ability to improve both the acute inflammatory signs
      and more permanent fibrotic changes of quiescent disease. The investigators will enroll
      patients with active TED and treat them for 3 months (a characteristic period of disease
      activity) and compare this to standard treatments for mild active TED (observation, with over
      the counter interventions such as lubrication with artificial tears) to assess efficacy.
