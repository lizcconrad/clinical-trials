      The purpose of this study is to explore the therapeutic effect and mechanism of transcranial
      magnetic stimulation (rTMS) in the treatment of the tardive dyskinesia.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study was a parallel control design trial for 2 weeks. Patients with schizophrenia were
      treated with 10-Hz rTMS on left motor cortex (added to the ongoing treatment). Clinical
      symptoms and MEP were assessment before and after rTMS treatment.
