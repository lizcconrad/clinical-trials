  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The number of people who smoke, have concurrent depression and that seek treatment for
      smoking cessation has increased in recent years. This implies the need to design intensive
      and specific interventions that target this issue. In depression treatment, behavioural
      activation is one of the psychological interventions whose characteristics of brevity,
      flexibility and efficiency make it an ideal candidate to be included as part of smoking
      cessation treatment, especially when smokers have depressive symptoms. The aims of the
      present trial are: 1) to assess the efficacy (abstinence rates) of a psychological smoking
      cessation treatment with elements from behavioural activation for managing depressed mood (a
      randomized control trial with three groups: standard cognitive-behavioural smoking cessation
      treatment, standard cognitive-behavioural smoking cessation treatment plus behavioural
      activation, and a control group of delayed treatment) at the end of treatment, and at 3-, 6-,
      and 12-months follow-ups; and 2) to assess whether the applied cognitive-behavioural smoking
      cessation treatment plus behavioural activation improves depressed mood at the end of
      treatment and 3-, 6, 12-months follow-ups.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In recent years there has been a great interest in analyzing the relationship between smoking
      and depression due to the high smoking rates in this population. Smokers with depression are
      more likely to smoke heavily, show greater tobacco dependence, suffer more severe withdrawal,
      experience lower quit rates and have more relapse than smokers without depression. Some
      studies propose the inclusion of behavioural activation techniques to standard
      cognitive-behavioural therapy for quitting smoking, arguing that the loss of the ability to
      experience pleasure in response to daily activities after quitting smoking is a significant
      barrier to achieving and maintaining abstinence. With this type of intervention, the exposure
      to positive reinforcers alternative to cigarettes increases and the resulting distress of
      withdrawal syndrome it is also reduced. Therefore, behavioural activation may improve smoking
      abstinence rates and depressive symptomatology. This project aims to assess the effectiveness
      of a psychological intervention for smoking cessation with components of behavioural
      activation for managing depressed mood. We will use a single blind controlled randomized
      design. Two hundred and fifty daily (≥ 10 cigarettes/day) smokers will be randomized to one
      of three conditions: 1) standard cognitive-behavioural smoking cessation treatment (n=100);
      2) standard cognitive-behavioural smoking cessation treatment plus behavioural activation
      (n=100); or 3) a control group of three months delayed treatment (n=50). Both active
      treatments will be administered in eight weekly 60 minute sessions. The primary outcomes will
      be carbon monoxide (CO) verified at 24-hours point prevalence abstinence at the end of the
      treatment, a 7-day point prevalence abstinence at 3 months follow-up, a 30-days point
      prevalence abstinence at 6-, and 12-months follow-ups; and depressive symptomatology through
      BDI-II and Hamilton Depression Rating Scale scores at the end of treatment, and at 3-, 6-,
      and 12-months follow-ups. Additional aims include assessing others activation-related
      variables, craving, self-efficacy and withdrawal syndrome. This randomized controlled trial
      will be the first trial of Behavioural Activation and Smoking Cessation psychological
      treatment in a Spanish sample of seeking treatment smokers.

    <description>Standard cognitive-behavioural smoking cessation treatment is an effective treatment for tobacco dependence. The treatment elements are: treatment contract, self-report and graphic representation of cigarette consumption, information about tobacco, stimulus control, activities for the avoidance of withdrawal syndrome, physiological feedback (CO in expired air) on cigarette consumption, nicotine fading (change of cigarette brands each week progressively decreasing the intake of nicotine and tar), and relapse-prevention strategies (assertion training, problem solving training, change tobacco related misconceptions, management of anxiety and anger, exercise, weight control, self-reinforcing, and changing irrational beliefs).
Treatment will be delivered in eight 60-minute sessions over 8 consecutive weeks.</description>

    <description>Behavioural activation will be applied along with standard cognitive-behavioural smoking cessation treatment. The treatment elements are: those present in the standard cognitive-behavioural smoking cessation treatment, plus analysis of the relationship between behaviour and mood, identification of situations and behaviours that decrease mood, identifying avoidance behaviours, and identifying thoughts of rumination and worry, self-report of pleasant daily activities, pleasant activity scheduling to increase engagement in rewarding activities, and to reduce patterns of behavioural avoidance.
Treatment will be delivered in eight 60-minute sessions over 8 consecutive weeks.</description>
