  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This prospective monocentric open label trial was realized in the Laboratory of Clinical
      Functional Exploration of Movement at the University Hospital of Besancon. Cognitive
      evaluations: 7 days before fampridine treatment initiation (Pre 1), on the day of fampridine
      treatment initiation (Pre 2), 14 and 21 days after fampridine treatment initiation,
      respectively Post 1 and Post 2. Gait evaluations were assessed at Pre 1, Pre 2 and Post 1.

      Fampridine was prescribed according to guidelines issued by the French Health Products Safety
      Agency at the dose of 10 mg twice daily. Fampridine is indicated for the improvement of
      walking in MS patients with a walking disability (EDSS 4-6.5). A walking test is recommended
      to evaluate improvement after 2 weeks of treatment. According to the practitioner evaluation
      between Pre 2 and Post 1 (i.e. before and after fampridine treatment), patients were
      classified into 2 groups: responders whose clinical status was improved and non-responders
      whose clinical status was not improved.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic neurological disorder affecting young and middle-aged
      adults with a female to male ratio of more than 3:1. The cause of MS is unknown although it
      involves genetic susceptibility and environmental exposure. Since there is no known cure for
      MS, the main goals of treatment is to delay progression of the disease and to improve
      health-related quality of life (HRQoL) by masking patients' symptoms. Among several symptoms
      of MS (e.g., motor and cognitive impairments, optic neuritis, fatigue, pain, urinary
      dysfunction), gait impairment, defined as an activity limitation by the International
      Classification of Functioning Disability and Health, is one of the most common and disabling
      dysfunction in Persons with Multiple Sclerosis PwMS. Studies have reported that approximately
      75 % of individuals with MS experience clinically significant walking disturbances. Likewise,
      fatigue, impairment of information-processing speed (IPS), attention, working memory and
      executive functions can occur in MS and can worsen during the evolution of the disease.

      Studies have shown that MS symptomatic treatment by fampridine (4-aminopyridine) is
      associated with improvements in walking and muscle strength and possibly with cognition,
      vision, fatigue and spasticity. Indeed, fampridine is a potassium channel blocker which
      reduces the leakage of ionic current through these channels, prolonging repolarization and
      thus, enhancing action-potential formation in demyelinated axons. Presumably, by enhancing
      action-potential formation, more impulses might be conducted in the central nervous system
      (CNS) and neurological functions could be ameliorated. In recent phase III studies, Goodman
      et al. investigated the fampridine effect on the walk of individuals with MS during a timed
      25-foot walk test (T25FW). Improvement in walking velocity (â‰ˆ25 % from baseline) was found
      for 35-43 % of the individuals in the interventional group.

      However, improvement in neuronal conduction induced by fampridine might not be limited to
      short distances of gait or even to motor functions and might also improve long distance
      ambulation or cognitive functions.

      Different assessments have been used for measuring gait impairments in multiple sclerosis,
      including the Timed 25-Foot Walk (T25FW), Six-Minute Walk Test (6MWT), spatio-temporal gait
      parameters measured with an instrumented walkway or the Timed Up and Go test (TUG). These
      different assessments can be performed at different conditions: simple task, fast speed or
      dual task. In this last case, the gait is associated with a cognitive or another motor task.
      For cognitive assessments, Symbol Digit Modalities Test (SDMT) and verbal fluencies have been
      used in previous studies.

      The aimed of the study was to evaluate the impact of fampridine in gait evaluating by long
      distance tests and to evaluate the impact of fampridine in fatigue and cognition.

      Assessments of patients were performed 7 days before fampridine treatment initiation (Pre 1),
      on the day of fampridine treatment initiation (Pre 2), 14 and 21 days after fampridine
      treatment initiation, respectively Post 1 and Post 2. Gait evaluations were assessed at Pre
      1, Pre 2 and Post 1. The first two assessments were intended to evaluate the variability of
      measurement without any treatment. A measurement of activity was performed by accelerometer
      during the period covering the first two assessments. The third assessment was intend to
      measure clinical improvements. The fourth seeks to show a potentially delayed action of
      fampridine on cognition.

    <description>The 6MWT assessed the submaximal level of functional capacity. It was realized according to the recommendation of the American Thoracic Society. 6MWT instructions were read prior to each walk. Participants used his/her typical assistive device and walked around a circuit with 24-meters longer. If necessary, they were allowed to have a rest period and encouragement phrases were used each 30 seconds.</description>

    <description>Both semantic and phonological verbal fluencies were assessed in a quiet room. Semantic fluency was measured by asking patients to provide as many animal names as possible in 120 s. Different kinds of one sort of animal were accepted (e.g. kinds of birds or fish). Phonological fluency was measured by asking patients to provide as many words as possible beginning with the letter 'P' in 120 s. They were informed that proper nouns and words with the same stem would not be counted (e.g. pen, pencil). Patients were instructed to avoid repetitions.</description>

The EMIF-SEP is composed of 40 items organized into four dimensions (cognitive, physical, social role and psychological dimensions) with each items rated on a four point scale (4=it's always true, 3=it's sometimes true, 2=it's sometimes false, 1=it's always false) and the total fatigue scores are standardized from 0 (meaning no fatigue) to 100 (meaning high degree of fatigue). The forty items are divided into the four dimensions: cognitive (10 items), physical (14 items), social role (13 items) and psychological (4 items). Each dimension score was also standardized as a percentage like total score.</description>

The FSS is designed to differentiate fatigue from clinical depression because both share some of the same symptoms.

Patients are asked to rate their level of agreement (toward 7) or disagreement (toward 0) with the 9 statements.</description>

    <measure>Timed Up and Go test (TUG)</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1</time_frame>
    <description>The TUG is a clinical test to assess the level of gait and balance. For its realization, a 47-cm-high chair with arm- and backrest was used. The 3-meters distance was marked with a tape on the floor and a cone marked the turning point. Participants were instructed to get up from the chair, walk 3 meters, turn around the cone and come back to sit on the chair. Participants were encouraged to walk as quickly as possible with safety consistency. After a familiarization trial, the TUG was performed twice. A third trial was applied if a difference of 10% was found between the two first trials. The mean value computed from the two closest trials was taken into account.</description>
