    <textblock>
      Skeletal muscle is the largest organ in the human body and has many important roles in
      determining our physical abilities and overall wellbeing. One major function of skeletal
      muscle is to carry out many daily tasks, such as rising from a chair or getting on a bus,
      tasks often referred to as functional abilities. During healthy ageing muscle size is reduced
      by approximately 0.5-2% a year (known as sarcopenia), with concurrent reductions in
      functional abilities. This can result in a reduction in quality of life and loss of
      independence, both of which are clearly not desirable. The incidence of sarcopenia is around
      20% between 50-70 years and around 50% in those over 80 years, with the absolute numbers and
      the average age of the population rising. One method through which muscle function can be
      enhanced and retard the progression of sarcopenia, across all age groups, is through
      exercise. The effectiveness of exercise will depend on a number of genetic and environmental
      factors, with nutritional intake being one of the most important and easily altered. Recent
      research has suggested that altering the type of fatty acids consumed may have a positive
      effect on muscle function. Little research is yet to be carried out in elderly humans. This
      is important as that findings from animal models are not definitively transferrable to
      humans. The main aim of the current proposal, therefore, is to investigate the effect the
      consumption of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), long chain
      polyunsaturated fatty acids found in oily fish, on the response to a resistance training
      programme in the elderly. A further aim is to determine the mechanisms which result in these
      adaptive responses. The project will be centred round a large 18 week resistance
      training/nutritional (EPA/DHA) intervention with both males and females over the age of 65
      years. There are three main research questions and experiments stemming from this
      intervention. 1) Does the consumption of EPA and DHA result in a greater increase in
      strength, power and functional abilities in response to resistance training? To answer this
      question a series of measures of muscular performance and functional abilities will be
      assessed. 2) Does the consumption of EPA and DHA increase the size and quality of muscles,
      reduce the amount of fat found within the muscle and decrease inflammation? To address this
      question the participants will have MRI images of their muscles and blood samples taken
      before and after the intervention. This will allow the calculation of muscle mass/fat content
      and circulating levels of inflammatory markers. 3) Does the consumption of EPA and DHA
      enhance the activity of the molecules involved in controlling muscle mass after a single bout
      of resistance exercise? For this question muscle samples will be obtained before and after a
      single training session and measure changes in molecules previously identified as important
      in the changes in muscle mass in response to exercise. A fourth aim running throughout the
      proposal is 4) Do males and females respond differently to the combination of EPA/DHA and
      resistance exercise? Differences in protein metabolism have previously been noted between
      genders and yet the investigation of these differences is often overlooked. The investigators
      will investigate this by studying responses in groups of males and females. In summary, the
      aim of the proposed project is to test the hypothesis that the consumption of fatty acids
      found in oily fish will improve the response of an elderly population to a resistance
      training intervention. The major outcome of the proposal would be in establishing a
      beneficial effect of fish oil on muscular adaptation in the elderly, opening up a widely
      available therapeutic strategy for an improvement in the quality of life in the elderly
      population. Such strategies are of particular importance due to the increasing age of the UK
      population.
