  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an international, prospective, multicenter and randomized phase III study designed to
      determine if patients with locally advanced cervical cancer have longer overall survivals
      with pretherapeutic paraaortic surgical staging when compared to radiologic staging.

      All eligible patients will be equally randomized between the 2 following treatment groups:

        -  Standard of care arm: standard chemoradiation (whole pelvis chemoradiation therapy).

        -  Experimental arm: pretherapeutic paraaortic lymphadenectomy followed by tailored
           chemoradiation. Pretherapeutic lymphadenectomy will be performed via the laparoscopic
           extraperitoneal or transperitoneal approach using either traditional laparoscopy or
           robotically-assisted laparoscopy.

      The surgery (extraperitoneal or transperitoneal laparoscopic lymphadenectomy) is considered
      investigational.

      Chemoradiation treatment (with either pelvis or tailored radiation) is considered as standard
      treatment approved in France for the treatment of cervical cancer.

    <description>A Positon Emission Tomography (PET) scan will be obtained at 3 months after completion of chemoradiation therapy. CT scans will be obtained every 6 months for the next three years thereafter. Follow-up surveillance of patients will consist of serial clinical examinations by an oncologist every 3 months for the first 2 years, every 6 months for the next 3 years; then, patients will be followed annually only for collection of their survival data. Patients will come off study at 5 years after completion of initial chemoradiation therapy or at time of death.</description>

    <description>Patients with negative paraaortic lymph nodes will be managed with external beam radiotherapy to the pelvis (as defined by the surgical clips applied at the lower limit of the paraaortic node dissection) at a usual dose of 45 Gy. Limited boosts will be indicated individually on clinically involved parametria or pelvic nodes. The external beam radiation therapy will be followed by intracavitary brachytherapy (High Dose Rate (DR), Low DR or Pulse DR) with intent to cure.
Patients with metastatic disease to paraaortic lymph nodes will receive extended-field external beam radiotherapy followed by intracavitary brachytherapy with intent to cure. Patients who complete both external beam radiation and intracavitary radiotherapy will receive a total dose of 80-90 Gy low-dose equivalent to Point A.
Concurrent platinum-based chemotherapy (in the 2 sub groups above) will be given with definitive radiation therapy.</description>
