      The main purpose of this study is to assess the safety and tolerability and to determine the
      recommended phase 2 dose of S 95005 given in combination with oxaliplatin in patients with
      metastatic colorectal cancer.

      This is a one-arm study, which will be conducted in 2 parts:

        -  A dose-escalation part to determine the Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) of S 95005 in
           combination with oxaliplatin.

        -  An expansion part in patients treated at the recommended dose defined in the dose
           escalation part of this study to evaluate the safety, PK, and preliminary efficacy of S
           95005 in combination with oxaliplatin and either bevacizumab or nivolumab.
