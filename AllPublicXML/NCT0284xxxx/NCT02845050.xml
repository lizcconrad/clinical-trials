          3. Histologically confirmed muscle-invasive urothelial cell carcinoma of the bladder
             (MIBC) with clinical T2-T4a (N0/Nx, M0) assessed by primary PDD-guided TUR-B and by
             the screening imaging (MRI pelvis and CT chest/abdomen) which both must include the
             use of contrast medium

          4. Confirmed adequate complete resection of all visible tumor during TUR-B according to
             current treatment guidelines before registration; the latest TUR-B must have been done

               -  Hemoglobin ≥ 12 g/dL for the safety phase of the study; if the study treatment
                  proved to be adequate tolerated during this safety phase, the threshold can be
                  lowered to ≥ 10 g/dL according to the decision of the study steering committee

               -  Platelet count ≥ 100,000 mm3

               -  Serum albumin within normal range

          7. Absence of psychological, familial, sociological or geographical condition potentially
             hampering compliance with the study protocol and follow-up schedule; these conditions
             should be assessed with the patient before registration

          8. Electrocardiogram (ECG) without modifications that suggest a high risk of occurrence
             of an acute clinical event (such as signs of angina pectoris or high-risk arrhythmia,

             in the screening ECG-assessment

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Prior systemic chemotherapy for any kind of malignancy; prior intravesical
             chemotherapy or treatment with BCG is allowed

          3. Evidence of lymph node (N+) or distant metastasis (M1) in the screening imaging
             assessment, including known brain metastases or leptomeningeal involvement (however,

          6. Peripheral neuropathy Grade ≥ 2 NCI CTCAE v4.03 or hearing impairment Grade ≥ 2 NCI
             CTCAE v.4.03

          7. Any concurrent chronic system immune therapy or previous organ allograft

          8. Weight loss &gt; 5 % within the last 3 months before registration

          9. Any other serious illness or medical condition including:

               -  Infection requiring systemic anti-infective therapy within the last 2 weeks
                  before registration

             control from day of informed consent and for up to 6 months after the last cycle of
             chemotherapy, if their partners are women of child-bearing potential (if cystectomy is
             not performed) effective birth control means the use of condoms ideally combined with
             any acceptable contraception of the male patient's partner as described in exclusion
