  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The incidence of preterm birth increases annually. Premature delivery has become the leading
      cause of neonatal illness and death. For the survived premature babies, the incidence of
      sequelae is also higher than the full-term babies, which brings a heavy burden to a family
      and society. Preterm birth has become the important factor affecting the quality of births.
      The occurrence of premature birth is the outcome of combined action of genetic and
      environmental factors. However, its etiology is not clear. Recent studies have shown that the
      risk of preterm birth is associated with dietary factors. Choline is an essential nutrient
      for human health and it plays an important role in the growth and development of fetuses and
      neonates. The investigators previously found that serum levels of free choline in preterm
      mothers were lower than those in normal mothers with full-term birth. Serum levels of free
      choline also reduced in preterms after receiving parenteral nutrition (PN). However, the
      relationships between choline and preterm birth is not clear. Therefore, this study is aimed
      to explore the effect of choline intake during pregnancy and genetic polymorphisms on the
      risk of preterm birth and on the clinical outcomes in preterms receiving total PN therapy.
      Healthy Chinese pregnant women with their healthy term infants will be recruited as the
      control group, while Chinese women with preterm delivery and their preterm infants will be
      recruited as the preterm group. Dietary choline intake during pregnancy will be evaluated by
      semi-quantitative food frequency questionnaire and 24-h dietary recall questionnaire. Gene
      polymorphisms in the key enzymes of choline metabolism will be identified among the
      participated women and neonates through Real-time polymerase chain reaction. Choline and its
      related metabolites will be assayed using high performance liquid chromatography combined
      with mass spectrometry among all mothers and preterms before and after 7-days PN treatment.
      The influence of genetic risk factors and metabolic changes of choline on the physical and
      mental development of preterms will be evaluated. The results of this study will contribute
      to a comprehensive understanding of the role of choline and the relative gene polymorphisms
      on the risk of preterm birth, which will be helpful for estimating the high risk in advance.
      The results will also provide the scientific evidences to establish the personalized amount
      of choline intake among women and infants, optimize nutrition support for pregnant women and
      preterms, and promote better prenatal and postnatal care.
