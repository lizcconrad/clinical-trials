    <textblock>
      This pilot study aims to investigate whether a treatment called cranial electric stimulation
      or CES can decrease risk factors for suicide. The specific CES device we will use is called
      Alpha-Stim®. CES will be used in addition to usual treatment (medication and group therapy).

    <textblock>
      Suicide is still a major issue in the United States and all around the world. There are many
      reasons for people attempting suicide and the major modifiable risk factors are depression,
      anxiety, insomnia, and agitation. The standard treatment for all suicidal patients includes
      medication, admission to a hospital and reducing the risk factors. Medications have potential
      side effects and concerns about the drug interactions. One of the biological treatment
      alternatives to medication is cranial electric stimulation. This technique uses a device to
      stimulate the brain through electrical current. Using an Alpha-Stim® device, current is
      applied to the brain using skin electrodes which can be easily clipped on to the earlobe. The
      amount of current used is very low and is 1/1000 th of the current used for electroconvulsive
      therapy (ECT) and 1/10 th to 1/20 th of the 1-2 milliamperes used with transcranial direct
      current stimulation (tDCS). Our goal is to examine the safety and efficacy of this device
      when used as an add-on or adjunctive treatment to the usual treatments during the inpatient
      stay.

    <criteria>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Subject must be a patient admitted voluntarily to the UMMC adult psychiatric inpatient
             services with suicidal thoughts / intent / plan or suicide attempt who also has MSRFs
             including anxiety, agitation, insomnia, and/or depression).

          2. Subject must be between the ages of 18 and 65 (inclusive). Both men and women will be
             included

          3. Subjects who are female must have a negative pregnancy test prior to enrolling in the

             contraception during the study: intrauterine device (IUD), barrier method in
             combination with a spermicide, or oral/hormonal contraception or abstinence, which is
             typically the case on the inpatient units.

          4. If a subject has a substance abuse disorder, they must also have another non-substance
             abuse psychiatric disorder as determined from the clinical history.

          5. Chronic medical conditions such as endocrine disease, hypertension, renal disease,
             must be stable.

          6. Subject must be capable of giving informed consent. Subject must provide written
             informed consent prior to study participation.

          7. Subject must be capable of doing active or sham CES treatments and completing all
             study requirements.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Subject has a significant medical disorder with acute symptoms which could impair
             reliable participation in the trial or affect their MSRFs.

          2. Subject is pregnant.

          3. Subject has had concomitant therapy with another investigational drug, or
             participation in an investigational drug study within one month prior to entering this
             study.

          4. Subject has a clinical history of poor compliance or in the investigator's judgment
             participation in the study would be clinically contraindicated.

          5. Subject has current or past behavior that suggests to the investigator that his/her
             suicidal behavior is driven by secondary gain, i.e. expressing suicidal thoughts so
             that s/he can be admitted due to homelessness.
