      The purpose of this study is to determine whether the left lateral tilt-down position, which
      includes procedures that involve placing patients on their left lateral side at an angle to
      make their heads lower than their feet, is more beneficial than the left lateral horizontal
      body position (patient horizontally laying on their left side, traditionally used for
      colonoscopies) to decrease descending colon insertion time, the difficulty of colonoscopy
      procedure and patients' pain.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Supine with tilt-down position (trendelenburg position) is used in abdominal and
      gynecological surgery to allow better access to the pelvic organs, as gravity pulls the bowel
      out of the pelvic cavity and the rectosigmoid angle straightens, which may also be favorable
      for colonoscopy insertion. However, few published studies have explored the value of
      tilt-down position in the colonoscopy (left lateral horizontal body position are usually
      used) and there is consequently little evidence to support left lateral tilt-down position or
      left lateral horizontal body position. So the investigators perform a randomized controlled
      trial of left lateral tilt-down position versus left lateral horizontal position for
      colonoscopy to investigate the safety and efficacy of lateral tilt-down position.
