      This is a prospective, single arm, &quot;roll-in&quot; study of esmolol infusion for patients with
      septic shock with persistent tachycardia after adequate intravenous volume expansion. The
      study will evaluate the adequacy and efficiency of study protocols for the anticipated, main
      ECASSS study, which will have a separate entry in clinicaltrials.gov.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      To evaluate the adequacy and efficiency of study protocols for the anticipated, randomized,
      controlled ECASSS study. The primary clinical outcome is organ-failure free days at 28 days,
      with multiple secondary outcomes, including those relevant to function of and compliance with
      the study protocols.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Age ≥ 18 years

          2. Within 48 hours of admission to the ICU and septic shock (sepsis present at time of
             admission)

             a. Septic shock defined by consensus criteria as i. At least two systemic inflammatory
             response syndrome (SIRS) criteria ii. Suspected or documented infection iii. Receiving
             vasopressors to treat hypotension after at least 20 ml/kg intravenous crystalloid
             volume expansion

          3. Receiving vasopressors through a central venous catheter for more than 60 minutes.

          4. Arterial catheter in place or expected to be placed imminently.

          5. Heart rate &gt; 90/min while receiving vasopressors for more than 60 minutes.

          6. Adequately volume expanded, as manifest by any of the following, performed as part of
             routine clinical care (i.e., no study procedures will be performed before signed
             consent). If none of these measures are clinically available, the clinical attending
             must confirm that volume expansion is adequate. (After enrollment, a final safety
             check will confirm the adequacy of volume expansion.)

               1. Central venous pressure (CVP) &gt; 15 mm Hg.

               2. Negative Passive-Leg Raise (PLR) maneuver (&lt;10% increase in cardiac output after
                  PLR).

               3. No cardiac output response (&lt;10% increase) after rapid infusion (&lt;5 min) of 250
                  ml of IV crystalloid, i.e., a graded volume expansion challenge (GVEC).

               4. For patients who happen to be breathing passively on a positive pressure
                  mechanical ventilator delivering at least 8 ml/kg tidal volumes and in normal
                  sinus rhythm, stroke volume variability &lt;10% (such patients are acknowledged to
                  be uncommon; the protocol does not recommend or require the induction of passive
                  breathing).

         14. Cardiogenic shock, as defined by any of the following

               -  Cardiac index ≤ 2 L/min/m2

         19. Cardiovascular collapse (failure to achieve MAP of 65mmHg)

         20. Cardiac arrest within 24 hours

         21. Worse than moderate aortic stenosis
