    <textblock>
      This is a study protocol for the UK ROPE Register for Lower Urinary Tract Symptoms (LUTS).
      This register enables us to collect data on the treatment of LUTS using prostate artery
      embolisation (PAE), and other surgical methods to answer the following questions posed by
      NICE in 2013:

        -  Is PAE a safe and effective treatment option for LUTS caused by prostate enlargement?

        -  How does PAE compare with conventional surgical treatments? This will primarily be a
           surgical procedure called TURP (see below).

        -  Which patients would most benefit from PAE over the other treatment options? This is a
           pilot study, and the final register will contain data from roughly 100 patients for PAE
           and 100 patients for the other surgical interventions, allowing us to answer NICE's
           research questions, update NICE guidance documentation, and do further research with
           more patients if necessary.

      Our hypothesis is:

      • PAE produces significant improvements in the IPSS score 12 months post-procedure
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a pilot study, intended to collect observational data on the PAE procedure as it is
      disseminated and performed around the UK, and on other comparator interventions. The aim is
      to give NICE enough information to potentially update their Interventional Procedures
      Guidance and may form the grounding for further research in the shape of a larger randomised
      clinical trial.

      The ROPE Register project aims are to:

      Primary:

      • Assess the efficacy of PAE using the IPSS for LUTS BPE 12 months post-procedure.

      Secondary:

        -  Compare PAE to TURP (using IPSS score) for LUTS BPE 12 months post-procedure. This will
           be a non-inferiority study for PAE versus TURP. A non-inferiority approach has been
           chosen because if PAE is no worse in terms of outcome for the patient, but is a more
           acceptable procedure to the patient (or has fewer complications, is less invasive, etc)
           than TURP, then PAE would be preferable.

        -  Use descriptive statistics for other outcome measures (IPSS, IPSS QoL, IIEF, prostate
           volume and urinary flow studies) for other comparator interventions (not TURP), 12
           months post-procedure.

        -  Identify complications arising from PAE up to 12 months post-procedure.

        -  Elucidate which subgroup (s) of patients would benefit the most from PAE as a treatment
           option.

      Our hypothesis is:

      • PAE produces significant improvements in the IPSS score 12 months post-procedure

      Additional subgroup analyses:

      Other areas of interest from this research are covered in the subgroup analyses. The tables
      below detail the PAE patient subgroups that will be analysed. These subgroups will be
      cross-analysed with the measures in the Outcome measures table. This will enable trends to be
      noted in particular subgroups, which may inform future research.

      Subgroups:

      Age Baseline IPSS score Baseline Prostate Volume

      Outcome measures:

      IPSS Score IPSS Quality of Life Score IIEF score Prostate Volume Urinary flow study (Qmax,
      post-void residual volume, duration of micturition)

    <intervention_name>Prostatic Artery Embolisation</intervention_name>
    <description>The aim of PAE for LUTS (due to BPH) is to reduce the blood supply of the prostate gland, causing some of it to undergo necrosis with subsequent shrinkage.
The procedure is usually performed with the patient under local anaesthetic and sedation. Using a percutaneous transfemoral approach, super-selective catheterisation of small prostatic arteries is carried out using microcatheters. Embolisation involves the introduction of microparticles to block these small prostatic arteries. Embolisation agents include polyvinyl alcohol (PVA), gelatine sponge and other synthetic biocompatible materials.
NICE published Interventional Procedures Guidance (IPG453) in April 2013. The evidence at the time of assessment was deemed inadequate in quantity and quality. Therefore, the procedure was given a 'Research-only' recommendation.</description>

    <intervention_name>TURP</intervention_name>
    <description>Transurethral resection of the prostate. A cystoscope is passed up the urethra to the prostate, where the surrounding prostate tissue is excised. This is a common operation for benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), with around 15,000 procedures performed in the UK per year (NHS Choices). The conventional TURP method of tissue removal utilizes a wire loop with electrical current flowing in one direction (monopolar) through the resectoscope to cut the tissue. Bipolar TURP allows saline irrigation and eliminates the need for an ESU grounding pad thus preventing TUR syndrome and reducing other complications.</description>

    <intervention_name>Laser prostate surgery</intervention_name>
    <description>This surgical method (HoLEP or KTP/&quot;Greenlight&quot;) utilizes laser energy to remove tissue. With laser prostate surgery a laser fibre inserted via an endoscope is used to transmit laser energy to enucleate (HoLEP) or vaporise (KTP) the tissue. The specific advantages of utilizing laser energy rather than a traditional electrosurgical TURP is a decrease in the relative blood loss, elimination of the risk of TUR syndrome, the ability to treat larger glands, as well as treating patients who are actively being treated with anti-coagulation therapy for unrelated diagnoses.</description>
