      The purpose of this study is to collect development and outcome data on human embryos which
      are cultured in a 2nd generation continuous single culture medium (CSCM2) with the objective
      to demonstrate its performance efficacy in comparison to existing commercially available
      single culture or continuous embryo culture media.

      A multi-center (3 sites and 2 investigators), prospective trial with up to 300 patients.
      Patients will be enrolled from participating sites from the United States. Study sites will
      conduct this study under the oversight of Sterling IRB. Each study site should enroll enough
      patients to achieve at least 50 evaluable patients that have undergone a treatment cycle
      using split case sibling embryos in which half of the embryos are cultured in CSCM2 and the
      other half in current CSCM (as control).

      The methods will consist of standard ovarian stimulation protocols at each facility to obtain
      a sufficient number of mature (MII) oocytes for fertilization by ICSI. Following
      fertilization, identified diploid (2PN) zygotes will be evenly divided and randomly allocated
      to the embryo culture treatment conditions of CSCM2 or CSCM and cultured according to
      standard laboratory procedure (incubated in 5-6% CO2 in air or low O2 concentrations of 5-6%)
      to the blastocyst stage (Day 5/6 or 7). Top quality blastocyst(s) will be transferred and
      monitored for implantation, pregnancy and ongoing birth. Embryo transfers will either occur
      in a fresh or frozen cycle.

      The procedures in this study are designed to follow the standard medical care at each study
      site for women having IVF treatment (the participant will sign a separate consent at your
      clinic for your IVF procedures). The participants study doctor will explain in detail the
      procedures participants will undergo at the clinic; this form is only meant to explain the
      details of the research study. This study does not involve randomization of patient
      participation or any sham procedures.
