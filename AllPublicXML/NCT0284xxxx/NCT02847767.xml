  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The high dose per fraction (&gt;10Gy/fraction) used in Stereotactic Ablative Body Radiotherapy
      (SABR) has been shown to be more effective at local tumor control than treatments employing
      more conventional dose fractions. The mechanisms for this are currently under debate. One
      possible mechanism for this increased effectiveness is that high dose/fraction causes
      significant vascular damage to the tumor. This study hopes to measure vascular integrity pre
      and post SABR treatment using kinetic models obtained from dynamic contrast enhanced CT.

      Purpose:

      The purpose of this study is to determine if high dose per fraction SABR has an impact on the
      vasculature of both the tumor and of healthy liver tissue.

      Hypothesis:

      High dose / fraction in HCC patients with tumours &lt; 5 cm will result in detectable changes to
      kinetic model parameters derived from dynamic contrast enhanced images.

      Objectives:

      Primary objective:

      To quantify changes in tumor vascular support for patients receiving SABR.

      Secondary objectives:

      To investigate the correlation between PK derived model liver perfusion parameters and QoL
      metrics as measured by EORTC QLQ-C30 and FACT-Hep QoL assessments.

      Research Methods:

      Target population are patients receiving liver SABR for no more than 2 discrete liver tumors
      with a maximum dimension &lt;5cm.

      Perfusion CT Image Data Post Processing and Analysis. Patient motion will be corrected using
      deformable registration, fiducial tracking, and RPM breathing traces. Organ ROIs will be
      added to the perfusion image series by manually translating anatomical planning CT ROIs to
      the motion-corrected perfusion image series, or by algorithmically deforming planning ROIs.
      Portal vein and abdominal aorta ROIs will be demarcated.

      Analysis will proceed via custom software we have built during related projects. Contrast
      enhancement time courses will be generated for key structures (i.e., abdominal aorta, portal
      vein, and gross liver tissues) and used to derive a variety of perfusion map images, such as
      liver perfusion, mean transit time, arterial fraction, and distribution volume. A distributed
      parameter model will be preferred for kinetic modeling. Supplementary non-parametric
      techniques will be used for other parameters of interest (e.g., IAUC, maximum slope).

      Images acquired before and after treatment will be registered so that parameter maps can be
      compared on a per-patient basis. Changes in perfusion parameters will be characterized with
      special emphasis placed on regional structure and clustering effects. Pre and post parameter
      maps will be computed near individual-voxel level. Regions of interest (1) within or near
      tumour and (2) at a low-dose portion of liver will be defined. A distribution of parameters
      within each ROI will be used to generate estimates of the mean parameters and uncertainty.
      Estimates of mean parameters and whole distributions will be compared using standard
      statistical comparisons (t-test and Whitney respectively).

      Quality of Life We will evaluate quality of life (QOL) in HCC patients treated with SBRT
      using EORTC QLQ-C30 and FACT-Hep QOL assessments at baseline, 3, 6, 9 and 12 months.
      Correlation between perfusion parameter changes and patient outcomes or QOL (second-order
      analysis) will be applied if statistically significant first-order parameter changes can be
      detected. Standard correlative measures such as the Pearson product-moment correlation
      measure will be used to assess statistical significance. As there is currently no data
      relating liver perfusion to toxicity or quality of life, this study will examine whether a
      change in liver perfusion is correlated with enhanced or reduced QOL.

        All the following criteria must be met:

          1. Age &gt; 18 years old

          2. Multi-phase CT scan and/or MRI of the liver within 8 weeks of radiation planning
             demonstrating:

               -  Liver tumours &lt; 5 cm

               -  No more than 2 discrete liver tumours

               -  Normal liver &gt; 700 cc

          3. Patients must have HCC diagnosed by either: i) pathological confirmation, or ii)
             intrahepatic vascular enhancement of the lesion demonstrated by at least two imaging
             modalities, or iii) intrahepatic vascular enhancement of the lesion demonstrated by
             one imaging modality if AFP &gt; 200 in the setting of liver cirrhosis or chronic
             hepatitis B without cirrhosis (EASL consensus guidelines [2])

          4. Liver HCC must be deemed unresectable as determined by an experienced hepatobiliary
             surgeon, or the patient must be medically inoperable or refuse surgery,

          5. Patients must be discussed in a multidisciplinary setting, with representatives from
             Medical Oncology, Radiation Oncology, Surgery, Interventional Radiology, and
             Hepatology. Patients must be considered ineligible for standard local treatments,
             including surgery, liver transplantation, radiofrequency ablation, and targeted
             biologics. Some subjects could be potential candidates for sorafenib but normally this
             treatment is not considered before all local treatment options have been considered,
             as the response rate to sorafenib is low (2% in the SHARP study). Patients might be
             candidates for sorafenib after progression on the study treatment or if they do not
             want to participate and in both cases they will be referred to a medical oncologist.
             Patients may have received prior TACE and had an incomplete response. Ineffective or
             incomplete TACE is defined as incomplete filling by lipiodol-doxorubicin mixture used
             by either angiography or CT â‰¥1 month after TACE or by increasing alpha-fetoprotein
             level. Patients must have recovered from the effects of previous therapies before SBRT
             with a minimum 4-week period between TACE and SBRT.

          6. Eastern Clinical Oncology Group performance status 0, 1, or 2 (Appendix III), or a
             Karnofsky performance status of â‰¥ 60 (Appendix IV)

               -  Albumin above 28 g/L

               -  INR &lt; 1.7 and/or correctable with vitamin K (unless on anticoagulation therapy)

               -  No ascites or encephalopathy

               -  Child-Turcotte-Pugh score must be â‰¤ 7

          9. BCLC Stage B or C (portal venous invasion or liver hilum nodal disease only; (Appendix
             I)

             ethanol injection, or chemotherapy are not exclusion criteria provided that recurrence
             or lack of tumour response has been documented. Patients who decline, or not eligible
             for, these treatments will also be considered eligible.

         13. Patient signs a study-specific informed consent form. If the patient's mental status
             precludes this, written informed consent may be given by the patient's legal
             representative. A translator will be provided if the patient has a language barrier.

         14. Treatment plans meet acceptable dose constraints and Liver Veff is â‰¤ 0.55
