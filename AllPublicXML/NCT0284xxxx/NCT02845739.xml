      The main goal of project is to study the distribution of HPV genotypes in the anogenital area
      and peripheral humoral immune responses HPV (total and neutralizing Ab) before and after
      renal transplantation. Furthermore, the investigators wish (i) establish whether there is a
      correlation between HPV infection and HPV immune response before and after transplantation,
      and (ii) determine whether there is a link between HPV infection and immunosuppression.

      Kidney transplant patients, iatrogenic immunosuppression established, essential to limit the
      transplant. Kidney transplant patients, iatrogenic immunosuppression established, essential
      to limit the transplant rejection, exposes patients to an increased risk of infections,
      including human papillomavirus (HPV).

      These patients thus constitute a population at risk of developing cancers associated with
      HPV. Indeed, a recent meta-analysis indicated that the standardized incidence ratio for
      cancers associated with HPV increases dramatically in kidney transplant: SIR of 2.13 (95% CI
      1.37 to 3.30) for the cervical, RIS 22.76 (95% CI 15.8 to 32.7) for the vulva and vagina, RIS
      15.8 (95% CI 5.79 to 34.40) for the penis, RIS 4.85 (95% CI 1.36 to 17.3) and RIS to the anus
      of 3.23 (95% CI 2.40 to 4.35) for the oral cavity and pharynx. In fact, transplant patients
      are subject to increased surveillance to detect the onset and / or progression of lesions
      (pre) cancerous, especially anogenital level. Data on HPV infection in the genital area of
      kidney transplant patients are few and concern cohorts with a modest number of subjects.
      Indeed, it is difficult to estimate the prevalence of infection and know precisely genotypes
      of HPV present in anogenital level. Similarly, some studies report the presence of anti-HPV
      antibodies in transplant patients.

      The main goal of project is to study the distribution of HPV genotypes in the anogenital area
      and peripheral humoral immune responses HPV (total and neutralizing Ab) before and after
      renal transplantation. Furthermore, the investigators wish (i) establish whether there is a
      correlation between HPV infection and HPV immune response before and after transplantation,
      and (ii) determine whether there is a link between HPV infection and immunosuppression.

    <description>For woman, gynecologist perform cervical and anal samples with DNA pap cervical sampler.
For men, dermatologist perform penis and anal samples with same device. The sample with perform when the patient are registered to waiting list for transplant and 3 months and one year after transplantation.
The samples are genotyped using the kit INNO-LiPA HPV Genotyping Extra test (Innogenetics) which allows the detection of 28 HPV types.</description>
