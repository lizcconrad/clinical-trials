  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim was to conduct a non-blinded prospective randomized study at a tertiary hospital.
      Inclusion criteria: term pregnancy with a single fetus in cephalic presentation, Bishop score
      &lt; 6, gestational age &gt; 41 weeks or medical indication for induction of labor.

      Patients will be randomized to outpatient or inpatient cervix priming with Foley catheter.

      The primary outcome will be to compare the variation of Bishop score (difference between
      Bishop score before and after application of Foley catheter) between outpatient and inpatient
      groups. Secondary comparisons include: mode of delivery, Foley catheter
      application-to-delivery time, inpatient time, sequential use of prostaglandins, infection and
      maternal pain.

    <description>Patients randomized to outpatient cervix priming will have the insertion of the catheter in the same conditions defined by the Department protocol for inpatient cervix priming. They will be discharged after a reassuring cardiotocogram following the introduction of the Foley catheter. When discharged, the patients will be instructed to apply manual traction to the catheter every 6 hours and they will be given a written document with all the information that should bring them back to hospital.</description>

    <description>The introduction of a deflated catheter (Foley catheter nº 16F) through the outer cervix orifice is preceded by iodine disinfection of the cervix. The intracervical catheter is distended with 40mL of a saline solution. The end of the catheter is taped to the medial portion of the thigh and manual traction is applied to the catheter every 6 hours. If it is not spontaneously extruded it is removed after 24h. Cervix priming occurs in an inpatient setting.</description>
