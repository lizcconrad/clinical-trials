  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Intracranial aneurysm (IA) is an asymptomatic cerebrovascular abnormality affecting 3.2% of
      the general population. The devastating complication of IA is its rupture, resulting in
      subarachnoid haemorrhage that can lead to severe disability and death.

      Unfortunately, there are neither reliable clues nor diagnostic tools to predict the formation
      and/or the fate of an IA in a given individual. Also, there is no pharmacological drug
      available to prevent the rupture of aneurysm and subsequent subarachnoid haemorrhage. Current
      treatments are invasive with a significant risk of procedural morbidity. Thus, still now, the
      management of patients with IA remains extremely challenging and still controversial.

      Although the pathogenesis of IA has been the subject of many studies for the last decade, the
      mechanisms underlying IA formation, growth and rupture are still mostly unknown and relevant
      animal models of IA are not available.

      Familial history of IA predisposes to IA formation and rupture and increasing evidence
      suggest a genetic component of IA formation, with heterogeneous modes of inheritance and
      penetrance.

      This project, gathering neuroradiologists, geneticists and vascular biologists, addresses the
      urgent need to understand the pathogenic mechanisms of IA to develop diagnostic and
      predictive tools of risk of IA.

      The investigators propose to identify IA-causing variants by whole-exome sequencing in
      familial forms of the disease.

      The investigators hypothesises that the functional analysis of the causal / susceptibility
      variants thus identified will provide clues to understanding the pathological mechanisms of
      IA formation, and the bases for developing diagnostic tools. This project aims at meeting
      this challenge. Based on preliminary data that already allowed to identify such a variant,
      and the combination of genetic and functional investigations, the specific objectives of this
      project are: - To identify IA-causing variants in familial forms of the disease by
      whole-exome sequencing; - To understand the function of these genes/ variants in the
      formation and rupture of IA by molecular and cellular approaches and generation of relevant
      animal models; - To discover potential biomarkers of risk of IA formation and/or rupture.

        The initial stage of this biocollection based on the recruitment of large families for
        genetic linkage analysis.

        In the first instance, we identify patients with intracranial aneurysms occurring in a
        family context, and to conduct a comprehensive investigation according to clinical
        guidelines in force to assess the potentially informative family and ensure their adherence
        to the prior biocollection. The next step consists on the fine and accurate phenotyping of
        each of the family members (imaging) and the collection of a blood sample for DNA
        extraction for molecular genetic analysis.

        The population recruited will be composed of index and their healthy relatives and cases
        with sporadic cases and IA. The kinship links will be established from family trees.
