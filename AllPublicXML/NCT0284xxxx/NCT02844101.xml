  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Eighty healthy youngsters, aged 10-18 years, will be equally randomized between the blinded
      and the non-blinded group. The blinded subjects will be informed that we were testing the
      reliability of a new device for body posture assessment and these youngsters will did not
      receive any information with regards to physical activity. Conversely, the non-blinded
      subjects were informed that the device was an accelerometer that assessed physical activity
      levels and patterns. Participants will be instructed to wear the accelerometer for 4
      consecutive days and to keep a non-wear log diary over the 4 day-monitoring. The overall
      duration and the duration relative to the quality of the physical activity patterns
      (sedentary, light, moderate, vigorous and moderate to vigorous) were computed for each group
      during the 4-day monitoring, then compared between the two groups using the Student's t test.
