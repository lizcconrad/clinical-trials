  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Photodynamic therapy (PDT), also known as photoradiation therapy, phototherapy, or
      photochemotherapy, involves the use of a photoactive dye (photosensitizer) that is activated
      by exposure to light of a specific wavelength in the presence of oxygen. In recent years, PDT
      has been introduced as an important novel disinfection therapy in the field of implant
      dentistry. The inactivation of microorganisms using PDT has been defined as antimicrobial
      PDT. PDT has the potential to be an alternative of antibiotics, especially for the treatment
      of localized infections and oral biofilm. PDT is unlikely to cause bacterial-resistance and
      is equally effective against antibiotic-resistance and antibiotic-susceptible bacteria.

      Inconsistent results have been reported regarding the potential role of PDT as an adjunct to
      mechanical debridement in the management of peri-implant infection. Thus, the aim of the
      present trial is to investigate the treatment effect of non-surgical treatment with and
      without photodynamic therapy on initial peri-implantitis.

    <description>A PQW Williams probe (Hu-Friedy, Chicago Ill, USA)will be used to detect the peri-implant pocket. the percentage of bleeding on probing sites (BOP) will be recorded.</description>

    <measure>Change of Probing Pocket Depth</measure>
    <time_frame>From baseline to 12 months after treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Probing Pocket Depth at every site will be assessed as the distance from the gingival margin to the apical end of the pocket using a PQW Williams probe (Hu-Friedy, Chicago Ill, USA).</description>

    <measure>Change of modified plaque index</measure>
    <time_frame>From baseline to 12 months after treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Modified plaque index 0= No detection of plaque.
Plaque only recognized by running a probe across the smooth marginal surface of the implant. Implants covered by titanium spray in this area always score 1.
Plaque can be seen by the naked eye.
Abundance of soft matter.</description>

    <time_frame>From baseline to 12 months after treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Periapical radiographs will be taken at baseline, 3, 6, 9 and 12 month examination. The distance from implant shoulder to the most coronal level of implant-bone contact at the mesial and distal site will be recorded. The alteration of the distance between baseline and follow-up visit will be defined as marginal bone loss.</description>
