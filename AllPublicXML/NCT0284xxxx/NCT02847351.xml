      The study aimed to investigate whether an Arabinoxylan-enriched crackers consumption for 4
      weeks in overweight and obese patients without diabetes mellitus have specific healthy
      effects on glycemic control (reduction of homeostatic model assessment -HOMA index-).
      Furthermore, study evaluated the effects of Arabinoxylan on insulin, lipid and Ghrelin.

      The beneficial effects of soluble dietary fiber to health are well known: many studies show
      clearly that it delays the onset of cardiovascular disease and some cancers, and improves
      glycemic control in type 2 diabetes. (1,2). Overweight and obesity are known to be associated
      with increased rate of diabetes, hypertension and cardiovascular diseases, as well as to
      colon and breast cancer. The introduction of 25-30gr of dietary fiber daily would therefore
      indicated not only in type 2 diabetic subjects, but also in obese and overweight patients.
      Most of the foods commonly consumed in Western countries are low in dietary fiber: to reach
      the recommended levels people should introduce whole grain cereals, legumes, vegetables and
      dried fruits, not always accepted. We tested the effects on health of crackers baked with a
      special Integralbianco® flour, enriched with 3,2g of Arabinoxylan / 100g (vs refined flour).

    <description>19 free-living subjects (16 F/ 3M) attending from one year the Outpatient Obesity Clinic Policlinico S. Matteo were enrolled. All subjects were already reached weight loss and were in a sort of &quot;weight steady state&quot;. Based on 7-day food diary, a nutritionist composed 19 isocaloric diets, replacing all consumed carbohydrates with normal or AX crackers. The mean carbohydrates intake was 189.5g, with total fiber 20.6g. In AX diet total fiber was 25.3g/day (20.6 plus 4.68g of AX).
Height, weight, waist circumference were obtained at time 0, at week 4 and 8. At every time were collected blood samples for glucose, insulin, total cholesterol, HDL-chol., tryglicerides, plasma acyl and des-acyl ghrelin. Glucose and insulin were , also collected 2 h after a 75 g oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT).</description>
