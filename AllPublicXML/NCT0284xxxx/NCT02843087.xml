    <textblock>
      The impact of breastfeeding on the infant microbiome in vaginally and Cesarean delivered
      offspring from obese and normal weight mothers.

  <detailed_description>

      Design: Normal weight (NW; pre-pregnant BMI &lt;25.0 kg/m2), obese (Ob; pre-pregnant BMI &gt;30.0
      kg/m2), gestational diabetes (GDM), Type 2 diabetes (T2D), and Type 1 diabetes mothers during
      the 3rd trimester (34-36 weeks) of pregnancy that will be followed -along with their
      respective offspring- through the first 12 months of life will be recruited from the
      University of Florida (UF) Health Shands Hospital. Stool, saliva, blood, vaginal swab, human
      milk, urine, body composition and clinical variables will be collected from mother and infant
      at 34-36 weeks of gestation (mom only), 2-weeks, 2-months, and 1-year at the UF Clinical
      Research Center.

      Infant body composition is the primary outcome and will be monitored via anthropometry.
      Follow-up data points will be collected from electronic health records (EHR) and include but
      are not limited to wellness visits by 1 month, 2 months, 4 months, 6 months, 9 months, 12
      months, 15 months, 18 months, 2 years, 2 Â½ years, 3 years, and each year after that until
      17.9 years. Planned data analysis includes linear regression using the R statistical program.
      The primary data analysis will test maternal health status and human milk bioactive
      components for associations with the infant microbiome and pediatric outcomes collected by
      clinical visits and EHR.

      The study team will recruit equal samples of pregnant mothers in each the following groups
      (n=50 in each group; 1800 total participants): 1) NW vaginal deliveries; 2) NW C-section
      deliveries; 3) Ob vaginal deliveries 4) Ob C-section deliveries; 5) GDM vaginal deliveries;
      6) GDM C-section deliveries; 7) T2D vaginal deliveries; 8) T2D C-section deliveries; 9) T1D
      vaginal deliveries; 10) T1D C-section deliveries.

      Stool, saliva, and vaginal swab samples collected from participants may be used for animal
      studies whereby germ-free mice are inoculated with stool samples to evaluate a causal role of
      the microbiome in clinically relevant phenotypes (i.e. pediatric obesity).
