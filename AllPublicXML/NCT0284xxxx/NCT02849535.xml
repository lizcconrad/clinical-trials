  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The rise of oral targeted therapies favors outpatient care of cancer patients but exposes
      them to new risks compared to the injectable chemotherapy in the hospital: non-adherence to
      treatment, inappropriate management of side effects and interactions with other co-prescribed
      drugs. The clinical consequences (reduced efficacy and potentialized toxicity) are all the
      more important that ambulatory monitoring of treatments prescribed at the hospital remains
      underdeveloped due to default of coordination between these two settings.

      Adverse drug reactions are a major concern, as such, and because they involve prescription
      changes (dose reduction, treatment interruption). This results in a decrease in the dose
      taken and a risk of loss of efficacy.

      In the context of metastatic renal cell carcinoma, the risk of iatrogenicity is even higher
      because the oral targeted therapies available in this indication have a safety profile marked
      by potentially serious toxicities (hematologic and cardiac toxicity) or are known to reduce
      the treatment adherence (digestive and skin toxicities). In addition, these molecules are
      metabolized by the CYP3A4 hepatic cytochrome, which leads to avoid associating them with
      drugs inducing and / or inhibiting the CYP3A4, because of the risk of toxicity and / or loss
      of efficacy.

      The investigators propose to assess a program set up to secure drug taking by enhancing
      self-management of side effects and control of drug interactions by the patient. This program
      includes pharmaceutical visits and involves inpatient and outpatient (doctor, referent
      pharmacist and liberal nurse) professionals.

      The hypothesis of the study is that the PRISM care program will improve self-management of
      side effects by the patient, resulting in a relative dose intensity of oral chemotherapy
      improved compared to usual care.
