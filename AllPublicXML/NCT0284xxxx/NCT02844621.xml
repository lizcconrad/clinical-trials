  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effects of a common over-the-counter medication,
      omeprazole, on the normal gut bacteria and inflammation in the body in healthy older adults.

    <textblock>
      This study aims to enroll 25 healthy subjects from San Antonio, Texas and the surrounding
      area. Study participants will be asked to provide a blood and stool sample at baseline,
      complete a 14-day course of omeprazole (PrilosecÂ®), and then complete a follow-up blood and
      stool sample.

    <measure>Change in fecal microbiota diversity following omeprazole use</measure>
    <time_frame>14 days</time_frame>
    <description>Bacterial taxa will be classified according to operational taxonomic units (OTUs). The change in the diversity of bacteria taxa will be compared between pre- and post-samples using the Bray-Curtis dissimilarity measure.</description>

    <measure>Change in interleukin inflammatory markers following omeprazole use</measure>
    <time_frame>14 days</time_frame>
    <description>Interleukin 2, interleukin-6, and interleukin-10 will be measured from the blood at baseline and following omeprazole use and each reported in pg/mL.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in tumor necrosis factor-alpha following omeprazole use</measure>
    <time_frame>14 days</time_frame>
    <description>Tumor necrosis factor-alpha will be measured from the blood at baseline and following omeprazole use and reported in pg/mL.</description>
