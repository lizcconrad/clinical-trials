  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The current standard of care for ventricular tachycardia (VT) includes the use of medicine
      called anti-arrhythmic drugs (AADs) and Implantable Cardioverter Defibrillator (ICD) therapy.
      These treatments are used to terminate the irregular heartbeats and bring the heart back to a
      normal rhythm. Catheter ablation is a procedure used to eliminate (damage) the heart cells
      causing the arrhythmia. Patients eligible for this may benefit from an ablation procedure in
      addition to an ICD to treat their VT condition or risk of developing VT. This study aims to
      show that treating VT with catheter ablation, if performed preemptively at the time of ICD
      implantation, will reduce subsequent recurrent VT, ICD shocks, and lead to improved survival.

      Subjects who meet inclusion/exclusion criteria will be entered into the randomized trial.
      Randomization will be 1:1 between control group and ablation group. Those randomized to the
      control group will receive ICD therapy and routine drug therapy (including antiarrhythmic
      drugs as indicated). Subjects randomized to the ablation group will receive ablation therapy
      plus ICD for ventricular tachycardia. Patients that refuse ICD therapy and undergo ablation
      only will be enrolled in a prospective registry.

      Follow-up will be performed prior to hospital discharge for incision check and device
      interrogation as is standard of care. In addition, routine device and clinical follow-up will
      be scheduled at 1, 3, 6, 12, 18, and 24 months. Electrocardiography (ECG) will be performed
      pre-implant and prior to hospital discharge. Echocardiography (TTE) will be performed
      pre-implant and at 12 and 24 months.

      Patients that refuse ICD implantation will not be randomized and will be approached for
      inclusion into a registry if they undergo catheter ablation without an ICD. Basic
      demographics and medical history will be collected from registry subjects upon enrollment.
      Registry subjects will receive follow-up for routine clinical care every 6 months to check on
      their overall status.

      120 subjects will be randomized. An additional 60 subjects will enrolled into the registry.

      As of the time protocol revision C changes were made (07Nov2016), 33 subjects have been
      randomized. There has not been any preliminary or interim analysis of any data at this point.
      The study-sponsor has not had any access to any clinical follow-up for the patients enrolled
      to date.
