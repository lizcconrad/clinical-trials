      HILLCLIMBER is a randomized, controlled, open-label phase II trial of moderate dose statin
      therapy (pravastatin 40mg daily) versus high-dose statin therapy (rosuvastatin 20-40mg daily)
      in HIV-infected persons taking antiretroviral therapy (ART) who have coronary heart disease
      (CHD).

      HILLCLIMBER is a randomized, controlled, open-label phase II trial of moderate dose statin
      therapy versus high-dose statin therapy in HIV-infected persons taking antiretroviral therapy
      (ART) who have coronary heart disease (CHD).

      All subjects will have an initial 2-week run-in period with pravastatin 40mg daily (Week 0 to
      2). Subjects not demonstrating significant toxicity at week 2 will then be randomized to
      rosuvastatin 20mg (high intensity dose group) versus continuing pravastatin 40mg daily
      (moderate intensity group) for 12 weeks (Weeks 2 to 14). At week 6, those in the rosuvastatin
      arm who do not demonstrate significant toxicity and whose LDL-c is &gt;60mg/dl and decreased by
      less than 25% compared with week 2 will then have doses increased to rosuvastatin 40mg.
