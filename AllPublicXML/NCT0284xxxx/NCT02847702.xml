  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Key Inclusion Criteria Include:

          1. Males and females ≥ 40 and ≤ 75 years of age with moderate to severe chronic OA pain
             of the knee (lasting several hours daily) as their predominant pain condition for at
             least 6 months prior to screening

          2. Diagnostic criteria for primary pain condition (American College of Rheumatology [ACR]
             clinical and radiographic criteria):

               -  At least 1 of the following in addition to knee pain: age &gt; 50, stiffness &lt; 30
                  min, crepitus on active motion, and

               -  Kellgren-Lawrence (K-L) grade 2 or 3 radiographic evidence at the screening visit
                  as determined by a local radiologist or rheumatologist. Note that K-L grades 2 to
                  3 require the presence of osteophytes, which is required to meet ACR clinical and
                  radiographic criteria for knee OA

          3. Subjects whose OA pain of the index knee is not adequately treated prior to the
             screening visit:

             • Subjects must have a self-reported average pain intensity rating of moderate or
             severe on a verbal rating scale (ie, none, mild, moderate, and severe) over the 7 days
             prior to the screening visit

          4. The subjects must have &quot;average pain over the last 24 hours&quot; scores ≥ 5 and ≤ 9 on an
             11-point numerical rating scale (NRS) for the index knee on ≥ 3 consecutive days
             during the screening period and come in for randomization within 72 hours after
             qualification is met

          5. Subjects who are willing and able to stop taking any/all analgesic medications,
             including over-the-counter pain medications, opioids, marijuana, and topical
             analgesics for OA pain for the duration of the treatment period, with the exception of
             study-specific rescue medication.

        Key Exclusion Criteria Include:

          1. Subjects with radiographic evidence of OA with K-L grade 0, 1, or 4

          2. Subjects at risk for destructive arthropathy, subjects with a history of
             osteonecrosis, osteoporotic fracture, rapidly progressive osteoarthritis (RPOA 1 and
             2), subchondral insufficiency fracture, and hip/knee dislocations

          3. Subjects considered high risk for surgery based upon American Society of
             Anesthesiologists physical classification system for surgery grading, or subjects who
             would not be willing to undergo joint replacement surgery if required

          4. Subjects with chronic pain conditions other than OA of the knee as their predominant
             pain condition, including gout (except for subjects with gout that is controlled with
             diet and/or with stable suppressive treatment with uric acid reducing medication(s)
             and/or colchicine, and who have not had any attack within the past 2 years),
             pseudogout, psoriatic arthritis, active Lyme disease, rheumatoid arthritis or any
             other inflammatory arthritis, fibromyalgia, neuropathic pain conditions, bursitis, or
             acute injury or signs of active infection in the target pain area

          5. Subjects scheduled for surgical interventions of the disease site or any other major
             surgery during the study conduct period

          6. Subjects with a history of a prior joint replacement of the index knee

          7. Subjects who have had arthroscopy on either knee or hip within 6 months of entering
             the study, or open surgery on either knee or hip within 12 months of entering the
             study.

        Other protocol-specific inclusion/exclusion criteria may apply.
