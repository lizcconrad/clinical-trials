    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to assess the effect of ACT-541468 on a measure of
      sleep maintenance (Wake after Sleep Onset or WASO) by polysomnography in elderly subjects
      with insomnia disorder.

      The study consists of 3 phases: a screening phase, a double-blind treatment phase consisting
      of 5 periods, and a safety follow-up phase. Safety is monitored throughout the study.

    <description>Each subject participates in 5 treatment periods. On the evening of the first 2 days of each period they receive one dose (D) of ACT-541468 or placebo orally in the following order: D4, D2, D3, D1 and P, with D4 = the highest dose (50 mg) and D1 the lowest dose (5 mg). Each treatment period is separated from the next one by a 5- to 12- day washout.</description>
