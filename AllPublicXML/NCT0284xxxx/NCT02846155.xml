    <textblock>
      By using three different Gastric Preparation of Magnetic-controlled Capsule Endoscopy, the
      investigators hope to find out the optimal gastric preparation plan.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      It is a prospective, single-blind, randomized controlled trial. Patients who were conducted
      by Magnetic-controlled Capsule Endoscopy at Changhai Hospital will be randomly allocated into
      three different Gastric Preparation group before the procedure. It include clear water group
      which patient only drink 1000ml clear water before checking; simethicone group which patient
      drink 950ml clear water and 15ml simethicone before checking; simethicone combined with
      pronase group which patient drink 900ml lear water and 15ml simethicone and 20，000iu pronase
      before checking. The result were got from a relevant professional physician's blinded
      independent image-reading.

    <description>Two investigators who did not know which kind of gastric preparation of the patient scored the level of gastric cleansing 0f 120 participants according to a four-point grading scale: poor, fair, good, and excellent，which was pointed 3,2,1，and 0.The investigators should evaluate the gastric cleansing of six anatomical landmarks (cardia, fundus, body, angulus, antrum and pylorus).A poor level of cleansing indicated the mucosa was obscured largely by a lot of air bubbles and grume,fair indicated that a portion of the mucosa was obscured by air bubbles and grume that was enough to prevent a reliable visualization of polyps, good indicated that a small amount of air bubbles and grume，and excellent indicated that the fluid was clear and the image was either free or had only small bits of air bubbles and grume.</description>

    <measure>Diagnostic yield of Magnetic-controlled Capsule Endoscopy</measure>
    <time_frame>4 month</time_frame>
    <description>The gastric focal lesion was defined as any of the positive findings including polyp, ulcers, submucosal tumor (SMT) and others (i.e. xanthoma, diverticulum, etc.). Erosion, gastritis and gastric atrophy were defined as negative findings, because they are diffuse lesions which can be easily diagnosed by Magnetic-controlled Capsule Endoscopy.</description>

    <measure>Tolerability of participants</measure>
    <time_frame>4 month</time_frame>
    <description>The endoscopist scored the tolerability of participants according to a three-point grading scale: poor, fair, and excellent，which was pointed 2,1，and 0.A poor tolerability of participants indicated patients with perforated severe abdominal pain,nausea, vomiting，etc.fair indicated patients with perforated little abdominal pain,nausea, vomiting.and excellent indicated that patients with no obvious discomfort.</description>

    <description>Two investigators scored the level of gastric visibility 0f 120 participants according to a four-point grading scale: poor, fair, good, and excellent，which was pointed 3,2,1,and 0.The investigators should evaluate the visibility of gastric of six anatomical landmarks (cardia, fundus, body, angulus, antrum and pylorus).A poor level of cleansing indicated the less than 50% of mucosa could be seen,fair indicated that 50%-75% of the mucosa could be seen, good indicated that more than 75% of the mucosa could be seen，and excellent indicated the whole mucosa could be seen.</description>

             stenosis, overt gastrointestinal bleeding, history of upper gastrointestinal surgery
