      In this study, the investigators hypothesize that studying monogenic variants with strong
      effect associated with severe insulin deficiency of Wolfram syndrome will provide important
      insights into the more complex type 1 and type 2 diabetes mellitus.

      Aim 1. Establish and maintain a registry of patients with Wolfram syndrome. An Internet based
      registry will be employed to enroll participants with the clinical diagnosis of Wolfram
      syndrome (insulin dependent DM and bilateral OA). Clinical information regarding age of
      diagnosis and progression of the disease will be collated and analyzed to better define its
      natural history, along with potential metabolic phenotypes such as glucose intolerance of
      heterozygous parents and unaffected sibs.

      If not already completed, blood for WFS1 sequence analysis will be obtained on the
      participants (parents and sibs also for control purposes) and sent to a CLIA certified lab to
      define the mutation. This information will benefit patient families and referring physicians
      by providing a genetic diagnosis and where indicated. The Wolfram Syndrome Registry will
      foster international collaborations to more efficiently and systematically collect Wolfram
      syndrome patients and their clinical and experimental data.

      Background

      Wolfram syndrome (OMIM #222300) is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by insulin
      dependent diabetes mellitus (DM) in the first decade of life, followed by optic atrophy (OA),
      blindness, and deafness. Death from widespread neurodegeneration occurs in the third or
      fourth decades. Postmortem studies revealed a non-autoimmune loss of pancreatic beta-cells
      responsible for the diabetes.The investigators discovered that mutations in the WFS1 gene
      cause Wolfram syndrome, a rare Mendelian disease of strong effect in which the signaling
      pathway may have relevance for the more complex type 1 and type 2 diabetes mellitus.

      Protein synthesis in mammalian cells occurs primarily in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER).
      There are a number of metabolic conditions that disrupt this process, including increased
      protein synthesis, synthesis of mutated proteins, and others. When these conditions occur,
      they trigger an adaptive response by ER stress sensors that serve to slow protein synthesis,
      and in extreme conditions lead to apoptosis. The investigators discovered that beta-cells
      exhibit high levels of ER stress in animal models of Wfs1 deficiency. High levels of ER
      stress promoting beta-cell death may be related to the etiology of Wolfram syndrome in
      patients, but this is unknown at present.

      Rationale

      Immunocytochemistry and subcellular fractionation studies have indicated that Wolfram protein
      is localized in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane with nine transmembrane segments.
      Fibroblasts from a patient with a non-sense mutation in the gene revealed that protein
      absence was caused by rapid decay of the transcript, and a patient with compound missense
      mutations exhibited markedly reduced protein stability. Thus, in patients with Wolfram
      syndrome due to certain mutations the protein is present at reduced levels, although the
      mechanisms for how the protein participates in the ER stress reaction are still under
      investigation. In contrast, only non-inactivating or missense mutations have been described
      in the autosomal dominant low frequency sensorineural hearing loss (LFSNHI, OMIM #600965).
      Virtually nothing is known about how the more common polymorphic variants appear to impact
      the risk for type 2 diabetes. Studies in animal models have demonstrated a relationship
      between ER stress and Wfs1 (n.b. the nomenclature for the human gene is WFS1 and for the
      mouse is Wfs1). Both the Wolfram mRNA and protein are induced by ER stress. Glucose-induced
      insulin secretion also activates Wfs1 expression and a reduction in Wfs1 mRNA results in the
      activation of ER stress. ER stress as a cause of diabetes has been demonstrated in the mouse
      by knockout of eIF2 kinase (PERK), resulting in beta-cell loss and diabetes, and in a rare
      genetic disease characterized by mutation of this gene, resulting in early-onset diabetes and
      epiphyseal dysplasia, the Wolcott-Rallison syndrome. These results in mouse models suggest
      that lack of expression of Wfs1 in beta-cells appears to be a significant contributor to the
      reduction in beta-cell survival.

      While genetic studies have convincingly demonstrated that mutations in the WFS1 gene cause
      Wolfram syndrome, and alterations of expression of Wfs1 protein levels in animal models and
      cells in culture result in enhanced ER stress, the relationship between WFS1 expression, ER
      stress, and Wolfram syndrome in humans is unclear. The current proposal seeks to have
      patients with Wolfram syndrome enroll in the Registry. A simple peripheral blood draw will be
      obtained on the patient to obtain DNA for sequencing of the WFS1 gene. The research problem
      is to establish the link between ER stress and diabetes in patients with a monogenic disease
      of strong effect. Analyzing the WFS1 gene mutations from DNA of a registry of patients with
      Wolfram syndrome will allow us to test this hypothesis. Achieving this goal in these patients
      may have profound effects for the ultimate treatment of the very common and complex disease
      T2D. When available, parents and unaffected sibs of patients in the Registry will be invited
      to participate in the study by donating a blood sample as a control.

      As a first step, the investigators will establish registry and collect blood samples from
      patients to perform genetic testing and monitor levels of biomarkers.

      Study Design

      In this study, the investigators hypothesize that studying monogenic variants with strong
      effect associated with severe insulin deficiency of Wolfram syndrome will provide important
      insights into the more complex type 1 and type 2 diabetes mellitus.

      Aim 1. Establish and maintain a registry of patients with Wolfram syndrome. An Internet based
      registry will be employed to enroll participants with the clinical diagnosis of Wolfram
      syndrome (insulin dependent DM and bilateral OA). Clinical information regarding age of
      diagnosis and progression of the disease will be collated and analyzed to better define its
      natural history, along with potential metabolic phenotypes such as glucose intolerance of
      heterozygous parents and unaffected sibs.

      If not already completed, blood for WFS1 sequence analysis will be obtained on the
      participants (parents and sibs also for control purposes) and sent to a CLIA certified lab to
      define the mutation. This information will benefit patient families and referring physicians
      by providing a genetic diagnosis and where indicated. The Wolfram Syndrome Registry will
      foster international collaborations to more efficiently and systematically collect Wolfram
      syndrome patients and their clinical and experimental data.

      DNA samples will be used to sequence the WFS1 gene. If no mutations are found in this gene
      and the subject's doctor(s) are convinced he has Wolfram Syndrome, investigators may also
      offer sequencing of the WFS2 (CISD2) gene or of autosomal dominant hearing loss genes.

        Any patient worldwide with a clinical diagnosis of Wolfram syndrome and with access to the
        Internet can be enrolled in the Registry. Since the disease usually manifests in the first
        decade of life and tends to have an inevitably progressive course, participation of minors
        is important for establishing the natural course of the disease.
