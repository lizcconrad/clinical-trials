      The purpose of this study is to:

        1. define novel homogeneous groups of patients with LDs and

        2. work toward finding the cause of these disorders.

      Patients with leukodystrophies (LDs) of unknown etiology are a heterogeneous group but
      constitute the second largest group of genetic white matter diseases. In order to find the
      cause of leukodystrophies, patients with LDs of unknown cause will be analyzed clinically,
      neurophysiologically, biochemically and genetically. Patients would have been diagnosed as
      having no known leukodystrophies at outside centers. At the Baylor University Medical Center,
      such patients will undergo a series of neuropsychological, blood, urine, spinal fluid,
      radiological, and peripheral tissue pathological tests. Some of these tests will be part of a
      standard battery while others will be tailored to individual patients. Patients will be
      followed yearly or as necessary. Patients will be screened for mutations in genes coding for
      structural myelin proteins. In some patients in whom all tests yielded no information
      regarding the etiology of their disease, and in whom there is evidence to suggest involvement
      of the peripheral nervous system, a sural nerve biopsy will be considered. Sural nerve biopsy
      tissue will be evaluated using a novel combination of approaches including detailed
      pathological, immunohistochemical, and biochemical analysis of myelin proteins and lipids.
      Schwann cell biology and expression of myelin genes in the brain will also be investigated in
      situ. It is hoped that the present study will help clarify the nosology of the
      leukodystrophies and significantly advance our understanding of the pathogenesis of these
      diseases.
