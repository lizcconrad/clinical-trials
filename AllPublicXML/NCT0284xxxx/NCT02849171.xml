  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a pilot study. The purpose of this study is to test if an imaging tracer, not
      approved by the FDA, called 18F-Fluorocholine (18F-FCH) is useful for evaluating this type of
      cancer. This tracer is used to perform PET scans. The researchers want to see if the 18F-FCH
      PET scan, using the study tracer 18F-FCH, can improve upon the usual scans at diagnosing or
      monitoring this type of cancer.

      In patients with high-grade gliomas, changes on standard MRI of the brain may reflect true
      tumor growth or inflammatory changes in response to treatment, called pseudo-progression. It
      is important to distinguish true tumor growth from inflammation since inflammation indicates
      the tumor is responding to treatment. With standard MRI, it is difficult to determine if
      changes following treatment are due to tumor growth or inflammation early on. Researchers
      hope to learn if the investigational tracer, 18F-FCH, will be able to distinguish true tumor
      growth from inflammation more accurately than standard MRI or 18F-FDG PET scans.

    <description>from 18F-FCH PET. SUV measurements will be summarized by tumor progression versus pseudo-progression. Pearsons correlation will be estimated. To examine whether or not the radioactivity correlates with morphological characteristics, the investigators will employ a resampling approach (utilizing an appropriate statistic such as the difference in means or proportions for a given comparison) to incorporate within-patient correlation.</description>

    <description>Participants must require and agree to surgical resection of the evolving lesion based on clinical grounds (independent of enrollment on the protocol). Surgery does not need to be completed within 24 weeks of radiation since the majority of patients will be followed with surveillance MRI for an additional 4-8 weeks to assess evolution of the lesion. Eligible patients will undergo an 18F-FCH PET study up to 2 weeks prior to surgical resection. All patients will then proceed with standard surgical resection and will receive a second low-dose injection of 18F-FCH immediately prior to resection of the tumor. Tissue samples will be collected from various sections of the tumor and radioactivity levels and histopathologic metrics will be assessed. The purpose of the second 18F-FCH administration is to further elucidate the tissue distribution of 18F-FCH radioactivity with respect to the histopathology of the surgically resected tissue.</description>
