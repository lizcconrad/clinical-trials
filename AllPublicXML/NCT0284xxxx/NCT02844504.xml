  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Breast cancer patients often suffer from long-term physical symptoms of weakness. In this
      study, investigators propose to compare how two different low intensity physical exercise
      training programs can improve handgrip strength for breast cancer patients with symptoms of
      weakness. Using brain imaging, the study will also investigate changes in brain structure,
      and muscle activity associated with handgrip.

      Participants will be randomized to either a no treatment group or one of two low intensity
      6-week exercise training. Outcomes will be measured at baseline, post-intervention and 4
      weeks post intervention.
