  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Human safety studies will be carried out to test whether hop botanical dietary supplements
      used by peri- and post-menopausal women are safe to use with Food and Drug Administration
      (FDA)-approved drugs. To test this, a hop dietary supplement (previously tested in women at
      the University of Illinois at Chicago without any harmful effects) will be given with four
      selected FDA-approved drugs to determine if the hop supplement can increase or decrease how
      these medications are absorbed, metabolized and excreted by the human body. Preclinical
      studies predict that the hop supplement might affect the metabolism or break down of these
      probe drugs.

    <textblock>
      At the start of a study, subjects will be administered low doses of a mixture of four
      FDA-approved drugs (caffeine, tolbutamide, dextromethorphan, and alprazolam), and serial
      blood samples will be drawn and analyzed for the concentration of each drug over time.
      Afterwards, participants will take the hop dietary supplement twice daily for 14 days to
      allow for potential inhibition or induction of drug metabolizing enzymes and transporters.
      Thereafter, the same drugs will be taken again to obtain a second measure of drug
      concentrations in blood over time. Changes in the concentration-time curve values for each
      probe drug obtained before and after ingestion of the supplement would indicate that
      metabolism of the probe drugs is impacted by the hop dietary supplement.
