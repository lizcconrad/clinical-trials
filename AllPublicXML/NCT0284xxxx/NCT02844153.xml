    <textblock>
      Metformin is the most widely prescribed oral treatment for diabetes, and the only one that
      showed a survival benefit.

      Yet, there is no consensus on the optimal dose and withdrawal of metformin in chronic kidney
      disease (CKD) patients.

      The aim of the study is to describe the use and side-effects of metformin in CKD patients in
      routine practice.
