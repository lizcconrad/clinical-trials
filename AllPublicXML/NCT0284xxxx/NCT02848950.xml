  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The basis for obesity's impact on reproduction is not well characterised and there is a
      controversy whether the key organ influenced by it are the ovaries or the uterus.

      Insulin sensitizers ameliorate insulin resistance in obese patients. This study seeks to
      determine if Metformin helps to increase fecundability by affecting the uterus in women
      undergoing ART. As a surrogate marker- flows in the uterus will be tested during the
      treatment.

      Obesity has been long implicated in reduced reproductive potential and it has been shown to
      impair conception and implantation. However, the basis for this adverse effect is still
      obscure and there is a controversy whether the key organ influenced by it are the ovaries or
      the uterus.

      It is well established that insulin resistance is one of the main mechanisms of obesity's
      negative influences on the reproductive organs in females. Insulin sensitizers ameliorate
      insulin resistance in obese patients.

      This study seeks to determine if Metformin ,an oral antidiabetic and insulin sensitizer,
      helps to increase fecundability by affecting the uterus in women undergoing frozen-thawed
      embryo transfer compared to the control group. As a surrogate marker- flows in the uterus
      will be tested during the treatment.
