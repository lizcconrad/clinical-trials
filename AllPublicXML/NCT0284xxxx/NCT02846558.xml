      This is a pragmatic, single-blinded randomized trial of improving adherence to dietary
      interventions in patients with MS who are receiving monthly natalizumab infusions.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      MS affects at least 400,000 people in the US alone, and its incidence has increased in the
      past 50 years, likely due to changing environmental risk factors. Recent research suggests
      that diet may be a critical factor in the development of MS. The &quot;Western diet&quot;, high in
      sugar, fat, and salt, may influence MS risk and progression by directly affecting the immune
      system, altering gut bacteria, and changing metabolism.

      Studying patients with MS who are overweight and obese may be relevant as obesity can cause
      chronic low-grade inflammation, potentially worsening MS symptoms. Diet modification
      represents an interesting potential therapy for MS, particularly calorie restriction and
      fasting, which have been associated with reduced markers of inflammation. In addition to
      these direct effects, weight optimization may lead to improvements in MS-related symptoms,
      like fatigue, and overall quality of life.

      This is a single-blinded randomized trial of adherence to a dietary intervention in patients
      with MS who are receiving monthly natalizumab infusions. The study will evaluate how use of
      technology may help patients with MS adhere to a calorie restricted diet. It will also
      evaluate the effect of weight loss on fatigue and quality of life in patients with MS. A
      second part of the study will evaluate if shortening the period during the day in which
      people consume their typical food amounts leads to improvements in patient-reported outcomes.

    <description>MS patients receiving monthly natalizumab infusions will use the LoseIt! smartphone application to log daily food consumption. Data from the app will be collected at follow-up visits. Patients will receive initial training in using the app, and then receive weekly supportive messages encouraging them to adhere to the calorie restriction diet between 3- and 6-month followup visits. Results will be compared primarily to those collected from the Standard of Care arm.</description>

    <description>MS patients receiving monthly natalizumab infusions who are ineligible for the calorie restriction portion of the study (the Frequent Patient Activation and Standard of Care arms) will be offered the option to enroll in the second part of the study, assessing differences in outcomes between daily 16-hour fasting periods and no dietary changes. Patients in the second part of the study randomized to this arm will consume their normal daily food intake, but restrict eating to an 8-hour period during the day. Results will be compared to patients who do not make any changes to their diet, the No Change arm.</description>

If so, they may be randomized to this arm, in which no changes are made to amount or timing of daily food intake. Results will be compared with the experimental Timing arm</description>
