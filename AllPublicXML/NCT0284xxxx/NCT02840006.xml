      CONTEXT: In patients eligible for coronary artery bypass surgery, anesthesia should provide a
      number of conditions that exceed the limits of cardiovascular stability, myocardial
      protection and other organs. Moreover, the combination of general anesthesia and spinal
      anesthesia lessens the homeostatic, metabolic, hormonal and immunosuppressive changes. The
      goal of this research was to evaluate the consumption of fentanyl citrate in intra-operative
      in Coronary Artery Bypass Grafting (CABG) surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass under spinal
      anesthesia associated with general anesthesia.

      METHODS: Clinical, prospective, randomized and double covered study, approved by the Research
      Ethics Committee. Fifty-six patients candidates for CABG with CPB, after signing the Terms of
      consent, were randomized and divided into two groups: GI - General and GII - General +
      subarachnoid. General anesthesia was induced according to the weight of each patient and
      maintenance with isoflurane and fentanyl. Spinal anesthesia was induced with 20 mg of 0.5%
      hyperbaric bupivacaine and 200 mcg of morphine, the patient is placed in cephalo-position
      slope of 45 degrees for 10 minutes in Group II. In the statistical study was performed using
      the Mann-Whitney test; the level of statistical significance was set at 5%.
