  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Caregivers of persons with cancer may face many challenges as they support and care for a
      person receiving treatment. Sometimes having to help make treatment decisions for a patient
      can cause distress for caregivers. The purpose of this study is to evaluate 2 different
      electronic approaches to providing support for a caregiver. One group will have access to an
      on-line program with videos, providing education on decision making strategies for caregivers
      of patients with cancer, to watch and a daily meditation application and the other group will
      have access to the daily meditation application. Investigators will randomly assign
      participants to each group.

      Investigators will conduct a randomized trial pilot study to examine two arms of the
      intervention among 20 caregivers of patients with advanced cancer. Investigators will collect
      mixed methods data to describe changes in proximal and distal outcomes. Investigators have
      chosen the time points to capture neural and behavioral changes associated with the
      intervention and to capture end of life quality of life (QOL) for a majority of caregivers
      after death of their loved one. Investigators aim to:

        1. Evaluate the short and longer-term effects of the end of life care with medication
           (EOL_M) and meditation only (M_Only) interventions on stress reduction and end of life
           (EOL) planning behaviors and determine if there are different effects between EOL_M and
           M_ Only interventions.

        2. Evaluate the short-term and long-term effects of the intervention on caregiver distress,
           decisional regret, and EOL values and goals of care for treatment.

        3. Evaluate the impact of decentering on the association between the interventions,
           self-management behaviors (stress reduction and EOL planning behaviors) and distress,
           anxiety, concordance between EOL values and goals of care for treatment, decisional
           regret and satisfaction with EOL care.

        4. Describe the neural activity processes that are associated with increased
           self-management activities.

    <description>The intervention has two content components: end of life planning education (using end of life planning videos) and strategies and kindness based meditation (using the Stop, Breathe &amp; Think™ app). The activities comprising these components work together to improve both analytic neural processing (e.g. improving knowledge about goal setting and EOL planning, learning self-monitoring of EOL values and goals of care, and self-regulation skills of monitoring symptoms of distress and anxiety) and emotional neural processing (e.g. teaching participants to experience the moment non-judgmentally and directing thoughts to think positive thoughts and feel positive feelings like kindness and compassion.</description>
