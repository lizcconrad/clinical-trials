  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Tobacco smoke is the most common source of exposure to carcinogens in humans. Indeed, the
      smoke contains about 1010 particles per ml and 4800 chemical compounds, at least 66 are
      carcinogenic. Tobacco smoke is the leading preventable cause of cancer in humans since it is
      responsible for lung cancer, upper aerodigestive tract (mouth, pharynx, larynx, esophagus),
      nasal cavity and sinuses, stomach, pancreas, liver, bladder, kidney, uterine cervix, and some
      myeloid leukemias.

      This study aims to evaluate the combined effect of the scanner and the search for circulating
      tumor cells (CTC) on screening for tobacco-related cancers, accompanying smokers to cessation
      and addressing the psychological impact this approach.

      Study Objectives:

      The study takes two lines of research:

      1 - Imaging and Research circulating tumor cells:

      The main objective is to evaluate the diagnostic value of the couple scanner low intensity
      and speed search of circulating tumor cells (CTC-LDCT) for screening in a population at high
      risk of lung cancer.

      The secondary objectives are:

        1. / comparing the added diagnostic value of dual-CTC LDCT screening that screening with
           LDCT used alone as it was used in the NLST study for lung cancer screening;

        2. / to assess the interest assess the diagnostic value of research of circulating tumor
           cells to identify extrapulmonary cancers associated with smoking; 3 / evaluate the
           psychological effects of screening (see psychological study).

      2 - Psychological Study The main objective is to study the emotional and psychosocial
      consequences of LDCT screening in the specific context of circulating tumor cells. This is to
      identify 1 / specific mechanisms of fear, anxiety and mental distress, 2 / adaptation
      strategies that could be beneficial for other patients, 3 / specific stressors caused by the
      device screening and / or medical information given to patients.

      The secondary objective is to adjust and improve the communication skills of health
      professionals in order to develop an appropriate framework to support the emotional and
      psychological aspects involved in the screening process when ( will be) used daily in
      clinical practice.

      Study Design

        1. - Imaging and Research circulating tumor cells This is a prospective cohort study,
           multicenter (hospitals attached to the University Paris Descartes), open,
           non-randomized, single arm. Each subject enrolled in the study will undergo three
           screening procedures. Patients with cancer prevalent in the first exam will be offered
           treatment after the balance sheet. Only subjects who do not have cancer at the first
           examination will return to the actual screening study in search of incident cases. The
           same sequence of evaluation will be repeated once a year for 2 years.

        2. - Psychological Study To achieve the objectives, a qualitative study based on grounded
           theory ( &quot;grounded theory&quot;) will be built. Grounded theory is a research methodology
           that studies the psychosocial processes to make them modeled theoretically. Since this
           method involves small samples of subjects, promotes flexibility of data collection and
           detailed analysis of the cases studied.

    <description>A psychologist-researcher attended with patient at the first consultation by the physician. The actual psychological study will be proposed as voluntary patients to participate (30 patients).

These interviews will aim to assess the nature of the psychological impact that screening has had on you and your resources to cope</description>

    <description>The procedure of screening test could be stressful. &quot;False positive&quot; results can cause anxiety and lead to additional costs, as well as increased exposure to radiation and invasive medical examination. Although this is based on some objective results, there is a high probability of adverse psychological effects in case of false positives; so there is cause for concern in the short term anxiety associated with positive results and the use of additional tests during the intervals between screening phases. There is no data related to psychological distress potentially caused by the discovery of circulating tumor cells.</description>
