    <textblock>
      This is a single arm, open-label, one center, dose escalation clinical study to determine the
      safety and efficacy of infusion of autologous T cells expressing CD19-redirected Chimeric
      Antigen Receptor (CD19 CAR T) in adult patients with relapsed or refractory CD19 positive
      B-cell lymphoma.

    <description>A standard 3+3 dose escalation approach aimed to assess the safety and efficacy of autologous anti-CD19 CAR T cells will be applied. Five CAR T dosage will be tested in this study: 5×10^4 /kg ， 1×10^5 /kg ，1×10^6 /kg，3×10^6/Kg, and 6×10^6/Kg.</description>

    <description>Patients will receive a three-day regimen of chemotherapy consisting of fludarabine and cyclophosphamide aimed to deplete the lymphocytes. Four days after lymphodepletion, patients are intravenously infused autologous anti-CD19 CAR T cells. A prescribed CAR T cell dose will be intravenously infused to patient in a three-day split-dose regimen (day0,30%; day1, 30%; day2, 40%).</description>
