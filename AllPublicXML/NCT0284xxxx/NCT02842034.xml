  <arm_group>

    <arm_group_type>Active Comparator</arm_group_type>
    <description>Active treatment will be delivered at an intensity that is 120% of the resting motor threshold (RMT). Stimulation will be delivered at 10 Hz with 60 stimulation trains of 50 stimuli each (i.e., 3000 stimuli) and an intertrain interval of 10 sec. Treatment will be applied in sequential order to the dorsomedial prefrontal cortices (DMPFC).</description>
  </arm_group>
  <arm_group>
    <arm_group_label>Sham rTMS</arm_group_label>
    <arm_group_type>Sham Comparator</arm_group_type>
    <description>Sham stimulation will be delivered using the same stimulation parameters and at the same site of active treatment, but the coil will be reversed. This method produces sound and some somatic sensation (e.g., contraction of scalp muscles) similar to those of active stimulation, but with minimal direct brain effects.</description>
