    <textblock>
      As early complications of transplantation (acute rejection and infections) were better
      controlled and that the survival of kidney transplants has increased, chronic complications
      of immunosuppression became increasing challenges. The incidence of cancer is greatly
      increased in transplant and cancer is now the first cause of death. The iatrogenic
      immunosuppression plays a major role in the increased incidence of cancer. If it is accepted
      that the incidence of cancer is generally increased after transplantation, the increased risk
      is very different from a specific cancer to another. Furthermore the specific treatment of
      the tumor (surgery, radiotherapy, chemotherapy, biotherapy), the specificity of the context
      of transplantation is related to the possibility of modulation of immunosuppression. However,
      there is no immunological marker for predicting the effectiveness of a modification of the
      immunosuppression.

      Several studies point to the important role of CD4 T cells into Th1 anti-tumor
      immunosurveillance group cancers. Identified &quot;helper&quot; degenerate peptides, called Universal
      Cancer Peptide (UCP) derivative of telomerase, a type of tumor antigen universal. These UCP
      peptides bind most HLA-DR alleles most frequent of the population and have the particularity
      of specifically stimulate CD4 T cells of type Th1. Using a test based on the UCP, it possible
      to detect the presence of spontaneous CD4 Th1 anti-UCP answers in several types of human
      cancers.

      The main objective of this study is to determine whether, in renal transplant patients, the
      occurrence of cancer is associated with a deficiency of CD4 Th1 response anti-hTERT.
