  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators aimed to evaluate the effect of oral contraceptive pills(OCP) on macula,
      retinal nerve fiber layer and choroid thickness by using Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT).
      The present clinical study is the first research reported in the literature which is
      investigating the posterior ocular segment changes in women using OCP by using OCT.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (OCT) which is used to evaluate retina both
      qualitatively and qualitatively is a non invasive process. And also OCT makes it possible to
      perform retinal exams repeatedly without eye drops and dilatation.
