    <textblock>
      Preoperative planning has been carried out to allow for response preparedness . A layer
      technique is usually used with standard radiography .The investigators have a record of
      routine preoperative radiographs by standard recognized as having an advantage over the
      reproducibility of measurements compared with plain radiography . The Toulouse Hospitals have
      developed this technology and is part of the routine assessment of hip prothesis pre and
      postoperatively.

      The TraumaCad software can superimpose implants on Picture Archiving and Communication System
      and evaluate digital and reproducible size of the implants and their correct position .

      This is to demonstrate the superiority of modern digital tools in the preoperative
      preparation in Orthopaedics set.

      Modern joint replacements in orthopedic surgery allow to restore locomotion. More than
      150,000 hip replacements are performed each year in France . The optimization results going
      restoration of the lengths of members and anatomy .

      Preoperative planning of hip replacements optimizes the return of the hip rotation center .
      Preoperative planning of hip prothesis is practiced by layer on radiographs whose scaling is
      imprecise . The recent TraumaCad system ( Brainlab® ) allows adjustment of the scales for
      each patient and the virtual positioning of implants to simulate the response to the return
      of geometric parameters of the hip.

      Preoperative planning by TraumaCad hip arthroplasties provides better restitution of limb
      length over conventional planning methods.

      The standardized radiographs being the investigators want to compare this group with a
      control group operated without TraumaCad planning and evaluating the accuracy of the software
      to predict implants sizes also .

      There is no risk to the patient with this procedure . The direct benefit is increased
      accuracy of surgical gesture to the patient and the reduction of mechanical problems related
      to leg length . Earnings for the orthopedic community is the postoperative evaluation. In the
      long term , the prosthetic technical improvement must increase the life of prostheses with
      therefore lower revisions and less expenditure in terms of public health.

      The widespread use of automated planning and objective assessment postoperative radiographs .
