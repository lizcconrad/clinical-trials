  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overarching goal of this research program is to elucidate causal and directional neural
      network- level abnormalities in depression, and how they are modulated by an
      individually-tailored, circuit-directed intervention. By using concurrent TMS and EEG, the
      investigators can overcome a major limitation of EEG - the inability to demonstrate
      causality. Here, we plan to recruit patients with medication-resistant depression undergoing
      rTMS treatment. At multiple time points, we will perform TMS-EEG to investigate the
      excitability and connectivity profiles of brain networks and how they are modulated during
      treatment. This study aims to provide objective brain network measures that can predict and
      track clinical response to TMS treatment. Findings from this study will be utilized to
      develop a novel, personalized treatment protocol based on individual brain networks.

      Goals of the study are as follows:

        -  To evaluate the ability to predict and track brain network changes during TMS treatment
           for medication-resistant depression.

        -  To develop quantitative tools that measure the connectivity and excitability of the
           brain using resting and single pulse TMS-EEG.

        -  To determine the feasibility of recording EEG biomarkers in the clinic without
           disrupting clinical care.

    <description>rTMS will be delivered for 20 sessions over 4 weeks. Active 10 Hz rTMS will be delivered to the left DLPFC as assessed by either the 5cm rule or F3 site. Daily treatment regiments will last 36.5 minutes and rTMS will be delivered at 120% of the participant's motor threshold. Participants will be monitored during the rTMS sessions for adverse events and/or side effects.</description>
