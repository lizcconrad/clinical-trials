      Background: Gastric cancer (GC) is major global health concern and the second leading cause
      of cancer deaths worldwide. Amplification of Her2/neu gene and/or overexpression of the
      Her2/neu protein have been observed in GC. Trastuzumab (Herceptinâ„¢) is an anti-Her2/neu
      antibody, which has been successfully applied in GC. However, the intratumoral heterogeneity
      of Her2/neu overexpression and amplification in GC should be noticed. The investigators
      investigated the significance of evaluating Her2/neu expression in different paraffin blocks
      of tumor tissue in GC.

      Methods: 2000 GC patients from ten centers, patients were divided into a cohort using one
      tumor tissue paraffin block (cohort 1, n=1000) and a cohort using dual tumor tissue paraffin
      blocks (cohort 2, n=1000) when evaluating Her2/neu expression status by immunohistochemistry
      (IHC). In cohort 2, the investigators combined the results from two different paraffin blocks
      and used the higher one as the final score.
