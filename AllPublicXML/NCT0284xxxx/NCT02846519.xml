    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the pharmacokinetics of intranasally administered
      esketamine in healthy Han Chinese, Korean, Japanese, and Caucasian participants and to
      evaluate the effects of rifampin on the pharmacokinetics of intranasally administered
      esketamine in healthy Caucasian participants.
