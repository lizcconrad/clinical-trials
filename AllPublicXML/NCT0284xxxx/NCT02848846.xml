      The NEBIAS (&quot;NEurocontrolled BIdirectional Artificial upper limb and hand prosthesiS&quot;)
      proposal aims at developing and clinically evaluating (in selected amputees) a
      neuro-controlled upper limb prosthesis intuitively controlled and felt by the amputee as the
      natural one. This will be possible by means of a novel neural interface able to provide a
      stable and very selective connection with the nervous system. This goal will be achieved by
      combining microtechnology and material science and will allow, on one side, recording of the
      motor-related signals governing the actions of the amputated hand/arm for the motion control
      of a mechanical prosthesis, and on the other providing sensory feedback from tactile and
      kinesthetic sensors through neuromorphic stimulation of the adequate afferent pathway within
      the residual limb. The NEBIAS proposal is also aimed at finding out the 'language'
      intrinsically linking central nervous system with peripheral nerve signals in order to govern
      simple and complex hand/fingers movements. To reach this goal, a variety of techniques
      exploring brain and nerve functions will be assembled and integrated; this includes the
      analysis of electromagnetic brain and nerve signals, as well as of movement-related changes
      in brain's blood flow/metabolism.

    <description>The patients will use the robotic hand for a period of one year that will be divided in 3 different phases. The first phase is the intensive phase where the patient will use the robotic hand from Monday to Friday all days. This phase will last 6 weeks. The second phase is the semi-intensive where the patient will use the robotic hand only two days per week. This phase will last 6 weeks. The third phase is the monitoring where the patient will use the robotic hand only one day per week until the end of the trial.
During this phases the patient will perform different task requiring the use of the robotic hand.</description>
