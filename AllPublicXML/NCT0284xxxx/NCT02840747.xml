  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This document is a protocol for a non-interventional human research study in which the
      investigator hopes to better understand the changes that take place in T cells in Cutaneous
      T-cell lymphoma (CTCL). The purpose of this study is to establish a protocol for the
      collection and storage of tissue samples from patients with CTCL for future research studies.
      Collection and storage of tissue samples from control patients will also be carried out.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      CTCL is a heterogeneous group of non-Hodgkin's lymphomas characterized by chronic
      inflammation and accumulation of malignant T cells in the skin. In order to carry out
      research to expand the knowledge and develop more effective treatments, tissue samples from
      CTCL patients with presumed or known disorders are required and tissue samples from control
      patients will be required to compare the differences between affected and healthy
      populations.

      Scientists will be able to test new ideas and new technologies that are not apparent or
      available at the present moment from this tissue repository in the future. This type of
      information will thus be of great advantage to future patients with these diseases.
