      The purpose of this study is to develop appropriate training methods and gather participant
      feedback on their use of the Passy Muir Swallowing Self-Training Device (PMSST). The PMSST is
      a small device that provides external vibratory stimulation to the larynx during swallowing
      and swallowing training. A secondary purpose of the study is to determine how 3 months of use
      of the PMSST affects swallowing physiology, brain activation, oral intake and quality of
      life. This was an uncontrolled pilot study aimed at gaining patient feedback on use of the
      vibratory device.

      The investigators are currently developing the Passy Muir Swallowing Self-Trainer to continue
      treatment of dysphagia after the patient is discharged to home. The self-training device is
      worn around the neck with motors placed externally on the skin over the thyroid cartilage to
      provide vibratory stimulation to the larynx. The vibrations activate the sensory receptors
      inside the larynx which excite CNS control for swallowing and can help the patient to
      initiate swallowing. Patients can use the self-training device at home to promote swallowing
      rehabilitation during daily swallowing practice. The device can also be programmed to vibrate
      at regular intervals throughout the day to promote saliva swallows. Using this method, the
      patient can continue their swallowing therapy independently and in a manner that is cost
      effective. A previous Phase I trial compared the clinical outcomes of 8 patients with chronic
      dysphagia using either an intramuscular electrical stimulation implant device or an external
      vibratory stimulator to practice swallowing daily at home (FDA IDE G0G0153). Functional
      outcomes of oral intake improved with both devices. As the external vibratory stimulation has
      the advantage of being external and completely noninvasive, it has been selected for further
      development as a self-training device. A second pilot study examined the effect of different
      frequencies of vibration on the swallowing frequency of healthy participants and found
      swallowing significantly increased from baseline when using a vibration of 70 Hz on one side
      of the larynx and 110 Hz on the other side. Data has also been collected on the effect of
      different vibration characteristics on swallowing in participants who have swallowing
      problems after stroke.

      Purpose: The purpose of this study is to allow patients with chronic dysphagia to use the
      Self-Trainer for daily swallowing practice in their home and collect feedback on device use
      and satisfaction and use. Objective information on the effectiveness of self-training for
      swallowing rehabilitation will also be gathered.

      Objectives:

        1. To develop and evaluate training for participants and caregivers to use the
           self-trainer.

        2. To gather participant feedback on the use of the device after 3 months of daily
           practice.

        3. To determine how 3 months of daily practice with the Passy Muir Swallowing Self-Trainer
           affects swallowing physiology, brain activation, oral intake, and quality of life in
           participants with chronic dysphagia.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  13 years or older

          -  Stable medical condition

          -  Diagnosed with oropharyngeal dysphagia confirmed by MBS baseline measure of the follow
             two scales:

               1. Penetration-Aspiration Scale score of 2 or greater verified by modified barium
                  swallow (Rosenbek et al., 1996) and/or

               2. Functional Oral Intake Scale score of 5 or lower (Crary et al., 2005)

          -  Folstein Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) score of 23 or greater indicating
             cognitive ability to follow directions and communicate preferences

          -  Willingness to travel SRMH 2 or more times to undergo initial evaluation, device use
             training and checkup at 3 months.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Pregnancy

          -  Cardiac problems

               -  history of cardiac rhythm condition (including heart murmur or cardiac
                  arrhythmia)

               -  cardiac pacemaker in place

          -  Highly-pigmented (dark) skin color is an exclusion criterion because near-infrared
             spectroscopy requires the measurement of the degree of absorption of different
             wavelengths of light after being reflected back through the scalp. Highly pigmented
             skin interferes with wavelength transmission, making the measurement of changes in
             absorption inaccurate.

          -  Lack of a primary care physician who can be contacted if there are findings on the
             MRI.

          -  Presence of metal in the body (prostheses, electrodes, shrapnel, aneurism clips, other
             medical hardware)

          -  Presence of certain tattoos with ferromagnetic metal or permanent makeup, due to the
             exposure to high magnetic force through MRI procedures.

          -  Subjects who were metal workers as a previous occupation will also be excluded due to
             the possibility of unknown/undetected metal in their body.

          -  Volunteers with broken skin in the area that the fNIRS probes will be placed on the
             scalp

          -  Claustrophobia

          -  Previous surgery that used surgical staples

          -  Artificial joints
