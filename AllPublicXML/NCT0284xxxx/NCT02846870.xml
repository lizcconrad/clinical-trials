      This randomized clinical trial studies how well visually enhanced education works in
      improving prostate cancer and treatment knowledge in patients with prostate cancer that has
      not spread to other places in the body. Visually enhanced education includes pictures,
      drawings, and photos, may help doctors better convey information about radiation and prostate
      cancer to patients.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Our goal is to conduct a randomized controlled trial to determine the impact of a visual
      presentation in the context of a radiation oncologist's discussion with patient during
      consultation on patient satisfaction at end of consultation visit and at end of treatment, on
      anxiety at start of treatment, on decision regret following treatment, and on perception of
      side effects following treatment. Of note, the attending radiation oncologist will be
      responsible for reviewing the Powerpoint presentation with the patient, taking time to answer
      any questions that the patient has

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized into 1 of 2 arms.

      ARM A (STANDARD EDUCATION): Patients receive a standard prostate cancer radiation oncology
      consultation.

      ARM B (VISUAL ENHANCED EDUCATION): Patients receive a visually enhanced prostate cancer
      educational Powerpoint presentation including prostate anatomy, pathologic results, surgical
      options, radiation therapy, and prognosis with pictographs during radiation oncology
      consultation.
