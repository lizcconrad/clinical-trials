      This study uses an interactive design and development process to develop tailored messages
      that align YMSM's relationship experiences and desires with HIV prevention strategies. The
      study includes a tailored online prevention, intervention, as well as an attention control
      non--tailored HIV prevention (NTHP) comparison intervention. The pilot RCT will compare the
      intervention (N=120) to NTHP (N=60) to assess intervention feasibility and acceptability, and
      gather preliminary behavioral data to inform a subsequent application. Follow-up assessments
      will be collected at thirty (30), sixty (60), and ninety (90) days post-intervention.

    <textblock>
      A resurgence of new HIV cases among young men who have sex with men (YMSM; ages 18--24) has
      underscored the importance of developing culturally- and developmentally- informed HIV
      programs for YMSM. The investigators are developing and pilot testing a tailored, web- based
      intervention called myDEx that focuses on delivering HIV prevention messages based on single
      YMSM's relationship expectations and partner--seeking behaviors. To maximize intervention
      appeal and appropriateness, the investigators have convened a youth advisory board (YAB) to
      provide insight and feedback during the 3--stage intervention development process. Using an
      iterative design and development process, they have developed tailored messages that align
      YMSM's relationship experiences and desires with HIV prevention strategies. The investigators
      designed and developed the myDEx tailored online prevention intervention, as well as an
      attention- control non--tailored HIV/AIDS prevention (NTHP) comparison intervention. After
      developing both interventions, the investigators used usability testing procedures to collect
      preliminary data from 16 YMSM on the proposed intervention's design and acceptability.
      Recommended changes were added to the intervention prior to launching a small pilot
      randomized controlled trial (RCT). The pilot RCT will compare myDEx (N=120) to NTHP (N=60) to
      assess intervention feasibility and acceptability, and gather preliminary behavioral data to
      inform a subsequent application. Assessments will be collected at 30, 60, and 90 days
      follow--up.

      Specific Aims include:

        1. To develop a tailored (myDEx) and non-tailored (NTHP) HIV prevention intervention
           focused on addressing HIV risk behaviors among single YMSM;

        2. To collect preliminary data on the feasibility, acceptability, and intervention content
           of the myDEx (N=16) in preparation for a small pilot RCT; and,

        3. To implement a small pilot RCT of the refined myDEx (N=120) as compared to the NTHP
           (N=60) intervention, in order to evaluate its feasibility and acceptability and gather
           preliminary efficacy results in reducing sexual risk behaviors.

    <description>The proposed intervention will consist of a 6-session web-based program. Cognizant of challenges maintaining users' attention in a web application and to facilitate delivery through a smartphone, the investigators will design each session to be no more than 20 minutes in length. In the course of these 6 sessions, YMSM will have a total of 120 minutes of intervention exposure. Across sessions, the investigators will emphasize the importance of sexual decision-making across different partner types, help YMSM consider what type of relationship(s) they want, and align these relationship desires with safer sex practices.</description>

    <description>The investigators will create a 6-session attention-control comparison to match the intervention in time and attention yet have non-tailored and non-interactive content (NTHP). NTHP will include HIV/STI information currently available on sex education websites. The attention-control condition allows the investigators to avoid confounding due to content and ensures that all participants receive some HIV prevention content given their high vulnerability to HIV. Further, this comparison will help critically examine the extent to which tailoring increases the acceptability to the program, above and beyond having a non-tailored, non-interactive intervention.</description>
