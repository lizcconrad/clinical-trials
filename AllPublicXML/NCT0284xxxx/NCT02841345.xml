    <textblock>
      In the case of psychotic disorders such as bipolar disorder or schizophrenia, attention
      dysfunction contribute, according to the theories of neuroscience, the development of mood
      disorders following disturbances in the interaction-care emotion. In this context, the
      general objective of this research project is to refine our understanding of the similarities
      and distinctions between bipolar and schizophrenic patients in the basic emotional
      information processing. Specifically, these are: 1) to better understand what level of basic
      emotional information processing both conditions differ or are comparable and in what sense
      and 2) estimate, in both pathologies, the specific influence of the nature of the task of
      processing emotional information. To answer these questions, the investigators have developed
      a protocol to specifically target different information processing channels playing on the
      nature of the spatial frequency content of emotional natural scenes. To estimate in both
      pathologies, the specific influence of the nature of the task on emotional processing, 3
      types of tasks are proposed: 1) a simple task perception and 2) -3) two tasks whose
      categorization one focused on the emotional feelings of the individual and the other on the
      tendency to action. Both tasks categorization should involve more specifically the
      ventromedial prefrontal cortex (CPFVM) and the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC)
      respectively. All patient data will be compared with data from healthy control participants.

      Main goals This research project generally aims to refine our understanding of the
      similarities and distinctions between bipolar and schizophrenic patients in emotional
      information processing.

      Specifically, these are:

        1. better understand what level of emotional information processing both conditions differ
           or are comparable and in what direction

        2. assess specifically in both pathologies, emotional regulation deficits through the
           realization of different cognitive tasks when processing emotional information.

      To answer these questions, the investigators developed an original protocol imaging
      functional magnetic resonance (fMRI) to specifically target different information processing
      channels playing on the nature of the spatial frequency content of emotional natural scenes
      (see Methods). emotional regulation deficits in both disorders will be addressed in part
      through here 3 types of tasks: 1) a simple task perception and 2) -3) two tasks
      categorization of which centered on the emotional feelings of the individual (task affective)
      and the tendency to action (motivational task). Both tasks categorization should involve more
      specifically the Prefrontal Cortex-Ventro Median (CPFVM) and Lateral Prefrontal Cortex-Dorso
      (DLPFC), respectively, distinguishing between the two categories of patients. All patient
      data will be compared to healthy control participants.

      This project will also allow us to improve our knowledge in bipolar and schizophrenic
      patients compared with control subjects, i) on the brain structures of networks involved in
      emotional information processing and emotional regulation, ii) functional relationships still
      unclear between neural structures involved in both processes and iii) the nature of the
      information passing through these networks.

    <description>The experience will include 3 sessions. Each session will consist of the presentation of a pseudo-random sequence of 24 black and white images of negative emotional natural scenes, 24 positive emotional situations and 24 neutral emotional situations.
In the first session, participants will carry out an emotional assessment task: it will show at the end of each test his emotional feeling - pleasant, unpleasant or nothing - using a joystick.
In a second session, the participant will perform a motor task decision: it will show at the end of each test the tendency to action he would handle the situation actually using 3 buttons également- approach withdrawal or neither one nor the other.
In the third session, the participant will perform a simple visual perception task. To be comparable to the engine plane with the other sessions, a non-categorical motor task will be requested from participants.</description>
