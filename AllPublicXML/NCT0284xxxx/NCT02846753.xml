    <textblock>
      A prospective, non-randomized multi-center clinical investigation of the Venus P-Valve™ for
      the treatment of pulmonary regurgitation with or without stenosis in patient with native
      outflow tracts.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the implantation of the Venus P-Valve™ for the treatment of patients
      with an incompetent pulmonic valve, which causes blood to flow back from the pulmonary artery
      into the right heart ventricle during pumping of the heart (pulmonary regurgitation).
      Patients with and without narrowing (stenosis) of the right ventricular outflow tract will be
      included. The purpose of this protocol is to assess the safety and performance of Venus
      P-Valve™ implantation.

      Post-procedure, a clinical visit will be scheduled at 30 days, 6 month, 12 months, and
      annually thereafter to 3 years. Population: Patients≥12 years with a body weight of ≥30kg,
      with significant pulmonary regurgitation (≥3+) with or without right ventricular outflow
      tract (RVOT) stenosis (mean Doppler gradient ≥35mmHg) with native right ventricular outflow
      tracts.

    <description>Occurrence of death or reoperation (Valve and/or procedure related) calculated as a composite freedom-of-death and -reoperation probability at 12 months.

If the lower 95% confidence limit for survival and freedom from reoperation at 12 months is greater than 84%, the acceptance criterion for safety will have been met.</description>
