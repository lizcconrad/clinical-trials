  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Study design is a Phase IIb prospective multi-center, randomized, placebo-controlled,
      double-blind clinical trial. The goal will be to enroll 80 infants with Tuberous Sclerosis
      Complex who are less than 6 months of age prior to the onset of their first seizure
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The central hypothesis of this Phase IIb trial is that early identification of
      electroencephalography (EEG) biomarkers and early treatment versus delayed treatment with
      vigabatrin in infants with tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) will have a positive impact on
      developmental outcomes at 24 months of age. It would also prevent or lower the risk of
      developing infantile spasms and refractory seizures. This preventative approach would be
      expected to result in more favorable long-term cognitive, behavioral, developmental and
      psychiatric outcomes and significantly improve overall quality of life. It is a randomized,
      double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial design. Successful completion of this trial
      will also advance the field by demonstrating the value of systematic surveillance with EEG in
      asymptomatic infants with TSC.
