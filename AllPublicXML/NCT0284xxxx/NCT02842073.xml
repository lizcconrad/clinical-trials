      This is an open-label Phase IIa pilot study of the tolerability and effects on binge drinking
      of bupropion and naltrexone for binge drinkers and assess cortical adaptation to tactile
      stimuli in subjects with binge drinking.

      Participants: Investigators will recruit 12 men or women ages 21-34 years who exhibit a
      minimum of 5/3 (men/women) or more binge drinking episodes per month over the past three
      months. A binge drinking episode is defined as the consumption of 5/4 (men/women) standard
      drinks (~12 gms ethanol) in about a two hour period. Subjects may meet DSM-V criteria for
      mild or moderate alcohol use disorder. Subjects with overt physical dependence on alcohol,
      significant medical problems including seizures or bulimia, other substance use disorder
      except for occasional marijuana (based on toxicology screen) or significant psychiatric
      illness will be excluded.

      Procedures (methods): As a first step in human trials investigators will give open label
      bupropion + naltrexone to active binge drinking subjects. The primary goal here is to assess
      tolerability and acceptability though changes in binge drinking and subjective sense of
      &quot;effect&quot; will be gathered as well. Investigators will also test cortical adaptation to binge
      drinking by completing tactile sensory testing and comparing the results to controls and
      individuals with overt physical dependence on alcohol. Investigators will recruit subjects
      using the e-mail listserve for UNC students, faculty and staff.

      Investigators will use standard clinical doses of bupropion-XL 300 mg/d (lower seizure risk)
      and naltrexone 50 mg/d dispensed by the UNC Investigational Drug Services. Bupropion XL will
      be initiated at 150 mg/d on Days 1-4 and increased to 300 mg/d for Days 5-84. Naltrexone will
      be initiated at 25 mg/d from Days 7-9 and then go to 50 mg/d for Days 10-84. Subjects will be
      seen at screening and then at Weeks 0, 1, 3, 5, 8 and 12. Subjects will be breathalyzed and
      receive Medical Management counseling to encourage compliance and progress towards drinking
      goals. Investigators will use the Time Line Follow-Back approach to assess alcohol
      consumption history modified to include time taken to consume alcohol and define a binge.
      They will also measure craving for alcohol and will assess tolerability by probing for
      adverse effects. Key outcomes of interest include tolerability and acceptability, drinking
      behavior including frequency and intensity of binge drinking, and craving for alcohol.
      Because this is an open-label trial without a placebo comparison group no formal statistics
      will be completed and efficacy will not be assessed. Instead, this pilot study will inform
      investigators about the recruitment of binge drinkers, the tolerability and acceptability of
      bupropion/naltrexone in this population and potential efficacy signals.

    <description>Craving for alcohol will be assessed using the Penn Alcohol Craving Scale (PACS) The PACS is a five-item self-administered instrument for assessing craving. Frequency, intensity, and duration of thoughts about drinking are assessed along with ability to resist drinking. The final item asks the responder to provide an average rating of his/her craving over the course of the past week. The questions on the PACS use descriptors coupled with numerical ratings ranging from 0 to 6.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Men and women between the ages of 21 and 34 years.

          2. A minimum of 5/3 (men/women) or more binge drinking episodes per month over the past
             three months. A binge drinking episode is defined as the consumption of 5/4
             (men/women) standard drinks (~12 gms ethanol) in about a two hour period. Subjects may
             meet DSM-V criteria for mild or moderate alcohol use disorder.

          3. Ability to understand and sign written informed consent.

          4. Must have a 0.0 gms/dl breathalyzer reading on the day of screening and 0.0 gms/dl on
             the day of randomization.

          5. Must have a stable residence and be able to identify an individual who could contact
             participant if needed.

          6. Have a goal of sobriety or significantly reducing alcohol intake.

        Exclusion Criteria

          1. Presence of physical dependence on alcohol as assessed by clear tolerance to alcohol
             or alcohol withdrawal symptoms based on SCID interview or a Severe Alcohol Use
             Disorder (&gt;5 SCID DSM-V symptoms).

          2. Bupropion is contraindicated in individuals with a history of bulimia or a seizure
             disorder and naltrexone is contraindicated in acute liver disease and in patients
             using or misusing opioids.

          3. Clinically significant medical disease that might interfere with the evaluation of the
             study medication or present a safety concern (e.g., renal insufficiency, cirrhosis,
             unstable hypertension, diabetes mellitus, seizure disorder). Clinically significant
             psychiatric illness including any psychotic disorder, bipolar disorder,
             anorexia/bulimia, severe depression, or suicidal ideation.

          4. Other substance abuse or dependence disorder other than nicotine or cannabis abuse.

          5. Concurrent use of anticonvulsants. Concurrent use of any psychotropic medication
             including antidepressants, mood stabilizers, antipsychotics, anxiolytics, stimulants,
             or hypnotics with the exception of stable doses of antidepressants for one month.
             Bupropion is commonly added to antidepressants for augmentation so the use of another
             antidepressant does not represent a safety concern. Prior history of adverse reaction
             to bupropion or naltrexone.

          6. AST or ALT &gt; 3.5 times ULN or bilirubin &gt; 1.5 X ULN.

          7. Positive urine toxicology screen with the exception of cannabis. Individuals with
             positive cannabis screens will be excluded only if they have a history of cannabis
             dependence.

          8. Pregnant women and women of childbearing potential who do not practice a medically
             acceptable form of birth control (oral or depot contraceptive, or barrier methods such
             as diaphragm or condom with spermicidal).

          9. Women who are breastfeeding.

         10. Individuals requiring inpatient treatment or more intense outpatient treatment for
             their alcohol problems.

         11. Participation in any clinical trial within the past 60 days that would have safety
             concerns for the trial.

         12. Court-mandated participation in alcohol treatment or pending incarceration.
