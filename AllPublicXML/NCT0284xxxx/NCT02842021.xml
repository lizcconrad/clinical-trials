      To assess the efficacy and safety of a combination product S2G6T-1 compared to its monads and
      vehicle, applied twice daily for 7 days, in the treatment of symptomatic inflammatory
      interdigital tinea pedis in subjects 12 years of age and older. The results of this study
      will be utilized to perform power calculations for the Phase 3 pivotal trials.
