      Lung cancer is one of the most common cancer and the leading causes of cancer death in
      worldwide. Approximately 80% of NSCLC were inoperable. The prognosis of patients with
      LA-NSCLC remains disappointing. Investigators hypothesized that use of simultaneous
      integrated boost intensity modulated radiotherapy (SIB-IMRT) technology can safety increasing
      the radiation dose and benefit for inoperable NSCLC patients.

      Lung cancer is one of the most common cancer and the leading causes of cancer death in
      patients worldwide. Approximately 80% of NSCLC were inoperable. Concurrent chemo-radiation
      therapy (CCRT) is a standard treatment for locally advanced NSCLC who are not candidates for
      surgery. Nevertheless, the prognosis of patients with locally advanced NSCLC (LA-NSCLC) is
      still poor. Local control (LC) after CCRT is one of the most important prognostic factors.
      Local failure is common after standard-dose chemoradiation for NSCLC. Studies of stereotactic
      body radiation therapy (SBRT) have shown a steep dose response in treating early-stage lung
      cancer. Improving the total dose and shortening the overall treatment time may be effective
      for improving the LC rates. However, problems remain due to the toxicity to adjacent critical
      structures (e.g,lung,heart, esophagus), the target volumes usually limits the doses escalated
      that cannot be safely delivered by conventional radiotherapy techniques. In order to avoid
      the acute and late radiation toxicity of normal tissues, different dose prescriptions can be
      delivered to different target volumes in the same fraction, which deliver a higher dose to
      the Gross Tumor Volume (GTV) and a relatively lower dose to the subclinical disease. The
      technique is called simultaneous integrated boost intensity modulated radiotherapy
      (SIB-IMRT).

      Investigators hypothesized that use of SIB-IMRT technology can safety increasing the
      radiation dose and benefit for inoperable NSCLC patients.

Per RECIST, CR: disappearance of all target lesions, all non-target lesions, and no new lesion; PR: a &gt;=30% decrease in the sum of the longest dimensions of the target lesions (TLs) taking as a reference the baseline sum, no unequivocal progression of non-TLs, and no new lesions; progressive disease (PD), a &gt;=20% increase in TLs, clearly worsening of non-TLs, or emergence of new lesions; stable disease (SD): no change or small changes that do not meet previously given criteria for CR, PR or PD.</description>
