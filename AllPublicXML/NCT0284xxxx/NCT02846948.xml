  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to identify the diagnostic value of the focused assessed
      echocardiography protocol (FATE - Holm et al 2012) for patients undergoing urgent abdominal
      surgery and having signs of sepsis. The extended cardiac monitoring may affect patient's
      management during perioperative period. The investigators expect that the incidence of
      hemodynamic instability will be reduced and the outcomes of the patients will be improved.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Often sepsis remains undiagnosed at the very beginning because of the concentration to the
      surgical pathology in perioperative period. This results in unacceptably high mortality. The
      investigators hypothesize that extended hemodynamic monitoring by focused echocardiography
      will allow early detection of hemodynamic instability, which cannot be clinically diagnosed
      yet.

      The goals of the investigators study are:

        -  To conduct two-group randomized controlled clinical trial to compare patient management
           based on standard monitoring and extended hemodynamic monitoring by focused
           echocardiography in patients undergoing urgent abdominal surgery.

        -  To demonstrate that patient management based on extended hemodynamic monitoring by
           focused echocardiography results in reduced incidence of hemodynamic instability during
           perioperative period.

        -  To compare an amount of administrated of intravenous fluids in both groups.

      The investigators hypothesize that focused echocardiography monitoring will result in more
      administrated intravenous fluids during perioperative period.
