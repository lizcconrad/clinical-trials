  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Colonization with Staphylococcus aureus is related to inflammation in atopic dermatitis.
      Gladskin is a product for topical use containing the proprietary enzyme Staphefekt SA.100,
      which has the ability to specifically lyse the cell wall of S. aureus. The investigators
      hypothesize that Staphefekt decreases S. aureus colonization of the skin and consequently
      decreases symptoms of atopic dermatitis.The goal of this study is to determine the effect of
      Staphefekt on the use of topical corticosteroids in patients with atopic dermatitis.
      Secondary goals are to retrieve information about the effect on clinical symptoms, quality of
      life, growth characteristics of Staphylococcus aureus and the further microbiome.

      This is a multi center intervention study with a placebo controlled, double blind and
      randomized design. After standardization of corticosteroid treatment (triamcinolone acetonide
      0.1% cream), patients will be randomized in a 1:1 fashion to either treatment with Staphefekt
      SA.100 for 12 weeks or treatment with a placebo for 12 weeks. Topical corticosteroid use will
      be evaluated 2, 6, 12 and 20 weeks after start of the intervention. Swabs of the skin, nose
      and throat will be collected at baseline, week 2, 12 and 20.
