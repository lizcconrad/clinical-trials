  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hypertension is a major cardiovascular risk factor. Heart failure is one of its main
      complications but the factors that influence its development are still insufficiently known.
      The primary objective is to determine associated factors to the occurrence of left
      ventricular (LV) systolic dysfunction assessed by an alteration of the Global Longitudinal
      Strain (GLS) after more than the years of hypertension. The secondary objective is to
      estimate the prevalence of LV systolic dysfunction in a cohort of hypertensive people
      followed for over 10 years and formulate pathophysiological hypotheses on the development of
      this heart disease.

      Some of the hypertensive patients will develop a post hypertensive heart disease. This
      hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is now essentially defined by the association of LV hypertrophy
      and diastolic dysfunction. Investigators believe this hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is also
      characterized by early impairment of systolic function but mainly in its longitudinal
      component (assessed by measuring the GLS) and therefore exposed to cardiovascular events.

      The work is based on an existing cohort of hypertensive patients included more than 10 years
      ago before any initiation of antihypertensive therapy in the hypertension unit of the
      Bordeaux University Hospital, France. Patients will be contacted for further consultation
      with a cardiologist to identify patients with a LV systolic dysfunction. The primary
      end-point is a decrease of the longitudinal systolic function with a GLS&lt;-17% for men and
      &lt;-19% for women.

      A sufficient number of patients will be contacted in order to collect data of at least 400
      patients after more than 10-year of follow-up.
