    <textblock>
      Body composition analysis and especially body fat distribution in regions of interest
      (android and in particular intra-abdominal region) provides some information on the risk of
      cardiovascular disease. There is little data available on the body composition analysis in
      psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis (diseases with higher risk of cardiovascular disease), in
      particular data on fat distribution in regions of interest regarding the risk of
      cardiovascular disease.

      Adipokines, secreted by the adipose tissue, have pro or anti-inflammatory and metabolic
      properties that are interesting to explore in pathologies with a higher risk of
      cardiovascular disease like psoriasis or psoriatic arthritis.

      Adipokines have been investigated in psoriasis but fat tissue and in particular its
      distribution (android/visceral or intra-abdominal) has not been studied in parallel.
      Moreover, relation between adipokines and psoriasis area or severity has been studied but the
      relation between adipokines and cardiovascular risk factors has not yet been investigated.

      The aim of this study is to investigate relations between the body fat distribution,
      adipokines rates and the risk of cardiovascular disease of these patients.
