      The Cohera Sylys® Surgical Sealant study is a prospective, randomized, controlled,
      multicenter clinical study comparing standard anastomosis closure technique (Control) to
      standard closure technique plus Sylys® Surgical Sealant (Test) in patients undergoing a
      colectomy procedure with a stapled anastomosis.
