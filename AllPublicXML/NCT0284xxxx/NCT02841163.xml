      Measurement of herniated disc resorption and assessment of satisfaction regarding
      post-treatment state and integrative Korean medicine treatment through phone interview in 500
      patients with MRI follow-up results receiving treatment for lumbar and cervical disc
      herniation at Jaseng Hospital of Korean Medicine.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Intervertebral disc herniation treatment can be largely divided into conservative and
      surgical approaches, and the greater majority of patients show relief of symptoms and
      resorption of herniated disc through non-surgical, conservative management. Despite concerns
      that early surgical interventions in intervertebral disc herniation without allowing for
      sufficient conservative treatment may indicate overtreatment, awareness and understanding in
      the general public is found somewhat lacking.

      The objective of this study is to measure herniated disc resorption and assess satisfaction
      regarding post-treatment state and integrative Korean medicine treatment through phone
      interview in 500 patients with MRI follow-up results before and after receiving conservative
      treatment for lumbar and cervical disc herniation at Jaseng Hospital of Korean Medicine.
