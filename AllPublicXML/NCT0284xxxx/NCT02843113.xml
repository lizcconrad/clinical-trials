    <textblock>
      Through Stepping Up 4 Your Child, non-custodial fathers will be provided with a
      comprehensive, solution-oriented program featuring group based parent education and
      individualized case management to help them achieve financial independence, increase their
      parenting skills, and develop a co-parenting alliance.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Fathers' involvement in their children's lives has received increased attention in recent
      years. In response, support has grown for responsible fatherhood programs aimed at improving
      the quantity and quality of fathers' involvement. Research on these programs has concluded
      that factors such as fathers' parenting skills, co-parenting relationship quality, and
      socioeconomic status all impact fathers' ability to contribute to their children's growth and
      development. Using this previous research as a foundation, the Stepping Up 4 Your Child
      project will go beyond traditional fatherhood initiatives by integrating the provision of
      responsible parenting, economic stability, and relationship education services to fathers at
      risk for paternal disengagement. To do so, the University of Louisville's Kent School of
      Social Work will leverage its existing relationship with the Kentucky Office of Child Support
      Enforcement. Specifically, through Stepping Up 4 Your Child, non-custodial fathers will be
      provided with a comprehensive, solution-oriented program featuring group based parent
      education and individualized case management to help them achieve financial independence,
      increase their parenting skills, and develop a co-parenting alliance. Given that each of
      these focus areas have all been cited as three of the strongest predictors of paternal
      engagement, Stepping Up 4 Your Child and the results of its evaluation will have significant
      implications for the families it serves, as well as the practitioners, researchers, and
      policymakers interested in responsible fatherhood. 1

    <measure>Change in Fathering Knowledge and Skills.</measure>
    <time_frame>immediate after intervention, at 3 months later and at 6 months later</time_frame>
    <description>Fathering knowledge and skills will be measured using the 24/7 Dad Fathering Skills Survey (National Fatherhood Initiative, 2010). This survey has 25 items that are multiple choice response questions. This survey comes with the 24/7 Dad curriculum packet. Given that this survey is a measure of fathering knowledge and not a standardized scale, no reliability data are available.</description>

    <measure>Change in Fathers' Parenting Behavior.</measure>
    <time_frame>immediate after intervention, at 3 months later and at 6 months later</time_frame>
    <description>Fathers' reported parenting behavior will be measured using the Index of Father Involvement (Hawkins et al., 2002). This measure has 9 factors loaded as subscales designed to tap direct and indirect forms of involvement and a total of 26 items. All items are measured on a 5 point scale ranging from A (excellent) to F (failing). The measure has a reported reliability/internal consistency score of .69</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Co-Parenting Relationship Quality.</measure>
    <time_frame>immediate after intervention, at 3 months later and at 6 months later</time_frame>
    <description>Co-Parenting Relationship Quality. Co-parenting relationship quality will be measured using the Co-parenting Questionnaire (CQ, Margolis, Gordis, &amp; John, 2001). This measure is a 14-item self-report instrument examining: 1) the amount of conflict between parents surrounding parenting issues, 2) cooperation as the extent to which mothers and fathers support, value, and respect each other as parents and the degree to which they ease one another's parenting burden, and 3) triangulation, the extent to which parents distort parent-child boundaries by attempting to form a coalition with the child that undermines or excludes the other parent. The 14 items form a three factor structure and have good internal consistency with alphas for the 3 factors and the total scale ranging from .69 to .87.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Conflict Resolution Skills.</measure>
    <time_frame>immediate after intervention, at 3 months later and at 6 months later</time_frame>
    <description>The Stanley-Markman Relationship Dynamics Scale (Renick et al, 1992) will be used to measure conflict resolution skills. This measure has reported Chronbach's alpha levels of .73 and .81 (Stanley et al, 2006) and strong predictive validity for relationship failure.</description>

    <measure>Change in Communication Skills.</measure>
    <time_frame>immediate after intervention, at 3 months later and at 6 months later</time_frame>
    <description>Communication skills will be measured through the Communication Patterns Questionnaire to assess communication skills. This measure has strong discriminant validity and Chronbach's alpha levels ranging from .73 to .88 (Noller &amp; White, 1990).</description>

    <description>Participants assigned to treatment group that includes case management will receive an initial assessment to determine their strengths and needs. The participant will then work collaboratively with their case manager to connect to community resources to meet his needs. To do so, the case manager will meet with the participant using the following schedule: Months 1-2: intervention in the form of weekly face-to-face meeting with a case manager, plus a weekly phone call from a case manager; Months 3-4: intervention in the form of face-to-face meeting every other week, plus a weekly phone call; Months 5-6: intervention in the form of face-to-face meeting once a month, plus a weekly phone call.</description>
