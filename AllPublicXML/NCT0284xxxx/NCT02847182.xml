  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single site, prospective, randomized, double-blind study of a single intravenous
      autologous or allogeneic, unrelated cord blood (CB) infusion in children ages 2-7 years with
      Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). Participants will be randomly assigned to Sequence A,
      consisting of a single infusion of CB cells at baseline followed 6 months later by a single
      infusion of placebo, or Sequence B, consisting of an infusion of placebo at baseline followed
      6 months later by an infusion of CB cells. All participants will ultimately be treated with
      CB cells at some point during the study. Participants with an available qualified autologous
      CB unit will receive autologous cells, and those without a suitable autologous CB unit
      available will receive cells from a ≥4/6 HLA-matched, ABO-matched allogeneic, unrelated donor
      CB unit from the Carolinas Cord Blood Bank. All infusions will be double-blinded. The primary
      outcomes will be assessed 6 months after the initial infusion in the sequence. Additional
      testing for secondary exploratory analyses will be performed at 12 months. Duration of study
      participation will be 12 months from the time of baseline infusion.
