  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of Advanced Fetal Imaging - Phase II is to advance fetal MRI imaging by designing
      MRI coils specifically for pregnant women and testing recently developed MRI image
      acquisition techniques. The investigators aim to more reliably obtain higher quality fetal
      MRI images when compared to current clinical fetal MRI.

    <textblock>
      The main aim of this project is to evaluate and optimize the existing clinical magnetic
      resonance (MR) techniques for fetal imaging, and to also implement and test new MR
      technologies that would improve fetal imaging in general. This involves the development of
      new pulse sequences and image acquisition schemes that &quot;freeze&quot; fetal motion and hence
      provide improved image quality and robustness for both structural (T1- and T2- weighted,
      susceptibility and FLAIR imaging) and physiological imaging (diffusion, perfusion,
      spectroscopy, resting-state functional MRI, etc). The scope of this project also includes
      testing of newly developed radio frequency (RF) receive-only coil arrays that would
      inherently provide the means for faster imaging of the fetus, and thus complement the
      software developments.

    <description>Pregnant women who are able to have an MRI are eligible for the 60 minute research full MRI scan. Pregnant women may have a healthy pregnancy, a concern for fetal/placental abnormalities with a clinical fetal MRI ordered by their doctor, or a concern for fetal/placental abnormalities without a clinical fetal MRI ordered by their doctor.
The investigational MRI coil designed for pregnant women and research MRI sequences will be tested during the 60 minute research scan.</description>

    <description>Pregnant women with a concern for fetal/placental abnormalities with a clinical fetal MRI at Boston Children's Hospital are eligible for the 15 minute research add-on MRI scan.
The research MRI sequences will also be tested during the add-on research MRI scan.</description>

    <description>The investigational MRI receiver coil designed specifically for pregnant women will be used during the 60 minute full research MRI scan. An MRI receiver coil is part of the MRI machine that is placed over the body part being imaged during every MRI scan. A coil is required to obtain MR images, yet there isn't one designed for pregnant women. This investigational MRI receiver coil for pregnant women will be tested to see if it helps improve image quality and take images faster.</description>
