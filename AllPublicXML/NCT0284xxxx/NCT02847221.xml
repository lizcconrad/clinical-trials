  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Successful weaning from mechanical ventilation in ICU patients depends on patient ability to
      breathe spontaneously and on cough efficiency. Previous studies found that cough peak flow
      (CPF) at 60 L/min threshold predicted extubation failure. These studies measured CPF using a
      dedicated flow-meter that required patient disconnection from the ventilator, limiting the
      generalizability of this procedure. This study aimed to predict extubation outcome in a
      consecutive series of patients by measuring CPF from the ventilator flow-meter. CPF
      measurements were done by freezing ventilator screen and scrolling the cursor to the maximal
      value of CPF during expiration and Tidal Volume (TV) in preceding inspiration.

      The objective was to assess the performance of CPF to predict early extubation outcome.
