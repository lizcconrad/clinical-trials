  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cancer-specific splice variants gain significant interest as they generate neo-antigens, that
      could be targeted by immune cells. CD20, a membrane antigen broadly expressed in mature B
      cell lymphomas, is subject to an alternative splicing named Delta-CD20 leading to loss of
      membrane expression of the spliced isoform.

      The investigators group would now determine if it's possible, in patients with
      lymphoproliferative B, to detect the presence of a specific memory response to delta-CD20
      peptides.

      If this memory response exists, it will confirm the interest of this antigen as a target for
      tumor immunotherapy.

    <description>In Cohort A, patients will be included either in the group &quot;sustainable response&quot;or in the &quot;short / refractory response&quot; group.
- &quot;sustainable response&quot; group : patient with NHL diffuse large B cells, and persistent complete response for at least 6 months after first-line treatment with Rituximab OR patient with follicular NHL, mantle NHL, NHL marginal zone or Waldenstrom's disease in complete response or partial stable response for at least 1 year after first line treatment with Rituximab
&quot;short / refractory response&quot; group : patient with NHL diffuse large B cells, refractory or relapsed in less than 6 months after at least one line of treatment with Rituximab OR patient with follicular NHL, mantle NHL, NHL marginal zone or Waldenstrom's disease refractory or relapsed / progression within less than 1 year after at least one line of treatment with Rituximab</description>

    <description>For Cohort B patients will be included either in the group &quot;B hematologic therapeutic abstention&quot; or in the group &quot;any blood disease not treated with anti-CD20 antibodies.&quot;
&quot;B hematologic therapeutic abstention&quot; group : patient with hematological malignancy whatever the initial expansion stage
&quot;any blood disease not treated with anti-CD20 antibodies&quot; group : patient with follicular NHL, mantle NHL, NHL marginal zone or Waldenstorm disease without treatment criteria at diagnosis and with stable disease for at least 6 months</description>
