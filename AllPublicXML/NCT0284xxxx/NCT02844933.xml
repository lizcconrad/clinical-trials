      The primary objective of this study is to assess the efficacy of Cannabidiol Oral Solution on
      hyperphagia-related behavior in subjects with Prader-Willi Syndrome (PWS). The secondary
      objectives of this study are to assess the efficacy, safety and tolerability, impact on
      quality of life, and impact on physical activity of Cannabidiol Oral Solution in subjects
      with PWS.
