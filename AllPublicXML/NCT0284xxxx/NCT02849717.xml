      The purpose of this study is to see whether exercise can improve the health and well-being of
      patients scheduled to undergo surgery for a bowel related condition.

    <textblock>
      The proposed randomized controlled trial aims to recruit 60 patients that have a primary
      diagnosis of either colon or rectal cancer, inflammatory bowl disease, or diverticular
      disease and are scheduled for elective surgery. This two-arm clinical trial of an
      intervention examining the efficacy of a home-based walking and progressive resistance
      exercise program for the relief of post-operative fatigue and improvement of functional
      outcome following surgery.
