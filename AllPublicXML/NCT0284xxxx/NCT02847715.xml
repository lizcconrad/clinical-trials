  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Improvements in cancer treatment have led to an increasing number of patients being cured or
      in remission, but they are followed up to detect recurrence, manage persistent symptoms and
      late treatment effects. With growing survivors, traditional hospital follow-up is not
      sustainable. New models of follow-up care are needed. This research project aims to develop
      and establish the feasibility of introducing a new electronic care pathway/system for remote
      monitoring ovarian cancer patients in remission. The project includes a development phase,
      followed by a before-and-after study to explore the feasibility of a new pathway/system for
      remote monitoring.

      Background Improvements in cancer treatment have led to an increasing number of patients
      being cured or in remission, but they are followed up to detect recurrence, manage persistent
      symptoms and late treatment effects. With growing survivors, traditional hospital follow-up
      is not sustainable. New models of follow-up care are needed.

      Aim To develop and establish the feasibility of introducing a new electronic care
      pathway/system for remote monitoring ovarian cancer patients in remission.

      Methods An existing online patient symptom reporting system will be extended for use in
      remote follow-up. A tracking program will be developed and IT systems integrated in the local
      hospitals.

      Development Phase:

      a) Scoping literature review of existing validated symptom measures. b) Consultation with
      expert groups to establish choice of questions, relevant symptoms, timing/frequency for
      monitoring. c) Interviews with patients and clinicians to explore current pathway and
      redesign.

      Before-and-After Study A multi-centred quasi-experimental between-subjects before-and-after
      design will compare usual care (control) with the new electronic care pathway/system. 168
      participants will be recruited from Leeds, Bradford, Calderdale &amp; Huddersfield, and Airedale
      (N=84 Leeds, N=84 other sites). Both phases will recruit for ~12 months.

      In the control group, 84 eligible patients (post-treatment) will be recruited and data
      collected at routine appointments for 12 months on clinical outcomes and 6 monthly
      patient-reported outcomes.

      In the intervention consenting patients (N=84) will be reminded to use the system every ~3
      months and have a blood test by their GP. Information will be displayed in respective EPR.
      Patients will always have the option to speak to/see their 'key clinician'. Virtual clinics
      will be held for clinicians to review/respond to the data. Clinical and patient outcomes will
      be collected, and end-of-study interviews conducted.

      Outcomes

        -  Develop a new electronic care pathway/system for remote monitoring patients in remission

        -  Obtain initial data on clinical and patient feasibility.

    <description>In the after-phase of the before-and-after study, a group of 84 patients will be recruited and followed over a 12 month period. Patients in this group will be assigned to the new remote monitoring follow-up pathway (ePRIME), whereby instead of attending routine outpatient appointments they are monitored remoted via a online symptom monitoring questionnaire and related clinical tests undertaken remotely. All information is collated in the patient's electronic patient record, and clinicians will review/respond to the data as necessary.</description>

    <intervention_name>ePRIME</intervention_name>
    <description>ePRIME is an remote monitoring pathway that includes an online system for patients to self-report symptoms and AE following cancer treatments. ePRIME allows AE reporting from home and enables patient reported data to be integrated into existing EPR to allow for the reports to be used in routine care. In addition the system is capable of generating alerts for serious symptoms to the relevant clinical team and providing patient advice on managing mild and moderate symptoms.</description>
