    <textblock>
      The intrauterine devices are a safe, reliable, long-acting and reversible contraceptive
      method. It is also sound safe and cheap contraceptive methods available and is nearly
      maintenance free for up to 10 years.

      The fear and the pain associated with intrauterine devices insertion consider barriers to
      using this contraception method, this is because that the mucosal lining of female genital
      tract is highly sensitive to touch and pain. However; most of small procedures done in this
      sensitive area are performed without analgesia.

      The pain during intrauterine devices insertion is due to application of the tenaculum ,
      traction of the cervical canal, passing the uterine sound, insertion of the intrauterine
      devices through the cervix, and irritation of the endometrial lining by the intrauterine
      devices .

      Previous studies have reported different lines to decrease pain during intrauterine device
      insertion starting by simple methods such as pre-insertion ibuprofen use, intracervical or
      intrauterine lidocaine and misoprostol up to paracervical blocks.

      Previous studies, in literature, have found that the most painful steps during intrauterine
      devices insertion were uterine sounding then intrauterine device insertion itself, followed
      by tenaculum placement. One recent study addressed pain effect using an atraumatic vulsellum
      and a single-tooth tenaculum on pain perception during intrauterine devices and found no
      difference in reported pain.

    <description>The speculum was placed into the vagina and the cervix was cleansed with povidone iodine. After placement of single toothed vulsellum on the anterior lip of the cervix, for traction and fixation of the uterus, the uterine sound was inserted for determination of uterine length and uterine position followed by Cu-IUD insertion. The duration of IUD insertion were reported.</description>

    <description>after bimanual examination, the same sonographer (Level II experience) performed transvaginal /US using a SonoAce X6 machine (Medison, Korea) with transvaginal probe (4-8 MHz frequency, using an average 6.5 MHz). Firstly, he evaluated the uterine position. Then, he measured the endometrial and cervical stripe lengths in the sagittal view of the uterus and summed to have the actual length of the uterus; by which the IUD tube was adjusted before insertion.The same speculum and vulsellum were used and the IUD was inserted directly into the uterine cavity.</description>
