      The purpose of this study is to determine if fluorescence angiography can detect occult shock
      (hypoperfusion).
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hypoperfusion may be multifactorial, due to hemorrhage, shock or other disease processes
      resulting in either capillary leak into the interstitium or profound vasodilatation.
      Currently, diagnosis of hypoperfusion depends on indirect markers of perfusion such as
      lactate, blood pressure, creatinine, urine output, and mental status. These are all late
      signs of hypoperfusion as they are precursors to impending system failure. In this study, the
      focus will be on one of the most common causes of hypoperfusion in the surgical population;
      sepsis and septic shock.

    <description>We aim to obtain a SPI within 6 hours of enrollment. Skin perfusion images produced by LUNA have computerized, graded quantification of fluorescein intensity (values 0-256). The mean score will be used to compare Sepsis and Control arms.</description>

    <description>Upon enrollment following written, informed consent, the patient will receive an injection of 7.5 mg of Indocyanine Green (ICG) intravenously (Dilute 25 mg of Indocyanine Green (ICG) with 10 cc of solvent to achieve a 2.5 mg/cc concentration.) Following injection, Novadaq's LUNA™ fluorescence angiography system will be utilized to map a standard skin perfusion image (SPI) over the upper extremities and anterior chest wall.</description>

        of General Surgery, Trauma, and Surgical Critical Care and 2) admitted to the surgical
        intensive care units will be screened for eligibility based on enrollment criteria.
