  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The prevalence of malnutrition in hospital is very high (30 percent) with major consequences
      in terms of morbidity and mortality, generating significant health care costs. The positive
      impact of its support is demonstrated.

      The HAS (French High Sanitary Authority) recommends a screening of all adult hospitalized in
      the first 48 hours, with no consensus regarding the organization of screening within care
      services. Various strategies have been implemented. Although this screening is part of the
      nursing role, old and recent studies show that it is not done systematically and nutritional
      disorders are largely under-diagnosed and therefore untreated.

      The investigators assume that an organization of screening for eating disorders, based on a
      caregiver dedicated to this activity, improves the indicator IPAQSS (Indicateurs Pour
      l'Amélioration de la Qualité et de la Sécurité des Soins) which is an indicator for the
      improvement of the quality and security of care) Screening indicator of nutritional disorders
      Level 3, compared to an organization &quot;classic&quot; involving the care teams in their entirety.
      This indicator reflects the care system performance.

      In this study, patients will have no intervention. Only the organization of the care staff
      will be adapted but with no changes on the care of patients?

      Undernutrition in the hospital is a public health issue. The impacts of this malnutrition are
      known , with consequences clearly established on the morbidity, mortality and quality of
      life. Undernutrition is an independent risk factor for mortality (5). In terms of morbidity,
      the most frequently reported consequences are infections, postoperative complications
      (delayed healing, in particular nosocomial infections, risk of pressure ulcers) and
      pejorative impact on the prognosis of chronic diseases such as respiratory failure , heart
      and kidney.

      Malnutrition therefore affects the length of hospital stays and the burden of care.

      Many studies have shown the positive impact of the medical care of malnutrition on morbidity
      and mortality, whether intervention studies in general hospital population or in specific
      pathologies.

      But there is no systematic screening strategy undernutrition implementation in hospitals.

      The investigators assume that the organization of screening for eating disorders based on a
      caregiver specifically dedicated to this activity, improves the indicator IPAQSS Screening
      indicator of nutritional disorders level 3 compared with a &quot;classic&quot; organization shared
      between different actors of care. This indicator reflects the care system performance This
      organization must advance quickly and significantly the number of patients evaluated
      nutritionally and help reach a level of completeness close to 100%.
