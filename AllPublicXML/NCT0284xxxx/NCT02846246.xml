  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Current home care service are to a large extent task oriented with a limited focus on care
      recipient's involvement. Furthermore, studies have shown that low care recipients'
      involvement might decrease older people's quality of life. Person-centred care focusing on
      involvement has improved the quality of life and the satisfaction with care for older people
      in health care and nursing homes but there is a lack of knowledge about the effects and
      meaning of a person-centred interventions in aged care at home. Present study describes the
      evaluation of a person-centred and health-promoting intervention.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a non-randomised controlled trial with a before-after approach. The investigators
      will include 270 home care recipients &gt;65 years, 270 family members and 65 staff in
      intervention group and control group respectively. Participants will be recruited from a
      municipality in northern Sweden. The intervention involves letting the person and family
      together with contact nurse prioritise care content and make rearrangements to make sure the
      home care service maximises the potential to satisfy psychosocial, physical, and functional
      needs and increasing health. Outcome assessment will focus on; a) quality of life (primary
      outcomes), thriving and satisfaction with care for older people, b) caregiver strain,
      informal caregiving engagement and satisfaction with care for relatives, c) job satisfaction
      and stress for care staff. Evaluation will be performed by questionnaires and interviews.

      Person-centred home care services have the potential to improve the recurrently reported
      sub-standard experiences of home care services and the study result will hopefully lead the
      way in establish a person-centred and health-promoting model in aged care and living
      conditions for older people.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change of Quality of Life assessed with the Nottingham Health Profile scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 12 and 24 month follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>The Nottingham Health Profile scale will be used to assess quality of life. Nottingham health profile includes 38 items in six dimensions: energy level, pain, emotional reaction, sleep, social isolation, and physical abilities. Each item is answered through Yes/No statements and range from best (0) to worst (100) possible score. The Nottingham Health Profile has been found to be sensitive for changes, valid and reliable.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change of Quality of Life assessed with the EQ-5D</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 12 and 24 month follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>As a complement, the EQ-5D will also be used to assess quality of life. The EQ-5D consists of two parts, a health state description and a visual analogue scale. The health state description comprises five dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression. Each dimension has five levels on a Likert-scale: none (0) to extreme (4). The visual analogue scale rates participants overall health between endpoints, worst imaginable health (0) and best imaginable health (100). EQ-5D has been found to be sensitive for changes and valid.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in thriving assessed with the Thriving of Older People Assessment Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 12 and 24 month follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>Thriving will be assessed with The Thriving of Older People Assessment Scale which includes 32 items and consists of five sub-scales: resident attitude towards the place where they are living, quality of the care and care-givers, activities and peer relationships, opportunities to keep in touch with people and places of importance, and qualities in the physical environment. Each item has six answer alternatives on a Likert-scale ranging from No (1) to Yes, I agree completely (6). The Thriving of Older People Assessment Scale has been found to be valid and reliable.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in satisfaction with home care service assessed with the Quality of Care from the Patients' Perspective</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 12 and 24 month follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>Satisfaction with home care service will be measured with The Quality of Care from the Patients' Perspective which includes 64 items and consists of four dimensions: medical-technical competence (11 items), physical-technical conditions (10 items), identity-oriented approach (30 items) and social-cultural atmosphere (13 items). Each item should be answered in two ways; perceived reality and subjective importance. Perceived reality range between Not applicable (1) to Fully agree (5) on a five level Likert-scale while the subjective importance range between Of very great importance (1) to of little importance (4). The Quality of Care from the Patients' Perspective has been found to be valid and reliable.</description>

    <measure>Change in informal caregiver strain assessed with the Caregiver Burden Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 12 and 24 month follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>To assess informal caregiver strain, The Caregiver Burden Scale will be used. The scale includes 22 items in five dimensions: general strain, isolation, disappointment, emotional involvement, and environments. Response alternatives is a four-point Likert-scale: Not at all (1) to Often (4). The Caregiver Burden Scale has been found to be valid and reliable.</description>

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Change in informal caregiving engagement assessed with the Resource Utilization in Dementia instrument</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 12 and 24 month follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>Informal caregiver engagement will be assessed with The Resource Utilization in Dementia instrument which include three parts: personal activities of daily living (dressing/undressing, showering/bathing, washing, and moving), instrumental activities of daily living (cooking, shopping, washing, cleaning, taking care of economy, talking on the telephone, riding/driving car, and other transportations), and supervision (risks as fire, accidents, fall in house or outside etc.). The Resource Utilization in Dementia assesses resource utilization in terms of: hours of home care, number of days in hospital, number of visits to GP´s, physiotherapists, and informal care. The instrument has been found to be valid and reliable</description>

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Change in satisfaction with care for relatives assessed with the Pyramid questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 12 and 24 month follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>Satisfaction with care will be assessed with The Pyramid questionnaire which includes 40 items in seven parts; information, staff professional skills, care, activity, contact, social support and relative participation. Response alternatives is a four-point Likert-scale: Yes, to a great degree to No, not at all. The scale has been found to be valid and reliable.</description>

    <measure>Change in job satisfaction assessed with the Measure of Job Satisfaction</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 12 and 24 month follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>Job satisfaction will be assessed with The Measure of Job Satisfaction which includes 37 items in five dimensions; personal satisfaction, satisfaction with workload, team spirit, training and professional support. Response alternatives is a five-point Likert-scale: Very dissatisfied (1) to Very Satisfied (5). The scale has been found to be valid and reliable.</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Change in stress of conscience assessed with the Stress of Conscience scale</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 12 and 24 month follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>To assess stress of conscience, The Stress of Conscience scale will be used. the scale consists of ten items related to different health care situations, each question consists of an A and B part. The A parts' response alternatives are a six-point Likert-scale ranging from Never (0) to Every day (5). The questions are related to how often different situations arise at the workplace. The B parts are a ten centimetre visual analogue scale where each situations' impact on conscience are estimated. A total index can be calculated where a higher value means higher levels of stress of conscience. The Stress of Conscience scale has been found to be valid. A weakness is the absence of reliability test</description>
