  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will be a randomized clinical trial involving a total of 24 subjects. The
      investigators propose to recruit subjects into 2 groups: 1) Extraction treated with xenograft
      bone substitute (BioOss Collagen®) + collagen dressing (HeliPlug®), 2) Extraction treated
      with xenograft bone substitute (BioOss Collagen®) + 3D-collagen matrix (Mucograft Seal®). All
      subjects recruited will have already been approved and treatment planned for extraction +
      implant placement by non-study personnel to avoid any potential conflict of interest. All
      subjects will have radiographs that show the tooth planned for extraction. Each subject will
      be eligible for only 1 tooth extraction + dental implant rehabilitation. After tooth
      extraction, subjects will receive a standard site preservation therapy consisted with
      xenograft bone substitute + collagen dressing or the alternative site preservation therapy
      consisted with xenograft bone substitute + 3D-collagen matrix. After the conventional 6-month
      healing period, subjects will receive a dental implant in the previous extracted site. During
      the dental implant procedure, a 2x5mm bone core biopsy + a 2mm gingival biopsy will be
      obtained from the implant site. Biopsy samples will be stored for future histological and
      histochemical analysis. After dental implant placement, all subjects will receive a healing
      abutment for soft tissue healing prior to implant restoration.

      During the 6-month healing time after tooth extraction and site preservation therapy,
      subjects will return at week-1, week-2, week-4, month-3, and month-6 for intra-oral scanning
      for soft tissue volumetric acquirement. Subjects will receive a Cone beam computed tomography
      (CBCT) prior to extraction for the baseline hard-tissue volume measurement and appropriate
      extraction planning and at 6-month post-extraction for volumetric measurement and appropriate
      implant treatment planning.

      Hard tissue analysis will be performed to compare linear ridge remodeling (baseline vs.
      6-month healing). CBCT images will be analyzed by non-contact reverse engineering system.
      Soft tissue volumetric analysis will be performed to compare the soft tissue healing between
      BioOss Collagen + Mucograft Seal and BioOss Collagen + Collagen Dressing. Images captured
      with an intra-oral scanner collected at baseline, week-1, -2, -4, month-3, and month-6.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects must be adult males or females age 18 to 80 years (inclusive).

          -  Subjects must be able and willing to follow study procedures and instructions in
             English.

          -  Subjects must have read, understood and signed an informed consent form in English.

          -  Subjects must have a maxillary premolar, canine, lateral incisor, or central incisor
             with a restorative or periodontal hopeless prognosis (Kwok and Caton 2007), in which
             an implant is indicated without any sinus lift required.

          -  Subjects undergoing implant placement should be in adequate periodontal health prior
             to implant placement. This includes having probing depth ≤ 4 mm for all remaining
             teeth at the same quadrant of the proposed implant placement. Patients with
             periodontal probing sites with probing depths of up to 5 mm may also be included if
             bleeding on probing in these sites is absent. Each subject should be considered to be
             periodontally stable prior to the implant surgery.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Individuals who have a chronic disease with oral manifestations.

          -  Individuals who exhibit gross oral pathology.

          -  The use of either antibiotics or chronic use (more than 7 days) of NSAIDs within 1
             month prior to screening examination.

          -  Individuals that require antibiotic prophylaxis prior to dental treatment.

          -  Chronic treatment (i.e. two weeks or more) with any medication known to affect
             periodontal status (e.g. phenytoin, calcium antagonists, cyclosporine, Coumadin)
             within 1 month prior to screening examination.

          -  Uncontrolled diabetes mellitus (HbA1c &gt;7) within 3 months prior to screening
             examination.

          -  Individual with uncontrolled parafunctional habits, such as clenching and bruxing on
             objects, that could adversely impact implant survival.

          -  Individuals with a history of intravenous bisphosphonates.

          -  Individuals with active infectious diseases such as hepatitis, HIV or tuberculosis.

          -  Current cigarette smokers.

          -  Individuals who are known to be pregnant, breastfeeding or planning to become pregnant
             within 6 months.

          -  Individuals with blood disorders (hemophilia) and /or currently taking anticoagulant
             medications, such as heparin, warfarin, or clopidrogrel.

          -  Individuals receiving any therapy known to affect healing, such as high dose
             corticosteroids, radiation therapy or chemotherapy.

          -  Individuals allergic to topical or local anesthesia.

          -  Individuals who require maxillary sinus augmentation prior to dental implant therapy.

          -  Individuals with dehisced, fenestrated, or fractured labial/buccal alveolar bone plate
             determined after baseline CBCT or after tooth extraction where more than 50% of the
             buccal bone height is not present. In this case, if the surgeon determines that guided
             bone regeneration (bone graft and membrane) is needed to repair the defect, it will be
             done at no cost to the subject, but the subject will be excluded from the study
             protocol.
