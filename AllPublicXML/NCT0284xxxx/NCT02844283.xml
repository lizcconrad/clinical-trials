                  electrocardiographic changes:

               -  a) Greater than or equal to 2 mm ST-segment elevation) in 2 adjacent
                  electrocardiographic precordial leads

               -  b) A new left bundle branch block AND and an increase in cardiospecific enzymes
                  &gt;3x CK, or increase in troponin compared to institution laboratory normal ranges

               -  Successful PCI with stent implantation to infarct-related artery within the last
                  30 days; defined as residual stenosis no greater than 30%, Thrombolysis In
                  Myocardial Infarction (TIMI) flow of at least 2 and a reference diameter of at
                  least &gt; 2mm

               -  Is considered hemodynamically stable at time of enrollment and immediately prior

                  trial, must have an LVEF no greater than 45%. (All screening echos done within
                  the first 4 days post percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) must be repeated
                  either by echocardiography or MRI prior to Ad-HGF delivery to ensure that the
