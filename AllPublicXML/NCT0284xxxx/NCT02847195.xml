  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Assess the depth of sedation and analgesia in pediatric intensive care is critical to the
      management of intubated patients under mechanical ventilation. The responsiveness of the
      pupil is changed by the sedation and analgesia. Measuring the pupil diameter is proposed in
      anesthesia and intensive care to assess the quality of analgesia in adult population.
      Visually measuring the diameter of the pupil remains very imprecise, but this measure can be
      accurately and quickly performed thanks to portable devices called Pupillometers. Some
      devices including Algiscan® device (IdMed ) can measure in addition to the pupil diameter,
      the variation of pupil diameter, the latency of the pupillary reflex and the maximum speed of
      contraction. Pupillometry was tested in adult ICU patients, during painful and painless
      procedures [1]. In this study, pupillometry was more sensitive for detecting pain compared to
      the change in heart rate or bispectral index. The objective of this work is to perform
      measurements of pupil diameter during painful procedures (e.g. tracheal aspiration) in PICU.
      In parallel we will continue using the Comfort B-scale (has been validated for assessment of
      pain in children admitted to a pediatric intensive care unit [2-5] and compare the results of
      both types of assessment pain.

    <description>When aspiration is planned, pain assessment will be performed thrice :
3-5 minutes before aspiration, during aspiration, and 3-5 minutes after aspiration.
Pain assessment will be performed with both methods:
COMFORT B scale (routinely performed by nurses, and lasts less than one minute)
Simultaneously pupillometry is assessed using the device (Neurolight) (one measurement per eye, this also lasts less than one minute) These measurements can occur at any time during stay in ICU, and can be repeated.</description>

    <description>This is a safe and painless examination (the device is simply placed on the orbit of the eye). The optical pupillometer is cleaned by doctors before and after each use, using cleaning wipes containing antibacterial, antiviral and antifungal drugs; such wipes are already in use in the service for cleaning equipment.</description>
