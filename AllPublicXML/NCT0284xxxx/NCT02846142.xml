  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This trial will consist of three parts: the first two parts will enroll healthy female
      volunteers into a single ascending dose (SAD) and multiple ascending dose (MAD) treatment
      groups.

      The SAD treatment group is comprised of at least 3 cohorts where subjects will be randomized
      to a single dose of either PTI-428 or placebo and will be followed for 7 days post dose. A
      total of 24 subjects are anticipated to participate in this part of the study.

      Following the conclusion of the respective SAD level dose groups and after sufficient review
      of study data and approval by the SRC, a second set of healthy adult female subjects will
      participate in an assigned MAD treatment group. The MAD treatment group is comprised of 3
      cohorts where subjects will be randomized to either PTI-428 or placebo and will be followed
      for a total of 14 days. The SRC will convene after the completion of each cohort to evaluate
      safety, PK and other relevant data. The SRC will determine whether to proceed to the next
      planned dose level, to reduce the dose, or to stop the study. The next cohort may commence
      only after written SRC approval. A total of 24 subjects are anticipated to participate in
      this part of the study.

      Following completion of the SAD and MAD, 40 female healthy volunteers will participate in two
      treatment periods of the DDI study component: Treatment period A will consist of once daily
      oral contraceptive (OC) for 28-days (21-day hormonal active + 7 days off).

      Treatment period B will randomize subjects to PTI-428 or placebo in combination with once
      daily OC for 28 days (21-day hormonal active and PTI-428 or placebo + 7 days off). Following
      completion of the subjects' second treatment period, they will be followed for 7-days after
      their last dose.
