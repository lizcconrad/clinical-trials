  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Teens with Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) have high rates of negative
      driving outcomes, including motor vehicle crashes, which may be caused by visual inattention
      (i.e., looking away from the roadway to perform secondary tasks). A driving intervention that
      trains teens to reduce instances of looking away from the roadway will be tested in teens
      with ADHD.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Operating a motor vehicle requires a complex set of skills, the most important of which is
      the ability to continuously visually attend to the roadway. Glances away from the roadway
      significantly increase one's risk for a motor vehicle crash (MVC). Teen drivers evidence far
      more extended glances away from the roadway than experienced drivers. Further, teens with a
      diagnosis of Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) emit 3-times more extended
      glances away from the roadway than typical teens. There is a clear need for interventions,
      particularly one that targets extended glances away from the roadway, to address the driving
      deficits of teens with ADHD. The proposed research will test the efficacy of the FOcused
      Concentration and Attention Learning (FOCAL) intervention, which targets reducing the number
      of extended glances away from the roadway, among teens with ADHD. The PC-based FOCAL training
      provides teens with an operational understanding of the dangers of extended glances away from
      the roadway and trains them on limiting the length of the teens' glances. The investigators
      have enhanced the FOCAL intervention (now termed FOCAL+) to include multiple training
      sessions and to integrate practice on a driving simulator with immediate feedback regarding
      extended glance behavior. In this randomized trial, teens with ADHD will be randomly assigned
      to receive either FOCAL+ or a sham placebo group. Immediately after 1 month of training
      sessions and 6-months post-training, teens' driving skills will be assessed using a driving
      simulator. In addition, teens will have cameras installed in their cars for 12-months which
      record driver behavior and road conditions during irregular events (e.g., hard-braking,
      swerving). Using data from driving simulation, cameras installed in the teen's car, and teen
      driving records, the investigators will examine the short- and long-term efficacy of the
      FOCAL+ intervention on 1) decreasing rates of extended glances away from the roadway among
      teens with ADHD, and 2) improving driving performance among teens with ADHD.

    <description>Participants will complete a simulated drive in a driving simulator with an integrated eye-tracking system. After acclimating to the driving simulator, participants will complete two 15-minute drives. During each drive, the participant will engage in one secondary task per minute for a total of 28 secondary tasks. The secondary task will consist of searching for streets on a GPS map. Eye gaze, driving speed and lateral position will be sampled continuously. Eye gaze data will be summarized by calculating the number of extended (≥2 secs) glances away from the roadway, which will be the primary outcome for visual behavior during driving.</description>

    <measure>Number of incidents, crashes, and near-crashes recorded with DriveCam</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The DriveCam device is an event-triggered palm sized pair of cameras that are mounted to the rear view mirror of the participant's car. The device has a forward-road facing camera and another camera that faces the driver. Both cameras continuously record but only save to memory when a built-in accelerometer exceeds a set g force threshold. Any g-force event that exceeds .6 g-force will be coded using three primary codings: 1) incidents (i.e., a threshold exceedance in which the driver's action, either intentional or unintentional, was responsible for a safety-relevant event), 2) crashes (i.e., collision with another vehicle or object), and 3) near-crashes (i.e., an evasive maneuver performed to avoid a MVC). The primary outcomes will include the number of incidents, crashes, and near-crashes per hour driven.</description>

    <measure>Number of incidents, crashes, and near-crashes recorded with DriveCam that are preceded by a greater than 2 second glance away from the roadway</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The DriveCam device has a forward-road facing camera and another camera that faces the driver. Both cameras record when a built-in accelerometer exceeds a set g force threshold of .6. Video recordings of the driver will be coded for whether an extended glance away from the roadway preceded the recorded event, along with the length of the glance away from the roadway and the temporal proximity of that glance to the actual event. Using these codings, the investigators will be able to determine the number of incidents preceded by ≥ 2 sec glance away from roadway.</description>

    <description>Weekly for 5 weeks, teens complete a computer training program designed to train teens to limit the length of glances away from the roadway. On a computer, the top portion of the screen plays a simulated video drive while the bottom half of the screen contains a map. Teens complete tasks that require switching between the 2 halves of the screen. While doing so, they receive feedback regarding how long they are looking away from the driving portion of the screen. After each session of computerized FOCAL training, teens will complete two 5-minute simulated drives. During the drives, teens will be cued to a complete a visual search task which will require them to divert their gaze from the road. Eye tracking goggles will monitor eye glances and provide real time auditory feedback when a visual glance away from the roadway exceeds 2 secs.</description>

    <description>Weekly for 5 weeks, teens will perform computer-based training regarding traffic codes, laws, and rules of the road. After each computerized training, teens will complete two 5-minute drives. This time in the driving simulator will be contextualized as a time for them to practice the rules of the road they learned during training. Importantly, teens in the sham intervention group will complete the same distraction tasks but will NOT receive any feedback regarding their eye gaze during simulated driving.</description>
