      This study will enroll 200 men with clinical suspicion of prostate cancer due to higher serum
      level of PSA than 2.5 ng/ml or abnormal digital rectal examination.

      Anatomical magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) at 3 Tesla
      (T) magnetic field using surface coils will be used to non-invasively predict the presence or
      absence of prostate cancer.

      Targeted TRUS guided biopsy based on MRI findings will be performed in addition to routine
      twelve core TRUS biopsy.

      Moreover, selected serum and urine biomarkers as well as biomarkers extracted from fresh
      biopsy sample will be collected and correlated with the presence or absence of prostate
      cancer.

      Specific aims of the current study are as follows:

      i) To determine the sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of a novel rapid anatomical MRI and
      DWI at 3T magnetic field for the detection of prostate cancer in correlation with systematic
      TRUS guided biopsy

      ii) To determine the sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of selected serum, urine and
      tissue biomarkers for detection of prostate cancer

      iii) To develop statistical model for diagnosis of prostate cancer incorporating findings of
      a novel rapid MRI/DWI and selected biomarkers

      iv) To assess the applicability of TRUS guided prostate biopsy based on MRI finding in
      patient with no previous prostate biopsy

      v) To develop and validate an imaging protocol which will become the standard protocol for
      prostate imaging at Medical Imaging Centre of Southwest Finland (VSKK) / TYKS, Turku,
      Finland.
