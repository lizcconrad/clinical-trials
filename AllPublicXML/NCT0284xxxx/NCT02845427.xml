      Comparative randomised study to clarify which better to use or no use of closed suction drain
      system after total hip arthroplasty regarding amount of blood loss, need for blood
      transfusion, risk for superficial infection, ecchymosis, wound discharge, effect on early
      post-operative rehabilitation. Patients will be followed up for one month postoperative
      clinically (Harris Hip score system), laboratory (Hb level), and radiologically (A-P view
      plain x-ray of the hip).

    <textblock>
      Total Hip Arthroplasty (THA) wounds are prone to formation of hematomas. Hematomas may
      increase the incision tension, leading to wound discharge and providing a good medium for
      bacteria, increase post-operative pain, limitation of range of motion of hip joint and
      prolong post-operative rehabilitation duration, also may cause ecchymosis, and tension
      vesicles around the surgical wound.

      So use of closed suction drain system may reduce these complications. Nevertheless some
      recent studies have claimed that drainage can cause other complications and does not reduce
      hematoma formation and risk for infection. Furthermore, some studies have shown that drainage
      increase blood loss after THA which may both lead to increase blood transfusion requirements
      and provide an entry point for skin microorganisms.

      Some other studies have found that no significance between use and non use of suction drain
      after THA.

      So the investigators will take this issue for study a comparison between benefits and hazards
      of use and non use of suction drain after THA.
