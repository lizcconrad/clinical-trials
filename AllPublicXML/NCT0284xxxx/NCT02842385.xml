    <textblock>
      Changes in the marginal bone level surrounding the implant are the frequently used parameters
      in assessing the short- and long-term success. Multiple biological and biomechanical factors
      have been reported to adversely affect marginal bone level. Recently, initial vertical
      mucosal tissue thickness has also been reported to have an impact on bone stability.The
      hypothesis of present study is that soft tissue thickness on implant placement has no
      positive impact of crestal bone remodeling.

      The aim of this study is to evaluate the clinical and radiographical results of submerged and
      nonsubmerged implants with thin (&lt;3 mm) and thick (&gt;3 mm) soft tissue over 1.5 year after
      implant placement. All submerged and nonsubmerged implants were randomly placed as
      split-mouth. Clinical periodontal parameters were recorded. Crestal bone levels were analyzed
      from the day of implants inserted to 1.5 year after prosthetic loading on digitally
      standardized radiographs. Non-parametric test were used for statistically analysis.
