      Randomized, two treatment groups

      Number of Subjects : 54 subjects (n=27 per group)

      Group 1 : gait rehabilitation with hip assist robot / 10 sessions (5sessions - treadmill gait
      training / 5sessions - overground gait training), 30min per session

      Group 2 : gait rehabilitation without hip assist robot / 10 sessions (5sessions - treadmill
      gait training / 5sessions - overground gait training), 30min per session

      Primary objective is to demonstrate the effects of hip assist robot on spatio-temporal
      parameters measured by motion capture system (Motion Analysis Corporation, Santa Rosa, CA,
      USA), muscle activation patterns measured by surface electromyography (sEMG) (Noraxon Inc.,
      Scottsdale, AZ, USA), metabolic energy cost parameters measured by portable cardiopulmonary
      metabolic system (Cosmed K4B2, Rome, Italy) and foot pressure distribution measured by F-Scan
      Mobile system (Tekscan Inc., South Boston, MA, USA).

      Secondary objective is to demonstrate the effects of hip assist robot on motor function
      improvement evaluated by Berg Balance Scale (BBS), Tinetti performance oriented mobility
      assessment (POMA), Korean version Modified Bathel index (K-MBI), Modified Rankin Scale (MRS),
      Functional Ambulation Classification (FAC), Fugl-Meyer assessment for lower extremity (FMA),
      Korean version Fall Efficacy Scale (K-FES), Manual Muscle Test (MMT) and Range of Motion
      (ROM).

    <measure>Change in 10 meter walk test from baseline in gait speed</measure>
    <time_frame>session 0 (initial visit); session 11 (at approximately 4 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>Measure of self selected speeds by measuring the time it takes an individual to walk 10 meters. To perform the test, patient walks 10 meters (33 ft) and the time is measured when the leading foot crosses the start line and the finish line. The instructions are: &quot;Please walk this distance at your normal pace when I say go.&quot;</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Berg Balance Scale (BBS)</measure>
    <time_frame>session 0 (initial visit); session 11 (at approximately 4 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>The BBS is a 14-item objective measure designed to assess static balance and fall risk in adult populations and is a well-accepted measure in the stroke literature. The functional activities that are assessed include sitting and standing balance during transfers, altered base of support, reaching, turning, eyes open and closed.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Tinetti performance oriented mobility assessment (POMA)</measure>
    <time_frame>session 0 (initial visit); session 11 (at approximately 4 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>Task-oriented outcome measure that assesses gait and balance ability is composed of a 9-item gait portion (POMA-G) and 7-item balance portion (POMA-B).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Modified Bathel index (MBI)</measure>
    <time_frame>session 0 (initial visit); session 11 (at approximately 4 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>The MBI is a measure of activities of daily living, which shows the degree of independence of a patient from any assistance. It covers 10 domains of functioning (activities): bowel control, bladder control, as well as help with grooming, toilet use, feeding, transfers, walking, dressing, climbing stairs, and bathing.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Modified Rankin Scale (MRS)</measure>
    <time_frame>session 0 (initial visit); session 11 (at approximately 4 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>The modified Rankin Scale (mRS) is a commonly used scale for measuring the degree of disability or dependence in the daily activities of people who have suffered a stroke or other causes of neurological disability.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Functional Ambulation Classification (FAC)</measure>
    <time_frame>session 0 (initial visit); session 11 (at approximately 4 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>The Functional Ambulation Categories (FAC) is a functional walking test that evaluates ambulation ability. This 6-point scale assesses ambulation status by determining how much human support the patient requires when walking, regardless of whether or not they use a personal assistive device.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Fugl-Meyer assessment for lower extremity (FMA)</measure>
    <time_frame>session 0 (initial visit); session 11 (at approximately 4 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>The Fugl-Meyer Assessment (FMA) is a stroke-specific, performance-based impairment index. It is designed to assess motor functioning, balance, sensation and joint functioning in patients with post-stroke hemiplegia. It is applied clinically and in research to determine disease severity, describe motor recovery, and to plan and assess treatment.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Fall Efficacy Scale (FES)</measure>
    <time_frame>session 0 (initial visit); session 11 (at approximately 4 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>Fall Efficacy Scale (FES) is a 10-item questionnaire designed confidence in their ability to perform 10 daily tasks without falling as an indicator of how one's fear of falling impacts physical performance. Each item is rated from 1 (&quot;very confident&quot;) to 10 (&quot;not confident at all&quot;), and the per item ratings are added to generate a summary total score.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Manual Muscle Test (MMT)</measure>
    <time_frame>session 0 (initial visit); session 11 (at approximately 4 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>Manual muscle testing (MMT) is a procedure for the evaluation of the function and strength of individual muscles and muscle groups based on the effective performance of a movement in relation to the forces of gravity and manual resistance.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Range of Motion (ROM)</measure>
    <time_frame>session 0 (initial visit); session 11 (at approximately 4 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>Range of Motion (ROM) testing is the measurement of movement around a specific joint or body part.</description>
