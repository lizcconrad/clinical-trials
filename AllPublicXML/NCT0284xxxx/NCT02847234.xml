  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cervical necrotizing fasciitis (CNF) is a rare but severe complication of pharyngeal or
      dental infections. The infection can rapidly descend into the mediastinum and lead to a
      life-threatening prognosis. Treatment consists of a multidisciplinary approach in intensive
      care with radiologist and with early and repeated surgical debridement. Anti-inflammatory
      drugs have been incriminated by authors in the development of necrotizing fasciitis.
      Recently, a single-center study demonstrated that pharyngeal source of CNF and oral
      glucocorticoid intake before admission was associated with the occurrence of mediastinitis.

      The aim of the study is to assess the incidence and factors associated with CNF
      complications, in particular mediastinitis. Secondary outcome is to describe patient
      characteristics, medical and surgical management.

      Methods: A retrospective, observational, non-interventional multicentre study is conducted in
      nine intensive care units in France from January 2005 to December 2016.
