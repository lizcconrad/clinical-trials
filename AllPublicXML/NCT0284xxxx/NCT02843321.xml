  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To assess the safety and biological efficacy of prophylactically administered donor-derived
      multi-infection specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) (targeting cytomegalovirus (CMV),
      Adenovirus (Adv), Epstein Barr virus (EBV), Varicella-Zoster virus (VZV), Influenza (Flu), BK
      virus (BKV), and Aspergillus (Asp)) combined with early immunisation with Influenza and VZV
      vaccines for the prevention of viral and fungal infection following allogeneic blood or
      marrow stem cell transplantation.

    <textblock>
      The study will analyse the safety and biological efficacy of administering the
      investigational products (donor-derived T cells stimulated with viral and fungal antigen
      expressing DC combined with Flu and VZV immunisation), for the prophylaxis of viral and
      fungal reactivation and/or infection following allogeneic blood or marrow transplantation.
      The cells will be given prophylactically a minimum of 28 days after transplantation followed
      by administration of the Flu and VZV vaccines 24 to 72 hours later. The AIMS are to study the
      safety of combining CTL infusions and vaccination as well as their effect on reconstitution
      of infection-specific immunity, viral and Aspergillus reactivation and infection rates after
      transplantation, viral load, and use of antiviral and antifungal pharmacotherapy for specific
      infections. The investigators will also evaluate the safety of infusions and vaccinations
      with respect to the development adverse events within the first 12 months post transplant.
