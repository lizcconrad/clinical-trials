  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Peripheral artery disease (PAD) is a manifestation of atherosclerosis that produces
      progressive narrowing and occlusion of the arteries supplying the lower extremities. The most
      common clinical manifestation of PAD is claudication, i.e., a severe functional limitation
      identified as gait dysfunction and walking-induced leg muscle pain relieved by rest. The
      standard therapies for claudication include the medications cilostazol and pentoxifylline,
      supervised exercise therapy and operative revascularization. Recent data demonstrated that 24
      weeks of treatment with the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor Ramipril produces
      improvements in the walking performance of patients with claudication that are higher than
      those of cilostazol and pentoxifylline and similar to those produced by supervised exercise
      therapy and operative revascularization. The mechanisms by which Ramipril therapy produces
      this impressive improvement in the functional capacity of claudicating patients remain
      unknown. The Investigators hypothesize that treatment of claudicating PAD patients with
      Ramipril will improve walking performance and quality of life by improving the myopathy of
      the gastrocnemius. Improved myopathy is a consequence of reduced oxidative damage, reduced
      TGF-β1 production by vascular smooth muscle cells and reduced collagen deposition in the
      affected gastrocnemius.

    <textblock>
      This is an interventional study of PAD patients that exhibit claudication. The purpose of
      this study is to determine the potential mechanisms by which Ramipril vastly improves the
      walking performance of these patients. The study will be achieved through these specific
      aims:

      Specific Aim #1: Test the hypothesis that Ramipril-mediated improvements of walking
      parameters among patients with PAD correlate with improvements in both the morphometrics and
      biochemistry of myofibers in the gastrocnemius of the impaired limb.

      Specific Aim #2: Test the hypothesis that Ramipril-mediated improvements of walking
      parameters in patients with PAD correlate with reduced fibrotic events in small vessels and
      microvasculature, in association with reduced generalized collagen deposition and improved
      tissue oxygenation, in the gastrocnemius of the impaired limb.

      Specific Aim #3: Using adult human arterial smooth muscle cells (AHASMC), in vitro, the
      Investigators will test the hypothesis that the ACE inhibitor Ramipril, which acts as an
      antagonist of Angiotensin II type 1 receptor (ART1) stimulation by reducing tissue
      Angiotensin II (Ang II), impedes a mechanism in which Ang II stimulation of ART1 and exposure
      to hypoxia enhance proliferation of AHASMC and their production of TGF-β1 and collagen, via
      stimulation of phosphoinositide-3-kinase signaling and suppression of phosphatase and tensin
      homologue, a master regulator of cell growth.

      If the above hypotheses are correct, Aims #1 and #2 will demonstrate for the first time that
      therapy with Ramipril improves the walking performance and quality of life of claudicating
      PAD patients by improving the myopathy in skeletal muscle of the ischemic lower limbs. The
      work in Aim #3 will determine the pathways by which hypoxia and Angiotensin II cooperate to
      induce myopathy in the ischemic muscle. Specific agents targeting these pathways could become
      new treatments for claudication and for the more advanced stages of PAD characterized by leg
      rest pain and gangrene.
