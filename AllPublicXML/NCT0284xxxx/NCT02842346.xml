      The aim of our study was to investigate the correlation between the umbilical resistance
      index and weight gain during the third trimester of low-risk pregnancies.

    <description>. During routine prenatal third trimester ultrasonography patients had a fetal weight estimation and measurement of the umbilical resistance index. After delivery we took note of the weight at birth, the term of the delivery, and the time interval between the ultrasound and the delivery, and then we calculated the weight gain on a weekly basis.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Any pregnant patient with a normally progressing pregnancy and reporting for a
             prenatal screening ultrasound between 31 and 34 weeks amenorrhea.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  -The lack of an ultrasound carried out during the first trimester to confirm the term
             of the pregnancy.

          -  A medical condition in the mother: diabetes, high blood pressure or a known chronic
             illness.

          -  A medical condition in the fetus: suspicion of fetal hypotrophy (fetal biometrics
             lower than the 10th percentile), a birth defect (a chromosomal abnormality) during the
             pregnancy.

          -  Patients with tobacco addiction.

          -  A body mass index (BMI) â‰¥ 30 before the pregnancy.

          -  Multiple pregnancies

          -  A gap of less than 4 weeks between the date of the ultrasound and the date of
             delivery.
