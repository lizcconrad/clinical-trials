    <textblock>
      This study investigates the levels of advanced oxidation protein product and monocyte
      chemoattractant protein-1 in gingival crevicular fluid in periodontal disease and health. 25
      participants with chronic periodontitis, 25 participants with gingivitis and 25 periodontally
      healthy subjects are included into this study. In each participant, four sites are identified
      for gingival crevicular fluid samples.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Oxidative stress is the disequilibrium between the formation of free radicals and antioxidant
      defense mechanisms via damaging cellular macromolecules (DNA, protein, lipid, etc..) which
      are susceptible to oxidative damage.

      Advanced oxidation protein product is identified as a new marker of protein oxidation.

      Monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 is a major chemoattractant for lymphocytes, monocytes and
      macrophages.
