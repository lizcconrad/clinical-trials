    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the frequency of occurrence, severity, and response to treatment by a
      chemical agent, notably the dimerizer AP1903 (Bellicum Pharmaceuticals compagny), in the case
      of acute Graft versus Host Disease (aGvHD) occurring after the administration of
      T-lymphocytes expressing iCASP9 and concomitantly to a bone marrow graft depleted in B- and
      T-lymphocytes

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Haematopoietic transplantation may result in serious complications, notably graft versus host
      disease (GvHD).

      T-lymphocyte depletion of the bone marrow graft is able to prevent GvHD, while increasing the
      risk of rejection and reducing the antileukaemic effect of the graft (graft versus leukaemia,
      GvL). In a previous study, the investigators showed that the ex vivo transfer of the Herpes
      simplex thymidine kinase suicide gene (HSV-TK) into the graft's T lymphocytes prior to
      reinjection was not associated with immediate toxicity, while allowing for the prolonged
      recirculation of genetically modified cells (GMC) and control of induced GvHD by ganciclovir
      (GCV). In addition, this study revealed the existence of GMC resistant to GCV, an
      immunodeficiency of transduced cells, as well as an increased risk of Epstein-Barr virus
      (EBV)-induced lymphoproliferative disease. To overcome these difficulties, investigators
      improved the methodology of producing GMC by using a new vector (pMSCV-iCASP9-2A-ΔCD19) whose
      susceptibility gene was of human origin and associated with a human surface marker
      (non-functional) enabling the cell selection process. Moreover, the demonstration that the
      induced GvHD in this setting could be controlled by the administration of GCV alone led to
      significantly increase the number of genetically modified T-lymphocytes administered and omit
      cyclosporin prophylaxis of GvHD.

      This phase I study will include 12 patients and will be conducted according the dose
      escalation method (2.10e6, 5.10e6 and 10.10e6 GMC / kg respectively for levels I, II &amp; III).
      GMC will be prepared in the Cell and Tissue Engineering Laboratory (advanced therapy
      medicinal products departement) of the french Blood center (EFS) in Besançon, France, and
      sent to the transplantation department.
