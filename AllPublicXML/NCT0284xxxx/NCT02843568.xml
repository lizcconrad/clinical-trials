  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to develop radiation plans that will help preserve lung function
      in healthy tissue surrounding the tumor. We believe that 4DCT scans can be useful in
      designing radiation treatment plans that help us avoid healthy normal functioning lung tissue
      close to lung tumors. Currently 4DCT scans are used to help us determine exactly where the
      tumor is and how it moves when you breathe. In this study we will also use the 4DCT scans to
      try to identify high functioning normal lung tissue.

    <measure>Pulmonary function, based on changes in tissue elasticity measured from 4DCT</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months post RT</time_frame>
    <description>The primary endpoint of this study will be the ratio of the tissue elasticity map following RT to the elasticity map before RT (i.e., the Jacobian ratio of (post RT /pre RT)) calculated from 4DCT at 3 months post-RT. Based on the randomness of our measurement technique, diminished expansion (i.e. substantial change) is defined as a Jacobian ratio &lt;0.94 (i.e., less than 94% of the pre-RT value).</description>

    <arm_group_type>Active Comparator</arm_group_type>
    <description>Subjects undergo four-dimensional computed tomographic imaging (4DCT) scans: 1 at simulation, and 2 scans at each of the 3 post-radiation therapy time points (3, 6, and 12 months). 4DCT determines lung tissue elasticity and for standard of care radiation treatment planning. Subjects undergo laboratory biomarker analysis, including spirometry, diffusion capacity (DLCO), and lung volumes (FEV, FEV1). Subjects complete a self-assessment, RTOG defined acute evaluation toxicity evaluation, RTOG late toxicity evaluation, and constitutional assessment.
Radiation doses between 60-66 Gy using standard fractionation (1.8-2.0 Gy/fx) and 40-60 Gy stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) hypofractionation schemes are utilized. Treatment volumes are at the discretion of the treating radiation oncologist and should follow standard of care.</description>

    <arm_group_label>Pulmonary Function Damage Reduction</arm_group_label>
    <arm_group_type>Experimental</arm_group_type>
    <description>All criteria and specifications in the standard of care arm are applicable for this arm, including the same 4DCT scans, and laboratory biomarker analysis. Subjects randomized to this arm of the trial will have the same prescribed radiation dose to the tumor volume and held to the same radiation dose criteria as the subjects in the standard of care arm (60-66 Gy using standard fractionation (1.8-2.0 Gy/fx) and 40-60 Gy stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) hypofractionation). The fundamental difference will be radiation doses for these subjects will be redistributed away from regions predicted to cause the greatest reduction in pulmonary function if damaged.</description>
