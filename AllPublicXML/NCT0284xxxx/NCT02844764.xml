    <textblock>
      This is a prospective open-label clinical study of 50 patients to determine safety and
      treatment potential of autologous cell therapy for pain and inflammation associated with
      Osteoarthritis of the hip. Follow-up will consist of a larger sample including 4,000
      patients.

      This is a prospective open-label clinical study of 50 patients to determine safety and
      treatment potential of autologous cell therapy for pain and inflammation associated with
      Osteoarthritis of the hip. Follow-up will consist of a larger sample including 4,000
      patients.

      Patients will be treated for Osteoarthritis (OA) of the hip due to degeneration or chronic
      injury. They will be treated with autologous Stromed obtained by the Adipose Ultrasonic Cell
      Recovery Unit (AUCRU) and Platelet Rich Plasma (PRP) processed by the RegenLab (RegenKit
      BCT-3) PRP product each as direct injections to the affected joints. Patient outcomes will be
      tracked with laboratory tests for inflammation markers, hip disability and osteoarthritis
      outcome score (HOOS) questionnaires and follow up MRI's at various endpoints to 6 months.
      SF-36 forms (a quality of life measure) and numerical rating scales (NRS) will also be used
      to assess safety and efficacy of treatment, as well as any reduction in patient medication
      and/or delay in pending hip replacement therapy.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients with indication of Osteoarthritis. Can be from degeneration or chronic
             injury.

          2. Patients range from 18-90 years of age.

          3. Patients must be able to comply with treatment plan, laboratory tests and periodic
             interviews.

          4. Patients with adequate renal function, Creatinine â‰¤ 1.5 mg/dl.

          5. Patients with adequate cardiac and respiratory function.

          6. Patients with adequate blood coagulation activity, PT(INR) &lt; 1.5, APTT

          7. Patients must have adequate immune system function, with no known immunodeficiency
             disease.

          8. Greater than 6 months hip pain with the index side (left or right).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Neoplastic cancer within 5 years prior to screening, except for cutaneous basal cell
             or squamous cell cancer resolved by excision

          2. Presence of clinically significant acute or unstable cardiovascular and
             cerebrovascular (stroke).

             pain/mobility including, but not limited to:

               -  Treatments with strong opioid drugs in the previous 4 weeks for other pain rather
                  than hip osteoarthritis
