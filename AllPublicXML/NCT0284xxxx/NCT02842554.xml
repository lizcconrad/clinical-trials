      The purpose of this study is to assess the ability of Evoked Pain Training (EPT) and Drug/
      Placebo Administration (DPA) training to increase subjects' ability to discriminate between
      active and placebo treatments in a double-blind crossover trial of a known analgesic,
      measured by standardized effect size, relative to untrained control subjects.

        Inclusion criteria:

        A subject must meet all of the following criteria to be enrolled in the study:

          1. Be a man or a non-pregnant, non-lactating woman 18 years or older. Women of
             childbearing potential should be willing to use an acceptable birth control method (at
             the Investigator's discretion) during the study to avoid pregnancy.

          2. Have voluntarily provided written informed consent.

          3. Be able to speak, read, write, and understand English, understand the consent form,
             complete study-related procedures, and communicate with the study staff.

          4. Have a clinical diagnosis of Painful Diabetic Neuropathy (PDN) for at least 6 months.

             a. Clinical diagnosis may be verified by medical records or by clinical examination
             during the first visit combined with a medical history of appropriate symptoms for at
             least 6 months.

          5. Have a pain intensity score averaging ≥4 on a 0-10 NRS for average daily recall over
             past 24 hours. (This applies at V1, V2, and V5.)

          6. Have an average daily pain intensity of at least 4 on the 0-10 NRS on at least 20 out
             of the past 30 days.

          7. Be, in the opinion of the Investigator, in sufficiently good health to participate in
             the study at screening, based upon the results of a medical history, physical
             examination and laboratory analysis.

        Prior to each Treatment Period, the participants must meet the following additional
        criteria for randomization: Have average pain intensity (24-hour recall) ≥4 on the 0-10
        NRS.

        Exclusion criteria:

        A subject must be excluded if any of the following criteria are met:

          1. Are pregnant and/or lactating.

          2. Have been diagnosed as having any inflammatory arthritis, gout, pseudo-gout, Paget's
             disease, fibromyalgia or any chronic pain syndrome that in the Investigator's opinion
             would interfere with the assessment or self-evaluation of pain and other symptoms of
             PDN.

          3. Have evidence for multiple causes of pain in the neuropathic pain area, such as lumbar
             radiculopathy.

          4. Have received or used any of the excluded/prohibited treatments or drugs specified in
             the list of prohibited treatments (below) or are unable to agree to the list of
             treatments prohibited during the study.

          5. Have a history of congestive heart failure, unstable coronary artery disease, stroke,
             or uncontrolled hypertension.

          6. Have a history of significant gastrointestinal disease, including active
             gastro-duodenal ulcerations, perforations, or bleeds.

          7. Have abnormal clinical laboratory test results or vital signs unless deemed not
             clinically significant by the investigator.

          8. Have regularly worn false fingernails within the past 6 months (more than 25% of the
             time)

          9. Are undergoing active treatment for cancer, are known to be infected by human
             immunodeficiency virus, or are being acutely and intensively immunosuppressed
             following transplantation.

         10. Have a history of alcohol or other substance abuse (not including nicotine or tobacco)
             within 5 years.

         11. Have a history of suicide attempt within the past 1 year or suicidal ideation within
             the past 1 month.

         12. Have a history of epilepsy or other seizure disorder.

         13. Have creatinine clearance below 60 mL/min as calculated by Cockroft-Gault equation for
             serum creatinine.

         14. Known to have a condition that in the Investigator's judgment precludes participation
             in the study.

         15. Have previously been admitted to this study.

         16. Are involved in a worker's compensation, disability claim, or litigation related to
             medical condition or treatment that is open or was settled within the past 12 months.
             (Whether litigation is related to medical condition or treatment may be decided at the
             Investigator's discretion. Claims settled &gt;12 months previously are permitted.)

         17. Have a known failure to respond to pregabalin, gabapentin, or oxycodone due to either
             efficacy or tolerability in previous treatment at therapeutically appropriate doses.

         18. Are allergic to or have a hypersensitivity to pregabalin or oxycodone.
