  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Post-transplant diabetes affects 15 to 20% of renal transplant patients and contributes to
      increased morbidity and reduced survival of transplants and patients. Corticosteroids,
      anti-calcineurin and mammilian Target OF Rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitors have a major
      diabetogenic impact and greatly contribute to the increase in diabetes prevalence after
      transplantation.

      There are to date few studies concerning the pharmacological prevention of post-transplant
      diabetes. Hecking et al. have recently reported that a short treatment with insulin,
      administered immediately after transplantation, reduce the incidence of de novo diabetes
      one-year post-transplant. This study included 50 renal transplant patients and showed that a
      three months treatment of (Neutral Protamine Hagedorn) NPH insulin decreased HbA1c. The
      occurrence of diabetes, a secondary end-point, was reduced by 73% in the treated group.

      No further pharmacological strategy has been developed to date. Relevant experimental
      evidences suggest that gliptins could be used in the pharmacological prevention of
      post-transplant diabetes. These drugs are inhibitors of dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4), which
      inactivates the incretins, the glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and the gastric inhibitory
      polypeptide (GIP). DPP-4 inhibition causes an increase in the GLP-1 and GIP concentrations
      which induce insulin secretion and inhibition of glucagon secretion. The gliptins are
      approved for the treatment of type 2 diabetes. Beyond the effects on blood glucose, gliptins
      have pleiotropic effects including a protective effect on β cells and anti-inflammatory
      effect.

      The additional cost associated with new-onset diabetes after transplantation could be also
      significantly reduced by efficient prevention. A US study found that, for the period between
      1994 and 1998, a newly diagnosed diabetic patient has cost $21,500 of medical expenses 2
      years after transplantation. Moreover, transplantation resulting in one of the best increases
      of patients' quality of life, its estimate is essential in the treatment evaluation of this
      population.

    <description>Galvus is prescribed as recommended by the marketing authorization. In adults, the recommended dose of Galvus is 100 mg per day (one tablet in the morning and another in the evening).
In patients with moderate or severe kidney problems, the recommended dose is 50 mg once daily (one tablet in the morning).
Patients with creatinine clearance greater than 50 ml/min the vildalgliptin dose will be 100 mg/day. For those whose clearance is less than 50 ml/min, the daily dose is 50 mg. The creatinine clearance will be measured each week.
The treatment duration will be 3 months, divided into 2 months of complete treatment and one month of cessation treatment with half dose of vildagliptin.</description>
