    <textblock>
      This study aims to assess the effects of hazelnuts, cocoa, and the combination of both on
      vascular reactivity and metabolic profile. Participants, divided in six groups, will receive
      one of these breakfast integrations for 14 days:

      group 1) 30 g peeled hazelnuts;

      group 2) 30 g unpeeled hazelnuts;

      group 3) snack with 30 g peeled hazelnuts;

      group 4) snack with 2.5 g cocoa powder;

      group 5) snack with 30 g peeled hazelnuts and 2.5 g cocoa;

      group 6) empty snack, control group.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In the last few years, the prevalence of overweight and obesity has increased in all age
      groups. The European Food Safety Authority stated &quot;cocoa flavanols help maintain
      endothelium-dependent vasodilation, which contributes to normal blood flow&quot;. Several studies
      reported that a daily consumption of hazelnuts reduces the risk of cardiovascular disease.
      The hypothesis of this study is to demonstrate a beneficial effect of hazelnut and cocoa diet
      integrations on vascular reactivity and endocrine-metabolic parameters.

    <measure>Effects of a breakfast integration on vascular reactivity, assessed by the variation of peak systolic velocity of the brachial artery, in healthy subjects.</measure>
    <time_frame>2 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Vascular reactivity is measured by assessing the peak systolic velocity (PSV in cm/s) of the brachial artery at rest and after 3 minutes of arterial occlusion using an echographer in Doppler mode. To occlude arterial inflow, a sphygmomanometric cuff is placed above the antecubital fossa and inflated to at least 50 mmHg above systolic pressure for 3 minutes.</description>
