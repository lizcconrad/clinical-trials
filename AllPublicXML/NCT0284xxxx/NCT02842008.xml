    <textblock>
      Shoulder pain is the most common symptom of physical dysfunction in wheelchair basketball
      players. About the 85% of this population had shoulder pain in some moment of their life.
      Some studies suggest that exercise is an important tool as an element to treat and prevent
      shoulder injuries. For that reason, an intervention program would be a useful tool for
      prevent shoulder injuries in this population.

      The purpose of this study is determine the effects of therapeutic exercise program wheelchair
      basketball players, in order to prevent shoulder injuries.

    <description>This group will receive a home exercise program of shoulder based on mobility, strength and strengthening exercises, lasting 10 weeks, 3 times per weeks. The target dose use for mobility consisted in 8 repetitions for each 4 movements, for strengthening using resistive bands, 3 sets (including 5 exercises) of 10 repetitions with a 45 second rest between sets and 5 repetitions for each 5 strength with a 30 second rest and general protocol of postural hygiene. The instructional of the program is 30 minutes each day during the time of the study (10 weeks) with a screening about the exercise program and the daily activities performed every 4 weeks. Physiotherapist provided support to subjects through email along 10 weeks.</description>

             intervention.

          -  Differential diagnosis as acute injuries at cervical region and recent traumatic
             injury in shoulder one year before the study. The exercise program may not be
             appropriate for these conditions.
