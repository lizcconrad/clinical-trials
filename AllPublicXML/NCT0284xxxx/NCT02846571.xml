      The treatment in this trial consists of intraocular islet transplantation. A single dose of
      1000 - 2000 Islet Equivalents (IEQ)/kg recipient body weight (BW) will be infused into the
      anterior chamber of the eye through a self-sealing incision of the peripheral cornea. The
      procedure is projected to take approximately 20-30 minutes. Subject will remain flat on their
      back for 45-60 minutes after islet infusion to maximize adhesion of the islets to the iris.

      The impact of Type 1 Diabetes. In the U.S. alone, approximately 1.3 million people, including
      children and adolescents, suffer from type 1 diabetes (T1D); the disease incidence is
      increasing in many countries, also in children and adolescents. Chronic autoimmune T cell
      responses against pancreatic ß-cells are considered the primary cause of T1D, leading to loss
      of beta cell mass and insulin secretion and in turn life-long dependence on insulin
      injections. The disease severely impacts quality of life and confers risk for both acute and
      chronic complications linked to significant morbidity and mortality, such as end stage renal
      disease, blindness, cardiovascular disease, diabetic ketoacidosis and hypoglycemia. The
      economic burden caused by T1D amounts to approximately $14.4 billion in medical costs and
      lost income. There is a significant need to develop new therapies of improve existing ones to
      prevent, treat, and cure T1D. Diabetes socioeconomic impact primarily stems from the serious
      complications associated with this devastating disease. Such complications include blindness,
      amputations, kidney failure, heart and vascular disease, stroke, nerve damage, and even birth
      defects during pregnancy.

      Although the specific etiology of T1D remain unknown, it is well established that T1D results
      from the autoimmune destruction of the insulin-producing beta cells in the endocrine pancreas
      (i.e., the islets of Langerhans). Consequently, treatment options in T1D are limited to
      insulin supplementation. Insulin supplementation can be either in the form of multiple
      insulin injections daily or biological replacement of the insulin-producing beta cells which
      provide a natural source of insulin. On the one hand, conventional insulin supplementation
      via injection has saved countless lives of diabetic patients since the discovery of insulin
      in the early 1900s. However, it is well established that exogenous insulin injection therapy
      is suboptimal in preventing hyper and hypoglycemia fluctuations. On the other hand, it has
      been shown that even a partial level of endogenous insulin secretion protects from chronic
      diabetic complications, hypoglycemia and diabetic ketoacidosis, which can all lead to death.

      Therefore, beta cell replacement therapy through transplantation of isolated pancreatic
      islets offers a great therapeutic option in T1D. Several approaches of beta cell replacement
      have been pursued in the last few decades. Regenerative approaches such as regeneration of
      existing mature beta cells, differentiation of stem cells and/or trans-differentiation of
      other endocrine or non-endocrine (e.g., ductal and exocrine) cells into insulin-producing
      cells hold great promise in treating T1D. However, these approaches have yet to materialize
      into safe and reliable clinical application. Transplantation is also another option of
      biological replacement but has limitations as well. Limited availability of donor tissue
      remains a significant obstacle in transplantation therapies in general, including pancreatic
      islets. Other limitations of transplantation therapy are associated with the mandatory use of
      systemic anti-rejection immunosuppressive drugs. Chronic systemic immunosuppression exposes
      transplant recipients to serious and potentially deadly side-effects and complications such
      as increased susceptibility to infections/sepsis and cancer. Therefore, immunosuppressive
      agents are continuously being improved and new ones are being developed to better protect
      transplanted tissues (e.g., pancreatic islets) while reducing undesired side-effects of
      systemic immunosuppression and its associated complications.

      T1D patients currently receive transplant therapy either in the form of whole pancreas or
      isolated pancreatic islets. On the one hand, whole pancreas transplantation has been shown to
      achieve insulin independence in T1D patients, but it is also very invasive and is associated
      with high risk of complications and adverse events including mortality. On the other hand,
      transplantation of isolated pancreatic islets is minimally invasive and has significantly
      less complications compared to whole pancreas transplant, but survival of the islet graft
      might be severely limited due to complications associated with the current clinical
      transplant site, the portal system of the liver. Nevertheless, hundreds of T1D patients have
      received islet transplants in the liver in the last two and a half decades of clinical trials
      of islet transplantation. These studies have demonstrated that islet transplant recipients
      benefit from improved glycemic control, reduced hypoglycemia episodes, and prevention of
      diabetes-associated complications. This improves the patients' quality of life significantly.
      Importantly, it has been shown in transplanted T1D patients that restored hypoglycemia
      awareness following transplant is maintained even after the patients have to get back on
      insulin therapy due to rejection or loss of the islet graft. Therefore, transplantation of
      isolated pancreatic islets has emerged as a promising therapy for T1D. Consequently, islet
      transplantation is on the verge of becoming standard-of-care in the United States and other
      countries.
