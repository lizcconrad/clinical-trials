  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigational product PF 06252616, a humanized anti myostatin monoclonal antibody that
      neutralizes myostatin (GDF8) is in development for the treatment of Limb Girdle Muscular
      Dystrophy 2I (LGMD2I) to preserve and/or improve muscle function.

      This study will provide the clinical assessment of the safety, tolerability, Pharmacokinetics
      and Pharmacodynamics of PF 06252616 following repeat IV doses in ambulatory adults with
      LGMD2I.

    <textblock>
      This study is a Phase 1b/2, open-label multiple ascending dose escalation study to evaluate
      the safety, tolerability, efficacy, PK and PD of PF 06252616 in ambulatory adults with
      LGMD2I. The study design is intended to determine the optimal safe and pharmacologically
      active dose of PF 06252616 in LGMD2I while providing an opportunity for all subjects to
      receive active drug for a rare and disabling disorder. The study will be conducted in three
      periods: Lead-In, Treatment and Follow-up periods. The Lead-In and Follow-up periods will
      each be 16 weeks to allow an assessment of the change of various outcome measures of this
      period of time and comparison of change in function before, during and after treatment. The
      Treatment period will be 32 weeks. Three cohorts of participants will be enrolled and receive
      escalating doses of PF 06252616. The first cohort will have the option to crossover to the
      highest dose.
