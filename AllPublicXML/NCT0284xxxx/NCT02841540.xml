      This study will include a Phase 1 dose-finding portion (Cohorts A and B) and a four-arm
      expansion portion. The primary objectives of the study are to determine the maximum tolerated
      dose (MTD) and recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) of H3B-8800 administered orally in
      participants with Myelodysplastic Syndromes (MDS), Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML), or Chronic
      Myelomonocytic Leukemia (CMML) and to assess the safety and tolerability of H3B-8800 as a
      single agent administered orally once daily on a 5 days on/9 days off repeated dosing
      schedule in 28-day cycles in participants with MDS, AML, or CMML.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Confirmed diagnosis of Myelodysplastic Syndromes (MDS), Chronic Myelomonocytic
             Leukemia (CMML), or Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML).

               1. Participants with AML must either refuse or not be considered candidates for
                  intensive induction chemotherapy. Previously treated participants should have
                  evidence of persistent or recurrent AML in the peripheral blood and/or bone
                  marrow. Participants must have white blood cell (WBC) &lt; 15 x 10^9cells/L.

               2. For International Prognostic Staging System (IPSS) high-risk or intermediate-2
                  MDS, participants must be intolerant of hypomethylating agents or not have
                  responded to 4 treatment cycles of decitabine or 6 treatment cycles of

                  hypomethylating agent.

               3. For IPSS intermediate-1 or low-risk MDS, participants must be transfusion
                  dependent for red blood cells or platelets (as determined by instructional
                  practices or local standard of care). Participants who are red blood cell
                  transfusion dependent must also have failed erythropoiesis stimulating agents
                  (primary resistance or relapse after a response) or have serum erythropoietin

               4. For CMML, participants must have been treated with at least one prior therapy
                  (hydroxyurea or an hypomethylating agent [HMA]).

                  central analysis at a sponsor-designated laboratory to identify spliceosome
                  hotspot mutations in SF3B1, SRSF2, U2AF1, mutations in ZRSR2, and SRSF2 deletion
                  including amino acid P95.

          4. Male or female, age ≥ 18 years old at the time of consent.

             enrollment.

          4. Family history of Leber Hereditary Optic Neuropathy, Autosomal Dominant Optic Atrophy,
             Late-Onset Retinal Degeneration, Familial Dysautonomia or other hereditary

             therapy including investigational agents within 14 days of study entry.

         12. An active malignancy and/or cancer history for at least 2 years with the exception of
             non-melanoma skin cancer, carcinoma in situ, cervical intraepithelial neoplasia,
             organ-confined prostate cancer with no evidence of progressive disease.

         13. Clinically severe cardiovascular disease or clinically significant electrocardiogram
             (ECG) abnormality.

         14. Uncontrolled, clinically significant pulmonary disease.

         15. Known active or suspected central nervous system (CNS) leukemia.
