      The purpose of the study is to demonstrate the immune lot consistency of the antibody
      responses to meningococcal serogroups A, C, Y, and W following the administration of a single
      dose of MenACYW conjugate vaccine and to demonstrate the immune non-inferiority of the
      antibody responses to meningococcal serogroups A, C, Y, and W following the administration of
      a single dose of MenACYW conjugate vaccine vs licensed MCV4 vaccine.

      Primary Objectives:

        -  To demonstrate the immune lot consistency of the antibody responses to meningococcal
           serogroups A, C, Y, and W following the administration of a single dose of MenACYW
           conjugate vaccine with respect to serum bactericidal assay using human complement (hSBA)
           geometric mean titers.

        -  To demonstrate the non-inferiority of the antibody responses to meningococcal serogroups
           A, C, Y, and W following the administration of a single dose of MenACYW conjugate
           vaccine (pooled Lots 1 to 3) compared to those observed following the administration of
           a single dose of licensed MCV4 vaccine.

      Secondary Objective:

        -  To demonstrate the non-inferiority of the antibody responses to meningococcal serogroups
           A, C, Y, and W following the administration of a single dose of MenACYW conjugate
           vaccine (pooled Lots 1 to 3) compared to those observed following the administration of
           a single dose of licensed MCV4 vaccine in the adult population (18 to 55 years old)

        -  To demonstrate the non-inferiority of the antibody responses to meningococcal serogroups
           A, C, Y, and W following the administration of a single dose of MenACYW conjugate
           vaccine (pooled Lots 1 to 3) compared to those observed following the administration of
           a single dose of licensed MCV4 vaccine in the adolescent population (10 to 17 years old)

      Observational Objectives:

        -  To describe the safety profile of MenACYW conjugate vaccine and that of the licensed
           MCV4 vaccine.

      Healthy meningococcal-vaccine na√Øve adolescents and adults will be enrolled, randomized and
      will receive a single dose of either MenACYW conjugate vaccine from 1 of the 3 lots (Lot 1,
      Lot 2, or Lot 3) or licensed MCV4 vaccine. They will be assessed for immunogenicity at
      baseline (pre-vaccination) and at 1 month post-vaccination. Safety information will be
      collected post-vaccination and through the entire study.
