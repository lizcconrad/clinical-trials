  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Human Papilloma Virus (HPV) has been shown to be a cause of Head &amp; Neck Squamous Cell
      Carcinoma (HNSCC) and the majority of current studies focus on what is happening in patients
      with a HPV HNSCC. But there is limited investigation into HPV infection in the oropharynx of
      patients who do not have HNSCC. The current incidence of oral HPV infection is not known in
      the general population locally and there is also limited information on what particular
      localities within the mouth that patients' harbour HPV infection what strains are present and
      if there are any differences in viral load.

      Therefore the aim of this project is to investigate within patients that undergo
      tonsillectomies the rate of HPV infection in tonsils to determine the amount of HPV present
      within the community.

      Patients are having no additional invasive testing than is all ready being carried out for
      their care pertaining to their tonsillar tissue. Patients are routinely swabbed pre-operative
      for evidence of MRSA, this trial would add an extra swabbing procedure for the mouth.

      The ethical implications are related to the tissue which is being tested for a virus that can
      be implicated in head and neck squamous cancer. These patients would not normally be aware of
      HPV infection and this would raise an new health burden in these patient who are likely to be
      fit and well. The research team would be suitable to counsel patients from any worries
      related to HPV infection.
