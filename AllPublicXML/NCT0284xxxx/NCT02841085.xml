      Identify new genetic mutations predisposing to an increased risk of VTE by locating and / or
      identifying genes involved in subjects at high risk for thrombotic and in whom screening for
      detectable hereditary thrombophilia was negative.

      Venous thromboembolism desease is a public health problem justifying major primary and
      secondary prevention policy. When VTE occurs in the absence of risk factor clinically
      identifiable ( &quot;idiopathic&quot;), an inherited biological risk factor ( &quot;inherited
      thrombophilia&quot;) is found in 30% of cases. However, in patients with idiopathic VTE, the risk
      of recurrent venous thromboembolism is very high, whether detectable inherited thrombophilia
      was found or not.

      This first observation suggests that patients with idiopathic VTE and no detectable
      thrombophilia are likely to have an underlying unknown thrombophilia that are yet to be
      discovered.

      This hypothesis is further supported by the results of the study &quot;FIT&quot; (Regional PHRC 2001,
      promoter CHU Brest, Investigator Main: Francis Couturaud, EA3878 Brest, France, and
      investigator Associate: Clive Kearon, McMaster University, Hamilton, Ontario, Canada), a
      cross international study evaluating the risk of VTE among the family members first degree of
      patients a first idiopathic VTE episode. In this large study cross-1950 family members first
      degree (topics study) of 372 patients with a first episode of VTE Idiopathic (propositi) were
      included (50% included in Brest and 50% inclusive in Canada). The main result is that the
      risk of VTE among family members first degree is high and similar, the proband either bearer
      or without a detectable hereditary thrombophilia. In other words, even in the absence of
      detectable hereditary thrombophilia, the risk of VTE among family members first degree is
      high. This study has identified the subjects in that it is likely they have an inherited
      thrombophilia which has not yet been discovered.
