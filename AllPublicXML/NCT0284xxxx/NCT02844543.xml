      This study will assess the effects of exercise and non-concussive bodily contact on
      eye-tracking scores collected by the EYE-SYNC eye-tracking device.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators propose to prospectively study a cohort of 18-25-year-old athletes.
      Athletes will be tested with the EYE-SYNC eye-tracking device prior to the start of an
      athletic practice or competition (pre-test) and then after the conclusion of the
      practice/competition (post-test). The investigators hope to understand if eye-tracking scores
      are effected by exercise and non-concussive bodily contact commonly incurred during athletic
      play.

    <time_frame>Up to 6 hours</time_frame>
    <description>The EYE-SYNC test was performed before and after practice to analyze the effect of exercise and sub-concussive impact. The movement of eye was tracked using EYE-SYNC. The data were recorded in a surface tablet connected to EYE-SYNC.
Phase error is defined as the difference in degrees between movement of the target and the movement of the eye. Positive values indicate the eye is ahead of the target; negative values indicate the eye is behind the target.</description>

    <measure>Changes in the Eye-tracking Score Before and After Practice or Game: Tangential and Radial Error</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 6 hours</time_frame>
    <description>The EYE-SYNC test was performed before and after practice to analyze the effect of exercise and sub-concussive impact. The movement of eye was tracked using EYE-SYNC. The data were recorded in a surface tablet connected to EYE-SYNC.
Tangential and radial error are defined as degrees of variation in eye tracking along a circular path (tangential) and at 90 degrees to the tangential path (radial). Positive values indicate the eye is ahead of the target; negative values indicate the eye is behind the target.</description>

    <time_frame>Up to 6 hours</time_frame>
    <description>The EYE-SYNC test was performed before and after practice to analyze the effect of exercise and sub-concussive impact. The movement of eye was tracked using EYE-SYNC. The data were recorded in a surface tablet connected to EYE-SYNC.
Vertical and horizontal gain are defined as the ratio of velocity (velocity of the eye:velocity of the target). Positive values indicate the eye is ahead of the target; negative values indicate the eye is behind the target.</description>

    <measure>Changes in Sport Concussion Assessment Tool (SCAT-3) Standardized Assessment of Concussion (SAC) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Day of study/event (up to 6 hours)</time_frame>
    <description>Change in SCAT-3 SAC score before and after practice or game is reported. The SAC score is based on the following assessments: number of symptoms (22 points), symptom severity (132 points), orientation (5 points), immediate memory (15 points), concentration (5 points), and delayed recal (5 points). Scores are summed for a possible range of 0 to 184, with lower scores corresponding to fewer concussion symptoms, and higher scores corresponding to more concussion symptoms.</description>

    <description>The EYE-SYNCÂ® portable eye-tracking system. The eye tracker is a handheld isolated display environment with embedded eye tracking sensors. The eye tracker is connected to a high-performance Windows tablet though a customized docking station. Included accessories with EYE-SYNC are a U.S. tablet power supply adapter and disposable sanitary masks. Participants are asked to follow a dot with their eyes, as the dot moves on the screen of the EYE-SYNC device.</description>

    <description>Eye movements are recorded with an eye tracking system (Desktop Eye-Tracker, Eyelink CR, SR Research) with up to 1000 Hz temporal resolution. The target stimulus is presented on a computer screen approximately 50 cm from the participant. Participants are asked to follow a dot with their eyes, as the dot moves on the monitor screen of the desk-top eye-tracking device.</description>

        <description>Change in SCAT-3 SAC score before and after practice or game is reported. The SAC score is based on the following assessments: number of symptoms (22 points), symptom severity (132 points), orientation (5 points), immediate memory (15 points), concentration (5 points), and delayed recal (5 points). Scores are summed for a possible range of 0 to 184, with lower scores corresponding to fewer concussion symptoms, and higher scores corresponding to more concussion symptoms.</description>

        <title>Changes in the Eye-tracking Score Before and After Practice or Game: Tangential and Radial Error</title>
        <description>The EYE-SYNC test was performed before and after practice to analyze the effect of exercise and sub-concussive impact. The movement of eye was tracked using EYE-SYNC. The data were recorded in a surface tablet connected to EYE-SYNC.
Tangential and radial error are defined as degrees of variation in eye tracking along a circular path (tangential) and at 90 degrees to the tangential path (radial). Positive values indicate the eye is ahead of the target; negative values indicate the eye is behind the target.</description>
