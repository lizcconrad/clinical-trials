  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the role of basal GLP-1 action on the β-cell
      response to insulin resistance. Healthy subjects will have fasting GLP-1 action determined
      with GLP-1r blockade before and after induction of experimental insulin resistance. We
      hypothesize that fasting GLP-1 action will increase to compensate for experimental insulin
      resistance.

      The study will enroll up to 40 healthy participants and while it is anticipated that the
      screening blood draw will yield a number of screen failures, it is estimated that 10-15
      subjects will complete the entire study protocol. Enrolled participants will be asked to
      complete three study visits including the consent visit and two infusion study visits that
      will include hyperglycemic clamp procedures with the addition of the GLP-1 receptor
      antagonist Exendin (9-39) to determine the fasting GLP-1 effect. Each infusion procedure will
      last 2 hours. Subjects will be asked to take dexamethasone daily for approximately one week
      between Visit-2 and Visit-3 to induce insulin resistance.

      We will enroll 6-10 additional subjects as controls for effects of time and repeat testing.
      These individuals will have identical clamps with no dexamethasone at approximately 1 week
      intervals and will be determined at random by study staff.

      The primary outcome for visits 2-3 will be to measure the effects of Ex-9 on fasting
      glucose-stimulated insulin secretion before and after experimentally induced insulin
      resistance. The primary experimental variable for analysis will be C-peptide during the
      clamp. Mean values will be compared between the period of glucose only stimulation and
      glucose with Ex-9. For each subject in the active treatment arm data will be analyzed using
      2-way ANOVA for repeated measures using time (0-60 vs 60-120 min) and treatment (Dex vs no
      Dex) as the two factors. Based on our previous studies we expect a significant time effect
      due to Ex-9. If there is an interaction with treatment we would conclude that experimental
      insulin resistance influences the fasting GLP-1 effect. Data from control subjects will be
      analyzed identically; here we expect no interaction, indicating that the fasting GLP-1 is a
      stable measure. In our previous study using Ex-9 during a glucose clamp, the average
      coefficient of variation in insulin concentrations at the conclusion of each step in the ramp
      was 30%. Using this estimate of between subject variation, detecting a 20% difference between
      subsequent steps in the GLP-1 ramp with a power of 80% and significance level of 0.05 will
      require 8 subjects.
