  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether chewing gum post-operatively decreases the
      time to first flatus or defecation in patients undergoing spine surgery as a indirect
      indicator of post-operative ileus.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The patients undergoing spine surgery are at risk of developing post-operative ileus, which
      will lengthen the hospital stay and cause gastrointestinal distress in patients.
      Post-operative sham feeding in form of chewing a gum seems to increase the functionality of
      gastro-intestinal tract earlier in patients who have undergone gastro-intestinal and
      gynecological surgeries.

      This study will recruit patients undergoing spine surgery at the investigators medical center
      and allocate them randomly into two equal groups. Patients in one group will be asked to chew
      gum after surgery and the other group will not be offered anything on chew on. Both groups
      will be kept nothing per os (NPO) otherwise till the first bowel movement. The first
      post-operative flatus and defecation time will be recorded as primary measures and other main
      outcomes will include first post-operative meal, length of stay and presence of ileus. The
      descriptive parameters of the two groups will also be recorded as related to relevant medical
      history, surgery, and post-operative care, to adjust for its effect on outcome measures.

      This study will identify any beneficial effect that chewing gum will have on post-operative
      ileus development and might be helpful in establishing better post-operative care protocols
      in patients undergoing spine surgery.
