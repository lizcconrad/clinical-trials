  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to demonstrate non-inferiority of immunogenicity and evaluate the
      safety of a single dose of MenACYW conjugate vaccine compared to a single dose of Menomune® -
      A/C/Y/W-135 in adults 56 years of age and older in the US.

      Primary objective:

        -  To demonstrate the non-inferiority of the vaccine seroresponse to meningococcal
           serogroups A, C, Y, and W following the administration of a single dose of MenACYW
           conjugate vaccine compared to those observed following the administration of a single
           dose of Menomune® - A/C/Y/W-135.

      Secondary objective:

        -  To compare the hSBA antibody geometric mean titers (GMTs) of meningococcal serogroups A,
           C, Y, and W following the administration of MenACYW conjugate vaccine to those observed
           following the administration of Menomune® - A/C/Y/W-135

      Observational objectives:

        -  To describe antibody titers against meningococcal serogroups A, C, Y, and W measured by
           hSBA at baseline (before vaccination) and 30 days after vaccination with MenACYW
           conjugate vaccine or Menomune® - A/C/Y/W-135.

        -  To describe the safety profile of MenACYW conjugated vaccine compared to that of the
           licensed Menomune® - A/C/Y/W-135 after a single administration.

      Subjects will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive a single dose of MenACYW conjugate
      vaccine or Menomune® - A/C/Y/W-135 on Day 0 (Visit 1).

      They will undergo immunogenicity assessment at baseline (pre-vaccination) and at 30 to 44
      days post-vaccination and will also be evaluated for safety up to Day 180 post-vaccination.
