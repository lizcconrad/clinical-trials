      The purpose of this study is to understand how consuming healthy cookies every day for two
      weeks will affect different types of fat in the blood. Specifically, the overall goal of this
      study is to find out if the healthy cookies can increase a polyunsaturated fat called
      linoleic acid in plasma, red blood cells and white blood cells.

      Overall, linoleic acid has many health benefits including altering body composition and
      energy metabolism, possibly through its impact on cardiolipin. It is therefore imperative to
      develop foods products that allow for Americans to easily increase their intake of linoleic
      acid. It's also important to understand the mechanism in which linoleic acid exerts these
      positive health effects, particularly in states of muscle mass and quality loss associated
      with mitochondria dysfunction.

      The investigators plan to test the central hypothesis and accomplish the overall objective of
      this research by pursuing the following three specific aims

      Aim 1: To determine the extent to which cookies, made with grapeseed oil , increase linoleic
      acid in plasma, red blood cells (RBCs), and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs)
      fraction of blood after two weeks consumption

      Aim 2: To determine the extent to which cookies, made with grapeseed oil, increase
      cardiolipin and linoleic acid content of cardiolipin in PBMCs after two weeks of consumption

      Aim 3: To determine and compare the acceptability of consuming cookies made with grapeseed
      oil or high oleic safflower oil every day for two weeks
