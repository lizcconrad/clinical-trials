  <brief_summary>

      The purpose of this study is to test any good and bad effects of the study drug called
      Abemaciclib. Abemaciclib could shrink your cancer but it could also cause side effects.
      Researchers hope to learn if the study drug will delay the growth of the cancer or shrink the
      cancer by at least one quarter compared to its present size. Abemaciclib is not FDA approved
      and has not been tested in liposarcoma, but it has shrunk tumors in patients with breast
      cancer, lymphoma, and lung cancer.

             resectable.

          -  All patients must have measurable disease as defined by RECIST 1.1. Patients must also
             have evidence of disease progression by RECIST 1.1 within 6 months of first dose of
             study drug.

          -  Any number of prior therapies (including none) is permitted. The last dose of systemic
             therapy (include targeted therapies) must have been given at least 2 4 weeks prior to
             initiation of therapy. Patients receiving BCNU or mitomycin C must have received their
             last dose of such therapy at least 6 weeks prior to initiation of therapy.

          -  Patients with brain metastasis that have been treated with definitive surgery or
             radiation and have been clinically stable for 3 months are eligible.

          -  AST(SGOT)/ALT(SGPT) ≤ 3 x institutional ULN

          -  Creatinine ≤ 1.5 x ULN or Creatinine Clearance &gt; 50 mL/min (calculated by
             Cockcroft-Gault method)

          -  Patients must not have current evidence of another malignancy that requires treatment.

          -  Women of child-bearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception
             (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence). Women must not breast feed

             active infection, including HIV, active hepatitis B or C, symptomatic congestive heart
             failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia (specifically, atrial
             fibrillation or ventricular dysrhythmias except ventricular premature contractions),
             or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study
             requirements.
