    <textblock>
      This research study will test if oxytocin, delivered by nasal spray, will promote weight loss
      in children, adolescents, and adults with Hypothalamic Obesity as compared to a placebo. The
      study is divided into two parts. During the first part, subjects will receive either oxytocin
      or placebo. In the second part, subjects will &quot;cross-over&quot; to receive the other treatment -
      either oxytocin or placebo. During study visits participants will do blood tests, physical
      exams, metabolic testing, a MRI scan, and some surveys and questionnaires.

    <description>The primary objective of this study is to determine whether treatment with 8 weeks of inhaled OXT (relative to 8 weeks of placebo) will promote weight loss in children and adolescents with brain tumors and hypothalamic obesity syndrome ages 10 to 21 years. Specifically, the primary outcome will be: the difference of the post-treatment weight between the two periods (treatment vs. placebo); the statistical model will include the difference of the baseline weight between the two periods and the sequence (OXT-PBO versus PBO-OXT).</description>

    <description>All subjects receiving at least one dose of OXT and/or placebo will be included in the safety analysis. The frequencies of AEs by type, body system, severity and relationship to study drug will be summarized. SAEs (if any) will be described in detail. In particular, the proportion of study subjects who were able to achieve the full dosing amount and the proportion of those receiving synthetic vasopressin requiring modification to their usual synthetic vasopressin regimen will also be noted. The incidence of hyponatremia will be reported. Participants will be screened for adverse events using a safety monitoring uniform report form (SMURF).</description>

         15. Pregnant or lactating females.

         16. Individuals with a known sensitivity to either oxytocin or the components of its
