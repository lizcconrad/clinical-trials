      rising dose regimens of BIA 5-453.

    <textblock>
      Two centres, double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled study of six dosage regimens of BIA
      5-453 in six groups of healthy male subjects.

      In each group, the study consisted of a 10-day multiple-dose period. Progression to the next
      dose level only occurred if the previous dose level was considered to be safe and well
      tolerated. An appropriate interval separated the investigation of doses to permit a timely
      review and evaluation of safety data (including plasma exploratory pharmacokinetics) prior to
      proceeding to a higher dose level.
