  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This will be a single center, non comparison clinical trial. Fifty study patients will have
      the Symfony IOL implanted in their dominant eye and a +3,25D Tecnis Multifocal in their
      non-dominant eye. The investigators will be evaluated vision at distance, intermediate and
      near as well as assessing patient satisfaction and spectacle independence.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Each study patient will undergo the same routine cataract extraction procedure in each eye.
      In their dominant eye a Tecnis Symfony IOL will be implanted and in the non dominant eye, a
      Tecnis +3.25D Multifocal implanted. The surgeries will be within 2 days of each other. Every
      patient will receive same postoperative instructions and medications. The aim is to
      investigate the potential benefits of implanting two different IOL's to give the patient a
      wider range of near vision with decreased risk of haloing and glare to enable them to be less
      dependent on reading glasses
