  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The diverse studies published on the future of the elderly hospitalized in resuscitation
      place the limit very low, between 65 and 80 years. The feeling of a very bad forecast at
      these extreme ages pulls nevertheless a filter in the admission in ICU which has this day no
      scientific justification. The knowledge of the evolution after the hospitalization of these
      older patients can help to make certain decisions concerning as well the admission of these
      patients in ICU as the realization of invasive treatments.

      After informal interrogation of numerous intensivists, it seems to take shape a bar around 85
      years beyond which the forecast would be worse without more proof what consolidated the
      choice of this limit.

      The reserved scores were already used in similar studies (simplified ALD).

      Primary purpose :

        -  Describe the survival and the evolution of the quality of life after a stay in
           resuscitation for very old patients.

        -  The quality of life will be studied through a score of autonomy: the simplified ALD
           score.

      The population will be described in general then by age bracket (more or less of 90 years
      old), according to the length of stay in ICU, the heavy treatments (artificial ventilation,
      renal replacement therapy) practiced, the initial gravity (score IGS 2). The impact of
      possible decisions of Limitation or Stop of Therapeutic Activates will also be taken into
      account.
