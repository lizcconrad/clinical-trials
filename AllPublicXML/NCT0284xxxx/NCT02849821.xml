  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, controlled and observational study. Participants underwent a 3-hour
      exposure to hypoxic conditions simulating an altitude of 4,000 meters above sea level
      (m.a.s.l.) in a hypobaric pressure chamber. Clinical parameters, as well as blood and stool
      samples and biopsies from the sigmoid colon (by sigmoidoscopy) are collected at subsequent
      time points. The investigators goal is to evaluate if a 3-hour stay at high altitude (4, 000
      m) can alter disease activity and can modulate a pro inflammatory reaction.

      To evaluate the potential influence of hypoxia on the course of IBD on a biomolecular level,
      and to test the effects of hypoxia under standardized conditions, the investigators initiated
      a prospective and controlled investigation in healthy controls and IBD patients in stable
      remission. the investigators primary aim is to show that a 3-hour stay at high altitude can
      alter disease activity of IBD. Ten healthy volunteers, 11 Crohn's disease (CD) patients and 9
      ulcerative colitis (UC) patients underwent a 3-hour exposure to hypoxic conditions simulating
      an altitude of 4,000 m.a.s.l. in a hypobaric low-pressure chamber situated at the Swiss
      Aeromedical Center, Dubendorf, Switzerland. Stool samples for the analysis of calprotectin
      and microbiotal composition, biopsy samples from the rectosigmoid region, and blood samples
      were repetitively collected and analysed in conjunction with detailed records of clinical
      symptoms over a subsequent interval of 4 weeks.

    <description>Harvey Bradshaw Activity Index (HBI) in Crohn's disease (CD):
To calculate the clinical activity of patients with CD the Harvey Bradshaw Activity Index (HBI) was used. This index includes general wellbeing, abdominal pain, the number of bowel movements, abdominal resistance and CD associated extraintestinal diseases. Each category has a point value assigned and from the sum of all categories a point value is calculated.</description>

    <description>partial Mayo Score for Ulcerative Colitis (UC): To calculate the clinical activity of patients with UC the partial Mayo Score was used. This clinical index includes the stool frequency, the amount of blood in the stool and the physician rating of disease activity. Each category has a point value assigned from 0 to 3 and from the sum of all categories a point value was calculated. Remission is defined as 0-1 points, mild disease 2-4 points, moderate disease 5-6 points and severe disease as 7-9 points.</description>

    <description>The healthy volunteers and IBD patients will have a 3-hour exposure to hypoxic conditions simulating an altitude of 4,000 meters above sea level (m.a.s.l.) in a hypobaric pressure chamber. Before and after the pressure chamber sigmoidoscopy will be performed. During stay in the pressure chamber repetitive measurements of bladder volume will be performed by sonography.</description>

    <description>To retrieve biopsies from the colon during the course of the study 3 sigmoidoscopies were performed. The first sigmoidoscopy was performed 1 day before the stay in the hypobaric chamber. The second sigmoidoscopy was performed directly after the hypobaric chamber and the third sigmoidoscopy was performed 1 week after the hypobaric chamber. During each sigmoidoscopy 6 biopsies were taken with standard size forceps (2.4 mm). One biopsy was analysed by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR), one biopsy was analysed by Western blotting and another biopsy was analysed for gene gene-expression by in situ hybridisation. Two biopsies were analysed by immunohistochemistry (IHC) and one biopsy was stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E).</description>
