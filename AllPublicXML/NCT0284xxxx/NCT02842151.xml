  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate current available assessments (automated vs. manual)
      with which manifest refraction data and biometric variables are obtained to understand if
      data from an automated refractor can be utilized to optimize the A-constant as well as manual
      subjective refraction (ie, to a clinically insignificant difference). The A-constant is the
      calculated number that helps the surgeon determine which IOL should be implanted in the eye
      during cataract surgery.

      Subjects will be implanted with ACRYSOF® IQ Monofocal IOL Model SN60WF. Standard clinical
      practice will be followed for pre-operative testing, IOL power estimation and IOL
      implantation. Only one eye will be enrolled in the study per surgeon determination. The eye
      will undergo both an automated and manual manifest refraction assessment at 3 months
      postoperative.

          -  Use of systemic medications that, in the opinion of the Investigator, may confound the
             outcome or increase the risk of complications to the subject;

          -  Any medical condition that, in the opinion of the Investigator, may confound the
             results of this study, prohibit the completion of the study assessments, or increase
             the risk for the subject;
