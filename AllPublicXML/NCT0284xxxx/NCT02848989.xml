  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Studies have shown that on-going pain following breast surgery is common and may limit the
      ability to participate in physical activity, cause tiredness, difficulty in daily
      chores/activities as well as other problems.

      This study is evaluating whether participating in a 12-week Qigong program (pronounced chee
      kung), an exercise program that involves gentle movements combined with breathing/relaxation
      techniques, also known as mind-body exercise, leads to improvement of pain, physical
      function, and quality of life among breast cancer survivors that have significant pain
      following surgery.

      This is a pilot/feasibility study designed to look at the potential benefits of a 12-week
      program of Qigong mind-body exercise program. The study applies to women who have completed
      physical therapy treatment on symptoms such as pain, and difficulty moving/strength of arm in
      women who are experiencing on-going symptoms after breast cancer surgery. The results of this
      study will be used to help design future studies of the effect of Qigong programs in breast
      cancer survivors.

    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Total number of adverse events sustained from participation in QMBE will be collected for each participant through home practice logs for at home QMBE participation and instructors will report any adverse events that occur during QMBE class on attendance logs. Any adverse events observed will be evaluated according to the DFCI/Harvard Cancer Center guidelines. The study will be considered safe if zero adverse events are observed/reported from participation in prescribed QMBE classes and/or at home practice.</description>

    <measure>Quality of life</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>QOL will be assessed using the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy Breast Symptom Index (FACT-B+4). This instrument consists of 42 items that measure physical, emotional, social and functional well-being, as well as breast cancer specific symptomology associated with upper extremity dysfunction.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Degree of Pain</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Degree of pain will be measured by the Brief Pain Inventory Short Form (BPI SF) and a Pain Medication Log.21 The BPI SF consists of 9 items that measure the severity of pain, impact of pain on daily function, location of pain, pain medications and amount of pain relief in the past 24 hours or the past week. Reliability coefficients for the BPI Severity and Interference scales ranged from .82 to .95</description>

    <measure>Gait &amp; Postural Control</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Gait &amp; postural control will be kinematically assessed during standing and walking using an 8-camera motion analysis system (Vicon 512, Oxford, UK) using standard protocols employed in prior mind-body studies as well as clinical evaluations for both children and adults with walking abnormalities due to mobility-limiting conditions, at the Motion Analysis Laboratory at Spaulding Rehabilitation Hospital.</description>
