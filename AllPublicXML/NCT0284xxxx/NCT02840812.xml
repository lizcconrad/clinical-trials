      This is a single center, open-label, non-randomized, 1:1 parallel control and single dose
      administration study design. Healthy subjects will be matched to severe renal function
      impaired (eGFR≤30mL/min/1.73m2，CKD-EPI estimated) subjects in age, gender and weight as
      parallel control, which matches healthy with normal renal function according to the of
      subjects with impaired renal function as, after enrollment of subjects with severe impaired
      renal function (eGFR≤30mL/min/1.73m2，CKD-EPI estimated). Renal function impaired group and
      control group both receive orally single-dose of nemonoxacin malate capsule (0.5g). Collect
      the blood and urine samples before and after the administration to perform pharmacokinetic
      analysis and safety observation.
