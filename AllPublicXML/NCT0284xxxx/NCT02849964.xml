  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The REIN registry highlights significant disparities in the incidence of end-stage renal
      disease (ESRD) between regions, especially in the North East of France. According to the
      literature, the incidence of ESRD in an area could be related to contextual factors
      influencing the needs for dialysis or transplantation (age structure, prevalence of risk
      factors, socioeconomic and morbidity levels), as well as to primary and secondary care
      provision (general practitioners and nephrologists) and to practice patterns in nephrology.

      The aims of this project are the following:

        1. to compare the incidence of renal replacement therapy (dialysis or preemptive
           transplantation) for ESRD between the &quot;départements&quot; and the &quot;cantons&quot; belonging to the
           5 regions of Eastern France (Alsace, Lorraine, Champagne-Ardenne, Bourgogne and
           Franche-Comté), while taking into account differences in population sizes and spatial
           patterns of the data,

        2. to analyse the relations between incidence disparities and socioeconomic environment,
           geographic accessibility to primary and secondary care and medical practice patterns,
           after adjusting for morbidity and mortality rates (incidence of diabetes, cardiovascular
           mortality).

      This project will enable a better understanding of the mechanisms involved in the spatial
      variations of ESRD incidence, while disentangling effects related to the need from effects
      related to service supply in different socio-economic contexts. It will be possible to
      identify a lack of equity in access to renal replacement therapy if, after adjusting for need
      indicators, there were variations of incidence of ESRD related to availability of service or
      to socioeconomic context. Highlighting such effects would lead to search for corrective
      measures in collaboration with the different stakeholders.
