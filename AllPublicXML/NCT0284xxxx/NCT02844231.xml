      Sleepwalking (also called somnambulism) is a disorder in which only SWS is disrupted. This
      NREM parasomnia is characterized by inappropriate motor behaviors, usually initiated during
      arousal from SWS, that induce psychological distress and alter quality of life, leading to
      fatigue, excessive daytime sleepiness, and objectively impaired vigilance in the morning.

      The pathophysiology of sleepwalking remains poorly understood. Sleepwalkers had difficulty
      maintaining stable, consolidated sleep and experienced more arousals and microarousals,
      specifically from SWS, leading to increased NREM instability, especially during the first
      sleep cycles. The brain is partially awake, resulting in behavioral manifestations, and
      partially in NREM sleep, resulting in no conscious awareness of actions.

      A Single Photonic Emission Computed Tomography (SPECT) study of one sleepwalking episode
      found increased activation in the posterior cingulate cortex and cerebellum, with
      deactivation in the frontoparietal associative cortices. Data from intracerebral EEGs during
      confusional arousals confirmed both local arousal of the motor and cingulate cortices and
      increased delta activity in the frontoparietal associative cortices.

      The investigators thus proposed a controlled study of SPECT imagery in 24 sleepwalkers (12
      SPECT during a SW episode and 12 SPECT during slow wave sleep and 24 during wakefulness) and
      12 controls (during slow wave sleep and wakefulness). SW episodes will be elicited by sleep
      deprivation condition associated with forced arousal (auditory stimulus).

      The comparative analyses of SPECT acquisitions between different states (wakefulness, slow
      wave sleep and SW) and populations (sleepwalkers versus controls) will provide new insights
      about the complex pathophysiology of SW episodes.
