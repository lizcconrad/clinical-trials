  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cytomegalovirus is a herpesviridae whose prevalence in general population is between 50 to
      80%. In immunocompetent individuals, CMV remains latent in a number of cells, without any
      pathological consequence. Immunosuppression may reactivate the virus causing either a
      CMV-active infection or a CMV disease with attributable symptoms.

      In Intensive Care Unit (ICU), 6 to 30 % of critically ill patients without classical
      immunosuppression, as those suffering from septic shock, present CMV reactivation. Our aim is
      to study the risk factors for developing viremia or CMV disease in ICU patients in septic
      shock without previous immunodepression and determine the relationship between viral
      reactivation and this acquired immunity alteration.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Immunosuppression statuses causing both CMV active infection or disease are mainly
      consecutive to HIV infection, bone marrow or solid organ transplantation. However, in
      severely ill patients, as in septic shock, it has been proved that after a hyper-inflammatory
      phase occurred a negative control of the immunity, resulting in a paralysed or impaired
      immune system. The length and extent of this immunodeficiency is correlated with the duration
      of ICU stay, the occurrence of nosocomial infection and mortality.

      A better understanding of CMV's natural history reactivation in the critically ill patient
      would better define the benefits from a specific therapy.
