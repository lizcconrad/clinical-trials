  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to determine the effects bevacizumab (the study drug)
      combined with Optune (the study device) tumor treatment field therapy has on meningiomas.
      Bevacizumab is considered investigational because the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)
      has not approved its use for the treatment of meningiomas. The study drug is a medication
      that blocks the growth of new blood vessels. It is thought that the study drug may interfere
      with the growth of new blood vessels and therefore might stop tumor growth, and possibly
      shrink the tumor by keeping it from receiving nutrients and oxygen supplied by the blood
      vessels. Optune is also considered investigational because the US FDA has not approved its
      use for the treatment of meningiomas. Optune is a device that the patient will wear and use
      for at least 18 hours of each day. It delivers alternating electrical current to the
      patient's brain tumor and by doing so interrupts a process called mitosis. Mitosis needs to
      occur in order for cell division to occur and allows tumors to grow. By slowing this process,
      we hypothesize that meningioma growth may also be slowed.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine progression free survival (PFS) for 6 months (PFS-6) in patients with
      recurrent or progressive meningioma.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine overall survival (OS). II. To determine tumor response rate (TRR). III. To
      assess quality of life with treatment (QOL) using Functional Assessment of Cancer
      Therapy-Brain (FACT-Br) questionnaire.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive bevacizumab intravenously (IV) over 30-90 minutes on days 1 and 15 of
      courses 1-4. Beginning on day 1 of course 5, patients may choose to receive bevacizumab IV
      every 3 weeks or remain on the every 2-week schedule. Patients also undergo electric field
      therapy using Optune (formerly NovoTTF-100A System) daily over 18 hours. Courses repeat every
      28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 2 years.
