      &quot;Children exposed to alcohol or drugs during pregnancy: Growth, health and development&quot;
      Background Children exposed to drugs during pregnancy are at risk of developmental disorders.
      The scope and size of this problem is poorly known in Norway.

      Alcohol has a known teratogenic effect on the fetus. How other drugs affect the fetus, is
      associated with more uncertainty. Withdrawal in the neonatal period has been perceived as the
      main problem. There is less knowledge about long-term outcome of exposure to drugs during
      pregnancy.

      Aim The aim of the study is to investigate the physical and mental health of children exposed
      to drugs during pregnancy. Identify the children's need for measures in the home and school,
      and how many of the children who are taken care of in fostercare.

      A sample of the children will be offered radiological examination of the brain (f-MRI). The
      purpose is to study the relationship between exposure to drugs, child development,
      environment and organic brain dysfunction.

      Design The project is a quantitative study. The relationship between exposure to drugs and
      development will be measured by questionnaires, clinical examination, neuropsychological
      tests and radiological examination (f-MRI).

      Children aged 2-15years who were referred, examined or treated for drug related problems at
      the Department of Pediatrics, Haukeland University Hospital will be invited to participate in
      the study.

      Information retrieval and examination of the children are expected to be completed during
      2011. Data analysis and further processing of data are expected to be completed during 2013.
