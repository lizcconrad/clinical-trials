      The overall purpose of this study is to test the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary
      efficacy of a family-focused behavioral intervention (&quot;FLARE&quot;, which stands for Family
      Lifestyle Actions and Risk Education) that aims to improve adherence to melanoma preventive
      behaviors among children at elevated risk for the disease.
