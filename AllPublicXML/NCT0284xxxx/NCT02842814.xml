      Whether and when systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) patients with stable disease should
      withdraw glucocorticoid (GC)? How about the relapse risk? What are the risk factors for
      disease flare? All the above are unclear. Long-course GC treatment has a lot of side-effects
      even in a sustaining low dose. The aim of this study is to explore the relapse risk after GC
      withdrawal in SLE patients with stable disease more than one year and to establish a
      predictive model for flare risk stratification.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a chronic autoimmune disease with a relapsing-remitting
      course. For patients in remission, glucocorticoid (GC) is used to be maintained in a low dose
      for a long time in fear of disease flare. Long-term GC could bring a lot of side-effects even
      in a low dose. Whether and when patients with stable disease should withdraw GC? How about
      the relapse risk? What are the risk factors for disease flare? All the above remain unclear.
      The aim of this study is to explore the relapse risk after GC withdrawal in SLE patients with
      stable disease and to establish a predictive model for risk stratification. Meanwhile the
      investigators aim to testify the effects of hydroxychloroquine in preventing SLE relapse.
      This study is an open-labeled randomized controlled clinical trial.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Percent of subjects with mild to moderate Lupus flare evaluated by modified SELENA-SLEDAI flare index (SFI)</measure>
    <time_frame>33 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The SFI includes three elements: the SELENA-SLEDAI score (range 0 ~105, with 0 indicating inactive disease and ); an assessment of new or worsening disease activity, medication changes, and hospitalizations that not captured with the use of the SLEDAI; and the score on the physician's global-assessment (PGA) visual-analogue scale (range, 0 to 3, 1=mild, 2=moderate, 3=severe); Mild to moderate flare by SFI is defined as appearance of one of the following: a change in SLEDAI&gt;3 points but≤12 points; or new onset/worse of cutaneous/ mucosal injury (discoid, photosensitivity, profundus, cutaneous vasculitis, bullous lupus, Nasopharyngeal ulcers), serositis (pleuritis and/or pericarditis), arthritis, SLE associated fever; or the need to increase prednisone dosage to no more than 0.5 mg/kg/day; or the need to add hydroxychloroquine or NSAIDs with no increase in the dose GC; or an increment of PGA ranges from 1.0 to 2.5.</description>

  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Mean change in PGA</measure>
    <time_frame>33 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The PGA is a visual analog scale scored from 0 to 3. A score of 1 corresponds to mild lupus disease activity; A score of 2 correlates with moderate disease activity and a score of 3 with severe disease activity</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>• Percent of subjects with at least one B in any system evaluated with The British Isles Lupus Activity Group (BILAG) scoring system</measure>
    <time_frame>33 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>BILAG includes 9 systems (constitutional, mucocutaneous, neuropsychiatric, musculoskeletal, cardiorespiratory, gastrointestinal, ophthalmic, renal and haematological). A to E scoring is based on the physician's intention to treat: Grade A: treatment requiring any of the following 1) high dose oral glucocorticoids, eg: prednisolone&gt;20mg/day; 2) intravenous pulse glucocorticoids, eg: pulse methylprednisolone ≥ 500 mg；3)systemic immunomodulators (include biologicals, immunoglobulins and plasmapheresis)；4) therapeutic high dose anticoagulation, eg: warfarin INR 3 - 4; Grade B: treatment requiring any of the following treatment:1) low dose oral glucocorticoids, eg: prednisolone ≤ 20mg/day; 2) intramuscular or intra-articular or soft tissue glucocorticoids injection; 3) topical glucocorticoids;4) topical immunomodulators; 5) antimalarials or thalidomide;6) symptomatic therapy; eg: NSAIDs; Grade C: mild disease; Grade D: inactive now but previously affected; Grade E: systems never involved</description>
