  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Suicidal behavior (SB) is a public health problem. The clinical model currently admitted to
      the understanding of SB is a stress vulnerability model, but so far, all scientific works has
      no clinical application. The management of psychiatric patients, including depressed
      subjects, faces the inability to detect those with a high risk of SB. Many studies have shown
      a link between low cholesterol and SB. A study has recently proposed a total cholesterol
      threshold below which the risk of suicide could be increased. However, a prospective study is
      needed to assess the predictive nature of such an indicator.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Investigators propose to assess, within a cohort of patients, the predictive value of a total
      cholesterol threshold in the occurrence of SB.

      555 inpatients suffering from a current Major depressive disorder (MDD), hospitalized in the
      Department of Emergency Psychiatry and Post Acute Care will be recruited.

      Each patient will attend a total of 5 visits during a follow-up period of 18 months (visits
      at 1, 3, 6, 12, and 18 months)
