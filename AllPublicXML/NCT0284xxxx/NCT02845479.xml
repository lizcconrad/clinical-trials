      Stage I of the Thoracic-POISE study will pilot-test a broad-based, multi-agent integrative
      care intervention delivered by naturopathic doctors in conjunction with standard surgical and
      oncologic care of people with thoracic cancer.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Despite enormous advances in thoracic surgery and oncology, two critical issues concern
      patients undergoing curative-intent surgery for lung, gastric and esophageal cancer: first, a
      majority (~60%) of patients experience minor and major adverse events occurring during and in
      the days following surgery; second, patients worry about the significant risk of cancer
      recurrence and mortality months to years after surgery. These issues, combined with side
      effects of chemotherapy and radiation, have detrimental effects on health-related quality of
      life (HRQoL). On a deeper level, there is the problem of an ongoing failure to integrate and
      evaluate the best of what complementary medicine has to offer surgical oncology care.

      The Thoracic-POISE Project has the overarching goal of improving care for thoracic cancer
      patients by impacting HRQoL, reducing surgical adverse events, prolonging overall survival
      and pioneering integrative care delivery. This multi-stage project aims to design, pilot-test
      and evaluate a broad-based, multi-agent, evidence-based integrative care program to be
      delivered by naturopathic doctors (ND) in conjunction with standard surgical and oncologic
      care. It is hypothesized that this integrative care program will improve HRQoL as well as
      reduce surgical adverse events and improve cancer survival. Stage I of the project will
      pilot-test the intervention and outcomes collection in a single-arm, feasibility study.
