  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Ankylosing spondylitis (AS) is a rheumatoid disease affecting all segments of the axial
      skeleton, leading to the complete fusion of all spinal segments - the bamboo-spine. During
      the last decade biological disease modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (bDMARD) have been
      successfully introduced to reduce the disease activity. It is unclear whether bDMARD
      treatment had an effect on spinal fracture risk related to AS. This national registry study
      will investigate the effect of bDMARD treatment on spinal fracture risk in a national cohort
      of patients with AS.
