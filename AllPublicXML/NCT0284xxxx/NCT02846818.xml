  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Impaired cerebral function remains an important complication of cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB)
      during cardiac surgery. The aim of the present study is to investigate whether the lactate to
      pyruvate (LP) ratio obtained by microdialysis (MD) of the cerebral venous outflow reflects a
      derangement of global cerebral energy state during cardiopulmonary bypass.

      Patients undergoing primary, elective coronary artery bypass grafting were blindly randomized
      to usual range MAP (40 to 60 mmHg; n = 5) or intervention group MAP (60 to 80 mmHg; n = 5)
      during CPB. MD catheters were positioned in a retrograde direction in the internal jugular
      vein and a reference catheter was inserted into the brachial artery. The relations between LP
      ratio, MAP, data obtained from bi-frontal NIRS and neurological outcome measures were
      assessed.
