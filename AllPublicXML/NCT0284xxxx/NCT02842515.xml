  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Current endodontic treatment are based essentially on the ouster of parenchyma in case of
      trauma or irreversible pulp inflammation. These situations typically affect immature teeth in
      subjects aged from 8 to 15 years. Consequently, loss of a functional pulp is leads to
      discontinuation of root development and apical closure. The challenge for the clinician in
      the management of such situations is then preserving a pulp vitality. But current practices
      consist in a filling of the endo-canal system with an inert or semi-inert material. In this
      case, no pulp vitality is present. New treatment methods are needed. The objective Pulp'R is
      the study the feasibility of preparing an autologous combined advanced therapy medicinal
      product (ATMP) for dental pulp regeneration in the patient with irreversible pulp
      inflammation or dental trauma.
