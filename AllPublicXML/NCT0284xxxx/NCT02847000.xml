  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with pancreatic cancer which has stopped responding to one or more chemotherapy
      drugs are asked to take part in this study. The study hopes to find out whether decitabine,
      the drug being studied, will have an effect on pancreatic cancer. The decitabine is being
      given at a lower dose than its approved use. It is also being given with another drug,
      tetrahydrouridine (THU), to improve the exposure of your pancreatic cancer cells to
      decitabine.

      The purpose of this study is to determine if the drug combination of decitabine and
      tetrahydrouridine can recognize a certain DNA target in your cancer. All cells have DNA
      within them, and tumor cells have abnormal DNA.

      Primary Objective The primary goal of this pilot study is to detect decitabine therapy
      induced DNMT1 protein level decreases with an effect size of 1 using a paired t-test and
      alpha=0.05. The effect size is defined as the difference in mean DNMT1-protein levels between
      post-treatment and pre-treatment divided by the standard deviation and is thus a metric of
      change in the natural units of the distribution, its standard deviation. Our goal is thus to
      detect drops in DNMT1 of at least one standard deviation.

      Secondary Objectives Secondary goals include correlating DNMT1 decreases with clinical
      response (measured by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors [RECIST1.1]), using
      logistic regression; time to relapse, using a Cox model; tolerability and safety assessment
      by toxicity characterization using CTCAEv4.

      Study Design Single-arm, open-label, proof-of-concept clinical trial in patients with
      metastatic pancreatic cancer that has progressed on one or more lines of systemic therapy.

    <measure>Clinical Response as measured by RECIST 1.1 guidelines</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Complete Response (CR): Disappearance of all target lesions. Any pathological lymph nodes (whether target or non-target) must have reduction in short axis to &lt; 10 mm.
Partial Response (PR): At least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum of diameters.
Progressive Disease (PD): At least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum on study (this includes the baseline sum if that is the smallest on study). In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 mm.
Stable Disease (SD): Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for PD, taking as reference the smallest sum diameters while on study.</description>

             Because there is an unknown, but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants
             secondary to treatment of the mother with oral THU-Dec, breastfeeding should be
             discontinued if the mother is treated with oral THU-Dec.

          -  Other severe acute or chronic medical or psychiatric conditions or laboratory
             abnormality that may increase the risk associated with study participation or study
             drug administration, or may interfere with the interpretation of study results, and in
             the judgment of the investigator would make the patient inappropriate for entry into
             this study.
