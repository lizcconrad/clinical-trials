  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      New CZT-based SPECT cameras are potentially capable of dynamic 3-D acquisition. Preliminary
      results suggested that dynamic acquisitions could allow the assessment of myocardial flow
      reserve using 99mTc-labelled perfusion tracers. The Flow-Heart study will assess the
      feasibility of myocardial flow reserve measurement by means of 99mTc-DTPA dynamic cardiac
      SPECT in 20 patients.
