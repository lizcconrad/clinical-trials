    <textblock>
      This is a pilot study randomizing patients with insomnia and coronary heart disease to either
      general sleep hygiene counseling and web-based cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia
      versus general sleep hygiene counseling alone (followed by the cognitive behavioral therapy
      at a later date).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      For this pilot study, the investigators will recruit up to 30 participants with insomnia and
      coronary heart disease. Another 30 patients will be recruited from another institution.
      Patients will be screened with a modified version of the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI), a
      brief self-report instrument validated for identifying insomnia. The investigators will
      modify the ISI to include exclusionary criteria. The investigators will randomize
      participants to 6 weeks of access to web based cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia
      (wCBT-I) using an internet based CBT-I program plus education provided through access to the
      Harvard Sleep Education web site (which provides general sleep education information only)
      compared to 6 weeks of access to the Harvard Sleep Education web site, followed by access to
      the web-CBT program (a wait list control group). The investigators will test the hypothesis
      that use of wCBT-I improves sleep quality and sleep duration as measured by sleep diaries and
      the ISI. A secondary goal of the study is to assess the recruitment yields, retention and
      adherence rates.

    <description>We are using a web-based cognitive behavioral therapy program called Go! to Sleep. Go! to Sleep is an interactive online program developed by specialists in Cleveland Clinic's Wellness Institute and Sleep Disorders Center. The program is a 6 week self-help program that uses cognitive behavioral therapy techniques that have been proven to be effective in decreasing symptoms of insomnia.</description>
