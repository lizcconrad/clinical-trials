  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Memory for action is especially important in everyday life although current literature is not
      very abundant. The enactment effect (i.e. better memory for performed actions than for
      verbally encoded sentences) is usually described as a robust effect in aging and can be found
      in many diseases. Although the enactment effect has been studied for three decades, there is
      still no consensus on how it enhances memory. Therefore, in order to gain additional insight
      into the representational basis of the enactment effect, in the present study, the
      investigators propose to test neurological patients. The investigators suggested that memory
      for action should be better than memory for verbally encoded information in Alzheimer's
      disease and Parkinson's disease.

      If patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD) have no cognitive
      assessment during the last 6 months, then they will realize different tests: MMSE (1), HAD
      (2), a cognitive assessment (3); (4); BREF (5); Assessment of apraxia, (6). Controls will
      perform the same tests to verify that they have no cognitive impairment. Then, two
      experimental conditions will be presented in all patients and controls: a first in which
      participants will have to name drawings (verbal learning) and a second in which they will
      have to reproduce an action associated with drawings (action learning). Immediately after
      this learning phase, a recognition task will be available and therefore participants will
      have to recognize drawings that had been presented previously. The main criteria used in the
      statistical analysis will be the correct recognition score.
