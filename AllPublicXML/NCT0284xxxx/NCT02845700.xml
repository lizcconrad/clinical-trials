  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study will use a prospective design consisting of three phases. The phases are:

        1. the development of the sensory retraining treatment (SRT),

        2. the evaluation of the treatment's feasibility and acceptability, and

        3. an assessment of its efficacy.

      During the third phase, a pilot study will be conducted in which participants will be
      randomly assigned to either SRT or a waitlist control group in order to assess efficacy.
      Diagnostic information and eligibility criteria will be assessed using the Structured
      Clinical Interview for DSM-IV (SCID) and the Clinician Administered PTSD Scale for DSM-5
      (CAPS-5).

      This study will use clinical interviews, self-report measures, and behavioral assessments to
      evaluate the efficacy of the SRT protocol. The study will recruit approximately 30 veterans.
      The primary inclusionary criterion will be that participants must show some evidence of
      olfactory perceptual bias toward military-relevant stimuli (e.g., burning rubber, decay,
      fuel). Investigators are not requiring current suicidal ideation as an entry criterion
      because investigators believe that a fair percentage of veterans will have some suicidal
      ideation/intent but making this an entry requirement will limit the investigators ability to
      recruit given the tight timeline for the study.

      The study will consist of the development and evaluation of a novel intervention. The
      essential feature of this intervention is the use of a gradient of triggering smells (e.g.,
      burning rubber, decay, fuel, etc.), to which participants will be systematically exposed in
      an effort to facilitate habituation to these odors. The SRT protocol will be administered
      over two 1-hour sessions. Participants will return 1 month after their final SRT protocol
      session to complete a battery of follow-up measures, as well as the CAPS-5.

      The primary outcome measures of interest are: olfactory perceptual bias (as measured by the
      olfactory bias assessment), suicidal ideation and behaviors (as measured by the Beck Suicide
      Scale and Depressive Symptom Inventory- Suicidality Subscale), and symptoms related to
      suicide, such as anxiety and trauma (as measured by the Beck Anxiety Inventory and PTSD
      Checklist for DSM-5, respectively).

    <description>A participant's ability to detect an array of threatening malodor in neutral dilution gradients will be tested at baseline and after the second and final intervention session, approximately one week after the baseline appointment. Perceptual bias is calculated as the percentage of correct responses (i.e., yes or no to detecting the malodor) on an odor over 6 trials for each of the 8 odors, at 25% and 33% dilution (i.e., over 96 trials).</description>

    <description>The retraining portion (SRT) will also involve the systematic presentation of diluted malodors. For each individual, vials on either side of their initial ideographic detection threshold established in the bias assessment phase will be presented. During the retraining, participants will be given feedback to shift their bias away from the malodorous target stimuli. For example, in the context of diluted solutions participants will be given the feedback that they are &quot;correct&quot; when a &quot;neutral&quot; response is given to solutions that are above the starting threshold (stronger malodor) and &quot;incorrect&quot; when a target is endorsed that is below the starting threshold (weaker malodor).
The retraining process will involve multiple ratings cycled through the malodors as well as other positive and neutral smells. Each training session will consist of 4 training blocks.</description>

    <description>Approximately half of the participants will be randomized to the SNT condition designed to control for the effects of time and learning. In the SNT condition, participants will complete the same assessments (including the olfactory bias assessment), as well as a sham training consisting of neutral/neutral odor pairing dilutions, rather than the combat/neutral odor pairings as in the SRT. Following the one-month assessment, they will be given the option to complete the SRT.</description>

    <description>Perceptual retraining involves the systematic presentation of diluted malodors (i.e., odors perceived as threatening). For each individual, vials on either side of a pre-determined and ideographic detection threshold will be presented. During the retraining, participants will be given feedback to shift their bias away from the malodorous target stimuli. For example, in the context of diluted solutions participants will be given the feedback that they are &quot;correct&quot; when a &quot;neutral&quot; response is given to solutions that are above the starting threshold (stronger malodor) and &quot;incorrect&quot; when a target is endorsed that is below the starting threshold (weaker malodor).</description>
