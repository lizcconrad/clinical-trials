    <textblock>
      Regular physical activity promotes physical and mental well-being in the general population.
      Patients with multiple sclerosis (MS patients) tend them, to limit their physical activity or
      because of deficiencies related to the disease, or even on the advice of their caregivers in
      order to save their functional abilities. Time for leisure activity could be almost 20% lower
      in MS patients compared to healthy controls, and this situation is likely to aggravate the
      functional symptoms of multiple sclerosis.

      The literature described the benefit of physical activity for MS patients according to
      protocols and varied assessments. Evaluations were indeed concern very analytical elements of
      metabolic functioning, nervous, muscular, cardiopulmonary etc ... or take into account the
      performance of components or fatigue and quality of life. Due to the multiplicity of RE
      protocols, sometimes on the verge of pragmatic goals of functional rehabilitation, the double
      issue was the profit earned by an RE program and of this benefit by level of severity of MS.
      The main objective of our study was an evaluation of the effects on fatigue and quality of
      life of a retraining program to effort suitable for levels of impairment and patients with MS
      activity limitations. The secondary objective was checking a performance improvement of the
      patients in this adapted program.

        Due to the double question about the expected benefits of our CR program, the inclusion of
        patients was conducted in two distinct periods, from specialized MS consultations in the
        services of Neurology and Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation ( MPR) of the University
        Hospital of Nantes (France). The first period (I) would lead to compare patients with EDSS
        less than 6 performing an exercise training (retrained group = IA) and patients with
        similar levels of EDSS not engaged in physical training (not retrained group = IB). The
        second period (II) compared to patients EDSS between 6 and 8 (EDSS group high = IIA) and
        patients with lower EDSS (EDSS group IIB = low), the two groups were following a RE
        program.
