      Men who have sex with men remain at high risk for HIV infection. Targeting prevention
      interventions to MSM at highest risk of seroconversion is an important goal of combination
      prevention interventions. Antecedent diagnosis of another sexually transmitted infection
      (STI), particularly syphilis, may serve as an entry point for biomedical prevention as these
      individuals are at highest risk for incident HIV. The use of the antiretroviral combination
      of tenofovir/emtricitabine has been shown to be associated with an overall 44% reduction in
      HIV acquisition in high-risk MSM when taken daily as PrEP. In those individuals with
      detectable drug levels, the benefit was as high as 90% risk reduction. In real-world
      evaluations of PrEP, high-risk sexual behaviour may continue as evidenced by high rates of
      intercurrent sexually transmitted infections. As such, biomedical interventions that may
      offer additional reduction in acquisition of common sexually transmitted infections should
      also be evaluated.

      Recently a small pilot study has demonstrated potential benefit from a similar strategy for
      syphilis prevention. In this study 30 MSM were randomized to receive either 100mg doxycycline
      once daily or contingency management strategies linked to remaining free of sexually
      transmitted diseases at progressive study visits. Overall, those receiving doxycycline were
      significantly less likely to be diagnosed with any STI during followup than those in the
      comparator arm.

      The investigators therefore propose to undertake a pilot study to evaluate the feasibility of
      using both tenofovir/emtricitabine and doxycycline (immediate or deferred use) for
      pre-exposure prophylaxis amongst HIV-negative MSM with recent history of syphilis infection
      in Vancouver, Canada.

      1. Rationale: 1.1 Men who have sex with men with antecedent diagnosis of another sexually
      transmitted infection, particularly syphilis, are at high risk for HIV infection.

      Men who have sex with men (MSM) continue to experience high rates of HIV incident infections
      in Canada and a disproportionately high burden of disease relative to the general population.
      In 2011, approximately 48% of new diagnoses occurred in MSM across Canada, a figure that has
      been relatively stable for the last decade. Within British Columbia (BC), although HIV new
      diagnosis rates overall have been declining over the last decade (dropping from a rate of
      10.6 cases/100,000 in 2004 to 5.9 cases/100,000 in 2013), MSM made up an increasing majority
      of new diagnoses (59%) within BC in 2013. Within Vancouver Coastal Health Authority (VCH),
      approximately 70% of all new HIV diagnoses annually from 2012-15 were amongst MSM.

      Targeting prevention interventions to MSM at highest risk is important when determining
      potential publicly funded biomedical interventions, particularly the use of HIV pre-exposure
      prophylaxis (PrEP). Antecedent diagnosis of another sexually transmitted infection (STI) may
      serve as an entry point for biomedical prevention as these individuals are at highest risk
      for incident HIV. In an evaluation of HIV incidence following diagnosis of syphilis infection
      in New York City, the annual HIV incidence was 3.6% (95% Confidence Interval [CI]: 3.27% -
      3.97%), with overall HIV incidence amongst MSM of 5.56% (1). In those males with syphilis and
      a subsequent additional STI the HIV incidence was even greater at 7.89% (95% CI: 6.62% -
      9.24%). A similar analysis of clients attending STI clinics in BC has revealed that
      antecedent STI is predictive of an elevated risk for subsequent HIV seroconversion with
      clients who ever had a diagnosis of syphilis having an HIV incidence of 3.6% person-years
      (95%CI: 2.5-4.9), gonorrhea (2.0%; 95%CI: 1.6-2.5), rectal gonorrhea (4.5% person-years;
      95%CI: 3.4-5.8), while individuals with rectal gonorrhea and syphilis had an incidence rate
      of 12.6 % person-years (95%CI: 8.4-21.8).

      Evaluating the use of PrEP in MSM with antecedent STI is an important component to inform HIV
      prevention programs in BC and nationally. The STI clinics operated by the BC Centre for
      Disease Control are well-positioned for this evaluation as about 15 and 25% of all HIV
      diagnoses in BC and VCH, respectively are diagnosed at these clinics.

      1.2. STI prevention strategies may also benefit from biomedical prevention interventions

      Novel biomedical strategies have been shown to be effective in preventing acquisition of STI
      such as HIV, and are now considered to be standard of care for at-risk MSM in the United
      States. The use of the antiretroviral combination of tenofovir/emtricitabine has been shown
      to be associated with an overall 44% reduction in HIV acquisition in high-risk MSM when taken
      daily as PrEP. In those individuals with detectable drug levels, the benefit was as high as
      90% risk reduction. In real-world evaluations of PrEP, high-risk sexual behaviour may
      continue as evidenced by high rates of intercurrent STI (50% of PrEP users after 12 months in
      a study of 657 PrEP initiators in San Francisco). As such, biomedical interventions that may
      offer additional reduction in acquisition of common sexually transmitted infections should be
      evaluated.

      Recently a small pilot study has demonstrated potential benefit from a similar strategy for
      syphilis prevention (2). In this study 30 MSM were randomized to receive either 100mg
      doxycycline once daily or contingency management strategies linked to remaining free of
      sexually transmitted diseases at progressive study visits. Doxycycline 100mg daily was chosen
      based on prior studies indicating that doses as low as once weekly doxycycyline could serve
      as prophylaxis for leptospirosis, another spirochete infection.

      Overall, those receiving doxycycline were significantly less likely to be diagnosed with any
      STI during follow-up than those in the comparator arm (odds ratio [OR] 0.27; 95% CI 0.09 -
      0.83). Specific protection against syphilis infection was not seen during the on-treatment
      phase (OR 0.27; 95% CI 0.04 - 1.73), possibly reflecting the small sample size. During the
      study period, no change in sexual behaviours between arms was noted, supporting the potential
      role of doxycycline prophylaxis. A larger pilot evaluation of this strategy, in combination
      with HIV PrEP, would be a novel syndemic approach to addressing both the HIV and syphilis
      burden amongst the highest risk MSM.

      The investigators therefore propose to undertake a randomized trial of immediate vs. deferred
      doxycycline in conjunction with daily tenofovir/emtricitabine to determine the feasibility of
      combined HIV and syphilis pre-exposure prophylaxis amongst HIV-negative MSM with recent
      history of syphilis infection in Vancouver, Canada.

      2. Objectives:

        1. To assess feasibility of using dual daily PrEP. Defined as:

             1. Proportion of individuals successfully completing 12 months of
                tenofovir/emtricitabine

             2. Proportion of individuals successfully completing six and 12 months of doxycycline.

        2. To evaluate the adherence and tolerability of daily dual PrEP in at-risk MSM.

        3. To evaluate changes in sexual activity reported by study participants over the study
           period.

        4. To evaluate HIV incidence and syphilis re-infection rates over a 12 month period
           stratified by use of doxycycline for PrEP.

        5. To describe frequency of other STI's diagnosed in study participants over the study
           period.
