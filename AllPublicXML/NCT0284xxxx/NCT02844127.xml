  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine how the position of the right ventricular (RV) coil
      of an implantable cardioverter defibrillator (apex versus septum) affects the defibrillation
      threshold; specifically, can defibrillator threshold be improved by implantation site
      selection.

      The investigators propose a prospective, pseudo-randomized study of patients who are electing
      to undergo implantation of an implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD).

      There are two locations in the heart in which ICDs are normally implanted: the apex and the
      septum. The purpose of this study is to determine whether the ICD performs better in one
      location or the other, as measured by defibrillation threshold. In this study, both locations
      will be tested in each patient. The final location will be determined by the implanting
      physician as the location that is best for the patient.

    <description>The percentage of patients that have an improved safety profile from septal implantation versus apical implantation will be calculated. Improved safety profile is defined as a defibrillation threshold increase of &gt;4 joules.</description>

    <description>Patients will receive an Implantable Cardioverter Defibrillator (ICD), with the leads implanted in either the apex or the septum as the first location. After defibrillation threshold is determined, the leads position will be changed to the second location and DFT will be determined again.</description>
