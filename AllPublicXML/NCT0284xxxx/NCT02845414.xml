    <textblock>
      This is a single center, phase I dose escalation study designed to determine the maximum
      tolerated dose (MTD) or recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of deimmunized CD133KDEL
      (dCD133KDEL), a ligand-directed, deimmunized pseudomonas toxin against CD133, in patients
      with advanced, previously treated, refractory solid tumors.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Pathologically or cytologically confirmed, metastatic or unresectable solid tumor
             malignancy.

          2. Measurable or evaluable disease per RECIST 1.1 criteria (Appendix II), or modified
             RECIST criteria for mesothelioma (Appendix II).

          3. At least 1 prior line of systemic therapy considered standard for the malignancy, and
             for which no standard therapies exist. Prior systemic chemotherapy, immunotherapy,
             biological therapy, radiation therapy and/or surgery are allowed before the first dose
             of dCD133KDEL with the following restrictions:

               -  At least 14 days since any systemic therapy.

               -  At least 28 days since any experimental therapy.

               -  At least 14 days since any radiation therapy.

               -  At least 28 days since any major surgery, defined as a surgery involving a risk
                  to the life of the patient, specifically, an operation upon an organ within the
                  cranium, chest, abdomen, or pelvic cavity.

          4. Recovered from the acute toxic effects (≤ grade 1, CTCAE v4.0) of previous cancer
             treatment prior to study registration.

          5. ECOG performance status 0 or 1 (Appendix III).

          6. Adequate organ function within 14 days of study registration, defined as follows
             System Parameter Laboratory Value Hematologic Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥1.5 x
             10^9 /L Hemoglobin* 9 g/dL Platelets* ≥100 x 10^9 /L Hepatic Total bilirubin &lt; 2 x
             ULN^ ALT &lt; 2 x ULN^ Renal Serum creatinine &lt; 1.5 mg/dL OR estimated GFR &gt;50 by
             modified Cockcroft-Gault (* Patient may not have had a transfusion within 7 days

             ^ Upper limit of institutional normal.)

          7. Albumin ≥ 3.0 gm/dL within 14 days of study registration.

          8. Adequate cardiac function, defined as an ejection fraction ≥40% on transthoracic
             echocardiogram done within 14 days of study registration.

          9. QT/QTc interval ≤ 450 milliseconds within 14 days of study registration. If this
             screening EKG demonstrates a QT/QTc interval &gt; 450 milliseconds, a second screening
             EKG will be done within 7 days to document that the QT prolongation is persistent. The
             patient will be eligible if the second screening EKG shows a QT/QTc interval ≤ 450
             milliseconds but will require additional EKGs during the study period as outlined in
             section 6.1.2.

         10. Adequate pulmonary function, defined as resting oxygen saturation ≥ 90% on room air
             and/or pulmonary function tests (PFT) showing corrected DLCO &gt;50% and FEV1 ≥ 2 liters
             or ≥ 60% of predicted. PFT testing is required within 28 days of study registration
             only if the patient is symptomatic or prior known impairment is present.

         11. Females of childbearing potential and males who have partners of childbearing
             potential must agree to use 2 effective contraception methods, one of which must be a
             barrier method, during the study and for ≥12 weeks after the last dose of dCD133KDEL.
             Effective methods include intrauterine device (IUD), Depo-Provera injection or
             implant, Evra patch, NuvaRing, oral contraception, and diaphragm/spermicide with
             condom.

         12. Ability to understand and provide voluntary written consent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Known active CNS metastases or neurological symptoms possibly related to CNS
             metastases, spinal cord compression, or evidence of leptomeningeal disease. Patients
             with a history of brain metastases who have undergone whole brain radiation or gamma
             knife treatment ≥ 28 days prior to registration, whose metastases are documented as
             stable or resolved at the time of screening by brain MRI (or head CT with contrast for
             those who are intolerant of MRI), and do not require ≥10 mg of prednisone equivalent
             for symptom management related to the brain metastases, are eligible.

          2. Known uncontrolled cardiac arrhythmias, electrocardiographic evidence of acute
             ischemia or active conduction system abnormalities within 28 days of registration.

          3. Uncontrolled intercurrent illness or psychiatric illness/social situations that would
             limit compliance with study requirements.

          4. History of any one or more cardiovascular conditions within 12 weeks of study
             registration

               -  cardiac angioplasty or stenting

               -  myocardial infarction

               -  unstable angina

               -  coronary artery bypass graft surgery

               -  symptomatic peripheral vascular disease

                  Association (NYHA, Appendix IV)

               -  transient ischemic attack and/or cerebrovascular accident

          5. History of another malignancy other than non-melanoma skin cancer or treated carcinoma
             in situ, unless documented to be disease free for at least 3 years.

          6. History of allergic reaction or sensitivity to compounds of similar chemical or
             biological composition to dCD133KDEL, or any of the components of dCD133KDEL (i.e.
             Polysorbate 80).

          7. Pregnant or breastfeeding women, or women intending to become pregnant. Females of
