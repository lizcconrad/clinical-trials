  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      LUNG-EST is a retrospective study including 152 patients who benefit from lung surgery during
      the years 2012 to 2013 at Hospices civils de Lyon and with a diagnosis of lung
      adenocarcinomas. For all patients, clinical data and histopathological data are available.
      The objective of this study is to characterize these lung adenocarcinomas by the LungCarta
      Panel using the mass spectrometry array Sequenom. This panel could identify 214 DNA mutations
      and/or frameshift insert/deletion among 26 oncogenes. Once included in the study, the
      adenocarcinomas are also included in a Tissue MicroArray (TMA) in order to perform
      immunohistochemical analysis. Immunohistochemical staining with innovative antibodies are
      correlated with clinical, histopathological and molecular data.

      Our hypothesis is that this TMA could constitute a good tool to screen interesting protein's
      expression.

    <description>Tumour samples are coming from routine histopathological procedure. They are used with consent of the patients. Genomic DNA extraction is performed from paraffin-embedded formalin-fixed (FFPE) tumour samples of lung adenocarcinoma. The genomic DNA mutations are identified by mass spectrometry array (Sequenom) using the LungCarta Panel. This panel could identify 214 mutations among 26 oncogenes.</description>
