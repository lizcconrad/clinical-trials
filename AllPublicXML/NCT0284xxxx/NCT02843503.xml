  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Primary objective is to assess the impact of different reference glucose measurement methods
      on the measured performance of a CGM system, aiming at further standardization for the
      assessment of CGM systems. Secondary objective is to describe the relationship between
      glucose concentration of venous, capillary and arterialized-venous measurement samples.

      Study design: Open-label trial. Study population: Nineteen patients with type 1 diabetes aged
      18 years and older will be included.

      Intervention: The study will use the Dexcom G5 Mobile CGM. The participant will visit the
      clinical research center (CRC) twice during a 6 day period. These visits will have a duration
      of 8 hours. Blood will be drawn for the determination of glucose concentrations using venous,
      arterialized-venous and capillary sampling techniques. The patient will receive his usual
      breakfast and an increased insulin bolus will be administered to correct the breakfast
      glucose excursion with the aim of inducing a period of minor hypoglycemia. Blood sampling
      will continue until the end of the admission. The sensor will be worn until the end of the
      second 8-hour CRC session, which will be planned on day 6 or earlier depending on patient
      preference. The sensor will be removed and their sensor and blood glucose meter data
      downloaded from the devices. In the case of sensor failure before the first CRC session,
      patients will be instructed to insert a new sensor per the manufacturer's instruction and to
      notify study staff of the event. In case of failure of the sensor after the first CRC session
      but before the second CRC session, patients will return to the CRC for sensor removal and for
      data download.
