      In a Phase-III Study Patients With Chemotherapy-induced Polyneuropathy (NCI CTC Grade 2/3)
      Are Randomized for an Integrated Program (IP) Including Massage, Mobilization in Posture and
      Transport Layers, Physical Exercises (Standard) or With Whole-body Vibration (WBV) Platform

      Subjects with a haematological malignancy or solid and a diagnosis of a chemotherapy-induced
      polyneuropathy. In a phase-III study patients with chemotherapy-induced polyneuropathy (NCI
      CTC grade 2/3) are randomized for an integrated program (IP) including massage, mobilization
      in posture and transport layers, physical exercises (standard) or with whole-body vibration
      (WBV) platform training (experimental). 15 training sessions in a time period of 12 to 15
      weeks were intended. Evaluation included locomotor and neurological tests and
      self-assessment-tools. The primary objective of the study was the physical fitness and
      coordination assessed by the chair-rising test (CRT).
