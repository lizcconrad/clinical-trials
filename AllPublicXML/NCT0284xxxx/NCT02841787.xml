  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this field trial is to tailor and test a web-based intervention in adults 65
      years of age or older. Two versions of the web-based intervention have been created and will
      be tested--one with an online social network and one without an online social network. The
      purpose of this study is to: pilot a novel intervention, examine methods to improve adherence
      to web-based interventions (e.g., peer network); collect data on feasibility, acceptability,
      and efficacy of an web-based intervention for late life depression; and ultimately, to
      overcome the numerous barriers to treating depression in later life.
