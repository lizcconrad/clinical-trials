  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Caudal block is often performed to relieve postoperative pain in pediatric urological
      surgery. Recently, pudendal block is also used in penile surgery and it has advantage because
      of less side effects such as transient weakness of low extremities, but limited to use in
      penile surgery. Local anesthesia is a single shot injection, so additional analgesic drugs is
      required when the effect of local anesthetics are disappeared. Dexmedetomidine, an alpha
      adrenergic agonist, is commonly used in pediatric sedation. It has analgesic effect and
      potentiates the effect of local anesthetics. There are many studies about the potentiation of
      the effect of local anesthetics when added to dexmedetomidine in adults, it has been limited
      in pediatrics. Recent study said that local anesthetics with dexmedetomidine had prolonged
      duration of analgesia in caudal block, also in ilioinguinal block. Thus it is expected to
      have a prolonged effect when investigators use dexmedetomidine in pediatrics as well as
      adults.

    <description>Patients are put in lithotomy position. Two separate injection points are marked at 3 and 9 o'clock, about 2 to 2.5 cm from the center of anus. After aseptic preparation, a nerve stimulator needle advanced 1.5 to 3.5 cm perpendicular to the skin, and stimulation current is 2.5 to 5 mA. The unilateral contraction of anal sphincter means the inferior anal nerve stimulation. After reducing the current to 0.5 mA, the needle is then moved deeper until an up-and-down penile movement is observed. This is stimulation of the perineal branch of the pudendal nerve. Prepared drug (0.25% ropivacaine and 0.3 mcg/kg dexmedetomidine in the experimental group, and equivalent doses of ropivacaine and normal saline in the control group) is injected in half and half bilaterally.</description>
