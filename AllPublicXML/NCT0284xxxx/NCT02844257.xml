  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) is a haematological malignant disease characterized by an
      uncontrolled proliferation of immature hematopoietic cells. Over the last two decades,
      clinical trials have demonstrated an improved response rate in younger adult AML. Aggressive
      induction plus more potent intensification programs with chemotherapy alone or chemotherapy
      plus stem cell transplantation (SCT) has improved treatment results. Advances in
      understanding disease biology, improvements in induction and consolidation program, and
      better supportive care have also all contributed. A number of clinical and laboratory
      characteristics influence the response to treatment and, thus, the survival of patients with
      AML. Among them, cytogenetic at diagnosis represents the most important prognostic variable.
      However, other factors may have a prognostic value and may influence patient's outcome.

      Anaemia and thrombocytopenia are cardinal manifestations of AML. Over the last decades, it
      has become apparent that the frequency of allogeneic blood transfusions can modify host
      immunity and clinical outcomes. Anaemia has long been recognized as an adverse prognostic
      factor in myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), which represents a pre-leukemic disease. Red blood
      cell (RBC) transfusion need was identified as a strong and independent risk factor for
      survival in MDS, for which the presence and severity of anaemia were attributed to a clonally
      advanced and biologically more aggressive disease.

      Based on these data, the investigators retrospectively assessed the prognostic value of RBC
      and platelet transfusions at the time of diagnosis and the frequency of transfusions during
      the first induction course of chemotherapy in a large unselected group of patients with
      previously untreated AML.

    <time_frame>Date of last contact if alive (up to 11 months)</time_frame>
    <description>Overall survival (OS) is defined as the time elapsed between induction chemotherapy regimen and death for any cause. Patients not known to have this event are censored on the date they were last examined</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Complete remission (CR) rate</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 11 months</time_frame>
    <description>Response to induction therapy was assessed after one or two courses of chemotherapy (Between day 28 and day 35 of each course of chemotherapy). CR was defined according to standard criteria as less than 5 % blasts in bone marrow aspirates with evidence of maturation of cell lines and restoration of peripheral blood counts.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of blood products for each type of administration</measure>
    <time_frame>Duration of study (11 months)</time_frame>
    <description>Transfusion of a single unit of packed red blood cell (PRBC) or one whole-blood-derived platelet concentrate (PC) or platelets collected by apheresis (PA).
Prophylactic transfusions were consistently given at morning platelet counts of &lt;20×109/l and haemoglobin level &lt;80 g/l. Patients requiring platelets were transfused with PC (PCs pooled from several units with 0.7 to 1×1011 platelets/10 kg of weight). Blood products were leukoreduced through discarding the buffy coat and administered through a standard blood filter but were not irradiated or routinely leukodepleted. Only patients planned to be allografted or autografted were transfused with irradiated transfusion products.</description>
