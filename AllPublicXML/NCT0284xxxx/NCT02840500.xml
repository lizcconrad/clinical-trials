  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients treated in Palliative Care Units are potentially fragile patients, especially in our
      case, which are cancer patients. The management of these patients is usually done from
      experience, because these patients rarely meet criteria for clinical trials, as their
      inclusion could affect results obtained in the trial.

      There is insufficient clinical information on the quality of life of cancer patients with
      breakthrough pain treated in palliative care units according to routine clinical practice.
      For this reason we consider it is appropriate to prospectively evaluate the quality of life
      of cancer patients with cancer breakthrough pain treated in palliative care units as well as
      the characteristics of these patients.

      This post-authorization observational study will assess the quality of life of patients with
      breakthrough cancer pain treated in Palliative Care Units in Spanish hospitals.
