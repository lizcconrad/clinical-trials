      The primary objective of this study is to collect data to confirm the performance and safety
      of the True™ Flow Valvuloplasty Perfusion Catheter during dilatation of the aortic valve in
      the preparation for Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation (TAVI).

      The BARD® True™ Flow Valvuloplasty Perfusion Catheter Study is a prospective, single-center,
      non-randomized, single-arm observational study intended to collect data to confirm the
      performance and safety of the BARD® True™ Flow Valvuloplasty Perfusion Catheter (True™ Flow
      catheter) when used for dilatation of the aortic valve in preparation for Transcatheter
      Aortic Valve Implantation (TAVI). This study will be conducted in conformance with the
      Declaration of Helsinki, applicable national privacy laws, and European, national regulations
      and International Organization for Standardization (ISO) requirements (ISO 14155:2011 (E)).

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  The subject voluntarily provides written informed consent prior to the collection of
             study-specific data or performance of study-specific procedures using an Informed
             Consent Form (ICF) that is reviewed and approved by the Ethics Committee (EC) for the
             site.

          -  The subject is a male or non-pregnant female ≥ 18 years old.

          -  The subject is undergoing TAVI for treatment of aortic stenosis.

          -  The subject has an annulus diameter that can be treated with the available size
             device, in accordance with the Instructions For Use (IFU).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  The patient is unable or unwilling to provide written informed consent.

          -  The patient has a known allergy or sensitivity to contrast media that cannot be
             adequately pre-medicated.

          -  The patient has had previous aortic valve replacement.

          -  The patient has a known congenital aortic valve abnormality (e.g., bicuspid aortic
             valve).

          -  The patient has echocardiographic evidence of intracardiac mass, or thrombus.

          -  The patient has vascular conditions that make insertion and endovascular access to the
             aortic valve impossible.

          -  The patient has another medical condition, which, in the opinion of the Investigator,
             may cause him/her to confound the data interpretation, or is associated with a life
             expectancy insufficient to allow for the completion of study procedures.

          -  The subject is currently participating in an investigational drug, biologic, or
             another device study that has not completed the study treatment or that clinically
             interferes with the objectives of the study.
