      Participants with AL Amyloidosis will receive the drug daratumumab by IV infusion once weekly
      for two months, then every 2 weeks for four months, then once each month. Study treatment may
      continue until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or decision to withdraw from the
      trial. Disease evaluations will be performed every three months until disease progression.

      This Phase I/II study is intended to evaluate the safety and tolerability of infusion of
      daratumumab in AL amyloidosis, specifically with respect to infusion reactions. In addition,
      the investigators would like to assess organ response with respect to cardiac biomarkers and
      proteinuria, as well as hematologic response and time to next treatment. Participants with AL
      Amyloidosis will receive the drug daratumumab by IV infusion once weekly for two months, then
      every 2 weeks for four months, then once each month. Study treatment may continue until
      disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or decision to withdraw from the trial. Disease
      evaluations will be performed every three months until disease progression.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Histological diagnosis of primary systemic (AL) amyloidosis:

               1. At least one tissue demonstrating positive Congo Red staining with characteristic
                  apple green birefringence AND

               2. Evidence of a clonal plasma cell dyscrasia:

             i. Monoclonal protein in the serum and/or urine by immunofixation electrophoresis
             AND/OR ii. Abnormal serum free light chain assay AND/OR iii. Clonal plasma cell
             population in the bone marrow demonstrated by immunohistochemistry, flow cytometry or
             in situ hybridization AND

             c. Evidence of organ involvement other than carpal tunnel syndrome. Confirmation of
             tissue diagnosis at all sites of organ dysfunction is encouraged, but not required.

          -  Must have relapsed after or been refractory to at least one prior treatment regimen of
             proven efficacy in the treatment of AL amyloidosis

          -  Must be &gt; 18 years of age.

          -  Must have a performance status of 0-2 by Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG)
             criteria

          -  Must have adequate hepatic function as evidenced by serum bilirubin values &lt; 2.0
             mg/dL; alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and/or aspartate aminotransferase (AST) &lt; 3x
             upper limit of normal (ULN).

          -  Must have an absolute neutrophil count ≥1000/mm3, hemoglobin ≥7.5 g/dL, and platelet
             count ≥50×109/L

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  • Renal Insufficiency (CrCL &lt;20mL/min), calculated by Cockcroft-Gault Equation
             Creatinine Clearance = Sex * ((140 - Age) / (SerumCreat)) * (Weight / 72) Equation
             parameters such as sex have two or more discrete values that may be used in the
             calculation. The numbers in the parentheses, e.g. (1), represent the values that will
             be used. The default unit of measure for weight is kilograms. Please verify that the
             correct unit of measure has been selected.

                  volume at one second (FEV1) &lt;50% of predicted normal. Note that forced expiratory
                  volume at one second FEV1 testing is required for patients suspected of having
                  COPD.

               -  Known moderate or severe persistent asthma within the past 2 years or currently
