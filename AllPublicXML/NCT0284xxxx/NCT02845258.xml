  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients may evolve pseudocysts of the pancreas secondary to a severe pancreatitis. In case
      of a symptomatic or infected pseudocyst, a therapeutic drainage of the cyst is indicated. In
      modern medicine the preferred way to perform such a drainage is by the means of endoscopic
      ultrasound (EUS). It is not precisely elucidated how this EUS-procedure should be performed
      in different scenarios. The cyst appearance and the drainage stents and/or technique may
      impact the clinical outcome.

      This study is a prospective, single-center observational study on the outcome after
      EUS-guided drainage of pancreatic pseudocysts.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patintes referred to Sahlgrenska University hospital for an EUS-guided drainage of a
      pseudocyst are eligible for inclusion. The drainage is performed at the discretion of an
      experienced endosonographer. Thus, the equipment and the technique used may vary among
      patients but no randomization is done before the procedure. Intraprocedural variables are
      registered as well as data and outcome parameters from the clinical follow up according to
      below.

    <description>Pancreatic pseudocyst drainage with a plastic or self-expandable metallic stent (SEMS):
This procedure is to be regarded as a clinical routine procedure since a couple of years back. The type of stent (material? length? thickness?), the cyst appearance (large? infected? cyst wall thickness?) and the type of access (transgastric? transduodenal?) may however vary from patient to patient.
In this study we perform EUS-drainage using different types of equipment on a wide range of pancreatic pseudocysts of different appearance and character. All procedures are performed as recommended. The very aim of the study is to investigate which technique and Equipment is to be preferred in different scenarios.</description>
