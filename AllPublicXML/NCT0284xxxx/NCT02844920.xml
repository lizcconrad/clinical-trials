  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to observe the presence or absence of intrauterine adhesions at 6
      weeks after treatment with the Sonata® System through hysteroscopic evaluation by third party
      readers.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients who agree to participate in this observational trial will have selected fibroid
      treatment with the Sonata System. Research participants will undergo hysteroscopy at 6 weeks
      following treatment to evaluate presence or absence of intrauterine adhesions.

      Research participants will be asked to complete a quality of life questionnaire prior to and
      6 weeks following treatment. Research participants will also complete a satisfaction survey
      and a diary that tracks their return to normal daily activities.
