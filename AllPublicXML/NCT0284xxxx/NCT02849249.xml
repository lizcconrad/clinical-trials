    <textblock>
      The study was designed according to the draft of allergenic product regulation published by
      Spanish Regulatory Agency. The aim of the study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of
      subcutaneous immunotherapy with polimerized (100/100) mixture of pollens: Olea europaea and
      Phleum pratense in patients with rhinoconjunctivitis with or without associated mild asthma.
      In addition, surrogate efficacy parameters will be evaluated: immunoglobulin level changes
      and skin reactivity.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients must sign the Informed Consent Form.

          2. Patients must be between 18 and 60 years of age.

          3. Patients with seasonal allergic rhinoconjunctivitis produced by Phleum pratense and
             Olea europaea during at least 2 years prior to participating in the study. Although
             the pathology being studied is allergic rhinoconjunctivitis, patients who have
             concomitant mild or moderate asthma may be included.

          4. Patients who have had a skin prick test result ≥ 3 mm in diameter against Phleum
             pratense and Olea europaea.

          5. Patients who have specific IgE ≥ class 2 (CAP/PHADIA) to Phleum pratense and Olea
             europaea.

          6. Patients will preferably be polysensitized to Phleum pratense. Polysensitized patients
             to otherallergenic sources may only be included in the study if their other
             sensitizations are produced by:

               1. Overlapping seasonal pollens which are cross-reactive with Phleum pratense and
                  Olea europaea.

               2. Pollens whose seasons do not overlap with Phleum pratense or Olea europaea and
                  which are not expected to produce symptoms during the study period.

               3. Other allergens which are not expected to produce symptoms during the study
                  period.

          7. Women of child-bearing potential must have a negative urine pregnancy test at the time
             they begin the study.

          8. Furthermore, women of child-bearing potential must agree to use adequate contraceptive
             methods during this study if they are sexually active.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients who received immunotherapy in the previous 5 years for Phleum pratense and
             Olea europaea or for any allergen with cross reactivity or patients that are currently
             receiving immunotherapy for any allergen.

          2. Patients with severe asthma or forzed expiratoy volumen in 1 second FEV1&lt; 70% even if
             the are pharmacologically controlled .

          3. Patients with: immunological, cardiac, renal or hepatic illnesses or any other medical
             condition that the investigator deems relevant so as to interfere with the study.

          4. Patients with a previous history of anaphylaxis

          5. Patients with chronic urticaria,

          6. Patients with moderate to severe atopic dermatitis

          7. Patients who have participated in another clinical trial within 3 month prior to
             enrolment.

          8. Patients under treatment with tricyclic antidepressives, phenothiazines , β- blockers,
             or Angiotensin Converting Enzyme Inhibitors (ACEI)

          9. Female patients who are pregnant or breast-feeding

         10. Patient who does not attend the visits
