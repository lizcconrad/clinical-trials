  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pulse oximetry is a vital tool in the rapid and non-invasive assessment of emergency
      patients, providing a continuous estimate of hemoglobin saturation in arterial blood.
      Unfortunately, the costs of these devices are prohibitive and reduce availability in smaller
      centres and poor countries, putting millions of patients in danger of easily treatable and
      preventable conditions. With current rapid prototyping technologies such as 3D printing, it
      is possible to create a very inexpensive pulse oximeter that meets or exceeds the gold
      standard. The goal of this study is to develop, validate and certify a pulse oximeter that
      measures hemoglobin, carboxyhemoglobin and methemoglobin. This pulse oximeter will be
      certified with Health Canada, and then released under the Open Hardware License (OHL), such
      that hospitals and ministries of health in rural and impoverished communities in Canada and
      internationally would have easy access to these devices.
