  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Meningococcus C vaccine was first used in France to prevent epidemics. It was a success in
      Puy-de-Dôme, Landes, Pyrénées Atlantiques and Hautes Pyrénées. Following many European
      countries, France introduced meningococcus C conjugate vaccine in 2009 but this
      recommendation was not suffiicently applied (6,6% of the 20-25 years-old were vaccinated in
      2015).

      The situation in France is very different from UK and there is no data on the subject. The
      vaccination campaign in 2002 in Puy-de-Dôme offers much more detachment, possible comparison
      between vaccinated and unvaccinated people, among which meningococcus circulation could
      maintain immunity. This is the reason why we have decided to assess in 2016 the vaccinal and
      natural immunity among Puy-de-Dôme population.

      People were recruited during hospitalisation or consultation of Pediatric, Occupational
      Medecine, Infectiology departments of Clermont Ferrand Hospital or Health Service of
      Auvergne's University, from March to September 2016.

      Doctors gave informations about the study and collected consents before blood tests were done
      (two tubes of 4,5mL each).

      Blood tests were daily collected and freezed. Then they were analysed at Meningococcus
      National Reference Center, in Paris.
