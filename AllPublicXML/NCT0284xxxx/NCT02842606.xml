  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cardio-metabolic diseases are a leading cause of mortality worldwide. Over the years,
      therefore, there have been considerable efforts to identify strategies for prevention and
      management of risk factors. The diet, with its pleiotropic effects, is one of the most
      effective approaches to reduce the cardio-metabolic risk. In this context, the dietary fibers
      have been extensively studied and the available evidence supports the beneficial effects of
      its consumption. However, worldwide the average fiber consumption is still less than the
      recommended daily dose. For this reason, the availability of functional foods, such as
      additional sources of fiber in the diet, may facilitate the attainment of fiber recommended.

    <description>The two test meals are designed to have the same energy and macronutrient composition. They differ only in the carbohydrate source: fiber-enriched pasta or control pasta. Blood samples are taken at fasting and every 30 minutes over 4 hours. Fasting and postprandial intestinal fermentation is evaluated by breath test.</description>
