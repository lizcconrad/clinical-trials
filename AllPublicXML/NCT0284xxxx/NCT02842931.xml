      Purpose: to evaluate an efficacy of chemotherapy regimens R-DA-EPOCH-21 and R-mNHL-BFM-90
      with and without autologous hematopoietic stem cells transplantation (auto-SCT) in newly
      diagnosed patients with DLBCL with intermediate and high risk.

      Patients initially are randomized into 4 arms:

        1. st arm R-DA-EPOCH-21

        2. nd arm R-mNHL-BFM-90

        3. rd arm R-DA-EPOCH-21 + auto-SCT

        4. th arm of R-mNHL-BFM-90 + auto-SCT

      Patients who achieved complete remission after 6 cycles of R-DA-EPOCH-21 or R-mNHL-BFM-90
      immunochemotherapy continue to be under observation (1st and 2nd arms) or continue treatment
      with Rituximab + BCNU+Etoposid+Ara-C+Melphalan (R-BEAM) followed by auto-SCT (3rd and 4th
      arms). Patients who achieved partial remission after 6 cycles of R-DA-EPOCH-21 or
      R-mNHL-BFM-90 immunochemotherapy continue treatment with 2 cycles of
      Rituximab+Dexamethasone+Ara-C+Cisplatin (R-DHAP), continue to be under observation (1st and
      2nd arms) or continue treatment with R-BEAM, followed by auto-SCT (3rd and 4th arms).
