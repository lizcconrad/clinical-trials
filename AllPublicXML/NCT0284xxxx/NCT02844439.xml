    <description>The single arm design assessing PFS-6 in the overall population with the ability to detect a rate of 25% is appropriate as a preliminary test of activity in patients with glioblastoma, based on PFS-6 rates seen in randomized studies with bevacizumab [Weathers 2015; Taal 2014; Galanis 2015]. The sample size of this study is also designed to permit the comparison of results with EGFR amplified and non-amplified tumors, as well as EGFRvIII mutated versus wild-type. The sample size is adequate to characterize the safety profile in patients with glioblastoma.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Willingness and ability to provide written informed consent and to comply with the
             study protocol as judged by the investigator

          2. Age ≥ 18 years old

          3. Kamofsky performance status ≥70%

          4. Stable or decreasing dose of corticosteroids within 5 days prior to study 5.
             enrollment.

          5. For women who are not postmenopausal (i.e., &lt; 12 months after last menstruation) or
             surgically sterile (absence of ovaries and/or uterus) and who are sexually active:
             agreement to use an adequate method of contraception (oral contraceptives,
             intrauterine contraceptive device, barrier method of contraception in conjunction with
             spermicidal jelly) during the treatment period and for at least 6 months after the
             last dose of study drug.

          6. For male patients who are sexually active and who are partners of premenopausal women:
             agreement to use a barrier method of contraception during the treatment period and for
             at least 6 months after the last dose of study drug.

          7. Histologically confirmed glioblastoma. A local pathology report constitutes adequate
             documentation of histology for study inclusion. Patients with an initial diagnosis of
             a lower-grade glioma are eligible if a subsequent biopsy was determined to be
             glioblastoma.

          8. First recurrence after concurrent or adjuvant chemoradiotherapy. Imaging confirmation
             of first tumor progression or regrowth as defined by the RANO criteria . A minimum of
             12 weeks must have elapsed from the completion of radiotherapy to study entry to
             minimize the potential for MRI changes related to radiation necrosis that might be
             misdiagnosed as progression of disease, unless there is a new lesion outside the
             radiation field or unequivocal evidence of viable tumor on histopathological sampling.

          9. Prior treatment with TMZ for low grade glioma or glioblastoma.

         10. No more than one prior line of systemic treatment for glioblastoma. Concurrent and
             adjuvant TMZ-based chemotherapy, including the combination of TMZ with an
             investigational agent, is considered one line of therapy.

         11. Prior therapy with gamma knife or other focal high-dose radiotherapy is allowed, but
             the patient must have subsequent histologic documentation of recurrence, unless the
             recurrence is a new lesion outside the irradiated field.

         12. Recovery from the toxic effects of prior therapy, with a minimum time of:

               1. ≥ 28 days elapsed from the administration of any prior cytotoxic agents, except ≥
                  14 days from vincristine, ≥ 21 days from procarbazine, and ≥ 42 days from
                  nitrosureas

               2. ≥ 28 days elapsed from the administration of any investigational agent

               3. ≥ 14 days elapsed from administration of any non-cytotoxic agent (e.g.,
                  interferon, tamoxifen, thalidomide, cis-retinoic acid)

         13. Patients who have undergone recent surgery for recurrent or progressive tumor are
             eligible provided that:

               1. Surgery must have confirmed the recurrence

               2. There must be residual disease

               3. A minimum of 28 days must have elapsed from the day of surgery to first dose of
                  the study drug. For core or needle biopsy, a minimum of 7 days must have elapsed
                  prior to study entry

         14. Availability of formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tumor tissue diagnostic of
             glioblastoma.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Concurrent therapeutic intervention (including radiation therapy and NovoTTF).

          2. Prior exposure to EGFR inhibitors.

          3. Prior exposure to bevacizumab or other VEGF- or VEGF-receptor-targeted agent within 8
             weeks of study start.

          4. Prior treatment with prolifeprospan 20 with carmustine wafer.

          5. Prior intracerebral agent.

          6. Evidence of recent hemorrhage on baseline MRI of the brain. However, patients with
             clinically asymptomatic presence of hemosiderin, resolving hemorrhagic changes related
             to surgery, or presence of punctuate hemorrhage in the tumor are eligible.

          7. Need for urgent palliative intervention for primary disease (e.g., rapidly increasing
             intracranial pressure, impending herniation, uncontrolled seizures).

          8. Hematology:

             ANC &lt; 1.5 x109/L; Plt &lt; 100 x109/L Hgb &lt; 9.0 g/dL within 7 days prior to enrollment.

          9. T.Bili. ≥ 1.5 x ULN (except in patients diagnosed with Gilbert's disease).

         10. AST(SGOT), ALT(SGPT), or alkaline phosphatase (ALP) ≥ 2.5 x ULN.

             body.

         15. Used any prescription medication during the prior 2 weeks that the investigator judges
             is likely to interfere with the study or to pose an additional risk to the patient in
             participating, specifically inhibitors or inducers of cytochrome P450 (CYP)3A4 (refer
             to Appendix 5). A stable regimen (≥ 4 weeks) of antidepressants of the selective
             serotonin re-uptake inhibitor (SSRI) class is allowed (common SSRIs include
             escitalopram oxalate, citalopram, fluvoxamine, paroxetine, sertraline, and
             fluoxetine).

             months) prior to study enrolment.

         22. History of stroke or transient ischemic attacks within 6 months prior to study
             enrolment.

         23. Significant vascular disease (e.g., aortic aneurysm requiring surgical repair or
             recent peripheral arterial thrombosis) within 6 months prior to study enrolment.
