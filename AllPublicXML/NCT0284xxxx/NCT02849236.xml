  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Breast augmentation surgery can cause important postoperative pain, especially when bilateral
      subpectoral implants are used. The investigators hypothesized that a technique of regional
      analgesia, the pectoral nerve block type I (or &quot;PECS I block&quot;) would reduce pain within the
      first twenty-four hours and, in turn, morphine consumption and associated side effects. This
      is a randomized, controlled, double-blind study which compares intra and postoperative
      analgesia with or without PECS I block in breast surgery.
