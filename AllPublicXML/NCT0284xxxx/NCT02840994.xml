    <textblock>
      The objective of the proposed clinical trial is to investigate the safety and tolerability of
      CV301 in combination with Anti-PD1-Therapy compared to Anti-PD1-Therapy alone in subjects
      with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).

      The clinical trial is designed to evaluate the possible enhanced antitumor activity of CV301
      with Anti-PD1-Therapy compared to Anti-PD1-Therapy alone. The rationale for combining CV301
      with Anti-PD1-Therapy is based on the hypothesis that CV301 can induce specific immune
      response in the tumor, and that in combination, Anti-PD1-Therapy may augment the T
      cell-mediated immune response generated by CV301 by blocking the inhibitory signal of the
      PD-1.

      The trial will include a Phase 1 portion, a Phase 1b portion with 2 cohorts and a Phase 2
      portion.

      The Phase 1 portion is a dose escalation part to assess the safety and tolerability of CV301
      alone, prior to moving into the combination with Anti-PD1-Therapy (the Phase 1b component).

      The following Phase 1b portion of the trial aims to test the safety and tolerability of the
      combination treatment using a two cohort approach with cohort 1 receiving CV301 plus
      Nivolumab and cohort 2 receiving CV301 plus Pembrolizumab, before expanding the number of
      patients to be treated in the randomized Phase 2 portion of the trial.

      The objective of the Phase 2 portion is to assess the safety and preliminary efficacy of
      CV301 in combination with Pembrolizumab compared to Pembrolizumab alone in subjects with
      NSCLC.

        Inclusion criteria for the Phase 1:

          1. Subjects must have a metastatic or unresectable locally advanced malignant solid
             tumor, histologically confirmed by the Laboratory of Pathology, NCI. Efforts will be
             made, as much as possible, to enroll subjects with tumor types with known increased
             expression of CEA or MUC-1 (such as lung, breast, ovarian, prostate, colorectal,
             pancreatic, bladder, gastric, cervix, etc.).

          2. Subjects may have measurable or nonmeasurable but evaluable disease. Subjects with
             surgically resected or ablated metastatic disease at high risk of relapse are also
             eligible.

             Prior therapy: Subjects must have completed or had disease progression on at least one
             prior line of disease-appropriate therapy for locally advanced or metastatic disease,
             or not be candidates for therapy of proven efficacy for their disease.

          3. Subjects with EGFR or ALK genomic tumor aberrations should have disease progression on
             FDA-approved therapy for these aberrations.

          4. There should be a minimum of 4 weeks from any prior chemotherapy, immunotherapy and/or
             radiation, with the exception of hormonal therapy for prostate and breast cancers,
             HER2-directed therapy for HER2+ breast cancer (3+ IHC or FISH+), maintenance therapy
             for colorectal or pancreatic cancer, and erlotinib in EGFR-mutated lung cancer under
             the condition that subjects are on these therapies for at least two months before
             start of trial treatment. There should be a minimum of 6 weeks from any prior antibody
             therapies (such as ipilimumab or anti-PD1/PDL1) due to prolonged half-life.

          5. Subjects must have recovered (Grade 1 or baseline) from any clinically significant
             toxicity associated with prior therapy. Typically, this is 3-4 weeks for subjects who
             most recently received cytotoxic therapy, except for the nitrosoureas and mitomycin C,
             for which 6 weeks is needed for recovery.

          6. Men or women, age ≥ 18 years.

          7. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status ≤ 1 or Karnofsky ≥ 70%.

             ≤ 3.0 x ULN d. Hematological eligibility parameters (within 16 days of starting
             therapy): i. Platelet count ≥ 100,000/µL ii. Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥ 1/ µL

          9. Subjects must have baseline pulse oximetry &gt; 90% on room air.

         10. The effects of CV301 on the developing human fetus are unknown. For this reason, women
             of child-bearing potential (WOCBP) and men must agree to use adequate contraception
             (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to trial entry and for
             the duration of trial participation and for a period of 4 months after the last
             vaccination therapy. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while
             she or her partner is participating in this trial, she should inform her treating
             physician immediately.

         11. Subjects with prostate cancer must continue to receive GnRH agonist therapy (unless
             orchiectomy has been done).

         12. Subjects must be able to understand and be willing to sign a written informed consent
             document.

             Pembrolizumab as first-line therapy for NSCLC as per FDA approved indications in first
             line for at least 11 weeks and assessed by RECIST to have CR, PR, or SD at week 12
             (+/- 1 week).

             As of June 2017, FDA-approved indications for front-line treatment include 2
             indications for Pembrolizumab:

               -  As a single agent for the first-line treatment of patients with metastatic NSCLC
                  whose tumors have high PD-L1 expression (Tumor Proportion Score (TPS) ≥50%) as
                  determined by an FDA-approved test, with no EGFR or ALK genomic tumor
                  aberrations.

               -  In combination with pemetrexed and carboplatin, as first-line treatment of
                  patients with metastatic nonsquamous NSCLC. This indication is approved under
                  accelerated approval based on tumor response rate and progression-free survival.
                  Continued approval for this indication may be contingent upon verification and
                  description of clinical benefit in the confirmatory trials.

             Pemetrexed single agent maintenance after the initial 4 cycles of pemetrexed in
             combination with carboplatinum and Pembrolizumab is allowed and optional as per
             investigator or institutional standard practice.

          3. In case of metastatic recurrence of a previous early stage NSCLC, any chemotherapy or
             radiation therapy must have finalized more than 12 months before the start of the
             first-line treatment, either Pembrolizumab alone or in combination with pemetrexed and
             carboplatinum.

          4. ECOG performance status 0 and 1.

                  i. Female CrCl = [(140 - age in years) x weight in kg x 0.85] / [72 x serum
                  creatinine in mg/dL] ii. Male CrCl = [(140 - age in years) x weight in kg x 1.00]

         12. Men who are sexually active with WOCBP must use any contraceptive method with a
             failure rate of less than 1% per year. Men receiving Nivolumab and who are sexually
             active with WOCBP will be instructed to adhere to contraception for a period of 31
             weeks after the last dose of investigational product. Women who are not of
             childbearing potential (ie, who are postmenopausal or surgically sterile) as well as
             azoospermic men, do not require contraception.

             combination with Pembrolizumab as first-line chemotherapy for candidates to
             Pembrolizumab maintenance of first line (Phase 1b and Phase 2).

          5. Concurrent chemotherapy or radiotherapy or other immunotherapy not explicitly allowed
             by inclusion criteria for that phase of study.

             subject to carry out the treatment program.

         18. Any other condition, which would, in the opinion of the Principal Investigator or
             Medical Monitor, indicate the subject is a poor candidate for treatment with CV301 or
