  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Type 2 cardio renal syndrome is defined by the occurrence or the exacerbation of a kidney
      failure induced by a chronic heart failure. Sodium overload is one of the main causes leading
      to the occurrence or the exacerbation of this syndrome. Some patients have a massive sodium
      retention on which medications are not effective enough. These patients have no further
      therapeutic options because of the refractory congestion and a 3-months mortality rate around
      15%, frequent rehospitalization (3-months rehospitalization rate at 71%) and an excessively
      impaired quality of life.

      For those refractory heart failure with cardio renal syndrome, nephrology departments resort
      to non-medication sodium extraction (hemodialysis, peritoneal dialysis, isolated
      ultrafiltration). Between 2002 and 2008, 927 French patients would have start dialysis in
      this situation. In 2013, 174 patients start dialysis in 97 dialysis centers. French National
      Authority of Health recently published new Good Practice Guidance thereupon, strengthened by
      the increasing number of publications and the widespread use of this technique. There is
      therefore a consensus among professionals about the benefits of such a technique in those
      indications. However, bibliographical data are not strong enough to support a strong level of
      evidence. None of foresight strategies have been compared to others in a proper randomized
      controlled trial, and there is no clue about any suspected superiority from one strategy to
      another.

      So far, the investigators propound invasive, expensive and not validated techniques to
      patients with functional and vital prognosis altered. The investigators think it's essential
      to prove the efficacy of such an approach. They wish to quantify those techniques impact on
      rehospitalization, with a consideration for the potential survival impact.

      It seems unethical to evaluate separated techniques, taking in account that patients with
      severe heart failure will switch from one technique to another among their care. It is
      therefore crucial to validate benefits from an invasive procedure (hemodialysis, peritoneal
      dialysis, isolated ultrafiltration) compared to a medication-restricted care.

    <description>Peritoneal dialysis: at least one daily contact, 5 days a week minimum, with a hypertonic solution. Le number of contact et the stasis duration will be decided by the practitioner.
Hemodialysis: at least one hemodialysis per week, one hemofiltration and/or hemodiafiltration per week, and at least 2 liter of ultrafiltrate extraction per week. In case of serious interdialytic weight gain, and/or hemodynamic unsteadiness, sessions can be up to 6 per weeks. Sessions duration will be adjusted to the needful ultrafiltrate and hemodynamic tolerance.
Isolated ultrafiltration: at least once a week, and includes an extraction of minimum 2 liter ultrafiltrate in less than 4 hours. It could be done, according to routines and department capacity, on a hemodialysis generator, plasmatic exchange generator, or mobile ultrafiltration device.</description>
