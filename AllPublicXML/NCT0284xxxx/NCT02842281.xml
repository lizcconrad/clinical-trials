  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study evaluates whether the gut microbiome is involved in determining whether children
      with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) develop worsening GI symptoms (e.g. pain) when given
      fructans (a sugar often found in wheat). Participants will both receive a diet with fructans
      and a diet without fructans.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Fructans (fructo-oligosaccharides) are a type of carbohydrate which can not be hydrolyzed by
      humans. It is commonly found in wheat in the American diet. After ingestion they arrive
      essentially intact into the colon where they are metabolized by the colonic microbiome.
      Fructan avoidance has been found to help decrease gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g. pain) in
      those with IBS.

      However not all individuals with IBS have worsening symptoms when eating fructans in their
      diet. This study seeks to evaluate whether the microbiome is involved in determining whether
      an individual with IBS has worsening symptoms with fructan ingestion.

      Following a one week baseline period, participants will be randomized in a double-blind
      cross-over fashion to either a 72 hour meal period with fructans or a 72 hour meal period
      with maltodextrin (placebo). A washout period of at least 10 days will occur in between.
      Symptoms will be captured using a stool and pain diary. Stool specimens and urine specimens
      will be obtained at baseline and during the dietary interventions. Breath hydrogen testing
      will be obtained during the dietary interventions.
