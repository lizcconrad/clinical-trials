      The objective of the study is for clinical staff to gain experience using the proposed
      artificial pancreas system named inControl and the inControl Cloud and assess 24/7 in-home
      usability prior to initiating a large randomized controlled trial.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Participation in this study will require 5 study visits over 2-4 weeks.

        -  Visit 1: screening/enrollment visit to assess study eligibility.

        -  Visit 2: continuous glucose monitor (CGM) training and initiation session based upon
           current or prior use of a CGM; if subject doesn't currently use a CGM, subject will be
           trained and may be asked to wear the CGM at home for 1 week.

        -  Visit 3: subjects will be taught how to use the study insulin pump.

        -  Visit 4: subjects will be trained on the use of inControl and wear it at home for 14
           days.

        -  Visit 5: subjects will return study equipment and to complete questionnaire.

             one year and using insulin for at least 1 year

          2. Use of an insulin pump for at least 6 months with established parameters for basal
             rate(s), carbohydrate ratio(s) and insulin sensitivity factor(s) for at least 3
             months.

          3. Age 14.0 to &lt;75.0 years

             women who are not surgically sterile. Subjects who become pregnant will be
             discontinued from the study. Also, subjects who during the study develop and express

             at all times of the participants location, and being present and available to provide
             assistance when the system is being used at night

          7. Willingness, if using the closed-loop system, to stop closed-loop when taking
             acetaminophen and avoid closed-loop for at least 4 hours afterward

          8. Willingness to suspend use of any personal CGM for the duration of the clinical trial
             once the study CGM is in use
