  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Narcotrend index is a widely used quantitative parameter for evaluating anesthesia and
      sedation levels.Dexmedetomidine is a novel sedative,providing sedation while patients remain
      cooperative and can be easily aroused. This study was designed to explore the correlation of
      Narcotrend index and OAA/S scale in monitoring sedation level with different single- doses of
      dexmedetomidine intravenously.

      60 patients,aged 20～60,American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) physical status ⅠorⅡ,
      scheduled for electively lower limb surgery undergoing combined spinal epidural anesthesia
      were randomly divided three group. In each group,a bolus of dexmedetomidine was administered
      intravenously 15 min after spinal anesthesia. The initial dose in group 1, group 2 and group
      3 was started from 0.9 µg/kg,1.0 µg/kg and 1.1 µg/kg, respectively. HR、MAP、SpO2、the
      Observer's Assessment of Alertness/Sedation（OAA/S）scale and the corresponding Narcotrend
      index were recorded at 5-minute intervals until 30 minutes after administration. The
      relationship between OAA/S scale and Narcotrend index was analyzed by a Spearman analysis.
      The cutoff values of Narcotrend index for OAA/S≤2 were obtained by analysis of receiver
      operating characteristic curves(ROC).
