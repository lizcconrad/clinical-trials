  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The management of cancers and their therapeutic guidance was until shortly mostly based on
      histopathological considerations of the tumor. the development of targeted therapies is a
      turning point and keeps increase. These molecules target a specific molecular defect in the
      tumor making it more effective and more specific treatment. But these treatments are only
      effective if the tumor has a specific molecular abnormality that is characterized and known.

      These therapeutic progresses have been made possible through the decoding of the human genome
      and the molecular defects occurring during the carcinogenesis process. Now, dozens of
      therapies targeting a specific molecular abnormality are available in the therapeutic arsenal
      and dozens more are under development in clinical trials Phase 1 to 3.

      In recent years, the democratization of next generation sequencing has opened a new era in
      cancer research but also for molecular diagnostics. Indeed, the enormous sequencing
      capabilities offered by high-throughput sequencing technologies allow analysis in a limited
      time the entire coding sequence of the genome (exome), or even the entire genome of a tumor
      (whole genome sequencing). Thus, the evolution and the development of broadband and
      associated bioinformatics tools for genomics techniques now make it possible to establish the
      genetic profile of a tumor. Targeted diagnosis of molecular abnormalities and allows to
      propose and specifically targeted direct therapeutic identified genetic alterations and
      supposedly responsible for tumor development. An analysis of tumor exome by next-generation
      sequencing (NGS) and provides information on genetic modifications of these tumors.

      This study did not aim to evaluate a therapeutic strategy or treatment. The objective of this
      study is to evaluate the clinical benefit of an analysis of exome performed in current
      practice at the Centre Georges-François Leclerc from Dijon. The analysis will be performed by
      quantifying the number of patients undergoing therapeutic proposal based on the results of
      the analysis of the profile of the tumor.

    <description>In the treatment or assessment of metastatic solid tumor malignancies not curable it can be offered to patients to establish the profile of their tumor by next generation sequencing (NGS). This technique permits the sequencing of millions of fragments in parallel in a short time and allows to identify rapidly somatic or constitutional mutations known or yet unknown. The establishment of the genetic profile of the tumor coupled to the available clinical data can help clinicians to predict patient outcome in terms of survival or progression to disease, but may also provide key clues to adapt the management and patient treatment.</description>
