  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:

      The human body uses antibodies as one way to help fight infection. VRC01LS is an antibody
      directed against the HIV virus. Researchers want to see if it is safe and well tolerated.
      They will study the amount of VRC01LS in the body and how it changes over time. They will
      check to see if people who get VRC01LS develop an immune response to it.

      Objective:

      To see if VRC01LS is safe and well tolerated.

      Eligibility:

      Adults ages 18 70 who are HIV infected but otherwise healthy. Females who are able to get
      pregnant must be willing to use birth control during the study.

      Design:

      Participants will be screened in another protocol.

      Participants will get the study drug one time, by IV infusion. A needle will guide a thin
      tube into a vein. The study drug mixed with salt water will be dripped into the vein over
      about 30 minutes.

      Participants will be monitored for 30 minutes after the infusion.

      Blood samples will be taken at the following times:

      Once before the infusion

      5 times in the 4 hours after the infusion

      1 time 24 hours after infusion. Some participants may have 3 optional blood draws in the time
      period between 4 and 24 hours.

      For 3 days after the infusion, participants will write their temperature and symptoms in a
      diary.

      There will be a total of 23 study visits over 48 weeks. Ten visits will be in the first 4
      weeks. At all visits, participants will answer health questions and give blood samples.

      VRC 607: A Phase 1, Single Dose Study of the Safety and Virologic Effect of a Human
      Monoclonal Antibody, VRC-HIVMAB080-00-AB (VRC01LS), with Broad HIV-1 Neutralizing Activity,
      Administered Intravenously to HIV-Infected Adults.

      Study Design:

      This is the first study of the VRC-HIVMAB080-00-AB (VRC01LS) monoclonal antibody (MAb) in
      HIV-infected viremic adults. It is a study to examine safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics
      (PK) and virologic impact of VRC01LS. The primary hypothesis is that VRC01LS is safe for
      intravenous administration to HIV-1-infected adults and will not elicit hypersensitivity
      reactions. The secondary hypothesis is that VRC01LS will be detectable in human sera with a
      definable half-life.

      Product Description:

      VRC-HIVMAB080-00-AB (VRC01LS) is a human MAb targeted to the CD4 binding site of HIV-1.
      VRC01LS is a modification of the VRC01 MAb (which has been shown to be safe and to have
      antiviral activity in human studies) with the addition of the LS , a 2-amino acid mutation
      designed to improve the half-life of the antibody. There are no changes to the Fab binding
      sites. It was developed and manufactured by VRC/NIAID/NIH under cGMP at the VRC Vaccine Pilot
      Plant operated under contract by the Vaccine Clinical Materials Program (VCMP), Leidos
      Biomedical Research, Inc., Frederick, MD. Vials are provided at 100 mg/mL.

      Subjects:

      HIV-1-infected viremic adults; 18-70 years of age.

      Study Plan:

      This is an open-label, single dose study to assess VRC01LS administered at 40 mg/kg IV in
      HIVinfected viremic subjects. Safety lab samples, HIV viral load, CD4 count, PK samples and
      blood samples for human anti-VRC01LS antibody detection will be drawn at baseline and
      intervals throughout the study. Subjects will keep a daily diary of reactogenicity symptoms
      for the 3 days after

      study product administration and will be queried at each study visit for adverse events.

      VRC 607 Study Schema:

      Subjects-10 (*The expected enrollment is 10 subjects. Up to 20 subjects may be enrolled in

      the event that there are subjects who do not complete the sampling schedule, if additional PK
      evaluations are needed, or if additional subjects are needed for safety evaluations)

      Administration Schedule-Day 0; 40 mg/kg IV

      Study Duration: Subjects will be followed for 48 weeks after the study product
      administration.
