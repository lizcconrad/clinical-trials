  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To investigate whether the interactive family based lifestyle programme leads to behaviour
      change at 6 months with the primary outcome being increased levels of moderate to vigorous
      physical activity (MVPA).
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      To investigate whether the lifestyle programme results in changes to the following outcomes 3
      and 6 months after baseline assessment (Child)

        -  An increase in objectively measured total amount of physical activity

        -  An increase in the proportion meeting MVPA guidelines (measured objectively)

        -  Reduction in time spent sedentary (measured objectively and self-reported)

        -  Change in self-reported physical activity

        -  Reduction in measures of adiposity (body mass index percentile, per cent body fat)

        -  Improvement in psychological factors that may mediate physical activity participation
           (self-efficacy, motivation, attitudes, social support and enjoyment of physical
           activity; and physical self-perceptions)

        -  Change in healthy food provision and parenting practices for healthy food

        -  Improvement in diet composition.

        -  Improvement in knowledge of physical activity and nutrition.

        -  Improvement in cardio-metabolic variables (blood pressure, glucose, HbA1c, cholesterol)

      The Investigators will also include qualitative data collected from:

        -  Evaluation forms following each intervention workshop session which will be completed by
           the Parent/guardian, child and facilitator

        -  Feedback from focus groups to be held following completion of the total intervention
           i.e. 8 sessions

      To investigate whether the lifestyle programme results in changes to the following outcomes 3
      and 6 months after baseline assessment (Parent(s)/guardian(s))

        -  An increase in objectively measured total volume of physical activity

        -  An increase in the proportion meeting MVPA guidelines (measured objectively)

        -  Reduction in time spent sedentary (measured objectively and self-reported)

        -  Change in self-reported physical activity

        -  Reduction in measures of adiposity (body mass index percentile, per cent body fat)

        -  Change in healthy food provision and parenting practices for healthy food

        -  Improvement in diet composition.

        -  Improvement in knowledge of physical activity and nutrition.

    <measure>Improvement in diet composition</measure>
    <time_frame>3 and 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Investigators will query the nutrition habits of participants to investigate any changes in the behaviours targeted in the workshops. A food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) taken from the ISCOLE study that was adapted from the HBSC Study will be used to query the consumption of 23 food categories in a &quot;usual&quot; week. The Investigators will also query breakfast consumption for weekdays and weekends. The Investigators have also created ad hoc questions on other intervention targets of snacking behaviours, fruit and vegetable intake and fizzy drink consumption. This ad hoc method has been used in other international multi-site studies.</description>

    <measure>Improvement in knowledge of physical activity and nutrition</measure>
    <time_frame>3 and 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The physical activity questionnaire for adolescents (PAQ-A) [62] will be used to assess the Types and context of physical activity in order to investigate changes in the Types of sports/exercise/activities the participating child may participate in (information which is not available from the accelerometer or the majority of other validated self-report questionnaires). This questionnaire requests responses for the last 7 days by asking participants to check a list of activities for frequency of participation. This questionnaire has received support from an expert panel and has also high validity against objective measures and moderate reliability.</description>
