  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Stroke is a major cause of morbidity and mortality, especially in low and middle income
      countries including Iran. Patients with recent stroke or TIA are at high risk for new
      vascular events. Several evidence based strategies in secondary prevention of stroke are
      available but frequently underused. The study is aimed to evaluate an intervention to improve
      patients with Stroke.
