  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The reduction of functional limits and disablilities induced by knee osteoarthritis as well
      as improvement of patients quality of life is a public health need registered amongst the
      priorities established by the French law of August 9th 2004 relative to Public Health policy.
      However, the response to this need is not limited to treatment with health products.

      This clinical trial in real life on ARTHRUM H 2% device aims to analyse patients quality of
      life treated by intraarticular injections, eventually for several years, by difference of
      usual clinical trials.

      This open, prospective, multicentric study aims to analyse, in patient care, the impact of
      three intraarticular injections of ARTHRUM H 2% on quality of life over a period of 6 months
      (D180) in the symptomatic treatment of knee osteoarthritis.
