  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Loss of mobility is predictive of a loss of autonomy and is often the first sign of
      functional decline. Loss of mobility is also associated with poor perceived quality of life,
      depressive symptoms, high risk of adverse events such as falls and fractures, to an increased
      risk to input in institution and mortality's increase.

      Consequences and frequency of loss of mobility make essential its identification, evaluation
      and the practice of preventive measures in primary care.

      The implementation of effective interventions in primary care to prevent or delay the loss of
      mobility is a public health priority.

      PRISME-3P program aims to develop and evaluate a dedicated care pathway, in primary care,
      based on a personalized multimodal intervention: screening, support combining physician,
      teaching exercises by a specialized Monitor in Adapted Physical Activities (MAPA) and
      nutritional counseling.

    <measure>Change in Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB) score</measure>

    <description>Consists in estimating three components: 1. walking, 2. muscular strength and endurance, and 3. balance through short physical exercises (walk on a defined distance, get up from a chair, keep a position up). A score from 1 to 3 for each of the components marks a very low feature of lower limbs. This feature is considered low of 4 in 6, moderated by 7 in 9 and high of 10 in 12.</description>

    <description>Functional disability refers to limitations in performing in dependent living tasks, which are often further divided into activities of daily living (ADLs), which include basic activities of hygiene and personal care, and instrumental activities of daily living (IADLs), which include basic activities necessary to reside in the community, such as shopping, managing finances, housekeeping, and meal preparation</description>

    <description>The multimodal intervention on mobility will consist of the implementation of a care pathway dedicated in primary care. It will include awareness and training of general practitioners for easy identification, a care associating a dedicated geriatric consultation to rule out underlying pathology, teaching exercises by MAPA (+/- taken care in the presence of MAPA) and nutritional counseling by a dietician. Close collaboration between general practitioners, geriatrician, MAPA and dietician will be established.</description>

Consultation with the geriatrician to rule a condition associated with loss of mobility and not known until now.
Perform a nutritional assessment by a dietician followed by appropriate care management.
Educational activity based on exercises and physical activity and balance: MAPA teaches exercises to develop strength and balance; gives tips to increase time spent on non-sedentary activities and enhance endurance followed by a monthly phone coaching.
At 3 months, in case of no improvement of the SPPB score of 1 point, a training of 10 weeks with two sessions per week will be perform by the MAPA individually or in small patients groups;
Implementation of a information exchange processing (mail, phone and book binding) between the various stakeholders.</description>
