             trial

             • Females who are capable of childbearing must have a negative pregnancy test at the
             time of the screening visit and the pregnancy test must be repeated at enrollment if
             it was done &gt; 14 days prior

          3. Presence of any condition that in the opinion of the investigator impairs the
             participant's ability to use the system (e.g.,visual impairment that interferes with
             ability to read the display)

          4. Unable or unwilling to use study devices and follow study procedures including the
             meal and exercise/ activity challenges in the CRC.
