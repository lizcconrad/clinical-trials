  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The project is designed to document in college undergraduates the relationships among
      sleep/wake timing and duration, use of mobile phones and other electronic devices, food
      timing and content, self-reported mood and physiological measures.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      College undergraduates are studied in cohorts of ~ 50 in fall or spring semesters. They
      complete diaries once in the morning and once in the evening about sleep/wake timing, timing
      of social and school activities, and mood. They wear physiological sensors. They install (1)
      an application on their mobile phone that tracks timing, duration and de-identified
      sender/recipient of phone calls and text messages, use of internet or apps (but not the
      content or names of those internet sites and apps) and (2) meal content and timing. They also
      spend at least one overnight session providing saliva samples for later assay for hormones.
