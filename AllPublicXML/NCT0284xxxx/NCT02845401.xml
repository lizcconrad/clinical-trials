  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators' research is aimed at developing more effective, finite approaches for
      managing individual patients with chronic hepatitis B (CHB). This prospective clinical and
      basic scientific study exclusively focuses on patients with the early antigen negative form
      of disease, which in developed countries is treated indefinitely with antiviral drugs. The
      investigators' study &quot;BeNEG-DO,&quot; directly offers patients who are already taking standard
      oral Hepatitis B Virus (HBV) antiviral therapy for at least 192 weeks the option to stop or
      continue treatment. Drawing on data from pilot studies, including the investigators' own
      University of California, San Francisco and Sutter Institutional Review Board-approved study,
      the investigators will examine a finite HBV treatment strategy on clinical outcome and
      safety. In conjunction, the investigators will study immunologic mechanisms and gene
      expression profiles that correlate with and predict the post-treatment clinical course. The
      BeNEG-DO study could seriously question, and potentially change, the current treatment
      paradigm for millions of patients with CHB and also lead to new disease-terminating antiviral
      therapeutics.

      A prospective case-control study of safety and clinical outcomes, and of innate and adaptive
      immune responses and their genetic predictors, in adult human subjects with HBeAg-CHB who
      either continue or stop nucleoside or nucleotide analog (NA) antiviral therapy. Immune
      responses will be studied using liver tissue and serial peripheral blood samples. The
      immunological factors selected have been chosen based on preliminary and inferential
      evidence. Immunologic findings will be correlated with different serologic, virologic and
      biochemical outcomes. Genetic predictors of the type of response and respective clinical
      outcomes will also be sought.
