  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this prospective, comparative non-randomized multiple teaching hospitals study, the
      investigators try to determine the relationship of total hysterectomy and Taiwanese female
      pelvic floor and sexual function from the view of epidemiology and clinical survey. This is
      an important issue that related to female autonomy, health care resources and even national
      health policy. The study results will help to understand whether there is unnecessary part in
      the current hysterectomy procedures and its potential health hazard.

      Women with benign gynecology disease and indicated for laparoscopic hysterectomy
      (laparoscopic subtotal hysterectomy: LSH, laparoscopic cervical ligament sparing
      hysterectomy: CLSH, laparoscopic assisted vaginal hysterectomy: LAVH) are invited and
      explained the details of the protocol by the surgeon. The types of hysterectomy are
      determined by the patient and the surgeon together after discussion. All participant have to
      sign the informed consent. The participant will be followed up for two years after surgery.
      Preoperative evaluation on uterine condition, pelvic floor, questionaires were recorded. The
      perioperative parameters including surgical time, blood loss, and postoperative parameters
      such as pain score, hospitalization etc were recorded. The postoperative evaluation on pelvic
      floor condition, questionaires etc were also recorded at different time points.
