      This is a prospective, multicenter, randomized controlled trial. The trial will include
      approximately 66 subjects in up to 10 experienced clinical centers in the United States. The
      estimated enrollment period is 18 weeks (this includes the 2-week run-in period). After
      completing a 2-week screening period, the subjects will be followed for at least 16 weeks
      post-randomization.
