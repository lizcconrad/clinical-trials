  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study was to compare the efficacy and safety of POF, FOLFOX, and FOLFOX plus
      paclitaxel(ip) as first-line treatment in AGC a phase II clinical trial.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The biweekly 5-fluorouracil and leucovorin (LV5FU2) regimen associated with oxaliplatin
      (FOLFOX) is active in patients with AGC. Meanwhile, Paclitaxel monotherapy is also active in
      patients with AGC. In previous studies, we found that POF(A combination of oxaliplatin,
      fluorouracil and Paclitaxel) regimen appears to be of good efficacy and is well tolerated in
      patients with advanced gastric cancer. This study is being done to find out if three drugs
      combination maintain manageable side effects but have better benefit than two drugs
      combination. Intraperitoneal paclitaxel showed high local concentration in abdominal cavity
      and low systemic toxicity. This study is being done to find out if the combination with
      Intraperitoneal paclitaxel and FOLFOX have higher local control rate and lower systemic
      toxicity.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  18-75 years old;

          -  Patients must have histologically or cytologically confirmed metastatic or
             unresectable gastric or gastroesophageal junction (GEJ) adenocarcinoma. GEJ
             adenocarcinoma may be classified according to Siewert's classification type I, II, or
             III

          -  Histological documentation of local recurrence or metastasis is strongly encouraged,
             unless the risk of such a procedure outweighs the potential benefit of confirming the
             metastatic disease.

          -  If no histologic confirmation, then the metastases or recurrence will require
             documentation by a 2nd radiographic procedure (eg. PET/CT scan or MRI in addition to
             the CT scan). If the imaging procedure does not confirm recurrent or metastatic
             disease, biopsy confirmation will be required.

          -  Patients must have disease that can be evaluated radiographically. This may be
             measurable disease or non-measurable disease. Measurable disease is defined as that
             which can be measured in at least one dimension as &gt; 20 mm with conventional
             techniques, or &gt;10 mm by high resolution imaging. Disease that is identified on
             radiology studies, but does not meet the criteria for measurable disease, is
             considered non-measurable.

          -  Patients may have received no prior chemotherapy for metastatic or unresectable
             disease. Patients may have received prior adjuvant therapy (chemotherapy and/or
             chemoradiation) if more than 6 months have elapsed between the end of adjuvant therapy
             and registration.

          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Performance Status (ECOG PS) of 0-1;

          -  An expected survival of ≥ 3 months;

          -  Major organ function has to meet the following criteria; (1) For results of blood
             routine test:

          -  Hemoglobin (HB) ≥ 80g / L,

          -  ANC(absolute neutrophil count) ≥ 1.5 × 109 / L,

          -  PLT(blood platelet) ≥ 75 × 109 / L, (2) For results of biochemical tests:

          -  BLT（total bilirubin） ≤ 1.25 times the upper limit of normal (ULN),

          -  ALT(Alanine aminotransferase) and AST(aspartate aminotransferase ) ≤ 2.5 × ·ULN, liver
             metastases, if any, the ALT and AST≤ 5 × ULN,

          -  Serum Cr（creatinine）≤1ULN, Endogenous creatinine clearance rate ＞50ml/min;

          -  The patient has a PT（prothrombintime） (INR international normalized ratio) &lt; or = to
             1.5 and an PTT（Partial Thromboplastin Time）&lt; than or = to 3 seconds above the upper
             limits of normal if the patientia t is not on anticoagulation. ·If a patient is on
             full-dose anticoagulants, the following criteria should be met for enrollment:

          -  The patient must have an in-range INR (usually between 2 and 3) on a stable dose of
             warfarin or on stable dose of LMW(Low molecular weight) heparin

          -  The patient must not have active bleeding or pathological conditions that carry high
             risk of bleeding (e.g. tumor involving major vessels, known varices)

          -  Pregnancy test (serum or urine) has to be performed for woman of childbearing age
             within 7 days before enrolment and the test result must be negative.

          -  Men and women of childbearing potential must be willing to consent to using effective
             contraception while on treatment and for at least 3 months thereafter.

          -  Ability to understand informed consent and signing of written informed consent
             document prior to initiation of protocol therapy.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients who have received previous chemotherapy for the treatment of metastatic or
             unresectable gastric or GEJ adenocarcinoma are ineligible.

          -  Patients who have received previous pre- or post-operative chemotherapy or
             chemoradiation are ineligible if therapy was completed less than 6 months prior to
             study registration. Patients must have recovered from adverse events from any previous
             therapy.

          -  Patients with a history of another neoplastic disease within the past three years,
             excluding basal cell carcinoma of the skin, cervical carcinoma in situ, or
             nonmetastatic prostate cancer.

          -  Patients with brain or central nervous system metastases, including leptomeningeal
             disease.

          -  Pregnant (positive pregnancy test) or breast feeding.

          -  Serious, non-healing wound, ulcer, or bone fracture.

          -  Significant cardiac disease as defined as:

        unstable angina, New York Heart Association (NYHA) grade II or greater, congestive heart
        failure, history of myocardial infarction within 6 months Evidence of bleeding diathesis or
        coagulopathy.

          -  History of a stroke or CVA within 6 months

          -  Clinically significant peripheral vascular disease.

          -  Inability to comply with study and/or follow-up procedures.

          -  Patients with any other medical condition or reason, in that investigator's opinion,
             makes the patient unstable to participate in a clinical trial.
