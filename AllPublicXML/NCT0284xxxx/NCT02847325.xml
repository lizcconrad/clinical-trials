  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      AC0058TA is a small molecule compound that potently, selectively and irreversibly inhibits
      Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK) phosphorylation and downstream signals, resulting in
      inhibition of inflammatory cytokine production in monocytes and inhibition of lymphocyte
      activation (predominantly B-cell activation) in the preclinical studies. The nonclinical
      program has demonstrated that AC0058TA has the potential to interfere with signaling
      functions mediated by tyrosine kinases and may be useful for controlling excessive or
      aberrant T- and B-cell activation in autoimmune diseases.

      As an investigational targeted therapy for RA and SLE, AC0058TA is expected to address the
      unmet need of this patient population, for whom there are currently no effected therapies and
      there is a great unmet medical need, AC0058TA may inhibit the key pathway which involves the
      disease process.

      This is a 2-part, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, single-dose-escalation (Part
      1) and multiple-dose-escalation (Part 2) study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, PK, and
      PD of AC0058TA administered orally to healthy subjects. Part 1 of the study will also to
      evaluate the effect of food on the pharmacokinetics of a single oral dose of AC0058TA.
