  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Prone positioning has been shown to improve survival in patients with acute respiratory
      distress syndrome (ARDS). However, a recent large observational study found that prone
      positioning was used in only 7% of all ARDS patients, and 16% in the severe category.
      However, this study did not focus on the prone position per se. In present study, the
      investigators would like to explore the rate of use of prone positioning in ARDS patients and
      the reasons why this treatment was not applied. The present study is one-day prevalence study
      repeated four times over one year.

      The hypothesis is that the rate of use of prone position is greater than 50% in the severe
      ARDS category.
