  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study proposes to assess the impact of a provider-based intervention to enhance
      re-engagement and improve retention, adherence, persistence and viral load among challenging
      patients in Argentina
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Motivational Interviewing (MI) has primarily been utilized as a counseling strategy by
      therapists to counter addiction and improve lifestyle behaviors.

      This application proposes to train physicians to utilize MI to promote re-engagement in HIV
      care and to sustain retention and adherence. The study will increase the reach of the
      original pilot study and increase its generalizability, expanding the patient population to a
      wide variety of public and private clinic and hospital patients, including transgender women,
      drug users, men who have sex with men (MSM), and heterosexual men and women.

    <time_frame>Less than 6 months detectable VL</time_frame>
    <description>VL will be assessed by blood sampling. Viral suppression (HIV VL &lt;200 copies/mL) will be the primary dichotomous outcome; a secondary dichotomization will be made among detectable patients with VL &lt;1000 and those with VL &gt;1000.</description>

    <time_frame>2 years</time_frame>
    <description>Defined as the number of missed clinic appointments (i.e., &quot;no shows&quot; not cancelled in advance by patients or clinic staff) in the 6 months preceding assessment.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Medication persistence</measure>
    <time_frame>2 years</time_frame>
    <description>Medication persistence is the time to treatment discontinuation, with a permissible gap of &lt; 30 days, participants will be considered to have discontinued the regimen if a therapy gap = &gt; 30 days occurs.</description>

    <description>The training will include MI skills and elements identified as most effective, MI spirit (collaboration, evoking patient motivation, honoring patient autonomy, recognizing and reinforcing change talk, and &quot;rolling&quot; with (not fighting) resistance. Physicians utilizing MI will learn to engage with patients in an empathic, nonjudgmental manner and to pose simple but strategic questions to motivate change; when patients resist change, the physician learns to ''roll'' with resistance instead of confronting it. If and when the patient is ready to initiate a change, the physician will be prepared to support their decision</description>
