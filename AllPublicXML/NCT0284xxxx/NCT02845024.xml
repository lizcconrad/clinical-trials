      Aim:

      The purpose of this study is to investigate the effect of nonsurgical periodontal therapy
      plus doxycycline on glycemic control in type 2 diabetes mellitus (type 2 DM) patients who
      have periodontitis.

      Materials and methods:

      A total of 24 type 2 DM patients with periodontitis will be selected for the study, and
      randomly divided into two equal groups,who are at least 35 years of age and 16 teeth and type
      II diabetes are (at least the last 3 months of diagnosis of diabetes and its FBS More than
      110 have), and also with periodontal disease are chronic moderate (at least in three areas
      Attachment level to a depth of 3-4 mm maxillary or mandibular been confirmed by clinical
      examination and radiographic signs are being); Takes place. The initial HbA1c Patients should
      be between 7-9 percent over the past three months has changed his medication also found the
      necessary explanations on how to do that consent, Plaque index (PI) by Loe &amp; Silness,
      bleeding on probing (BOP) based on Carter and Barnes (if any bleeding number 1 and its
      absence is 0), probing depth (PD) and clinical attachment levels (CAL) were recorded. &quot;Group
      1&quot;: (12 patients) was treated with oral hygiene instruction, Scaling, and root planing, and
      doxycycline for 15 days; and &quot;Group 2&quot;: (12 patients) has the same treatment but with
      placebo, After 12 weeks their periodontal condition and Fasting blood sugar (FBS), glycated
      hemoglobin (HbA1c) level, will be reevaluated.
