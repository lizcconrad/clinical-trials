  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, randomized, multi-center, comparator Phase II trial looking at the
      addition of Bevacizumab to Vinblastine in chemotherapy naïve pediatric patients with
      progressive Low Grade Glioma aged 6 months to less than18 years of age at the time of
      initiation of therapy. Participants will be randomized to Arm A or Arm B. Arm A includes 68
      weeks of single agent Vinblastine administered once weekly IV. Arm B includes 68 weeks of
      Vinblastine administered weekly IV with the addition of 12 doses of Bevacizumab administered
      every two weeks IV for the initial 24 weeks. Randomization will take place at the time of
      registration taking into account NF1 and BRAF-KIAA1549-fusion status.

             &gt; 1.0 cm2 residual tumour) with necessity to begin treatment because of a risk of
             neurological impairment with progression.

          4. All patients on study must have measurable tumour (&gt; 1.0 cm2 of residual tissue if
             resection has been performed) within 28 days of registration.

                  should be calculated. If UPC ratio &gt; 0.5, 24-hour urine protein should be
                  obtained and the level should be &lt; 1000 mg/24 hours for patient enrollment.
