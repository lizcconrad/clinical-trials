    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, multicenter study with an extension phase to evaluate the safety and
      tolerability of an perampanel oral suspension when administered as an adjunctive therapy in
      children (ages 4 to &lt;12 years) with inadequately controlled partial onset seizures (POS) or
      primary generalized tonic clonic seizures (PGTC).

      This is a multicenter, open-label, single-arm study in children (ages 4 to less than 12
      years) with inadequately controlled POS or PGTC. The study will consist of a Core Study and
      two Extension Phases (Extension A and Extension B). The Core Study will consist of the
      following 2 phases: Pretreatment and Treatment Phase. The Pretreatment Phase, during which
      participants will be assessed for eligibility, will consist of up to a 4-week ± 3 day
      Screening/Baseline Period. The Treatment Phase will consist of 3 periods: up to an 11-week
      Titration Period (dose titration on the basis of individual clinical response and
      tolerability), up to a 12-week Maintenance Period (continuation of perampanel oral suspension
      once daily at the dose level achieved at the end of the Titration Period), and up to a 4-week
      Follow-up Period (only for those participants not rolling over into Extension A). Extension A
      will consist of up to a 29-week Maintenance Period and up to a 4-week Follow-up Period. Visit
      10 will be completed within 5 weeks ± 6 days of Visit 9. All participants who complete all
      scheduled visits up to and including Visit 9 in the Treatment Phase will be eligible to
      participate in Extension A of the study. During the Maintenance Period of Extension A, all
      participants will continue with their optimal perampanel dose (i.e., dose level that they
      completed on during the Core Study). Participants who do not continue in Extension A or those
      who prematurely discontinue from the study will enter up to a 4-week Follow-up Period.
      Participants in Japan, who complete Extension A, may be eligible to participate in Extension
      B. Extension B will consist of a Treatment Phase which will continue as long as clinically
      appropriate according to the judgment of the investigator. Treatment of participants in
      Extension B will be completed when the participant reaches 12 years of age or when perampanel
      is commercially available in Japan for treatment of POS in pediatric participants (4 to &lt;12
      years of age).

             secondarily generalized seizures or primary generalized tonic-clonic (PGTC) seizures
             according to the International League Against Epilepsy's (ILAE) Classification of
             Epileptic Seizures (1981). A diagnosis should have been established at least 6 months
             prior to Visit 1 by clinical history and an electroencephalogram (EEG) that is
             consistent with the diagnosis; normal interictal EEGs will be allowed provided that
             the participant meets the other diagnosis criterion (i.e., clinical history)

          -  Male or female participant, from age 4 to less than 12 years at the time of informed
             consent/assent

          -  Have a minimum weight of 16 kilograms (kg) (35 pounds [lb])

          -  Have had a brain imaging (e.g., magnetic resonance imaging [MRI] scan or computed
             tomography (CT)) before Visit 1 that ruled out a progressive cause of epilepsy

          -  During the 12 weeks ± 3 days (4 weeks ±3 days in Japan only) prior to Visit 2,
             participants must have had equal or greater than 1 POS or 1 PGTC seizure. Only simple
             POS with motor signs, complex POS, and complex POS with secondary generalization are
             counted toward this inclusion for POS

          -  Are currently being treated with stable doses of 1 to a maximum of 3 approved
             antiepileptic drugs (AEDs). Doses must be stable for at least 4 weeks before to Visit
             1; in the case where a new AED regimen has been initiated for a participant, the dose
             must be stable for at least 8 weeks prior to Visit 1. Only 1 EIAED (defined as
             carbamazepine, phenytoin, oxcarbazepine, or eslicarbazepine) out of the maximum of 3
             AEDs is allowed (A vagal nerve stimulator [VNS] will be counted as one of the 3
             allowed AEDs.)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Females who are breastfeeding or pregnant at Screening or Baseline (as documented by a
             positive beta human chorionic gonadotropin (β-hCG) (or human chorionic gonadotropin
             (hCG)) test with a minimum sensitivity of 25 International Units per liter (IU/L) or
             equivalent units of β-hCG or hCG). A separate baseline assessment is required if a
             negative screening pregnancy test was obtained more than 72 hours before the first
             dose of study drug.

          -  Females of childbearing potential who:

          -  Had unprotected sexual intercourse within 30 days before study entry and who do not
             agree to use a highly effective method of contraception (e.g., total abstinence, an
             intrauterine device, a contraceptive implant, an oral contraceptive, or have a
             vasectomized partner with confirmed azoospermia) throughout the entire study period or
             for 28 days after study drug discontinuation. If a highly effective method is not
             appropriate or acceptable for the participant, then the participant may use a
             medically effective method (e.g., a double barrier method such as condom plus
             diaphragm with spermicide).

          -  Are currently abstinent, and do not agree to use a double-barrier method (as described
             above) or refrain from being sexually active during the study period or for 28 days

          -  Are using hormonal contraceptives but are not on a stable dose of the same hormonal
             contraceptive product for at least 4 weeks before dosing and who do not agree to use
             the same contraceptive during the study or for 28 days after study drug
             discontinuation.

          -  Current or history of pseudo-seizures (psychogenic nonepileptic seizures) within
             approximately 5 years before Visit 1.

          -  Have a history of status epilepticus that required hospitalization during the 6 months
             before Visit 1.

          -  Have an unstable psychiatric diagnosis that may confound participants' ability to
             participate in the study or that may prevent completion of the protocol-specified
             tests (e.g., significant suicide risk, including suicidal behavior and ideation within
             6 months before Visit 1, current psychotic disorder, acute mania).

          -  Any suicidal ideation with intent with or without a plan within 6 months before Visit
             2 (i.e., answering &quot;Yes&quot; to questions 4 or 5 on the Suicidal Ideation section of the
             Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS)) in participants aged 6 and above.

          -  Are scheduled and/or confirmed to have epilepsy surgery within 6 months after Visit 1;
             however, those who have previously documented &quot;failed&quot; epilepsy surgery will be
             allowed.

          -  Evidence of clinically significant disease (e.g., cardiac, respiratory,
             gastrointestinal, renal disease) that in the opinion of the investigator(s) could
             affect the participant's safety or interfere with the study assessments.

          -  Evidence of moderate or severe renal insufficiency as defined by estimated glomerular
             filtration rates (eGFRs) of 31 to &lt; 60 &quot;milliters per minute (mL/min)&quot; and &lt; 30
             mL/min, respectively.

          -  Evidence of significant active hepatic disease. Stable elevation of liver enzymes,
             alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) due to concomitant
             medication(s), will be allowed if they are less than 3 times the upper limit of normal
             (ULN).

          -  Evidence of significant active hematological disease; white blood cell (WBC) count
             equal or less than 2500/µL (2.50 1E+09/liter [L]) or an absolute neutrophil count

             reactions.

          -  Concomitant use of felbamate as an AED for less than 2 years or where the dose has not
             been stable for at least 8 weeks before Visit 1. Participants must not have a history
             of WBC count equal to or less than 2500/µL, platelets below 100,000, liver function
             tests (LFTs) above 3 times the ULN, or other indication of hepatic or bone marrow
             dysfunction while receiving felbamate. If participants received felbamate in the past,
             it must have been discontinued 8 weeks before Visit 1 to be eligible for study
             participation.

          -  Concomitant use of vigabatrin: participants who took vigabatrin in the past must be
             off vigabatrin for at least 5 months before Visit 1 and with documentation showing no

          -  Used benzodiazepines for epilepsy during which the dose has not been stable for
             greater than 4 weeks prior to Visit 1. Benzodiazepines use as rescue medication for
             seizure control is allowed; however, intermittent use of benzodiazepines for any other
             indication (eg, anxiety/sleep disorders) is prohibited.

          -  A VNS implanted less than 5 months before Visit 1 or changes in parameter less than 4
             weeks before Visit 1 (or thereafter during the study)

          -  On a ketogenic diet for which the diet is not a stable regimen for at least 4 weeks
             before Visit 1.

          -  History of or a concomitant medical condition that in the opinion of the
             investigator(s) would preclude the participant's participation in a clinical study or
             compromise the participant's ability to safely complete the study.

          -  Have previously been exposed to perampanel in a clinical trial or by prescription for
             more than 2 months or discontinued for Adverse Events (AEs).
