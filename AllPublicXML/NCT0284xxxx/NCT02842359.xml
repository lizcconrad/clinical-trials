      Primary Objective:

      To evaluate the effect of irbesartan/atorvastatin fixed-dose combination comparing to each
      irbesartan and atorvastatin on flow mediated dilation change in type 2 diabetic patients
      diagnosed with hyperlipidemia, hypertension.

      Secondary Objective:

      To evaluate efficacy of blood pressure and hyperlipidemic factors of irbesartan/atorvastatin
      fixed-dose combination in type 2 diabetic patients diagnosed with hyperlipidemia and
      hypertension, with adequately controlled blood glucose levels in groups.
