    <textblock>
      The main purpose of this study is to explore the sequential therapeutic effect and evaluate
      the safety of anti-CD19 or anti-CD20 CAR-T cells briging HSCT in the treatment of
      relapse/refractory B cell malignancies.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The CD19-targeted CAR-T has shown exellent therapeutic efficiency in B cell
      malignancies,especially in acute lymphocytic leukemia. Recently the anti-CD20 CAR T cells has
      been used in the treatment of relapsed/refractory DLBCL and exhibited good clinical outcomes.

      However, patients treated with CAR-T may face relapse of CD19 or CD20 mutation. Therefore we
      attempt to maintain and relieve patients by sequential therapy of the HSCT and hope to
      combine their advantages.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. CD19-expressing or CD20-expressing relapsed or refractory B cell malignancies after at
             least one standard chemotherapy and one salvage regimen.According to current
             traditional therapies, there must be no available alternative curative therapies.

          2. Patients enrolled must have an evaluated score above 60 with KPS.

          3. Expected survival time of patients enrolled is over 3 months.

          4. Gender is not limited, age from 14 years to 75 years.

          5. Patients must have measurable or evaluable disease at the time of enrollment, which
             may include any evidence of disease including minimal residual disease detected by
             flow cytometry, cytogenetics, or polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis.

          6. Adequate absolute CD3 count estimated need to be assured for obtaining target cell
             dose based on dosage cohorts.

          7. Subjects with the following CNS status are eligible only in the absence of neurologic
             symptoms suggestive of CNS leukemia, such as cranial nerve palsy: CNS 1, defined as
             absence of blasts in cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) on cytospin preparation, regardless
             of the number of WBCs; CNS 2, defined as presence of &lt; 5/uL WBCs in CSF and cytospin
             positive for blasts, or &gt; 5/uL WBCs but negative by Steinherz/Bleyer algorithm CNS3
             with marrow disease who has failed salvage systemic and intensive IT chemotherapy (and
             therefore not eligible for radiation)

          8. Patients with isolated CNS relapse will be eligible if they have previously been
             treated with cranial radiation (at least 1800 cGy).
