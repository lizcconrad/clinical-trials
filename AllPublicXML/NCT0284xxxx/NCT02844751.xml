      This is a prospective open-label clinical study of 50 patients to determine safety and
      treatment potential of autologous cell therapy for pain and inflammation associated with
      Osteoarthritis of the knee. Follow-up will consist of a larger sample including 4,000
      patients.

      This is a prospective open-label clinical study of 50 patients to determine safety and
      treatment potential of autologous cell therapy for pain and inflammation associated with
      Osteoarthritis of the knee. Follow-up will consist of a larger sample including 4,000
      patients.

      Patients will be treated for Osteoarthritis (OA) of the knee due to degeneration or chronic
      injury. They will be treated with autologous Stromed obtained by the Adipose Ultrasonic Cell
      Recovery Unit (AUCRU) and Platelet Rich Plasma (PRP) processed by RegenLab (RegenKit BCT-3)
      PRP product each as direct injections to the affected joints.

      Cohort 1 will include PRP treatments at time of initial StroMed treatment plus at 1 week, 2
      weeks and 1 month.

      Cohort 2 will include PRP treatments at time of initial StroMed treatment plus at 1 month and
      2 months.

      Patient outcomes will be tracked with a follow up MRI at various endpoints to 6 months,
      laboratory tests for inflammation markers, and knee injury and osteoarthritis outcome score
      (KOOS) questionnaires. SF-36 forms (a quality of life measure) and numerical rating scales
      (NRS) will also be used to assess safety and efficacy of treatment, as well as any reduction
      in patient medication and/or delay in pending knee replacement therapy.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients with indication of Osteoarthritis, grade 2 or more. Can be from degeneration
             or chronic injury.

          2. Patients range from 18-90 years of age.

          3. Patients must be able to comply with treatment plan, laboratory tests and periodic
