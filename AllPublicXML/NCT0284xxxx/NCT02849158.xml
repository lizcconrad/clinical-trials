    <textblock>
      Single center interventional study to explore activity of fibroblasts in the tumor and away
      in the healthy rectal tissue.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients included in the trial will have new biopsy performed before starting the Radiation
      Therapy and Chemotherapy (RT-CT). These biopsies will study the activity of fibroblasts in
      the tumor and away in the healthy rectal tissue. Within 8 to 10 weeks after the end of RT-CT,
      patients will have cancer surgery by proctectomy (with complete removal of the meso-rectum).
      On the resection specimen, new samples will be taken at the level of the tumor and away from
      the rectum.This study is single center interventional exploratory .
