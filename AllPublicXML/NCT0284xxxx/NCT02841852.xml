  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) are one of the most frequently prescribed classes of drugs in
      the world and the most effective drugs available to reduce gastric acid secretion. However,
      studies have shown that PPIs are not always prescribed with a clear indication. Indeed,
      between 25% and 86% of older individuals taking a PPI have been overprescribed these
      medications. In older patients, overprescribing of a PPI is associated with increases in
      morbidity, adverse drug events, hospitalization, and mortality. The hypothesis is that
      overprescription of PPIs is associated with the individual multimorbidities in older patients
      evaluated using the multimorbidities group criteria included in the CIRS. The aim of the
      present study was to establish a relationship between overprescribing of PPIs and
      multimorbidities in older patients.
