  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate to what extent IOs improve the functionality of
      edentulous patients and changes in quality of life and overall patient satisfaction following
      treatment with IOs.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Edentulous individuals will be selected from patients attending the prosthodontic clinic.
      Then, new complete dentures will be provided; in a second stage half of these subjects
      (randomly selected) will receive IOs. The effect of different treatment protocols on chewing
      ability, patient satisfaction and OHRQoL will be investigated and assessed.
