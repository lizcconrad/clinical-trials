  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall aim of this study is to test the effect of academic detailing (i.e.
      provider-level educational intervention focused on evidence-based smoking cessation treatment
      for those with psychiatric illness), alone or in combination with practical support from a
      community health worker, on the provision and utilization of standard of care smoking
      cessation treatment to those with serious mental illness (SMI). Further, this study will
      determine if these interventions improve smoking cessation rates for adults with SMI who
      smoke.

      In this study, the investigators aim to test whether a provider-level educational
      intervention in the form of targeted, practical, action-oriented education to primary care
      physicians and nurses on safety and effectiveness of and how to use evidence-based smoking
      cessation treatment for those with psychiatric illness, termed academic detailing (AD), alone
      or in combination with practical support offered to the primary care physician / primary care
      team and the smoker with SMI in the form of a community health worker (CHW) will improve
      recommendation and utilization of standard of care smoking cessation treatments to and by
      those with SMI and, if so, whether the intervention improves smoking cessation rates for
      adults with SMI who smoke.

      To do so, the investigators will randomize primary care clinics that serve approximately 1300
      adult smokers with SMI who receive psychiatric rehabilitation services, Community Based
      Flexible Support (CBFS) or Assertive Community Treatment (ACT)), from the two largest
      providers of these services in the Boston area to either receive AD for their prescribers or
      not in a cluster randomized design. Half of the smokers with SMI in the study who receive
      primary care at the clinics assigned to the AD intervention to providers will be randomly
      assigned to be offered CHW support in addition to their ongoing psychiatric rehabilitation
      (CBFS or ACT) services.

    <description>The investigators hypothesize that those who receive AD+CHW will demonstrate higher rates of biochemically verified tobacco abstinence than those who receive usual care (TAU). The primary outcome will be the proportion of smokers who are abstinent at the Year Three Assessment.</description>

    <description>Usual care (TAU) for adults with SMI in Massachusetts consists of rehabilitation services publicly funded by the state and traditional fee for service outpatient medical and psychiatric care. Importantly, medical care is not programmatically integrated with the psychiatric rehabilitation services. Participants in this arm will receive no other study-related intervention.</description>

    <description>Academic detailing (AD) is a targeted continuing medical education (CME) strategy that adapts social marketing techniques, using mixed interactive and didactic formats in individual and group settings integrated into the practice setting to promote beneficial changes in medical care. The aim of AD is to help clinicians understand and adopt targeted evidence-based practices.

CHWs will then receive the additional specialized training.</description>
