    <description>Induced abortion is a main backstop for terminating unwanted pregnancies, however, traditional hard metal instruments has lots of insufficiencies such as easily tissue damage, and repeatedly sterilization increases the incidence of cross infection in the hospital what leads to more complications of pelvic inflammation, infertility and so on. Therefore disposable non-metallic instruments are desperately needed as a way to decrease the complications and provide better medical services to patients. So, the investigators want to explore the clinical effect of disposable tissue suction tube set and make comparison with traditional metal instruments.</description>

    <description>Induced abortion is a main backstop for terminating unwanted pregnancies. In Chinese hospital, traditional metal instruments are always used during the surgery. So the investigators want to explore the clinical effect of disposable tissue suction tube set and make comparison with traditional metal instruments.</description>
