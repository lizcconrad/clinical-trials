      This observational study will evaluate circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) as a prognostic marker
      and as a monitor of disease recurrence in stage III colorectal cancer (CRC).

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) are small fragments of nucleic acid that originate from
      apoptotic or necrotic tumor cell turnover. Characteristic of the malignant process, ctDNA can
      be assessed in plasma and offers the potential of a sensitive and specific biomarker for
      prognostic information on disease-free or overall survival, and predictive information on
      chemotherapy resistance and probability of lack of response to treatment. This study will
      evaluate ctDNA as a prognostic marker and as a monitor of disease recurrence in stage III
      colorectal cancer (CRC). We will recruit newly diagnosed stage III CRC patients, determine
      their tumor mutational profile, and systematically collect high volume (&gt;10 ml), serial
      plasma specimens every 3 months for up to 3 years and every 6 months in years 4-5 for ctDNA
      and concurrent carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) measurement. Clinical outcome and survival will
      be tracked. The resulting data will permit assessment of ctDNA as a prognostic marker for
      disease-free and overall survival and as a monitor of disease recurrence in comparison with
      CEA.
