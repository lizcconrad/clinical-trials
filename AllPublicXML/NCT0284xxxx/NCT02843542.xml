  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A comparative prospective study to evaluate different imaging modalities (pet-ct and pet-mr)
      prior to surgery in parathyroid tumor patients.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with Hyperthyroidism and surgery indication will be recruited and directed to
      imagine exams. in addition to the conservative 99mTc-MIBI (methoxyisobutylisonitrile) and US,
      patients will also undergo 18FCH (¹⁸F-choline) PET/MRI for detecting adenomas and their
      location. imaging experts will decode the imaging exams. sensitivity and specificity of the
      exams will be examined.
