  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Intensive care unit (ICU) patients commonly display hyperglycemia, even without previously
      known diabetes. It was demonstrated that hyperglycemia was associated with increased hospital
      mortality in various medical and surgical ICU situations. However, discrepant results from
      recent randomized, clinical trials of tight blood glucose control in ICUs have not allowed
      conclusions regarding whether there is a causal link between hyperglycemia and ICU mortality.
      In addition to the mean blood glucose level, glucose variability has recently been emphasized
      as an independent predictor of ICU and hospital mortality. This concept has been described in
      a wide variety of medical, surgical and trauma ICU patients. In all of these settings,
      glycemic variability was measured with various indices but was steadily associated with ICU
      and/or hospital mortality in non-diabetic ICU patients. Conversely, glycemic variability was
      either weakly or not associated with mortality in ICU patients with previously known
      diabetes. Notably, all of these data have been observational, and interventional trials
      remain lacking to assess the impact of glycemic variability reduction on ICU mortality and
      thus to demonstrate causality. However, glycemic variability was considered sufficiently
      important to be mentioned in recent international guidelines for the management of
      hyperglycemia in critically ill patients. In these publications, experts from the American
      College of Critical Care Medicine emphasized that glycemia should be maintained at less than
      9.9 mmol/L in ICU patients while avoiding hypoglycemia and minimizing glycemic variability.
      To achieve these goals, computer-based insulin infusion protocols have demonstrated their
      superiority to paper-based protocols. Glucose concentrations, variation per unit of time
      between the last and current glucose measurements, insulin dosage, and carbohydrate intake
      were the main input variables used in these different computerized algorithms. However, such
      protocols are not widely available because commercial systems have licensing fees and
      academic protocols do not always go beyond the pilot phase.

      To address this issue, the investigators adapted a previously validated, paper-based, dynamic
      protocol (DP) to an actual recommended glycemic target range. Our aim was to assess the
      efficacy, safety, feasibility and acceptance by nurses of this dynamic insulin protocol,
      compared to a paper-based, sliding scale static protocol (SP).

        This prospective trial involved adult patients who were admitted to the medical intensive
        care department of a French university hospital to compare the effects of two continuous
        intravenous insulin infusion (CIII) protocols on glycemic variability. According to the
        local protocol, patients with two consecutive capillary blood glucose measurements greater
        than 180 mg/dL (9.9 mmol/L), one hour apart, were considered to require CIII and were
        included in the trial. All of the patients or their family members received written
        information about the trial.
