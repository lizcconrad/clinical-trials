  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aging of the population, and greater exposure to noise, are responsible for an increased
      incidence of hearing loss (presbycusis). This hearing loss is sensorineural disability that
      has become a real public health problem. The main means of rehabilitation of this disability
      is represented by the apparatus of patients with conventional hearing aids. However, these
      hearing aids have several drawbacks that limit their profits, often abandoning the prosthesis
      by the patient.

      Middle ear implants were developed to answer these problems. They are intended to amplify the
      sound signal by transmitting directly to the middle ear to compensate for the hearing loss
      and are indicated in case of failure or contraindication of conventional equipment. However,
      these middle ear implants currently have limitations as performance failure. Recent data show
      that the performance of the ossicles repair techniques are dependent on the coupling of the
      ossicular prosthesis to the ossicles. Furthermore, advances in the understanding of the
      biomechanics of the ossicles confirm the importance of the placement and linkage of surgical
      restoration processes. This data can be applied to middle ear implants to improve
      performance. Indeed, a preliminary experimental study on anatomical parts, using analysis of
      the vibration of the middle ear structures by laser velocimetry, allowed the investigators to
      define the transducer placement method and coupling method to ossicles.

      Investigators wish to validate in vivo results in a pilot study on a small number of patients
      by comparing two surgical techniques guided by velocimetric measures.

    <description>Usual implantation technique of a middle ear implant. The principle of the ossicular stimulator middle ear transducer MET 7000 (Middle Ear Transducer, METTM) is to directly transmit sounds on the ossicles bypassing the outer ear. Their constraint is the surgical placement of the implant.
MET 7000 system (OTOLOGICS LLC, USA) is the implant that the investigators will use for their patients. The stimulator is usually placed against the body of the anvil by simple contact in the case of sensorineural hearing loss. In the case of mixed hearing loss, the stimulator will come in contact with the bracket using a titanium clip (ossicular prosthesis used in otologic surgery for ossiculoplasties). The optimized version corresponds to the use of the conventionally used in mixed deafness and applied to neurosensory deafness art. It is screwed onto the mastoid bone, the motor is suspended in the mastoid cavity and transmits vibrations to the body of the anvil by simple contact of the transducer.</description>
