      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Age &gt;= 18 and &lt;= 70 years old.

          -  Performance status (Karnofsky index) &gt;= 80.

          -  Histological diagnosis of invasive breast cancer (T1-T4,N2-3,M0). Time window between
             surgery and study randomization must be less than 60 days.

          -  Surgery must consist of mastectomy or conserving surgery with axillary lymph node
             dissection.

          -  Positive axillary lymph nodes defined as at least 1 out of 10 nodes with presence of
             disease. If sentinel node technique is used, sentinel node can be the only node
             affected.

          -  Status of hormone receptors, HER2 status, Ki-67 index and p53 in primary tumour.
             Results must be available before the adjuvant chemotherapy. All patients require the
             TA or TAC chemotherapy. And patients should receive the endocrine chemotherapy or
             anti-targeted therapy according to the hormone receptor status or HER2 status
             respectively.

          -  Written informed consent. Patients are able to comply with treatment and study
             follow-up.

          -  Patients must not present evidence of metastatic disease.

          -  Normal electrocardiogram (EKG) in the 12 weeks prior to randomization. If needed,
             normal cardiac function must be confirmed by left ventricular ejection fraction
             (LVEF).

          -  Laboratory results (within 14 days prior to randomization):

          -  Hematology: neutrophils &gt;= 2.0x10^9/l; platelets &gt;= 100x10^9/l; hemoglobin &gt;= 10
             mg/dl;

          -  Hepatic function: total bilirubin &lt;= 1 upper normal limit (UNL); SGOT and SGPT &lt;= 2.5
             UNL; alkaline phosphatase &lt;= 2.5 UNL. If values of SGOT and SGPT &gt; 1.5 UNL are
             associated to alkaline phosphatase &gt; 2.5 UNL, patient is not eligible;

          -  Renal function: creatinine &lt;= 175 mmol/l (2 mg/dl); creatinine clearance &gt;= 60 ml/min.

          -  Complete stage workup during the 12 weeks prior to randomization (mammograms are
             allowed within a 20 week window). All patients must have a bilateral mammogram, thorax
             x-ray, abdominal echography and/or computed tomography (CT)-scan. If bone pain, and/or
             alkaline phosphatase elevation, a bone scintigraphy is mandatory. This test is
             recommended for all patients. Other tests: as clinically indicated.

          -  Negative pregnancy test done in the 14 prior days to randomization.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Prior systemic therapy for breast cancer.Or prior therapy with anthracyclines or

          -  Bilateral invasive breast cancer.

          -  Any N0-1 or M1 tumour.

          -  Pre-existing grade &gt;= 2 motor or sensorial neurotoxicity (National Cancer Institute
             Common Toxicity Criteria version 2.0 [NCI CTC v-2.0]).

          -  Any other serious medical pathology, such as congestive heart failure; unstable
             angina; history of myocardial infarction during the previous year; uncontrolled HA or
             high risk arrhythmias.

          -  History of neurological or psychiatric disorders, which could preclude the patients
             from free informed consent.

          -  Active uncontrolled infection.

          -  Active peptic ulcer; unstable diabetes mellitus.

          -  Previous or current history of neoplasms different from breast cancer, except for skin
             carcinoma, cervical in situ carcinoma, or any other tumour curatively treated and
             without recurrence in the last 10 years; ductal in situ carcinoma in the same breast;
             lobular in situ carcinoma.
