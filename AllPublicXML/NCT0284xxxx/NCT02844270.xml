    <textblock>
      The Galaxy First-in-man study is a small pilot. single arm research , which will enroll a
      total of 45 patients. The goal is to access the feasibility, safety and efficacy of Rapamycin
      Drug-Eluting Bioresorbable Coronary Stent System in the treatment of patients with de novo
      coronary lesion.

      This study is a prospective, single arm clinical trial. 45 patients enrolled in the study
      will be randomly assigned to queue1 (n=30) and queue 2 (n=15). The clinical follow-up will be
      performed in all subjects at 1 month,6 months,1 year,2 years,3 years,4 years and 5 years
      after stent implantation; angiographic,IVUS and OCT follow-up will be performed at 6 months
      and 2 years after stent implantation in queue 1; angiographic,IVUS and OCT follow-up will be
      performed at 1 year and 3 years after stent implantation in queue 2. The primary endpoint of
      the study is target lesion failure (TLF) at 30 days after stent implantation.
