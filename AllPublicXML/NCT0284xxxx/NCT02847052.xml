  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      IL-22 is an IL-10 family cytokine that plays major actions to increase intestinal epithelial
      barrier function and regeneration during experimental colitis. IL-22 binding protein is a
      small, soluble, and secreted protein potently inhibiting IL-22 actions through preventing the
      binding with IL-22 Recepteur. This study aims at characterizing how IL-22 binding protein is
      regulated in Inflammatory bowel disease to better understand the way IL-22 acts on epithelial
      cells during flares of the disease.
