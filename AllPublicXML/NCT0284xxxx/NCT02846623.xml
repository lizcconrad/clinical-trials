    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical research study is to learn if atezolizumab and obinutuzumab (either
      with or without ibrutinib) can help control CLL. The safety of this drug combination will
      also be studied.

      Study Drug Administration:

      Each study cycle is 28 days.

      If participant is found to be eligible to take part in this study, participant will receive
      obinutuzumab by vein over about 4-6 hours on Days 1, 2, 8, and 15 of Cycle 1 and then Day 1
      of Cycles 2-9.

      Participant will also receive atezolizumab by vein on Days 1 and 15 of Cycles 2-9. The first
      time participant receives atezolizumab it should take about 1 hour. After that, if
      participant tolerates the drug well, it may only take about 30 minutes to receive.
      Participant will not receive atezolizumab during Cycle 1.

      All participants will receive the same dose of obinutuzumab and atezolizumab.

      If participant is already taking ibrutinib as part of participant's standard care,
      participant will continue to take it at the current dose and schedule participant has been
      assigned to by participant's regular doctor.

      Study Visits:

      On Days 1 and 15 of Cycles 1-9 and Days 8 and 22 of Cycle 2:

        -  Blood (about 1-2 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests. Part of this routine blood
           draw may also be used for tests related to the immune system.

        -  Participant may have a physical exam.

      On Days 2 and 8 of Cycle 1 and Days 8 and 22 of Cycles 3-6, blood (about 1-2 teaspoons) will
      be drawn for routine tests.

      On Day 15 of Cycle 1, participant may have these tests/procedures performed by participant's
      local doctor, if it is closer to participant's home. During Cycle 2, all blood draws and
      physical exams must be done at MD Anderson. After Cycle 2, participant must have physical
      exams and blood draws performed at MD Anderson at least 1 time each month; all other exams
      and draws can be done at participant's local clinic or doctor's office.

      If blood draws and physical exams are done outside of MD Anderson, the results will be sent
      to the study doctor for review.The option to have blood draws and physical exams at
      participant's local doctor's office will be discussed with participant by the study doctor.

      On Day 28 of Cycles 3, 6, and 9:

        -  Participant will have a physical exam.

        -  Blood (about 1-2 tablespoons) and urine will be collected for routine tests. These
           routine tests will include a pregnancy test if participant can become pregnant.

        -  Participant will have a bone marrow biopsy/aspirate to check the status of the disease.

        -  Participant will have a CT or PET scan to check the status of the disease.

      If the doctor thinks it is acceptable to do so, participant may skip the End of Cycle 3 visit
      and have the Day 1 of Cycle 4 visit instead. This will be discussed with participant.

      Length of Study:

      Participant may continue receiving obinutuzumab and atezolizumab for up to 9 cycles. If
      participant is receiving it, participant may continue to receive ibrutinib as part of
      participant's standard care for as long as the doctor thinks it is in participant's best
      interest. Participant will no longer be able to take the study drugs if the disease gets
      worse, if intolerable side effects occur, or if participant is unable to follow study
      directions.

      Participation on the study will be over after about 1 year of follow-up visits.

      End-of-Study Visit:

      Within 30 days of participant's last dose of study drugs:

        -  Participant will have a physical exam.

        -  Blood (about 1-2 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests.

        -  If the doctor thinks it is needed, participant will have a bone marrow biopsy/aspirate
           to check the status of the disease.

        -  If the doctor thinks it is needed, participant will have a CT or PET scan.

      Long-Term Follow-Up:

      After participant's end-of-study visit, participant will continue to have follow-up visits
      for up to 1 year at the below time points.

      One (1) time each month:

        -  Participant will have a physical exam.

        -  Blood (about 1-2 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests

      Every 3-6 months:

        -  Participant will have a bone marrow biopsy/aspirate to check the status of the disease.

        -  Participant will have a CT or PET scan.

      If participant starts a new type of anti-CLL treatment during the 1 year follow-up period,
      participant will stop having these study visits.

      This is an investigational study. Atezolizumab is not FDA approved or commercially available.
      Its use in this study is investigational. Obinutuzumab and ibrutinib are FDA approved and
      commercially available for use in the treatment of CLL. It is considered investigational to
      use these drugs in combination with each other to treat CLL.

      The study doctor can explain how the drugs are designed to work.

      Up to 72 participants will be enrolled in this study. All will take part at MD Anderson.

         21. Other severe acute or chronic medical or psychiatric condition or laboratory
             abnormality that in the opinion of the investigator may increase the risk associated
             with study participation or investigational product administration or may interfere
             with the interpretation of study results and/or would make the patient inappropriate
             for enrollment into this study
