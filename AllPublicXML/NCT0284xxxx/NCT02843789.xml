      The aim of this study is to analyze the variation of adiponectinemia and its molecular forms
      in RA patients receiving tocilizumab therapy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic inflammatory disease associated with cardiovascular
      morbidity. Tocilizumab (TCZ), a monoclonal antibody against the interleukin-6 receptor is an
      effective new biotherapy for the treatment of RA. This treatment is associated with increased
      LDL and HDL-cholesterol lipid parameters. Adipokines are adipose tissue-specific secreted
      molecules, which have many functions such as regulation of appetite, blood glucose or immune
      response. Among the adipokines, adiponectin exerts beneficial effects on the cardiovascular
      system. Patients with RA also exhibit body composition changes, including an increase in
      abdominal visceral fat. The impact of tocilizumab therapy in RA patients on adipokines and
      body composition is not known.

      This project aims to explore the evolution of circulating adiponectin and other adipokines
      during tocilizumab therapy in RA. Body composition and its variations under tocilizumab
      therapy will also be analyzed.
