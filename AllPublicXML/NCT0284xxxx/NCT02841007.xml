    <textblock>
      The geko™ device is indicated for the prevention and treatment of oedema. The aim of this
      study is to show that recruiting, and performing study assessments in ankle fracture patients
      requiring surgery to fix their ankle attending the James Cook Hospital is feasible, and to
      obtain data to support the powering of a larger study to demonstrate the effectiveness of the
      geko™ device at reducing length of stay for this population of patients. This study will also
      allow us to assess the acceptability, tolerability and compliance of treatment with the geko
      device.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Aged 18-60 years old

          2. Clinically and radiologically diagnosed acute ankle fracture that, in the opinion of
             the treating surgeon, requires operative fixation

          3. Able to understand the Patient Information Sheet (PIS) and willing to sign the written
             Informed Consent Form.

          4. Able and willing to follow the protocol requirements.

          3. Patients who on presentation to hospital are known to be pregnant.

          4. Clinically significant co-morbidities that need to be treated prior to surgical
             intervention and could therefore impact upon time to theatre

          5. History or signs of previous deep or superficial vein thrombosis/pulmonary embolism.

          6. Varicosities, ulceration or erosion around the area of the leg where the study device
