  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Leg and foot ulcers due to venous disease or diabetes are chronic wounds that can take 6 or
      more months to heal. Growth factors have been used to try and improve this healing, however,
      many such studies have failed, and that is thought to be due enzymes in the wound that
      degrade the growth factors and prevent them from working. This is a proof of concept study
      that will evaluate the treatment of chronic leg ulcers with topically applied growth factors
      that are combined with a therapy to prevent their inactivation in the wound.
