  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To strengthen family well-being and neighborhood cohesion in Kwun Tong community, a community
      -based &quot;Learning families&quot; campaign was conducted. As an initial step of this project, the
      investigators conducted a need assessments before designing and conducting a
      train-the-trainer workshop.The train-the-trainer workshop aimed to prepare the members of
      Estate Management Advisory Committees (EMAC) and Mutual Aid Committees (MACs) to implement
      and assist in conducting a series of community-based family well-being activities for
      residents in a public housing estate. Focus group interviews (before and one year after
      training workshop) were conducted to obtain opinion from the members of EMAC and MACs of the
      public housing estate. Questionnaire assessments were conducted before, immediately after
      finishing the training workshop, one year after training workshop.

      According to the Social Welfare Department statistics, Kwun Tong has been ranked as the
      highest for the reported cases of elderly abuse (12.3%), the second and fourth highest for
      the reported cases of battered spouse (9.2%) and child abuse (7.9%) respectively . To
      strengthen family well-being in the Kwun Tong community, the investigators adopt a
      community-based participatory (CBP) approach and implement a community-based &quot;Learning
      Families&quot; campaign in Kwun Tong district with our collaborator, the Christian Family Service
      Centre (CFSC). The campaign aims to promote family health, happiness, and harmony (3Hs)
      through cultivating cooperative and self-regulated family learning culture in the public
      housing estate

      Given that CFSC is the leading non-government organization based in Kwun Tong district, the
      investigators believe that the proposed campaign will deliver the family well-being messages
      effectively in the community via engaging major stakeholders such as the Estate Management
      Advisory Committees (EMACs) and the Mutual Aid Committees (MACs).

      The investigators implemented a brief training sessions to the resident leaders of EMAC &amp;
      MACs to engage and equip them with the general concept of &quot;Family well-being&quot;, &quot; Learning
      family&quot;, &quot;Neighbourhood cohesion&quot; and activities organizing skills. The train-the-trainer
      workshop aimed to prepare the members of Estate Management Advisory Committees (EMAC) and
      Mutual Aid Committees (MACs) to implement and assist in conducting a series of
      community-based family well-being activities for residents in a public housing estate.

      Focus group interviews (before and one year after training workshop) were conducted to obtain
      opinion from the members of EMAC and MACs of the public housing estate. Questionnaire
      assessments were conducted before, immediately after finishing the training workshop, one
      year after training workshop.
