      Primary Objective:

      To assess the efficacy of a single intraarticular dose of GZ389988 compared to placebo for
      relief of knee pain in patients with osteoarthritis (OA) of the knee.

      Secondary Objectives:

      To assess the safety and tolerability of a single intraarticular dose of GZ389988 in patients
      with painful OA of the knee.

      To assess the pharmacokinetic parameters of a single intraarticular dose of GZ389988 in
      patients with painful OA of the knee.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Screening will be performed within 21 days of dosing. Following the single dose of study
      medication, the study period for each patient will be 84 ± 7 days up to the end-of-study
      visit.

      Total duration for one patient will be up to 16 weeks (up to the end-of-study visit), not
      including the long-term observational safety follow-up phone call for 12 additional weeks.

      The collection of primary endpoint data up to Week 4 for futility analysis is optional.
      Assuming a possible step-down in dose due to safety/tolerability reasons, the total expected
      maximum number of included patients could be increased up to a maximum of 182 patients.
