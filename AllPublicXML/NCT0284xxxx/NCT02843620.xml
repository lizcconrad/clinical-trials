  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the effects of 40 mg of b-2Cool, a food supplement rich in native
      type-II collagen, on healthy adults with joint discomfort. Half of the participants will
      receive the b-2Cool containing supplement while the other half will receive a placebo pill.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Previous studies had shown the efficacy of the intake of native collagen to relieve pain in
      healthy patients with joint discomfort.

      Native collagen is detected in the gut's Peyer's patches and, thanks to a mechanism known as
      oral tolerisation, reduces the autoimmune attack to joints' collagen improving joint function
      and pain.

      Oral tolerance consists of two phases of immune response: the maintenance of homeostasis and
      the suppression of immune responses mediated by Ag-specific regulatory T cells. T-cells
      detect the epitopes of type-II collagen in the gut and suppress the immune response against
      bodily type-II collagen. Then, these regulatory T cells generated in the gut are presumed to
      migrate to a local microenvironment where a protein analogous to the orally dosed antigen
      resides, in this case type-II collagen. Upon reactivation in a new microenvironment,
      regulatory cells will suppress ongoing inflammation.
