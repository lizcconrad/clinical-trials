  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The anti-cancer cytotoxic chemotherapy is often the cause of neutropenia of grade IV or
      febrile neutropenia. Those neutropenia, in addition to being a comorbidity factor, result in
      dose reductions and/or temporary or permanent stop of chemotherapy, thus impacting clinical
      response. To avoid those episodes, or to shorten the duration and reduce the associated risk,
      administration of Granulocyte Colony Stimulating Factor (G-CSF) is recommended. Recombinant
      G-CSF reproduces the physiological effects of endogenous G-CSF by increasing the
      proliferation of granulocytes progenitors. Different forms of G-CSF are available: daily
      administration (such as filgrastim, lenograstim) and a single administration (pegfilgrastim).

      Various international learned societies offer recommendations for primary care, secondary or
      curative neutropenia induced by chemotherapy based on G-CSF. However, guidance on the ideal
      time for the administration of growth factors and duration of administration are not very
      clear. If it seems clear that the treatment should not be initiated within the first 24 hours
      following administration of chemotherapy, summaries of the characteristics of different
      products do not provide evidence to optimize the administration day depending on the kinetics
      evolution of neutrophils. In addition, no information is given as to the choice of a
      formulation with respect to the other.

      The pilot study the investigator propose aims to model the effect of exogenous G-CSF on the
      evolution of neutrophil function of time and explain the pharmacodynamic variability during
      the administration of chemotherapy based on eribulin. The description of the evolution of
      neutrophils when growth factors are administered give the opportunity to streamline
      administration regimens of these factors and to provide guidance on the circumstances in
      which they should or should not be given while weekly chemotherapy.

      Expected benefits and foreseeable risks With the exception of surplus withdrawals during the
      first 2 cycles of treatment, this study will have no impact on the care of patients.
