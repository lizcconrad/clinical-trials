  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1 study of the combination of Ad-p53 administered intra-arterially in
      combination with oral metronomic capecitabine in patients with unresectable, refractory liver
      metastases of colorectal carcinoma (CRC) and other solid tumors, including primary
      hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). This safety study has a standard 3+3 design. The Maximum
      Tolerated Dose (MTD) will be determined as well as the general safety and preliminary
      efficacy using RECIST 1.1 and Immune-Related Response Criteria. CEA levels will also be
      followed.

      This is a Phase 1 study of the combination of Ad-p53 administered intra-arterially in
      combination with oral metronomic capecitabine in patients with unresectable, refractory liver
      metastases of colorectal carcinoma (CRC) and other solid tumors, including primary
      hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). This safety study has a standard 3+3 design, with dosing
      following the initial cohort determined by MTD and DLT criteria as well as safety and
      tolerance. Patients will be followed for adverse events and preliminary efficacy. The Maximum
      Tolerated dose (MTD) will be determined as well as the general safety and preliminary
      efficacy using RECIST 1.1 and Immune-Related Response Criteria. CEA levels will also be
      followed. Biomarker testing of archival or fresh tissue is performed during the study.
      Patients will undergo a maximum of 2 8-week cycles, with scans every 8 weeks. No additional
      biopsies are planned following Screening. Enrollment will be up to 24 patients.
