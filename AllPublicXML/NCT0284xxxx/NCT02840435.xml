      This study is designed to test the effectiveness of the smoking cessation intervention &quot;Sit
      to Quit&quot; through a randomized-control trial. This study will compare abstinence outcomes in
      the Sit to Quit study group to a control group using the North Carolina State Tobacco Quit
      Line. This is an investigational study (n=60) designed to test Sit to Quit (STQ) versus Quit
      Line (QL) through a pilot randomized control trial. The proposed study is designed with
      double-blind procedures (participants and study staff) for randomization of 60 participants
      recruited through Duke Smoking Cessation Program into two groups: STQ and QL. STQ
      participants will receive access to the STQ Instructional Video, the STQ manual, and
      proactive Quit Coach calls supporting STQ. QL participants will be instructed to contact the
      NC Quit Line and will receive access to &quot;web Coach&quot; (Alere Well-being site), the Quit Line
      manual, and proactive Quit Coach calls supporting &quot;Quit for Life.&quot; All statistical analysis
      will be performed under the directions of the statistician designated in key personnel.
      Outcomes of variables including: demographic variables, evaluation responses, and abstinence
      rates will be analyzed using general regression models using an ANOVA-based design. The study
      Principal Investigator Dr. James Davis will ultimately be responsible for data and safety
      monitoring. Subject data will be collected during visits and captured in the Electronic
      Medical Record. Data will be collected by phone, and this data will be stored in REDCap.
      Participants that experience events related to their clinical treatment will be recommended
      to follow-up with their provider.

    <intervention_name>Sit to Quit</intervention_name>
    <description>Sit to Quit(STQ) is a smoking cessation program adapted from Mindfulness Training for Smokers (MTS) with core content available on the STQ video. STQ contains many elements found in traditional interventions (e.g. instruction on planning and structuring a quit day, garnering support from others, assessment of prior relapse occasions, development of strategies to avoid triggers). In addition, STQ provides instruction in various mindfulness practices and in how to apply mindfulness skills to manage common causes of relapse. Exercises are provided, and it is recommended to learn the skill experientially. STQ requests that participants practice guided meditation each day using an audio recording and employ other mindfulness practices targeted to manage relapse challenges. Participants will also receive the STQ Participant Manual, which provides all the instruction found in the STQ Video, but provides additional discussion of topics for smokers who desire additional material.</description>

    <description>Quit for Life integrates telephone counseling, written materials, NRT, and an online program called &quot;Web Coach.&quot; Web Coach is an interactive internet-based support system that provides health information on smoking cessation, assistance in the development of quit strategies, and an interactive blog to interact with other smokers. Web Coach is used by approximately 70% of AWI callers. Web Coach is not a complete program, but instead is designed to supplement AWI phone-based therapy. In addition, Quit for Life also provides the &quot;Quit Guide,&quot; which is a smoking cessation manual with written instructions on the use of medications, planning a quit day, and cessation-related cognitive skills.</description>
