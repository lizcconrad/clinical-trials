  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Only a small proportion of patients with biliary obstruction caused by hepatopancreatobiliary
      malignancies are suitable for surgical resection. Therefore, most patients with malignant
      biliary obstruction will need palliation of their obstructive jaundice to relieve the
      symptoms and prevent life threatening complications such as biliary sepsis. The endoscopic or
      percutaneous/transhepatic routes, such as endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography
      (ERCP) and percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography (PTC), and stents are accepted
      approaches for the relief of jaundice in malignant biliary obstruction. Improvement in the
      bilirubin level is also essential before palliative chemotherapy is considered in these
      patients. However, tumor ingrowth still remains a major cause of obstruction. In this trial,
      the investigators will use HabibTM EndoHPB (EMcision Ltd., UK) catheter which was used for
      the endobiliary radiofrequency ablation (RFA) treatment as a form of neoadjuvant therapy in
      hepatopancreatobiliary adenocarcinoma.

    <textblock>
      The HabibTM EndoHPB (EMcision Ltd., UK) catheter which was used for the endobiliary
      radiofrequency ablation (RFA) treatment is an endoscopic bipolar catheter designed to ablate
      tissue in malignant tumors within luminal structures. HabibTM EndoHPB has Food and Drug
      Administration (FDA) and European Conformity approval for such indications. It has also
      approved by Ministry of Health and Welfare in 2016. In this study, the investigators will
      perform intra-luminal RFA for 20 inoperable patients with malignant biliary stenosis. HabibTM
      EndoHPB will be deployed via an endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) route.
      By using radiofrequency energy to heat the tissue in the duct prior to insertion of the
      stent, the surrounding tissue becomes coagulated and this may delay tumor growth and the time
      before the stent lumen becomes occluded. If stent occlusion occurs in a participant during
      the follow up period, the participant will be reassessed and investigations will be used to
      determine cause of stent occlusion and whether it is appropriate to repeat RFA treatment. The
      aim will be to detect an improvement in survival and safety in the treated patients compared
      to patient receiving palliative treatment recorded in literatures.
