  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Decision-aids are tools to educate patients on a given topic so that they may better
      participate in shared-decision making in their health care. Given the complexities associated
      with PSA testing, many professional organizations have advocated for shared-decision making
      for PSA testing. However, no consensus exists as to how best educate and involve patients in
      the shared-decision making process. The goal of this study is to evaluate a pilot program
      utilizing a simple PSA screening decision-aid presented in two different fashions in a
      primary care clinic with a large fraction of African-American patients. The investigators
      will evaluate the effectiveness of this program to educate patients on the risks and benefits
      of prostate specific antigen (PSA) testing, on their subsequent level of comfort with their
      decision about whether to receive PSA testing, and on the comfort level of physicians on
      their patient's decisions regarding PSA testing, and importantly, how well these strategies
      can be implemented into the daily work-flow of a clinic. If successful, this program may
      serve as a model for the broader implementation of such strategies across Minnesota and the
      country.

      This pilot project will evaluate two approaches to implementing the use of a simple printed
      PSA screening decision-aid (DA) administered in an urban primary care clinic populated with a
      significant number of African-Americans. All subjects will complete a survey assessing their
      knowledge and attitudes about PSA screening and shared decision making (SDM), and physicians
      will also be briefly queried about their perceptions of the SDM process.

      After the first three month implementation period we will conduct focus groups with clinic
      staff to guide changes and refinements to the use of DA in the clinical setting. Another
      three month implementation period will follow using the same methods to assess outcomes.
      Finally we will conduct another round of focus groups to assess the overall impact of the
      interventions.

    <description>VA health services researchers have developed a patient education pamphlet for prostate cancer screening. The pamphlet, titled &quot;The PSA test for prostate cancer: Is it Right for ME was created by members of the PROstate CAncer Screening Education (PROCASE) study team. A modified version of the PROCASE decision aid will be utilized in this study.</description>
