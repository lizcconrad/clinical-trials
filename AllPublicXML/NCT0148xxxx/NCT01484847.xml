  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a study to assess how much of the investigational drug, PF-00298804, is in the blood
      stream over a period of time (called pharmacokinetic tests or PK) in patients with locally
      advanced head and neck squamous cell carcinoma who have a (gastrojejunostomy) feeding tube.

      This is a single arm pharmacokinetic assessment study conducted at Princess Margaret Hospital
      in which eligible patients will be enrolled successively to receive a single dose of
      PF-00299804 in an open-labelled, unblinded manner. All patients will receive 45 mg of
      PF-00299804 via Gastrostomy (GT) once only on an empty stomach (i.e. 2 hours before or after
      oral food intake or GT feeds (food intake of less than 500 calories permitted)) as an
      inpatient. All patients will be admitted for an overnight inpatient stay (approximately 24
      hours) to facilitate pharmacokinetic assessment. There will be no dose reductions or
      modifications. Blood sampling for pharmacokinetics will occur on day 1 immediately prior to
      the dose of PF-00299804 (t=0), then at t=30 minutes, t=1 hour, t=2 hours, t=3 hours, t=4
      hours, t=6 hours, t=12 hours, t=24 hours, t=48 hours, t=72 hours, t=96 hours, t=144 hours,
      t=168 hours, t=192 hours, and t=216 hours.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Signed, voluntary informed consent provided

          -  Willing and able to comply with visits, treatment plan, pharmacokinetics, tests, other
             procedures

          -  Confirmed SCCHN. Other primary sites of head and neck carcinoma: nasopharynx, skin,
             maxillary sinus or unknown primary, are allowed

          -  Must have functioning gastrojejunostomy tube

          -  May be receiving concurrent chemoradiation, radiation alone or recently completed
             surgery for locally advanced disease

          -  Prior treatment with agents targeted to epidermal growth factor receptor not allowed.

          -  Any treatment-related toxicity, including laboratory abnormalities, must have
             recovered to CTCAE Grade 2 (v.4.0) or baseline, except toxicity not considered safety
             risk. Chronic dysphagia, xerostomia or other local effect from prior surgery or
             radiation will not be considered exclusion criterion if stable for ≥ 3 months.

          -  ECOG performance status 0-2

          -  Must have adequate organ function determined by: Serum creatinine ≤ 1.5 ULN (upper
             limit of normal) or calculated creatinine clearance of ≥ 50 mL/min using the formula:
             Creatinine clearance = [(140-age) x wt (kg) x Constant] / creatinine (µmol/L)
             [Constant = 1.23 for men; 1.04 for women]. Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥ 1.5 x

             hypertension, unstable angina, myocardial infarction, symptomatic congestive heart
             failure within past year, uncontrolled cardiac arrhythmia, diagnosed/suspected

             infection. History of significant bleeding disorder, or concurrent medications that

             ability to receive study treatment as determined by investigator

          -  Dementia or altered mental status that would limit ability to obtain informed consent
             and compliance with requirements of the protocol

          -  Patients breastfeeding or pregnant are excluded. Those with reproductive potential
             must have negative pregnancy test within 72 hours of treatment. Patients of
             reproductive potential include any female who has experienced menarche and who has not
