  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Accurate early burn depth assessment is important to determine the optimal treatment. The
      most applied method to asses burn depth is clinical assessment. This method is the least
      expensive, but not very accurate. Laser Doppler imaging (LDI) has been shown to accurately
      assess burn depth. The clinical effects, the costs and cost-effectiveness of this device
      however, are unknown. The hypothesis is that an eary accurate diagnosis will lead to an
      earlier therapeutic decision: surgery or no surgery. Earlier excision and grafting probably
      leads to a decrease in wound healing time, in length of hospital stay and in costs.

      Before the investigators decide to implement LDI in Dutch burn care a study of the clinical
      effects and cost-effectiveness of LDI is necessary. Therefore a multicenter randomized
      controlled trial will be conducted, including all patients with burns of indeterminate depth
      (burns that are not obviously superficial or full thickness) treated in the Dutch burn
      centres. In total 200 patients will be included in an 18 months period. The patients are
      randomly divided in two groups: 'new diagnostic strategy' versus 'current diagnostic
      strategy'. Burn depth will be diagnosed both by clinical assessment and laser Doppler imaging
      in all patients. The results of the LDI-scan will be provided to the treating clinician in
      the 'new diagnostic strategy' group only. Time to wound healing, diagnostic and therapeutic
      decisions, and costs are observed.

    <measure>The effect of LDI on patient outcomes: quality of life and scar quality</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months post burn</time_frame>
    <description>Quality of life is measured with the EuroQol-5D in patient ≥ 5 years old (Bouillon et al., 2002) or the ItQol-47 in patients &lt;5 years old (Raat et al., 2007):
Baseline measurement within one month post burn
Second measurement within 3 months post burn
Scar quality is measured after 3 months:
Scar elasticity with the Cutometer® Skin Elasticity Meter 575 (Draaijers et al., 2004)
Vascularity and pigmentation with the Dermaspectometer (Draaijers et al., 2004)
Self-reported scar quality: Patients Observer Scar Assessment Scale (van der Wal et al., 2011)</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The effect of LDI on diagnostic and therapeutic decisions</measure>
    <time_frame>Until wound healing, circa 2-6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Effect of the introduction of the LDI will be assessed by comparing diagnostic decisions of burn clinicians, before and after the use of LDI.
Possible diagnostic decisions are (Monstrey et al., 2011):
Superficial dermal burn, will heal (within 14 days)
Intermediate burn (possible will heal, or needs grafting)
Deep dermal or subdermal (full thickness) burn, needs grafting (will not heal within 21 days)
The possible therapeutic decisions are:
Surgery
Postponement of decision
No surgery</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The effect of LDI on total (medical and non medical) costs</measure>
    <time_frame>From injury until 3 months post burn</time_frame>
    <description>Costs from a societal perspective are calculated (following the Dutch guidelines from Oostenbrink et al., 2004):
Costs during hospital stay
Outpatient costs
Non-hospital and non-medical costs</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The cost-effectiveness of LDI compared to the standard diagnostic strategy</measure>
    <time_frame>From injury until 3 months post burn</time_frame>
    <description>In case of differences in patient outcome (wound healing time and scar quality) between both diagnostic strategies, cost-effectiveness will be calculated by dividing the difference in average costs by the difference in average time of wound healing or scar quality.
In case of difference in quality of life between both diagnostic strategies, cost-utility will be calculated by dividing the difference in average costs by the difference in Quality Adjusted Life Years (QALY's).</description>
