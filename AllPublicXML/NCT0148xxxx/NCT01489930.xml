  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Loss of skeletal muscle strength and skeletal muscle mass occurs with of aging. This
      are-related decline in skeletal muscle mass and skeletal muscle strength is a major
      underlying factor contributing to many of the metabolic disorders and frailty of the
      investigators rapidly expanding aging population. Endurance (aerobic) and resistance exercise
      training programs have been shown to effectively reverse the age-related decline in metabolic
      and contractile muscle functions. The investigators will measure synthesis rates of
      individual muscle proteins in 36 each of young (18-30 yrs) and 36 older (&gt; 65 yrs) people to
      determine their response to 8 weeks each of endurance, resistance, combined endurance and
      resistance training, or placebo exercise training.

      Hypotheses.

        1. to measure fractional synthesis rates of multiple muscle proteins and identify those
           that are enhanced by an endurance exercise program

        2. to determine whether changes in protein synthesis in response to endurance exercise
           programs are dependent on age

        3. to measure fractional muscle synthesis rates of multiple muscle proteins and to identify
           those that are enhanced by a resistance exercise program

        4. to determine whether changes in protein synthesis in response to resistance exercise
           programs are dependent on age
