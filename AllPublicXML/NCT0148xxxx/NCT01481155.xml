  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether photodynamic therapy or CO2 laser therapy
      is superior in the treatment of actinic keratoses with respect to efficacy and side effects.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Ablative laser therapy and photodynamic therapy are widely used and accepted therapeutic
      methods to treat multiple actinic keratoses, yet comparative studies are rare. The purpose of
      this study is to compare both treatments intraindividually with respect to treatment efficacy
      and side effects.
