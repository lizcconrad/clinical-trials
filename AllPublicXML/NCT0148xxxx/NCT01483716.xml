  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Obesity is an escalating problem in the UK and a proportion of these patients have a
      condition known as Obesity Hypoventilation Syndrome (OHS). This syndrome is associated with
      symptoms of breathlessness, reduction in exercise capacity, fatigue and headaches. Previous
      research has shown that patients with this condition tend to use healthcare services more
      frequently and are often at risk of other diseases such as diabetes mellitus and high blood
      pressure. Currently, the mainstay of treatment is noninvasive ventilation (NIV), this is a
      mask ventilator that patients use overnight to improve oxygen levels and remove carbon
      dioxide (the waste gas of breathing), however this does not fully treat the underlying
      problem. The research group has shown that NIV helps improve activity and contributes to
      weight loss in this group of patients. The aim of this research will be to investigate the
      effect of an exercise and nutrition programme in addition to NIV on weight loss and activity
      levels compared to NIV alone.
