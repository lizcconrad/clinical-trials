    <textblock>
      The main objectives are to determine on one hand whether oligomeric alpha-synuclein levels
      are increased in MSA patients compared to controls and on other hand whether there is a good
      agreement between cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and plasma levels.

    <textblock>
      Multiple system atrophy (MSA) is a rare neurodegenerative disorder which is characterized by
      a variable combination of parkinsonism, cerebellar dysfunction, autonomic failure, and
      additional signs. No effective treatment is available. Together with PD and Lewy body
      dementia, MSA belongs to a group of neurodegenerative disorders, the alpha-synucleinopathies,
      which are characterized by the abnormal accumulation of alpha-synuclein. The development of
      biological markers for the diagnosis and prognosis in MSA remains an unmet need. Such
      biological markers are crucial for future disease-modification and neuroprotection trials.
      Alpha-synuclein has a high potential for biomarker development since it constitutes the
      pathological hallmark feature in MSA. The oligomeric alpha-synuclein seems to be particularly
      involved in abnormal protein aggregation in alpha-synucleinopathies.

      The study will compare alpha-synuclein levels in CSF and plasma between patients suffering
      from AMS and controls who are patients requiring spinal tap without being affected by a
      neurodegenerative disorder. The MSA patients and controls will receive CSF and blood sampling
      at one study visit.
