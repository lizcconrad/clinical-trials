      The purpose of this study was to describe mean differences in corneal staining (type and
      area) for OPTI-FREE PureMoist Multi-Purpose Disinfecting Solution (MPDS) at Day 30 compared
      to Baseline (Day 0).

    <description>Percentage corneal staining was assessed by the investigator for each of five regions of the cornea; i.e., four quadrants plus central. The investigator instilled flourescein dye and examined the cornea with a slit lamp, i.e., biomicroscope and yellow filter. Percentage corneal staining was recorded in increments of ten, and the percentages of the five regions were averaged together.</description>
