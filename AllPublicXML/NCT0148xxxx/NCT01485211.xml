      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the corneal pachymetric variations during and after
      corneal collagen cross-linking (CXL) treatment with ultraviolet-A irradiation (UVA) and
      hypo-osmolar riboflavin solution in thin corneas.

      To evaluate the corneal pachymetric variations during and after corneal collagen
      cross-linking (CXL) treatment with ultraviolet-A irradiation (UVA) and hypo-osmolar
      riboflavin solution in thin corneas.

      Eighteen eyes of 18 patients, 11 men and 7 women, with progressive keratoconus and thinnest
      corneal thickness (TCT) less than 400µm were included in this study.

      After the epithelium removal, iso-osmolar riboflavin was applied to the cornea every 3
      minutes (30 min). Hipo-osmolar riboflavin was then applied every 20 seconds until the TCT
      reached 400µm. UVA irradiation was performed for 30 min. Pachymetry was recorded at the
      thinnest point of the cornea preoperatively, after epithelial removal, after iso-osmolar
      riboflavin, after hypo-osmolar riboflavin, after UVA irradiation, and at 1, 6 and 12 months.

    <description>Riboflavin and UVA-induced corneal cross-linking increases the stability of keratoconic corneas. The current inclusion criteria require a minimum stromal thickness of 400 µm. Hypo-osmolar riboflavin solution increases the stromal thickness before CXL in cases with preoperatively thin corneas.</description>
