  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The intent of this study is to complete the collection of clinical data on subjects enrolled
      in the Stabilimax Dynamic Spine Stabilization IDE clinical trial (#G060214) sponsored by the
      now defunct Applied Spine Technologies Inc . The Applied Spine assets, including the clinical
      trial data, were acquired by Rachiotek, LLC in 2010. When Applied Spine ceased their funding
      of the trial, a number of enrolled patients had not yet completed the two year follow-up
      visit defined as the study endpoint in the clinical investigation plan. No additional patient
      treatment is required to complete the study. Rachiotek has interest in pursuing IDE approval
      for a new study and the information collected in this study is essential for supporting the
      new Investigational Device Exemption application.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Any patient that after having met all of the inclusion/exclusion criteria identified
             for the Stabilimax Investigational Device Exemption study had enrolled in the
             Stabilimax Investigational Device Exemption study and were implanted with the
             Stabilimax NZ or the control device.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Any patient that has had the device removed and the adverse event follow-up report
             stated that the event was resolved. This applies only if the patient was formally
             withdrawn from the study at that time.
