    <textblock>
      It will be a single dose, single-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled dose
      escalation study of SC continuously-delivered LD/CD solution (ND-0612) for 24 hours in
      healthy volunteers.

      Objectives are to determine:

        1. the maximal tolerated dose of SC ND-0612

        2. the steady state plasma concentration of LD and CD following SC ND-0612 administration.

      Each treatment group will include 6 healthy volunteers. Dosing will be done in a sequential
      manner.

    <description>The safety and tolerability of ND0612 will be well monitored and will assess the ND0612 effect at various doses in comparison to placebo in the following parameters:
Incidence and frequency of local adverse events related to the ND0612 Sc administration.
Local safety scoring. In addition, systemic adverse events and withdrawal rates and discontinuations due to adverse events will be recorded</description>
