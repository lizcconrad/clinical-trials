  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The specific aim of this study is to determine whether a medical intervention improve status
      of patients with discal sciatica and if yes which type of intervention.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary criteria is to determine the difference between the mean leg pain during the
      latest 24 hours preceding the infiltration and the mean leg pain preceding the visit S4
      (visit 4 weeks after the infiltration). If difference is of 50% patient will be considered
      &quot;improved&quot;. This study will be organized under three steps:Step 1 : when 124 patients will be
      randomized: first intermediate analysis to compare efficacy of groups 1+ 2+ 3 versus 4. If
      significant difference is not demonstrated, study will be stopped at this stage since having
      demonstrating that infiltration or simulation is inefficient. On the other case, step 2 will
      be performed.Step 2 : Recruitment is continued only in arms 1 to 3 until reaching a total of
      142 randomized patients. Second intermediate analysis to compare efficacy of groups 1+ 2
      versus 3. If significant difference is not demonstrated, study will be stopped at this stage
      since having demonstrating that infiltration is inefficient. On the other case, step 3 will
      be performed.Step 3 : Recruitment is continued only in arms 1 and 2 until reaching a total of
      274 randomized patients. Third intermediate analysis to compare efficacy of groups 1 versus
      2.

      Visit of inclusion (J0): 1/ notification in the case report form of - information concerning
      patient pain (mean, maximal and minimal pain during the 24 last hours)- Oswestry
      questionnaire - impact of discal sciatica on professional activity,- intake of analgesic,
      co-analgesics and non steroids anti- inflammatory drugs2/ Randomization and infiltration with
      corresponding treatment arm3/ Thirty minutes after receiving the infiltration, recording of
      actual patient pain Visits at day 7, weeks 4, 12 and 24 after J0: Notification in the case
      report form of - information concerning patient pain (mean, maximal and minimal pain during
      the 24 last hours)- Oswestry questionnaire - impact of discal sciatica on professional
      activity,- intake of analgesic, co-analgesics and non steroids anti- inflammatory drugs
