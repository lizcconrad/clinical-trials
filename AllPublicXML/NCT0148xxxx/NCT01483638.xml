               -  Urinary protein &lt;2+ by urine dipstick. If dipstick is ≥2+ then a 24-hour urine
                  collection can be done and the patient may enter only if urinary protein is &lt;2 g
                  per 24 hours.

          7. At least 4 weeks since the end of prior systemic treatment, radiotherapy, or surgical
             procedure with resolution of all treatment-related toxicity to NCI CTCAE Version 4.0

             within 3 days prior to treatment.

         10. Signed and dated informed consent document indicating that the patient (or legally

             prior to enrollment.

         11. Willingness and ability to comply with scheduled visits, treatment plans (including
             willingness to take either AG-013736 or placebo according to randomization),
             laboratory tests, and other study procedures.

          1. Gastrointestinal abnormalities including:

               -  inability to take oral medication;

               -  requirement for intravenous alimentation;

               -  prior surgical procedures affecting absorption including total gastric resection;

               -  treatment for active peptic ulcer disease in the past 6 months;

               -  active gastrointestinal bleeding, unrelated to cancer, as evidenced by
                  hematemesis, hematochezia or melena in the past 3 months without evidence of
                  resolution documented by endoscopy or colonoscopy;

               -  malabsorption syndromes.

               -  History of abdominal fistula, gastrointestinal perforation, or intra-abdominal
                  abscess within 6 months prior to start, unless affected area has been removed
                  surgically

          2. Current use or anticipated need for treatment with drugs that are known potent CYP3A4
             inhibitors (ie, grapefruit juice, verapamil, ketoconazole, miconazole, itraconazole,
             erythromycin, telithromycin, clarithromycin, indinavir, saquinavir, ritonavir,
             nelfinavir, lopinavir, atazanavir, amprenavir, fosamprenavir and delavirdine).

          3. Current use or anticipated need for treatment with drugs that are known CYP3A4 or
             CYP1A2 inducers (ie, carbamazepine, dexamethasone, felbamate, omeprazole,
             phenobarbital, phenytoin, amobarbital, nevirapine, primidone, rifabutin, rifampin, and

             hematuria.

          5. Requirement of anticoagulant therapy with oral vitamin K antagonists. Low-dose
             anticoagulants for maintenance of patency of central venous access devise or

          6. Active seizure disorder or evidence of brain metastases, spinal cord compression, or
             carcinomatous meningitis.

          7. A serious uncontrolled medical disorder or active infection that would impair their

             myocardial infarction, uncontrolled angina, coronary/peripheral artery bypass graft,
             symptomatic congestive heart failure, cerebrovascular accident or transient ischemic
             attack and 6 months for deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism.

             or QTc interval &gt;450 msec for males or &gt;470 msec for females.

         10. Known human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) or acquired immunodeficiency syndrome
             (AIDS)-related illness.

             curative intent for skin cancer (other than melanoma), in situ breast or in situ
             cervical cancer, or those treated with curative intent for any other cancer with no
             evidence of disease for 2 years.

         12. Dementia or significantly altered mental status that would prohibit the understanding
             or rendering of informed consent and compliance with the requirements of this
             protocol.

         13. Female patients who are pregnant or lactating, or men and women of reproductive
             potential not willing or not able to employ an effective method of birth
             control/contraception to prevent pregnancy during treatment and for 6 months after
             discontinuing study treatment. The definition of effective contraception should be in
             agreement with local regulation and based on the judgment of the principal
             investigator or a designated associate.

         14. Other severe acute or chronic medical or psychiatric condition, or laboratory
             abnormality that may increase the risk associated with study participation or study
             drug administration, or may interfere with the interpretation of study results, and in
             the judgment of the investigator would make the patient inappropriate for entry into
             this study.

         15. Current, recent (within 4 weeks of the study treatment administration), or planned
             participation in an experimental therapeutic drug study other than this protocol.
