    <textblock>
      Overall objective: To conduct a randomised controlled trial (RCT) to examine whether an early
      two-dose measles vaccination (MV) strategy at 4 and 9 months will reduce child mortality
      compared with the WHO strategy of one dose of MV at 9 months.

      Specific hypotheses Hypothesis I) Two doses of MV at 4 and 9 months compared with the
      standard dose of MV at 9 months will reduce mortality by 30% between 4 months and 5 years of
      age1. As in a previous trial it is expected that the beneficial effect is strongest for
      girls.

      Hypothesis II) Children receiving MV at 4 months in the presence of maternal measles
      antibodies (MatAb) will have 35% lower mortality between 4 months and 5 years of age than
      children receiving MV at 4 months with no detectable MatAb.

      Implications: These hypotheses are based on a previous RCT showing strong beneficial effects
      of providing an early measles vaccine, in particular among children with MatAb.
