        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Male or female subjects 18 to 55 years of age.

          2. Body weight between 60 kg and 80 kg, body mass index between 20 and 30 kg/m2
             inclusive.

          3. NHV as evidenced by comprehensive clinical assessment (detailed medical history and
             complete physical examination).

          4. Normal resting blood pressure and heart rate

          5. Willingness to refrain from the consumption of alcohol for 24 hours prior to each
             study visit.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. History or presence of currently relevant medical conditions, including any
             cardiovascular, pulmonary, gastrointestinal, hepatic, renal, metabolic, hematological,

             disease, or signs of acute illness.

          2. Administration of any medications within 1 week before randomization, other than

          3. Onset of a new exercise routine or major change to a previous exercise routine within
             2 weeks prior to randomization. Subjects must be willing to maintain a relatively
             constant level of exercise during the study and refrain from unusually strenuous
             physical activities

          4. Known history of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) antibody; and/or positive
             hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), and/or positive hepatitis C antibody (HCV) at the
             screening visit.

          5. History of substance (eg. drug or alcohol) abuse or regular (daily) smoking within a
             year prior to randomization or positive results on urine drug screen.

          6. Excessive consumption of beverages with xanthine derivates (caffeine, theophylline,
             theobromine), such as coffee, tea, cola, or yerba mate (more than 4 cups or glasses
             per day).

          7. Hospitalization for any reason within 60 days of randomization.

          8. Participation in any clinical research study evaluating another investigational drug
             or therapy within 30 days of the investigational drug, whichever is longer, prior to
             the randomization visit.

          9. Live/attenuated vaccinations within 12 weeks of randomization or during the study.

         10. Tuberculosis vaccination within the last year.

         11. Previous exposure to any other biological agent within 12 months of randomization.

         12. History of a hypersensitivity reaction to doxycycline or other tetracyclines.

         13. Recent travel (within 12 months of randomization) to areas endemic for parasitic
             helminthes, such as developing countries, particularly in Africa and the tropical and
             subtropical regions of Asia.

         14. Pregnant or breast-feeding women.
