    <textblock>
      During cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) after heart surgery, a child's blood is exposed to many
      foreign entities. These conditions trigger the body's inflammatory response which results in
      leaky capillaries, increased swelling and possibly organ dysfunction. Since the early 1990's,
      modified ultrafiltration (MUF) has been shown to decrease excess swelling, reduce bleeding,
      improve heart function, and decrease hospital length of stay. Angiopoietins are a family of
      proteins necessary for both normal and abnormal blood vessel formation. They also appear to
      play a role in capillary leak. Though MUF has been shown to improve clinical outcome
      following CPB, there continues to be conflicting reports whether this is a result of the
      filtration of inflammatory proteins or simply from excess fluid removal. Since angiopoietins
      appear to play a role in both inflammation and capillary leak, the investigators hypothesize
      that the benefit seen after MUF is also secondary to its ability to filter out these
      proteins, especially angiopoietin-2.

    <textblock>
      During cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) for corrective or palliative congenital heart surgery, a
      child's blood is subjected to hemodilution, hypothermia, nonpulsatile blood flow and exposure
      to foreign and non-endothelialized surfaces. These non-physiologic conditions trigger the
      host's innate systemic inflammatory response which results in capillary leak, increased total
      body water and can lead to end organ dysfunction. Since the early 1990's, modified
      ultrafiltration (MUF) has been shown to decrease excess tissue edema, reduce postoperative
      bleeding, improve cardiac contractility, maintain hemodynamic stability, and decrease
      hospital length of stay. Angiopoietins are a family of vascular growth factors necessary for
      both normal and abnormal blood vessel formation and appear to play a role in capillary leak.
      Though MUF has been shown to improve clinical outcome following CPB, there continues to be
      conflicting reports whether this is a result of the filtration of inflammatory cytokines or
      simply excess fluid removal. Since angiopoietins appear to play a role in both inflammation
      and capillary leak, the investigators aim to determine whether MUF's clinical benefit is also
      secondary to its ability to filter out these molecules, more specifically angiopoietin-2.

    <description>Modified ultrafiltration (MUF) is the process after cardiopulmonary bypass during which a filtration unit is added and blood is filtered and returned back to the patient. The goal of this project is to evaluate the effect of MUF on concentrations of Angiopoietin-2 (Ang-2) and IL 8, two known pro-inflammatory markers involved in capillary leakage, as well as Ang-1 and IL 10, two anti-inflammatory mediators. Levels will be drawn prior to bypass, after MUF and at ICU admission.</description>
