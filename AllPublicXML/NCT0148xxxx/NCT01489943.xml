  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test the effects of study drug (GSK1605786) on the blood
      levels of multiple commonly used drugs that are given to measure how your liver breaks down
      the study drug. These commonly-used drugs are midazolam, pioglitazone, omeprazole, and
      rosuvastatin which will determine the effect of GSK1605786 on how the body breaks down
      (metabolizes) these commonly-used drugs. Blood samples for pharmacokinetic analysis of
      GSK1605786, and two metabolites, [GSK2635622 (CCX062) and GSK2656694 (CCX304)] and four probe
      substrates will be collected over a 24-hour period after administration. Safety will be
      assessed by the measurement of vital signs, cardiac monitoring, collection of adverse event
      assessments and laboratory tests.
