  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Myelodysplastic Syndrome (MDS) is a disease of the bone marrow characterized by
      anemia,neutropenia, and thrombocytopenia (low red blood cell, white blood cell, and platelet
      counts). MDS patients with thrombocytopenia who fail standard therapies require regular
      platelet transfusions which are expensive and inconvenient, and are a risk for further
      serious bleeding complications. The new treatment of MDS using azacitidine has shown to
      increase the survival rate of MDS patients including to improve platelet production over
      time. However,in the early cycles of treatment with azacitidine,the low platelet counts tend
      to exacerbate before they provide any clinical benefit.

      Eltrombopag is a drug designed to activate the thrombopoietin receptor. Eltrombopag has been
      able to increase platelet counts in healthy Thrombocytopenia Purpura (ITP), a disease where
      patients destroy their own platelets very rapidly and thus develop thrombocytopenia.

      Eltrombopag is administered orally and is Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) approved for
      the treatment of thrombocytopenia in patients with chronic ITP who failed to respond to
      standard treatment.

      This study is a single arm pilot study to evaluate the safety and tolerability of Eltrombopag
      in the treatment of low platelet counts in adult subjects with MDS treated using azacitidine
      This study also incorporates a correlative laboratory component designed to determined the
      mechanism of action of 5-azacitidine +/- Eltrombopag and to determine a baseline profile
      which may predict those most responsive. These studies will incorporate gene methylation and
      expression, and immunoprofiling.
