  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is strong evidence that patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) are at increased
      risk of developing coronary heart disease (CHD). This elevated risk is independent of
      classical risk factors such as smoking, obesity, hypercholesterolemia, diabetes and
      hypertension. The risk of CHD is increased 1½-2 fold in those with minor depression and 3-4½
      fold in subjects with MDD. Put simply, the relative risk of developing CHD is proportional to
      the severity of the depression. While the mechanism of increased cardiac risk attributable to
      MDD is not known disturbances in autonomic function most likely do play a part.

      In untreated patients with MDD (with no underlying CHD) the investigators have identified
      that a marked sympathetic nervous activation and diminished heart rate variability (HRV)
      occurs in a proportion (approximately one third) of patients. Diminished HRV has been linked
      to increased incidence rates of acute cardiac events in conditions such as hypertension,
      diabetes and myocardial infarction. Importantly, whether treating depression actually
      improves the risk of: (1) CHD development or (2) recurrence of cardiac events in patients
      with existing CHD remains unknown.

      The investigators, and others, have provided a growing body of evidence linking elevated
      sympathetic activity and exaggerated sympathetic responses to stress to early stages of end
      organ dysfunction and markers of disease development. Of particular note, in addition to
      possible effects on HRV is the association of chronic sympathetic nervous activation to: (a)
      abnormal blood pressure regulation and (b) the development of insulin resistance.

      The investigators therefore plan to examine the cardiovascular effects of two different
      antidepressant medications, agomelatine and escitalopram, in patients with MDD. In addition,
      the investigators plan to investigate the effects these two medications have on sympathetic
      nervous system activity, blood pressure, HRV, endothelial function, metabolic and
      psychological effects.

      Findings from this study will assist us to identify of biological correlates of sympathetic
      nervous activation which will enable us to: (1) identify those at potentially increased
      cardiac risk, and (2) potentially implement additional therapeutic strategies in order to
      reduce cardiac risk. Indeed, it is not known whether antidepressant treatment alone would be
      sufficient to reverse any adverse effects of sympathetic nervous activation. This study aims
      to answer this important clinical question.

    <description>The investigators will measure sympathetic nervous system activity via whole body noradrenaline spillover and microneurography. Data will be used to examine the relationship between the degree of sympathetic nervous system activity and early signs of cardiac structure and function abnormalities, insulin resistance, and morning surge in blood pressure. This may help in identifying MDD patients who are at an increased risk.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline and following 12 weeks of antidepressant treatment.</time_frame>
    <description>The investigators will explore the association between sympathetic nervous system activity and stress reactivity to the morning surge in blood pressure in patients with MDD.
