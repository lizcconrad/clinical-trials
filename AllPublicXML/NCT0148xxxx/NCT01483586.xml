    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  confirmed adenocarcinoma of the prostate

          -  undergone definitive treatment (surgery, surgery with radiation therapy, cryotherapy,
             radiation therapy or brachytherapy) for the primary prostate tumor with a rising PSA

          -  life expectancy greater than 6 months

          -  has Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status 0, 1, or 2

          -  use of other dietary/herbal supplements (e.g. saw palmetto, selenium, etc.) has been
             stable for at least 2 months prior to screening and the patient agrees not to stop or
             change the dose while participating in the study.

          -  Adequate hepatic function with serum bilirubin ≤ 1.5 times the upper institutional
             limits of normal, ALT and AST ≤ 2.5 times the upper institutional limits of normal

          -  Adequate renal function with serum creatinine ≤ 1.5 times the upper institutional
             limits of normal

          -  Adequate hematologic function (absolute neutrophil counts ≥ 1,500 mm3 and platelets ≥
             100,000 mm3)

          -  All electrolytes (including potassium, sodium, and serum or ionized calcium) must be
             within normal limits

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with evidence of metastatic disease would be excluded, except for presence of
             positive lymph nodes from the surgical pathology. Similarly, patients with
             radiological evidence of lymph nodes &lt; 2 cm that lack pathological confirmation would
             be eligible

          -  Patients with a PSA doubling time of &lt;6months at screening would be excluded

          -  Patients meeting Phoenix criteria for biochemical failure (nadir + ≥2ng/mL increase in
             serum PSA) who wish additional conventional therapy

          -  Any concurrent malignancy other than adequately treated basal or squamous cell skin
             cancer or superficial bladder cancer

          -  Any psychiatric or other disorders such as dementia that would prohibit the patient
             from understanding or rendering informed consent or from fully complying with protocol
             treatment and follow-up

          -  Inability to swallow capsules

          -  Patients with a known history of gastrointestinal disease, surgery or malabsorption
             that could potentially impact the absorption of the study drug

          -  Patients requiring the use of a feeding tube

          -  Receipt of prior chemotherapy
