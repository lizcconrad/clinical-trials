  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the overall cutaneous response rate (participants
      who achieve a complete response or partial response) based on the modified severity weighted
      assessment tool criteria.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-arm (group), open-label (all people know the identity of the intervention),
      and multicenter study. The study consists of 3 phases including, the screening phase (within
      28 days prior to the start of study medication), treatment phase (participants will receive
      quisinostat) and follow-up phase (30 days after the last dose of study medication until death
      or clinical cutoff). Clinical cut-off is defined as when the last participant will be
      assessed with progressive disease or died, or 6 months after the last participant enrolled,
      whichever occurs first. However, if any participants are still receiving study treatment at
      the time of clinical cut-off, these participants will enter a long-term extension phase and
      will continue to receive study medication until a reason for discontinuation is met (ie,
      disease progression, toxicity, availability of other effective medications that the
      participant may receive, or treating physician advice). The long-term extension phase will
      continue for a maximum of 2 years beyond the clinical cut-off for primary analysis. Safety
      will be evaluated by the assessment of adverse events, vital signs, physical examination,
      12-lead electrocardiogram, and clinical laboratory tests which will be monitored in this
      study. Any participants responding to treatment at the end of the 2-year long-term extension
      phase will be able to continue to receive quisinostat as long as they are assessed by the
      investigator as not meeting treatment discontinuation criteria; during this time, only
      information related to serious adverse events will be collected.

    <measure>Number of participants who will achieve overall cutaneous Response Rate (RR) based on modified Severity Weighted Assessment Tool (mSWAT) criteria</measure>
    <time_frame>From screening until progressive disease or confirmed lost to follow-up or death or start of alternate therapy, or withdrawal from the study; as assessed for approximately 6 months after the enrollment of the last participant</time_frame>
    <description>The RR is defined as the number of participants who will achieve a complete response (CR) or partial response (PR). mSWAT criteria is used to evaluate the skin tumor burden. The investigator will determine the percentage of total body surface area (TBSA) affected by patches, plaques or tumors in 12 body regions, using the participant's palm and fingers representing 1% of TBSA. CR is defined as 100% clearance of skin lesions and PR is defined as 50% to 99 % clearance of skin lesions from baseline without occurrence of a new tumor.</description>

    <measure>Number of participants who will achieve global Response Rate (RR) based on based on consensus global response score</measure>
    <time_frame>From screening until progressive disease or confirmed lost to follow-up or death from any cause or start of alternate therapy, or withdrawal from the study; as assessed for approximately 6 months after the enrollment of the last participant</time_frame>
    <description>The RR is defined as the number of participants who will achieve a complete response (CR) or partial response (PR). Global response score provides uniformity in the assessment of response and utilizes all component of the tumor-node-metastasis-blood staging (ie, skin, nodes, viscera and blood). Complete response is defined as complete disappearance of all clinical evidence of disease (all categories have CR/ non-involved [NI]) and PR is defined as regression of measurable disease (all categories do not have a CR/NI and no category has a PD and if any other category involved at baseline, at least one has a CR or PR).</description>

    <description>PFS is defined as the interval between the date of administration of the first dose of study medication and the date of disease progression or death from any cause, whichever occurs first.</description>

    <description>1-year OS rate is defined as the number of participants surviving at 1 year after the date of administration of the first dose of study medication.</description>

    <time_frame>From screening until progressive disease or confirmed lost to follow-up or death from any cause or start of alternate therapy, or withdrawal from the study; as assessed for approximately 6 months after the enrollment of the last participant</time_frame>
    <description>EORTC QLQ-C30 is a questionnaire to assess quality of life of cancer patients. It is composed of 30 items, multi-item measure (28 items) and 2 single-item measures. For the multiple item measure, 4-point scale is used and the score for each item range from &quot;1 = not at all&quot; to &quot;4 = very much&quot;. Higher scores indicate worsening. The 2 single-item measure involves question about the overall health and overall quality of life which will be rated on a 7-point scale ranging from &quot;1 = very poor&quot; to &quot;7 = excellent&quot;. Lower scores indicate worsening.</description>

    <description>Pruritus Intensity Assessment Questionnaire is an 11-point scale that requires the participant to rate the intensity of their pruritus. The scores range from '0= no pruritus; 10 = worst imaginable'. Pruritus relief will be defined as a 3 or more point decrease in participant who have a baseline pruritus score of 3 or more points or complete resolution of pruritus for 3 or more continuous weeks without an increase in the use of antipruritic medications. Higher score indicates worsening.</description>
