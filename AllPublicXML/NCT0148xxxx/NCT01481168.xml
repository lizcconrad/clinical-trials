  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether or not the intravenous adenosine test
      readily identifies patients with unexplained syncope who would benefit from permanent
      pacemaker implantation.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigation of syncope (transient loss of consciousness with loss of postural tone,
      collapse and spontaneous recovery) varies widely, is often lengthy and frequently expensive.
      The intravenous adenosine test has been used in the investigation of syncope and is cheap,
      safe and free of serious side effects. However, it is unclear what diagnosis the test
      unearths. There is some evidence that the test readily identifies bradycardia pacing
      indications.

      In this study we plan to perform the adenosine test and implant a pacemaker should the test
      be positive. In half of the patients we will turn the pacemaker &quot;on&quot; and in the other half
      the pacemaker &quot;off&quot;. The groups will swap over after six months. During this time we will
      assess the number of syncopal episodes. Also, in those who have a negative adenosine test we
      will implant a loop recorder to try to discover the cause of syncope.
