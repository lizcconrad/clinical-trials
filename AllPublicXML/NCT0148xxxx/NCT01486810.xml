  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The proposed protocol is an open-label pilot study of the treatment of cocaine dependence
      using lisdexamfetamine (LDX), a prodrug of d-amphetamine. The investigators plan to enroll 12
      patients in an eight-week open-label trial to obtain preliminary data regarding the safety,
      tolerability, and potential utility of lisdexamfetamine for treatment of cocaine dependence
      and to determine an effective dosage range.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In an eight-week open label outpatient pilot trial, we will evaluate the safety,
      tolerability, and potential utility of LDX in the treatment of cocaine dependence. Patients
      will receive a flexible-fixed dosing schedule under open-label conditions. Patients will be
      titrated to the tolerated dose over a two week period, with a maximum of 140mg daily, and
      then maintained on the highest tolerated dose for four weeks, followed by a two week run-down
      period. All participants will receive medication management counseling and individual therapy
      using a structured compliance enhancement manual designed for pharmacotherapy trials in
      subjects with substance use disorders.

      The primary outcome measures will be 1) the maximum total lisdexamfetamine dose achieved
      during the study period defined as the highest amount of medication per day maintained for a
      seven day period 2) lisdexamfetamine tolerability as measured by adverse effects reported on
      the Systematic Assessment for Treatment and Emergent Events (SAFTEE). Secondary outcome
      measures will be 1) cocaine use as recorded by the number of days of use on the Timeline
      Follow-Back method (Sobell &amp; Sobell, 1992) and confirmed by urine toxicology, 2) cocaine
      craving as measured by the Cocaine Craving Scale (CCS) and Cocaine Craving Questionnaire
      (CCQ) and 3) alternate measures of cocaine use, such as the dollar value of cocaine used per
      day, as measured by the Timeline Follow-Back method, and the proportion of urine toxicology
      samples negative for cocaine.
