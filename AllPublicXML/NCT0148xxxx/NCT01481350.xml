      Pulmonary hypertension increases the perioperative risk in patients undergoing cardiac
      surgery for valvular heart diseases, especially in patients with a long life mitral valve
      disease. The present study wants to test the hypothesis that intravenous administration of
      sildenafil reduces pulmonary vascular resistances and afterload of the right ventricle.

    <textblock>
      Pulmonary hypertension represents an increased risk for perioperative patients undergoing
      cardiac surgery for valvular heart disease especially in patients with a long life mitral
      valve disease complicated by sever pulmonary hypertension, with high risk of developing post
      operative right ventricular failure during separation from cardiopulmonary by pass. A recent
      study showed that a single oral administration of sildenafil at the beginning of the cardiac
      intervention in patients undergoing valvular heart surgery complicated by pulmonary
      hypertension reduces pulmonary vascular resistances without inducing significant effects on
      systemic vascular resistances. The present study wants to test the hypothesis that
      intravenous administration of sildenafil reduces pulmonary vascular resistances and afterload
      of the right ventricle avoiding right ventricular failure. This should support weaning from
      cardiopulmonary by pass in patients undergoing cardiac surgery for valvular heart diseases
      associated to pulmonary hypertension.
