    <textblock>
      Intravitreal injections of pegaptanib will induce the regression of Proliferative Diabetic
      Retinopathy (PDR) and reduce the need for retinal photocoagulation.

      Primary Objective:

      To further establish the efficacy of intravitreal pegaptanib injections in the regression of
      retinal neovascularization secondary to high-risk PDR, as compared to standard panretinal
      photocoagulation (PRP)

      Secondary Objective:

      To maintain the regression of PDR after the induction phase with intravitreal pegaptanib
      injections administered at 12-week intervals, as compared to standard PRP

      To maintain the regression of PDR after the induction phase with retinal photocoagulation
      applied to areas of ischemia (Selective Laser Photocoagulation), as compared to standard PRP

      To evaluate the rate of recurrence of neovascularization after 6 intravitreal pegaptanib
      injections

      To determine if intravitreal pegaptanib will reduce the area and/or volume of concomitant
      diabetic macular edema, as assessed by leakage on fluorescein angiography (FA) and/or optical
      coherence tomography (OCT)

      To determine if intravitreal pegaptanib injections maintain or reduce the loss of
      best-corrected visual acuity

    <description>To assess the efficacy of intravitreal pegaptanib sodium injections in inducing regression of high risk PDR (as determined by percentage of eyes without treatment failure) using standard panretinal photocoagulation (PRP) as the control arm. Treatment failure is defined as:
Development of increased NVD and/or NVE
NVD and/or NVE that is not regressed at least 50% compared to the baseline amount within 3 weeks
Development of significant vitreous hemorrhage that is sufficient in quantity to obscure visualization of the entire macula, optic disc, and the major temporal arcade vessels</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Eligible eyes will have active PDR with high risk characteristics (HRC) as defined by
             the DRS. All eyes must meet at least one or both of the following criteria:

               -  Mild neovascularization of the disc (NVD) of at least 1/4 to 1/3 disc area as
                  shown in standard photograph 10A of the DRS.

               -  Moderate neovascularization of the retina elsewhere (NVE) of at least 1/2 disc
                  area as shown in standard photograph 7 of the DRS.

             and less than or equal to 85 letters (approximately 20/20) by the ETDRS visual acuity
             protocol at the screening visit.

          3. Eyes with mild pre-retinal hemorrhage (PRH) or mild vitreous hemorrhage (VH) that does

          2. Presence of either:

               -  significant epiretinal membranes involving the macula, OR

               -  proliferative diabetic membranes along the major retinal arcades that are
                  extensive enough to cause either:

                    -  significant vitreomacular traction, OR

                    -  significant impairment in visual acuity.

          3. Presence of any tractional retinal detachment.

          4. Severe ischemia involving the foveal avascular zone as determined by fluorescein
             angiography performed at the initial screening visit.

          5. Significant media opacity (due to cornea, anterior chamber, or lens) precluding clear
             visualization of the macula or optic disc.

          6. Presence of neovascular glaucoma with or without hyphema.

          7. Previous treatment with intravitreal steroid injections in the study eye within 6
             months of baseline.

          8. Previous treatment with peribulbar steroid injections in the study eye within 90 days
