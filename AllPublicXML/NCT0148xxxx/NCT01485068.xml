      The purpose of this study is to assess safety and efficacy of the Danubio Paclitaxel Eluting
      Balloon for the treatment of In-Stent Restenosis lesions in native coronary arteries.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The DEBREST clinical trial is a prospective, non-randomized, multicenter, interventional
      study evaluating the investigational Danubio Paclitaxel Eluting Coronary Balloon in patients
      with in-stent restenosis (ISR) lesion(s) with reference vessel diameter ≥2.5 mm and ≤3.5 mm.
      The trial will allow the treatment of up to two ISR (either Bare Metal Stent (BMS) or Drug
      Eluting Stent (DES) ISR) per patient in native coronary arteries with mandatory predilatation
      with a conventional balloon.

      The DEBREST clinical trial will enroll 60 patients. All patients will receive Quantitative
      Coronary Angiography (QCA) before and after Drug-Eluting Balloon (DEB) inflation and at 6
      months follow-up. All patients will have a clinical follow-up at 1, 6 and 12 months.

          2. First ISR after BMS or DES implantation.

          3. Reference diameter &gt; 2.5 and ≤ 3.5mm.

          4. Target lesion length: ≤ 21mm.

          5. Up to three restenotic lesions per patient.

          6. Single restenotic lesion per vessel.

          7. The lesion must be treated with the trial device Danubio.

          8. During the index procedure, in case of

               1. Treatment of a lesion in a vessel other than the target vessel or,

               2. Treatment of a lesion in the target vessel proximal or distal to the target
                  restenotic lesion, The treatment of the non-target lesion must be successfully
