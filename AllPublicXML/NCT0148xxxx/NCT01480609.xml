      This in an open-label, single dose, fixed sequence, two treatment period study enrolling 8
      patients (to obtain 6 evaluable) with end stage renal disease (ESRD) receiving haemodialysis.
      Patients will remain in the unit during each treatment period from admission to the
      collection of the final PK sample. The doses of ezogabine/retigabine in the two treatment
      periods will be separated by at least 7 days.

      Treatment Period 1: Subjects will be admitted on Day -1 when baseline assessments will be
      performed. On Day 1 subjects will receive a single dose of 100mg ezogabine/retigabine
      immediate release (IR) and dialysis will start 4 hours post-dose. Pharmacokinetic (PK)
      samples will be collected up to approximately 68 hours post-dose.

      Samples of dialysate will be collected in 0-1, 1-2, 2-3, and 3-4 hour (if available)
      aliquots, timed from the start of dialysis. The volume of dialysate collected in each aliquot
      will be recorded.

      Four samples of predialyzer (&quot;arterial&quot; line) blood and four samples of postdialyzer
      (&quot;venous&quot; line) blood will be obtained during the haemodialysis procedure at approximately
      one hour intervals starting immediately prior to the start of the procedure and finishing at
      the end of the procedure.

      Subjects will be discharged from the unit following the collection of the last PK sample.

      Treatment Period 2: Subjects will be admitted on Day -1 when baseline assessments will be
      performed. On Day 1 following the completion of their scheduled dialysis session subjects
      will receive a single dose of 100mg ezogabine/retigabine IR. PK samples will be collected up
      to approximately 68 hours post-dose.

      Subjects will be discharged from the unit following the collection of the last PK sample.

      In both treatment periods, PK blood samples will be obtained pre-dose, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5,
      3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 12, 16, 24, 36, 48, 60 and 68 hours (or just prior next dialysis session -
      whichever is sooner) post-dose. Subjects will be discharged after the final post-dose draw.
