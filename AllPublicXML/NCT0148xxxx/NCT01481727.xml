      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of high-intensity non invasive
      mechanical ventilation (during one year to reduce the severity and frequency of acute
      exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (AECOPD) in patients with frequent
      AECOPD (frequent exacerbations defined more two or more AECOPD) and in GOLD IV stage (very
      severe COPD). The design is a randomised, double blind and controled with placebo (sham
      maneuver) clinical trial.

      Background:

        -  There are many previous studies (no controlled trials or observational studies)that
           demonstrated minimal benefits (on gas exchange and marginal effect over exacerbations
           frequency) with the use of non invasive mechanical ventilation, in BiPAP modality with
           IPAP pressures &lt;18H2ocm (low intensity), in COPD patients.

        -  In subsequent years there were controled trials that concluded that there was no
           benefits with the use of non invasive mechanical ventilation on BiPAP mode in COPD
           patients ( It should be mentioned that in most trials were used low inspiratory pressure
           levels, that is called low-intensity non invasive mechanical ventilation).

        -  However, there are other recent studies that described some benefits of high intensity
           Bilevel modality of non invasive mechanical ventilation (inspiratory pressures &gt;18cmH2O)
           specially on gas exchange, quality of life and functional status.

        -  There are some issues that do not yet have a clear answer like the optimal inspiratory
           pressure (IPAP) or the ventilation modality (BIPAP or other) to obtain the maximal
           benefit on COPD patients. Additionally, is not clear also if the use of non invasive
           mechanical ventilation on COPD patients helps to reduce the frequency and severity of
           acute exacerbations of COPD (AECOPD).

      This study have some characteristics that are different to the previous reports:

        -  The inclusion of patients with frequent exacerbations phenotype (and therefore worst
           prognosis patients)that there are no included in previous trials

        -  The intervention maneuver that is bilevel modality of non invasive mechanical
           ventilation at hig-intensity pressure (&gt;18H2Ocm and &lt;24H2Ocm)

        -  The use of placebo maneuver (CPAP &quot;Sham&quot;)

        -  The home titration in three phases, over a week

        -  The long-term use of the intervention and sham maneuver
