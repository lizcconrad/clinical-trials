      The purpose of this study is to gather changes in physiological and biomechanical data such
      as ECG, respiration, and accelerometry data during daily activity and sleep in pediatric and
      adult subjects with epilepsy. Subjects will use a device that enables monitoring of the human
      state in everyday, free-living environments.

    <description>The E-32 study was designed to capture the subject's physiological and biomechanical data such as ECG data and rate, respiratory data and rate, and body orientation, motion and movement (accelerometry) during typical events such as walking, sitting, running and sleeping in order to help build a database of stereotypical human activity.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Subject must be six (6) years of age or older

          2. Subject has a clinical diagnosis of epilepsy

          3. Subject is currently taking at least one antiepileptic medication.

          4. Subject must be in good general health and fully ambulatory.

          5. Subject or guardian must be willing and able to complete informed consent and/or
             assent for children and HIPAA authorization.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Subjects with chest circumference smaller than 29 inches or greater than 47 inches.

          2. Subjects with existing signs of skin irritation, rash, damage or infection on the
             torso that in the opinion of the investigator would prevent the subject's
             participation in the study.

          3. Subjects with a medical condition that in the opinion of the investigator would affect
             his/her ability to participate in the study.

          4. Subjects with implanted defibrillators, pacemakers or neurostimulators (e.g., vagus
             nerve stimulators or pain stimulators).

          5. Subjects who are pregnant or lactating.

          6. Subjects with severe psychiatric disease that in the opinion of the investigator would
             prevent the subject's successful completion of the study.

          7. Subjects 6 to 16 years of age with moderate/severe learning difficulties or those who
             may be at risk of self-harm.

          8. Subjects prescribed drugs specifically for a cardiac or autonomic disorder that in the
             investigator's opinion would affect heart rate response unless the patient has ictal
             tachycardia while taking said drugs. These include, but are not limited to, beta
             adrenergic antagonists (&quot;beta blockers&quot;).

          9. Subjects with cardiovascular arrhythmias or cardiac disease that would preclude the
             ability to detect intrinsic changes in heart rate due to activity, stress, or seizure.
             This would include but not be limited to chronic atrial fibrillation or chronotropic
             incompetence.

         10. Subjects with a history of dependence on alcohol or narcotic drugs within the past 2
             years as defined by DSM IV-R.

         11. Subjects currently participating in another clinical study.
