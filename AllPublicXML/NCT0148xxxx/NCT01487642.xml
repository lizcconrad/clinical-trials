    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the study is to compare the efficacy of four different smoking
      cessation programmes, including a proactive telephone counseling intervention, a reactive
      telephone counseling a and an interactive web-based intervention and (as control) written
      self-help material.

    <textblock>
      Smoking remains the most important threat to public health. The majority of smokers wish to
      quit smoking and every year a substantial part of smokers makes a quit attempt. However, the
      majority of smokers tries to quit unassisted and existing smoking cessation interventions are
      underused. In this study we test the effectiveness of four different smoking cessation
      interventions in a randomized controlled trial. The study provides knowledge on factors
      important for recruitment and gives indication on potential reach of interventions among the
      general population. This knowledge can help us in designing interventions that is both
      effective but also have a high reach in the general population.

    <intervention_name>Standard 15-minute telephone counselling</intervention_name>
    <description>Subjects in arm 1 will benefit from a standard 15-minute telephone counselling session with a professional adviser which resembles a normal call to the national Quit-line. The telephone counselling will be reactive, thus the smoker initiates the call to a designated number to receive advice and information based on the needs and wishes of this particular smoker. Participants can receive self-help materials and information on other smoking cessation services if they wish.</description>

    <description>subjects in arm 2 will benefit from of five 15-minute calls from a professional adviser. Similar to the standard reactive telephone counselling, the proactive counselling will be a personal discussion and advice based on the needs and wishes of the particular participant. Together, the participant and adviser will determine a cessation date and schedule one call 3-7 days before the cessation date, one call immediately after the cessation date and three additional calls on days 3, 10 and 24, respectively, post-cessation.</description>
