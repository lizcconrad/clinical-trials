  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study was to assess the pigmentation in the trabecular meshwork of
      patients who had been treated for at least 2 years with TRAVATAN compared with patients
      without exposure (or less than 1 month) to a prostaglandin analogue (PGA).

    <description>A minimum of two punches were used to remove tissue to form a sclerostomy. Tissue removed by the punch was collected for analysis. Alternatively, the tissue was collected by block excision of the meshwork with scissors at the time of sclerostomy.</description>
