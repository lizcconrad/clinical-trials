    <textblock>
      The primary objective:

      -To assess the efficacy of TCH and TCHL in neo-adjuvant treatment of HER-2 positive breast
      cancer, using pathological complete response (pCR) as the primary endpoint (Phase II).

      Secondary objectives:

        -  To assess the clinical response rate and overall response rate for docetaxel and
           carboplatin with trastuzumab alone or trastuzumab combined with lapatinib in HER-2
           positive breast cancer.

        -  To assess the relationship between drug exposure and adverse events.

        -  To examine potential molecular and pharmacological markers of response to trastuzumab
           and lapatinib

        -  To assess Disease-free Survival (DFS) and Overall Survival (OS)

        -  To determine if prophylactic Loperamide significantly reduces the number of diarrhoea
           -related adverse events.

                  based on the largest tumour.

               -  Patients presenting with bilateral breast cancer are not eligible

          5. Tumour HER2/neu positive (3+ by IHC or fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH)

          9. The effects of lapatinib on the developing human foetus at the recommended therapeutic
             dose are unknown. For this reason, women of child-bearing potential and men must agree

             abstinence or a vasectomy partner) prior to study entry and for the duration of study
             participation. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while

          2. Prior taxanes

          3. Radiotherapy (Except for radiotherapy localised to radiotherapy to a primary squamous
             or basal cell skin cancer).

          4. Patients with metastatic disease (M1).

          5. Concurrent therapy with any other non-protocol anti-cancer therapy

          6. History of any other malignancy within the past 5 years, with the exception of
             non-melanoma skin cancer, in situ carcinoma of the breast (ductal or lobular) or

             requiring active therapy.

         13. Active, uncontrolled infection requiring parenteral antimicrobials or any condition
             requiring maintenance therapeutic (i.e. non-replacement) doses of corticosteroids.

         14. The presence of any other medical or psychiatric disorder that, in the opinion of the
             treating physician, would contraindicate the use of the drugs in this protocol or
             place the patient at undue risk for treatment complications

         15. Male patients.

         16. Patients with known hypersensitivity to Chinese hamster ovary products or other
             recombinant human or humanized antibodies and/or known hypersensitivity to any of the
             study drugs or their ingredients (eg, polysorbate 80 in docetaxel)

         17. Pregnant women are excluded from this study because lapatinib is member of the
             4-anilinoquinazoline class of kinase inhibitors with the potential for teratogenic or
             abortifacient effects. Because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse
             events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with lapatinib,
             breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated with lapatinib

         18. HIV-positive patients receiving combination anti-retroviral therapy are excluded from
             the study because of possible pharmacokinetic interactions with lapatinib. Appropriate
             studies will be undertaken in patients receiving combination anti-retroviral therapy
             when indicated.

         19. Patients with GI tract disease resulting in an inability to take oral medication,
             malabsorption syndrome, a requirement for IV alimentation, prior surgical procedures
             affecting absorption, uncontrolled inflammatory GI disease (e.g., Crohn's, ulcerative
             colitis).

         20. Concomitant requirement for medication classified as CYP3A4 inducers or inhibitors as
             defined in Table 2.

         21. Have current active hepatic or biliary disease (with exception of patients with
             Gilbert's syndrome, asymptomatic gallstones, liver metastases or stable chronic liver
             disease per investigator assessment)
