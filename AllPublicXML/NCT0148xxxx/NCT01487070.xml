  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Primary objective of this trial will be to evaluate the safety and efficacy of intravitreal
      injections of Macugen (pegaptanib sodium) when given at least 7-14 days prior to vitrectomy
      in subjects with tractional retinal detachment (with or withoutmacular involvement) secondary
      to proliferative diabetic retinopathy.

      Secondary objective is to evaluate regression of neovascularization and progression of
      macular traction utilizing OCT and fundus photographs.

    <description>Pegaptanib sodium drug substance is a pegylated (40 kDa branched PEG molecule consisting of two 20 kDa PEG arms) anti-VEGF aptamer. It is formulated in phosphate buffered saline at pH 6-7. Sodium hydroxide or hydrochloric acid may be added for pH adjustment.
Pegaptanib sodium is formulated at 0.3mg/90Âµl and presented in a USP Type I glass barrel syringe sealed with a bromobutyl rubber stopper. A 30-guage needle is fixed to the end of the syringe after removal of the rubber stopper. The syringe comes in a sealed foil pouch, and the 30-gauge needle is added to the sterile injection field separately. The drug product is preservative-free and intended for single use by intravitreous injection only.</description>
