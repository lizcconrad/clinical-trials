  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will inform the field about underlying mechanisms associated with infant sleep
      problems and will deepen the understanding of the intervention process. The study will
      provide detailed information on the intervention process itself and will explore how
      behavioral sleep interventions affect broader infant outcome.
