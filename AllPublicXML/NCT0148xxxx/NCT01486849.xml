      A Phase II, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled ascending dose titration study to
      evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamic effects of multiple
      ascending doses of CK-2017357 to an individual patient maximum tolerated dose (MTD), using a
      within-patient twice daily (BID) dose-titration regimen in ALS patients on 50 mg riluzole
      once daily (QD).

    <textblock>
      Patients will be randomized to one of two dosing groups, active CK-2017357 or placebo, in a
      3:1 ratio. Prior to study drug dosing, patients will be required to decrease their riluzole
      dose to 50 mg QD for 7 days; after this 7 day period patients will either receive placebo or
      start the titration on active CK-2017357 while continuing to take riluzole at 50 mg QD.

      Potential patients will be screened to assess their eligibility to enter the study within 21
      days prior to Day -7, when they will begin taking riluzole at the decreased dose of 50 mg QD.
      Patients will be randomized in a 3:1 ratio to CK-2017357 (Group 1) or placebo (Group 2). On
      Day 1, patients will begin taking a total daily dose of 250 mg (125 mg BID) of CK-2017357 or
      matching placebo tablets BID for 7 days. Then they will take a total daily dose of 375 mg
      (125 mg morning [AM] and 250 mg evening [PM]) of CK-2017357 or matching placebo tablets BID
      for 7 days, and finally, they will take a total daily dose of 500 mg (250 mg BID) of
      CK-2017357 or matching placebo tablets BID for 7 days. A final dose of 250 mg of CK-2017357
      or placebo will be taken in the morning on Day 22 at the study site.

      Dose-escalation of CK-2017357 or placebo may be stopped, or the dose reduced to a lower
      level, based on tolerability. All patients who return to a lower dose will stay on that dose
      for the remainder of the study.

      Patients will remain on the decreased dose of riluzole until the follow-up visit
      approximately 7 days after Day 22.
