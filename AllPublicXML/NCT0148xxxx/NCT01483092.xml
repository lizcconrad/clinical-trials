  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Prebiotics are non-digestible food ingredients that beneficially affect the host by
      selectively stimulating the growth or activity of species in the colon that can improve host
      health.

      Inulin-type fructans (inulin and oligofructose) are natural food ingredients with prebiotic
      activity. Fermentation of inulin and oligofructose by lactic acid producing bacteria results
      in an increase in bacterial biomass and the production of SCFA (acetate, propionate and
      butyrate), lactic acid and the gases CO2 and H2. They are naturally present in significant
      amounts in several vegetables such as garlic, artichoke, onion, asparagus, leek and wheat
      (1-4%). Based on consumption data, the daily intake of inulin in Europe varies between 3.2
      and 11.3g mainly from wheat (2-7.8g/d). However, this might have changed recently since
      inulin and oligofructose are used by the food industry either as sucrose and fat replacements
      or due to their health benefits for the human host.

      Several human absorption studies evaluated the effect of inulin/oligofructose on mineral
      absorption. It was shown that calcium and magnesium absorption was positively influenced.
      Until now, the positive effect on iron absorption was only shown in animals. The influence on
      human iron absorption was investigated twice. Both studies reported no effect of
      inulin/oligofructose on iron absorption, but this was most likely due to poorly conceived
      study designs.

      The aim of the present study is to demonstrate that inulin consumption over several weeks can
      lead to enhanced iron absorption in humans under optimized conditions.

    <description>Concentration of bifidobacteria, total bacteria, SCFA (acetate, propionate, butyrate, formate), lactate, and pH will be measured (in the fecal samples of study participants) and compared between baseline, inulin period and placebo period. The pH of fecal sqamples will be measured using a digital pH meter. HPLC measurements will be done for the determination of SCFA and lactate. DNA amplification and detection will be done by quantitative PCR.</description>
