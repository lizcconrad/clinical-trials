  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A Malaysian company by name Formedic Technologies SDN BHD has devised a hand held machine
      which is supposed to mimic the chest percussion performed by professional physiotherapist to
      mobilize sputum through the respiratory passage.

      The aim of this study is to compare the effectiveness and safety of this mechanical
      percussion device in the treatment of airway clearance with conventional chest physiotherapy
      carried out by qualified physiotherapists in patients suffering from bronchiectasis or
      Chronic obstructive Pulmonary disease (COPD).

      This study will compare the amount of sputum expectorated during the two procedures and not
      intended to look at the clinical improvement of the patient.

    <description>The patients will be instructed to cough out the sputum into a preweighed container during the 15 minutes of the procedure(Manual or mechanical percussion)and 5 minutes after the procedure.Container will be weighed to get the wet weight of the sputum then will be dried in a laboratory oven at 60degree c for 48 hours and weighed again to get the dry weight of the sputum</description>
