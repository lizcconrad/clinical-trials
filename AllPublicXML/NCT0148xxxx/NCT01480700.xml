  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is to determine the impact of the consumption of eggs rich in lutein/zeaxanthin
      from lucerne protein concentrate and DHA from microalgae on the plasma levels of these
      compounds but also on the macular pigment optical density, whose elevation may be beneficial
      in the prevention of Age-related Macular Degeneration (AMD).
