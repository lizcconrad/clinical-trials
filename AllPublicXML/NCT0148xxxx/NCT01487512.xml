  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the pharmacokinetics of OROS Hydromorphone in
      healthy adult Taiwanese participants after oral administration of 4 different dose strengths
      of 8, 16, 32 and 64 mg under fasted conditions.

    <textblock>
      This is a single-center, randomized (study drug assigned by chance like flipping a coin),
      open-label (all people involved know the identity of the intervention), 4-way crossover
      (participants receive different interventions sequentially during the trial) study in healthy
      adult Taiwanese participants. All participants will be randomly assigned to 1 of the 4
      different possible treatment sequences and will receive all treatments in the order specified
      by the randomization schedule. The study consists of a screening phase, an open-label
      treatment phase consisting of 4 single-dose treatment periods, and end-of-study or withdrawal
      assessments. During the open-label treatment periods, the participants will stay in the
      center until completion of the 72-hour pharmacokinetics [PK] (how the drug is absorbed in the
      body, distributed within the body, and how it is removed from the body over time) blood
      sample on Day 4. A 7- to 14-day washout period (period when receiving no treatment) will
      separate the open-label treatment periods. The safety and tolerability will be evaluated over
      the investigated dose range. The duration of participation in the study for an individual
      participant will be approximately 12 weeks.
