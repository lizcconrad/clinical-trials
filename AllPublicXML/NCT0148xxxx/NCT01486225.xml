  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to identify the nature of skin lesions that develop on contact
      with the grip-top bands of medical compression stockings, which are composed mainly of
      silicone.

      To identify the nature of lesions the investigator will analyse results of the biopsys,
      microbiological analyses, dermatological tests.
