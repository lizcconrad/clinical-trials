    <textblock>
      New minimally invasive surgical treatments are often outpatient procedures with low
      complication rates, promising fast recovery. The traditional physician-reported outcomes such
      as complication rates, blood loss, and hospital stay are not useful to guide treatment
      recommendations for one or the other minimally invasive procedure. This study aims to apply
      patient-reported outcomes developed within the NIH framework for cancer research and chronic
      disease treatment to the comparative effectiveness research in minimally invasive procedures
      for benign disease.

    <textblock>
      To establish a pathway for comparative effectiveness using patient reported outcomes in
      minimally invasive surgery, we propose to use a readily available and easily reproducible
      model: cholecystectomy. Each year in the United States, approximately 750,000 patients
      undergo a cholecystectomy. Patients clearly prefer the laparoscopic approach over the open
      procedure to abdominal surgery. Initial survey data suggest that patients may also prefer
      even less invasive approaches.

      Currently, the standard operative procedure for a patient with symptomatic gallstone disease
      is a laparoscopic cholecystectomy performed under general anesthesia with four small
      abdominal incisions. Although postoperative pain and cardiopulmonary and wound complications
      are much less compared to open cholecystectomy, considerable cost is generated from lost
      productivity in days off of work after the surgical procedure related in part to pain and the
      physiologic response to the stress of the operative procedure. Anecdotal data suggest that
      fewer incisions, especially fewer transabdominal incisions, translate into less pain, less
      need for narcotic pain medication and faster recovery, but randomized trial data are needed.
      We propose to compare the effectiveness of the novel single-port cholecystectomy with
      laparoscopic cholecystectomy, the current standard of care.

    <description>The investigators will utilize the Patient-Reported Outcomes from the VAS to measure changes from Baseline to day 1 post OP. A 15-mm difference on a 100-mm visual analog scale with a standard deviation of 25 mm at any time point will constitute a clinically relevant difference.</description>

PROMIS Global Health Short Form and LASA are validated assessment tools. A 2-point difference is considered the minimally important difference in chronic disease for an item in the PROMIS and LASA tools.</description>

    <description>Frequently used biomarkers are inflammatory cytokines, specifically the serum levels of the early response pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF-Î±, Interleukin 1b, Interleukin 6 and Interleukin 8. We will measure and analyze these cytokine levels at set time points to determine if any subtle difference in the levels between the two surgical approaches is significant.</description>

    <description>In brief, a flexible, multi-sleeve 15-mm trocar designed specifically for single-port cholecystectomy will be inserted at the umbilicus via a 15-mm single incision. An additional 2-mm grasping device may be introduced in the right upper quadrant for retraction if necessary; this device is placed percutaneously without the need for a trocar. A 5-mm laparoscopic clip applier will be introduced through the periumbilical trocar to ligate the cystic artery and the cystic duct. The gallbladder will be removed through the umbilical port, adequate hemostasis is ensured, the umbilical trocar removed, and the single operative site will be closed and sterile dressings applied (four Band-Aids).</description>

    <description>The control procedure for the research practicum is a four-trocar laparoscopic cholecystectomy, the current gold-standard operation. This approach utilizes a 10-mm trocar placed at the umbilicus via a 15-mm incision and three separate subcostal 5-mm trocars placed via separate 5-mm incisions. The gallbladder will be removed through the umbilical trocar site. On occasion, this incision needs to be enlarged to accommodate removal of the gallbladder. Trocar sites will be closed and sterile dressings applied (four Band-Aids).</description>

    <description>In brief, a flexible, multi-sleeve 15-mm trocar designed specifically for single-port cholecystectomy will be inserted at the umbilicus via a 15-mm single incision. This trocar permits simultaneous introduction of multiple instruments, including a 5-mm flexible-tip laparoscope. Standard 5-mm instruments will be used for retraction and dissection. An additional 2-mm grasping device may be introduced in the right upper quadrant for retraction if necessary. A 5-mm laparoscopic clip applier will be introduced through the periumbilical trocar to ligate the cystic artery and the cystic duct.
