    <textblock>
      This research is being done to study the effect of incorporating acupuncture into the
      management of migraines. The primary aim is to determine in a randomized, controlled study
      whether individuals experiencing migraines have fewer occurrences and less intense migraines
      when acupuncture is integrated with nonprescription pharmacological treatment.
      Nonprescription pharmacological treatment in this study refers to the use of the following
      over the counter medications: Aspirin, Ibuprofen, Naproxen, Acetaminophen (with or without
      caffeine). Aspirin, Ibuprofen, and Naproxen are members of a class of drugs known as
      non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or NSAIDs.

      70 men and women between the ages of 18-65 diagnosed with migraines by a medical doctor.
      Participants must be using only nonprescription medication to treat their head pain.

      Once initial eligibility has been determined and informed consent obtained, a Traditional
      Chinese Medicine (TCM) differential diagnosis will be carried out to determine the underlying
      cause of the migraines experienced by the participant. If the migraines are due to Liver Qi
      stagnation with Liver Yang rising they will be eligible for participation in the study.
      Eligible participants will be randomly assigned to one of two groups: Group 1 will continue
      taking their current nonprescription migraine medication as needed and will receive
      acupuncture once a week for 8 weeks. Group 2 will continue with their current nonprescription
      migraine medication as needed but will not receive acupuncture. The same set of predetermined
      acupuncture points will be used at each session.

      All participants will complete a daily headache and medication use diary for four weeks on
      two separate occasions. In addition all participants will complete the Headache Impact Test
      (HIT-6) survey on three separate occasions.
