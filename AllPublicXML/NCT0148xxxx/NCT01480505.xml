      Purpose:

      To assess the functional and anatomical outcome of primary vitrectomy without scleral
      buckling for rhegmatogenous retinal detachment (RRD) in highly myopic eyes with axial length
      over 30 mm.

      Methods Design: Retrospective single center series. Setting: University Hospital. Patients:
      High myopic patients treated with primary vitrectomy without scleral buckling for a
      rhegmatogenous retinal detachment.

      Outcome measures: Anatomical success rate with complete reattachment of the retina without
      silicone oil tamponade and postoperative best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA).

    <measure>Assessing the functional and anatomical outcome of primary vitrectomy in Rhegmatogenous retinal detachment in highly myopic eyes</measure>
    <description>To assess by visual acuity measurements, fundus ophthalmoscopy and OCT scans the functional and anatomical outcome in patients with higly myopic eyes whom we performed primary vitrectomy without scleral buckling for rhegmatogenous retinal detachment (RRD)in comparison to standard surgical technics wich consist on scleral buckling and pars plana vitrectomy with fluid gas exchange.</description>

    <intervention_name>Pars plana vitrectomy with gas tamponade</intervention_name>
    <description>A standard three-port 20 Gauge vitrectomy under a wide-angle-viewing contact lens was performed. Peripheral vitreous shaving was completed under slit-lamp illumination without contact lens by gentle scleral indentation. Posterior hyaloid detachment was checked and completed if necessary without dye. The epiretinal membrane removal or internal limiting membrane (ILM) peeling was performed if necessary. In general this latter procedure was not conducted for RD secondary to peripheral retinal tears without any sign of PVR or ERM but was done in almost all cases related to posterior break.
Subretinal fluid was aspirated through the retinal tear, the MH, the PVT or through a retinotomy to obtain a complete peroperative retinal reattachment.</description>
