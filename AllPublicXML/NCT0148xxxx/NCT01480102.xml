    <textblock>
      This study will compare post-operative pain levels in patients who receive paravertebral
      block prior to Percutaneous Nephrolithotomy (PCNL) surgery versus those who do not receive
      the block. We hypothesize that patients who receive the block will have lower post-operative
      pain scores and require less narcotics.

      The strategies used to manage nephrolithiasis including medical expulsive therapy,
      extracorporeal shock wave (ESWL), ureteroscopy, open surgery and percutaneous nephrolithotomy
      (PCNL). PCNL in an inpatient procedure performed in two steps. Step 1, is the placement of a
      drainage line (nephrostomy tube) from the back into the collecting system of the kidney. This
      step is typically performed by interventional radiologists under conscious sedation. Step 2
      is performed by urologists and involves dilating the tract of the nephrostomy tube, placement
      of an access sheath and actual removal of the stone using endoscopic equipment. The minimally
      invasive approach of PCNL is well accepted to be as effective as open procedures for stone
      removal with less morbidity. Post-operative pain management remains challenging and can lead
      to extended hospital stays.

      This randomized, double-blinded trial designed to assess the effects of paravertebral block
      on intra-operative and post-operative pain control.

    <description>All patients will receive the same post-operative pain control, which does not deviate from our standard protocol for patients receiving PCNL. All patients will be immediately given a PCA in recovery. Patients allergic to morphine/dilaudid will be given a narcoticopioid substitute (that will be converted to morphine equivalents for the purpose of the study). Nurses will be allowed to administer IV boluses of morphine PRN for inadequate pain control. If four boluses did not yield adequate analgesia, fentayl 50mcg will be used until adequate pain control is achieved.</description>
