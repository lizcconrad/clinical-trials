      The primary objective of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of STA-2 in the management
      of chronic stable angina. The secondary objectives of this study were to evaluate the safety
      and pharmacological activities of STA-2 in the management of chronic stable angina. This was
      a multi-center, double-blind, randomized, parallel-group, placebo-controlled study of STA-2
      in the management of chronic stable angina. The study period for each patient was
      approximately 7 weeks, during which the patient undergone one-week screening and washout
      period, followed by 6 weeks of treatment. Each patient was required to make a total of 5
      visits. Primary Efficacy Endpoint: Change in total exercise time.

      After washout, patients who met the inclusion and exclusion criteria were randomly assigned
      either to the treatment or control group. The respective regimens were:

      Treatment group:

      STA-2 250 mg capsule, each containing 100 mg green tea polyphenols, 2 capsules ter in die
      (t.i.d.=three times daily) for 6 weeks, to be administered in a non-fasting state.

      Control group:

      Placebo 250 mg capsule, 2 capsules t.i.d. (three times daily) for 6 weeks, to be administered
      in a non-fasting state.

    <measure>Change in Total Exercise Time</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline (visit 2) and week 6 (visit 5)</time_frame>
    <description>Total exercise time was defined as the maximal duration of exercise which was performed by the patient in the setting of exercise tolerance tests (ETT). A 12-lead electrocardiogram (EKG) was used to continuously monitor vital signs. Patients were asked to complete 9-12 minutes of exercise or to exercise until 85% of the maximum predicted heart rate was reached. All exercise tolerance tests used a standard Bruce multistage exercise test protocol.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in Time to 1mm ST-segment Depression During Exercise Tolerance Testing (ETT).</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline (visit 2) through week 6 (visit 5)</time_frame>
    <description>Time to 1 millimeter (mm) ST-segment depression was recorded from Electrocardiogram (EKG) during exercise tolerance testing (ETT). The 1mm ST-segment depression may be seen in typical angina patient. It means the ST segment of EKG wave drops at least 1 mm compared to the beginning of EKG measurement.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Consumption of Short-acting Nitrates</measure>
    <time_frame>from baseline (visit 2) through week 6 (visit 5)</time_frame>
    <description>The consumption of short-acting nitrates from baseline (V2, Day 0) to all visits [V3 (Day 14±2), V4 (Day 28±2), V5 (Day 42±2)]according to patient's diary.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Rate-pressure Product</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline (visit 2) to week 6 (visit 5)</time_frame>
    <description>Rate-pressure product was defined as the product of heart rate and systolic blood pressure, which was measured both at rest and at peak of exercise.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Pharmacological Parameters</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline (visit 2) to week 6 (visit 5)</time_frame>
    <description>The level of oxidative stress parameters (isoprostane, homocysteine), homeostasis parameters (PAI-I activity), inflammatory markers (fibrinogen, hsCRP, soluble CD40 ligand) and cardiac enzymes (CPK-MB and LDH), were measured to assess the pharmacological activity of STA-2.</description>

        <title>Change in Total Exercise Time</title>
        <description>Total exercise time was defined as the maximal duration of exercise which was performed by the patient in the setting of exercise tolerance tests (ETT). A 12-lead electrocardiogram (EKG) was used to continuously monitor vital signs. Patients were asked to complete 9-12 minutes of exercise or to exercise until 85% of the maximum predicted heart rate was reached. All exercise tolerance tests used a standard Bruce multistage exercise test protocol.</description>
