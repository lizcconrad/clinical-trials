      The purpose of this study is to compare the exercise capacity and pulmonary function test
      parameters of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) patients who underwent usual care
      with and without pulmonary daoyin therapy of China in community.

      This is a multicenter, randomized, none-blind, controlled study to evaluate the effect of
      pulmonary daoyin therapy in moderate to very severe COPD subjects. Following a 14 day run-in
      period, approximately 464 subjects will be randomly assigned to none-blind treatment for 3
      months. The primary measure of efficacy is the Exercise Capacity (6MWD) and spirometric
      values (e.g. FEV1). Secondary efficacy measures include Dyspnea (MMRC), Quality of life
      (CAT,SF-36), frequency of exacerbations. Safety will be assessed through the collection of
      adverse events. There will be a total of 4 study visits (randomization, and after 1,2,3
      months of treatment).
