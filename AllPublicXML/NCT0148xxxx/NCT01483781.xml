    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to evaluate the effects of canagliflozin on plasma volume and
      renal parameters in patients with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus who are currently taking metformin
      and being treated for high blood pressure.

    <textblock>
      This is a double-blind (neither the patient or study staff will know the identity of the
      treatment assigned) in patients with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) who have inadequate
      glycemic (blood sugar) control on metformin monotherapy (metformin taken alone for control of
      T2DM) and who are currently being treated for hypertension (high blood pressure) with agents
      called angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) or angiotensin receptor blockers
      (ARBs). In the study, patients will be randomized (assigned by chance) to receive treatment
      with canagliflozin or a placebo (a treatment identical in appearance to canagliflozin but
      does not contain active drug) for 12 weeks. During the 12-week treatment period, patients
      will also take metformin at a dose of at least 1500 mg/day in addition to their prescribed
      ACEI or ARB for hypertension. Patients will participate in the study for up to approximately
      22 weeks.
