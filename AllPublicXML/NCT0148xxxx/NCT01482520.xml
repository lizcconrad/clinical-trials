  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      All Hepatocellular carcinoma and Renal cell carcinoma patients who receive molecular targeted
      therapy will be candidates for the study.

      No additional treatment or intervention will be conducted except for blood sampling that will
      be limited to one time only.

      Blood samples (10 cc in volume) will be collected from all study participants once they
      provided written informed consent form. DNA will be extracted from peripheral blood samples
      using DNA isolation kit.

        All Hepatocellular carcinoma and Renal cell carcinoma patients who receive molecular
        targeted therapy will be candidates for the study.

        Once the patient signed written informed consent, two bottles of 5 cc blood will be drawn
        and subsequently extracted DNA and serum will be stored until genetic analysis.
