  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Despite decades of research, the mortality in acute lung injury remains very high and
      treatment options are very limited. Given these facts, the best treatment modality may be in
      prevention of this lethal syndrome.

      Historically, imaging has played a crucial role in understanding ALI. The appearance of chest
      radiography is one of the consensus criteria in defining ALI, and commuted tomography (CT)
      scans further advanced the understanding of the pathoanatomy of ALI. While valuable, these
      imaging modalities are nonspecific and do not incorporate functional cellular physiology.

      PET imaging measures concentrations of radioisotopes in the body. By embedding in, but not
      altering molecules, the natural fate of these tracers can be studied with PET imaging.
      Advances in the understanding of ALI include blood flow distribution, as well as the response
      to alveolar recruitment maneuvers and prone positioning. Not all patients who are receiving
      mechanical ventilation develop ALI. Inflammation in the lungs is known to play a key early
      role in the development and progression of ALI. Secondary to inflammation, the lungs develop
      edema and do not exchange oxygen as well. This early inflammation is in part driven by a
      specific type of immune cell called the neutrophil. These cells seem to travel and become
      sequestered in the lung- they are &quot;recruited&quot; to the lung during this inflammatory stage.
      When there, these neutrophils release inflammatory substances which are integral in the
      development of ALI. Neutrophils use primarily glucose as a fuel source. The radio isotope
      [18F]Fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)is a glucose analog and therefore taken up/ingested by the
      neutrophils as a part of their normal metabolism. Because of this fact, positron emission
      tomography (PET) using the radio isotope [18F]FDG is a highly sensitive marker to look at the
      recruitment of neutrophils to the lung, therefore quantifying the degree of pulmonary
      inflammation prior to the development of ALI.

      The investigators seek to examine the relationship of pulmonary inflammation in patients at
      risk for ALI, but without clinical evidence of the syndrome. The investigators seek to enroll
      ten patients in a pilot trial.

    <description>PET-CT imaging with [18F]FDG will be performed within 24 hours of admission to the ICU. All patients imaged will be those remaining on mechanical ventilation at the time of PET imaging.
A low-dose CT scan (50 effective mAs) will be obtained with placement of the participant such that the lungs are centered within the field of view. After completing the transmission scan, 10 mCi of [18F]FDG will be injected intravenously at the start of a 60-minute dynamic scan acquisition and the intravenous (IV) catheter flushed with 10 ml saline. Imaging will be obtained with the following framing schedule: 24 5-sec, 6 3-minute and 8 5-minute frames.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Adults patients (age ≥ 18) presenting to the SICU after ≥ 5 hours of mechanical
             ventilation in the OR or ED, without clinical evidence of ALI, and LIPS &gt; 4 or &lt; 4.

          -  Able to be positioned supine within the PET/CT scanner for ~1.25 hours

          -  Has legally authorized representative (LAR) available and willing to give informed
             consent, or is able to give informed consent prior to initiation of mechanical
             ventilation

          -  BMI &lt; 35

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Established ALI by accepted clinical criteria.

          -  Organ transplant recipient

          -  Treatment with immunosuppressive/immune-modulating medications

          -  Current corticosteroid treatment

          -  Chronic pulmonary or nonpulmonary inflammatory diseases

             criteria). Patient is placed in the supine position for a minimum of 30 minutes, and
             on mechanical ventilator settings that will be in place for the duration of the
             FDG-PET study. The patient is deemed unsafe for travel if oxygen requirement increases
             or any hemodynamic instability ensues (such as increasing vasopressor requirements).
