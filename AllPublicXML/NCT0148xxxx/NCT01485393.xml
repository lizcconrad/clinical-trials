    <description>Sleep quality will be assessed by both objective and subjective measures. The objective measures will comprise of total sleep time, number of awakenings overnight, sleep latency, normal sleep architecture on EEG. Subjective measures will utilize a post sleep questionnaire to assess the subjects feelings of being well rested.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Primary Inclusion Criteria for &quot;Insomniac&quot; subjects:

             initiating or maintaining sleep that is not accounted for by another sleep disorder,
             neurologic or psychiatric disorder or substance or medication.

          2. Subject will be required to not be on any current pharmacological sleep disorder
             treatment.

          3. Between the ages of 18 and 35 years.

          4. Not taking any prescription medications that alter sleep, cognitive functions, or
             both.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Primary Exclusion Criteria for &quot;Healthy&quot; control subjects:

          1. Abnormal sleep habits:

                  objectively assessed by wrist actigraphy measured for a 1-week duration prior to
                  the first study night.

          2. A sleep latency greater than 60 minutes, greater than 3 awakenings per night. This
             will also be objectively assessed by wrist actigraphy.

          3. A score greater than or equal to 10 on the Epworth Sleepiness Scale.

          4. Takes medication that alters sleep, cognitive function, or both.
