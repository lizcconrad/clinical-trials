    <measure>Emotion regulation</measure>
    <time_frame>8-weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Study participants will do an emotion regulation task while they are in the MRI scanner. We will assess brain activity and skin conductance during the task. Changes in these measures will be assessed before and after enrollment in the stress reduction program</description>

    <description>We are comparing 2 well-studied approaches to stress reduction. All participants will receive stress reduction instructions that have already been proven to effectively reduce stress. Our goal is to compare the neural mechanisms associated with both approaches.</description>
