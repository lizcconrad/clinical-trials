      Hypothesis: Novice trainees will achieve significantly higher clinical competence and patient
      satisfaction scores with the use of warm water infusion method when compared with traditional
      air insufflation

      Primary outcome: adenoma detection rate

      Secondary outcomes: (1) independent cecal intubation rate, (2) trainer assessment of
      trainee's colonoscopy skills, (3) trainee's assessment of clinical confidence, (4) procedural
      medication requirement, (5) patient pain level during procedure, (6) patient satisfaction at
      procedure completion, and (7) patient willingness to repeat procedure'

      Specific Aim: To demonstrate the stated hypothesis via above outcome measures. The long term
      goal is to provide evidence to influence other training institutions to consider education in
      the warm water infusion method'

      Study Design: Prospective randomized cross-over study in a university based setting
      (University of California Davis, Sacramento, California) with a diverse patient population.

      Participants: Total of 6 first year gastroenterology trainees (3 enrollees per year from July
      2011 to July 2012)

      Recruitment: Trainees' names and contact information will be acquired via the program
      director. They will be contacted in person on the first day of their fellowship orientation
      and provided information regarding the study.

      Randomization: A sealed envelope containing the randomized method (conventional air
      insufflation or warm water infusion) will be opened at the time of signed consent for study
      participation.

      Cross-over Design: Trainees will perform colonoscopies using the randomized method with a
      dedicated attending physician who uses air and/or water method as part of standard clinical
      practice for 6 months, at which point they will cross-over to the alternate method of
      colonoscopy with another dedicated attending for the remaining 6 months of their first year
      of fellowship.

      Air Insufflation Method:

      The minimal amount of air will be used during insertion to open the lumen. Minimal amounts of
      water (10 to 50 mL) at room temperature will be used for washing of residual feces. If
      insertion is hindered by scope looping, attempts at loop reduction will be made. If
      advancement does not occur within 3 to 5 minutes, an assistant will provide abdominal
      compression, followed by changing the patient's position to facilitate passage of the
      colonoscope. Cecal intubation will be suggested by identification of the appendiceal orifice
      and ileocecal valve or intubation of the terminal ileum.

      Warm Water Infusion Method:

      As first described by Dr. Felix W. Leung, the maneuvers can be summarized as warm water
      infusion in lieu of air insufflation combined with suction removal of all residual colonic
      air and residual feces by water exchange. Because insufflated air could lengthen the colon
      and exaggerate angulations at the flexures making insertion more difficult, the air pump will
      be turned off before insertion of the colonoscope into the rectum to avoid accidental
      insufflation of air. Further minimization of angulations at the flexures can be achieved by
      suction removal of all encountered residual air. Warm water (at 36-37ºC) maintained using a
      water bath and heat saver envelop will be infused intermittently using an Olympus OFP
      peristaltic flushing pump via an EndoGator auxiliary water port connector and disposable
      water bottle system for Olympus scopes. The minimum amount of water needed to distend the
      colon and open the lumen will be used during scope insertion. When the luminal water becomes
      turbid due to residual feces, the discolored water will be suctioned and replaced by clean
      water until the lumen is visualized again. If advancement does not occur within 3 to 5
      minutes, an assistant will provide abdominal compression, followed by changing the patient's
      position to facilitate passage of the colonoscope. Cecal intubation will be suggested by
      appropriate movement of the endoscopic image on the monitor screen when the right lower
      quadrant is palpated or the appendiceal orifice is visualized under water. The cecum will
      then be distended by air to confirm visualization of the ileocecal valve and appendiceal
      orifice. No specific limit will be set for the volume of water to be used.

      Colonoscopy Procedures:

      Trainees randomized to either use of conventional air insufflation or warm water infusion
      method will be performing colonoscopies with a dedicated endoscopy attending during their
      half-day weekly outpatient endoscopy clinics (for which main indications for colonoscopy will
      be screening or surveillance) for each 6-month study period. Three faculty
      gastroenterologists will be participating as dedicated research personnel.

      Patients will be monitored in a standard fashion (including regular nursing assessments of
      vital signs and discomfort). The sedation nurse will administer medications during the
      procedure according to patient pain levels (0=none to 10=most severe) assessed every 3-5
      minute intervals or at any time the patient appears to be in discomfort. Standard incremental
      doses of medications (using either meperidine 25mg or fentanyl 25 mcg and midazolam 1mg) will
      be offered to the patient when the pain level is ≥ 2. The nurse will record procedural times
      (start time, cecal intubation time, and end time in minutes), medications administered (for
      pre-procedural sedation, from procedure start to cecal intubation, and during withdrawal
      period from cecum to across anus), and attending involvement (hands-on assistance or
      take-over).

      An attending dedicated to colonoscopy training will be present for the entire duration of the
      procedure. Cecum is considered reached by the attending if clear-cut cecal landmarks are
      identified (appendiceal orifice, ileocecal valve, or intubation of the terminal ileum). In
      concordance with prior studies, attending endoscopists will allow trainees 20 minutes to
      reach the cecum, provided the examination is progressing in a safe manner and the patient is
      comfortable. If advancement does not occur within 3 to 5 minutes, an assistant will provide
      abdominal compression, followed by changing the patient's position to facilitate passage of
      the colonoscope. If the trainee has not reached the cecum by 20 minutes, the instructor will
      take over until the cecum is reached. The instructor will take over sooner than this if the
      trainee cannot advance the colonoscope for 5 minutes at the same site, or if it is judged
      that patient tolerance is becoming a factor. For both the air and water methods, unlimited
      verbal instruction will be allowed so that the instructor may guide the trainee with
      descriptions of maneuvers as if he/she were performing the procedure. The instructor will not
      provide hands-on assistance until either the trainee stated that he or she had reached the
      cecum, 20 minutes had passed, or it was necessary for the instructor to take over sooner than
      20 minutes for one of the reasons stated above.

      After each colonoscopy, the instructor will fill out a questionnaire regarding any prior
      colonic surgery, presence of abnormal anatomy or masses, polyp detection and removal, quality
      of preparation using the Boston Bowel Preparation Scale, and difficultly of the procedure
      (1=very easy to 5=very difficult). Overall assessment of the trainee's colonoscopy skills
      will be assessed by the instructor after each procedure (1=poor to 5=excellent). The
      instructor will also indicate whether the cecum was intubated and the colonoscopy completed
      independently by the trainee, if there was hands-on assistance, or if attending had to
      take-over the procedure. The trainee will be assessed for ease of learned technique (1=very
      easy to 5=very difficult) and self-assessment of clinical confidence (1=not at all confident
      to 5=extremely confident).

      Record Keeping and Standardization:

      A data collection sheet will be used for each study case, which includes data to be recorded
      by sedation nurse (procedural times, patient pain scores, medications administered,
      instructor involvement, and volume of water used), trainee self-evaluation, and attending
      evaluation of the case and trainee skill. A short post procedural survey that will be
      provided to patients to assess post-procedural pain, experience, satisfaction, and
      willingness to undergo repeat procedure. In addition to photographic images documenting cecal
      intubation that are scanned into our electronic records, a digital video recorder will be
      used to record all procedures so that the consultant and PI/investigators may review a
      predetermined 10% of the cases to ensure a uniform standard of reporting times, quality of
      preparation, polyp detection, and degree of difficulty. Personal identifiers will be removed
      from all digital images captured. We will track the number of additional colonoscopies that
      the trainee will perform as part of their inpatient rotations so that it may later be
      analyzed as a potential confounder. Pathology reports for all removed specimens will be
      recorded so that adenoma detection rates may be determined.

      Statistical Analysis Plan:

      Chi-squared (χ2) or Fisher's exact test analysis will be used to compared the proportion of
      successful trainee unassisted cecal intubation cases (primary outcome) between the
      conventional air insufflation and warm water infusion colonoscopy methods. Secondary outcome
      variables will be compared using Chi-squared test, Fisher's exact test or Mann Whitney U test
      as appropriate. Multivariate logistic regression analysis will be used to evaluate factors
      affecting cecal intubation time and success. We will also calculate the trainees' learning
      curves in consecutive blocks of 25 procedures (for air and water methods) using one-way
      variance analysis and Tukey Honestly Significant Difference test to compare unassisted cecal
      intubation and colonoscopy success rates and time required for cecal intubation and
      withdrawal as previously reported for conventional air method.
