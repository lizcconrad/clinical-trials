        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Pathologically proven diagnosis of a malignant major salivary gland tumor of the
             following histologic subtypes: high grade mucoepidermoid carcinoma, salivary duct
             carcinoma or high grade adenocarcinoma;

          2. Surgical resection with curative intent within 8 weeks prior to registration;

          3. Pathologic stage T3-4 or N1-3 or T1-2, N0 with a close (≤1mm) or microscopically
             positive surgical margin (AJCC, 7th ed.; see Appendix IV); patients must be free of
             distant metastases based upon the following minimum diagnostic workup:

          4. Zubrod Performance Status 0-1; 3.1.5 Age ≥ 18; 3.1.6 CBC/differential obtained within
             4 weeks prior to registration, with adequate bone marrow function 3.1.7 Adequate renal
             and hepatic function within 4 weeks prior to registration 3.1.8 Negative serum
             pregnancy test within 2 weeks prior to registration for women of childbearing
             potential; 3.1.9 Women of childbearing potential and male participants who are
             sexually active must practice adequate contraception during treatment and for 6 weeks
             following treatment. 3.1.10 Patients must be deemed able to comply with the treatment
             plan and follow-up schedule.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        3.2.1 Patients with residual macroscopic disease after surgery; 3.2.2 Patients with
        salivary gland malignancies originating from the minor salivary glands; 3.2.3 Patients with
        histologies other than high grade mucoepidermoid carcinoma, high grade adenocarcinoma or
        salivary duct carcinoma; 3.2.4 Prior invasive malignancy (except non-melanomatous skin
        cancer) unless disease free for a minimum of 3 years (for example, carcinoma in situ of the
        breast, oral cavity, or cervix are all permissible); 3.2.5 Prior systemic chemotherapy or
        radiation therapy for salivary gland malignancy; note that prior chemotherapy for a
        different cancer is allowable; 3.2.6 Prior radiotherapy to the region of the study cancer
        that would result in overlap of radiation therapy fields; 3.2.7 Severe, active
        co-morbidity, defined as follows: 3.2.7.1 Unstable angina and/or congestive heart failure
        requiring hospitalization within the last 6 months; 3.2.7.2 Transmural myocardial
        infarction within the last 6 months; 3.2.7.3 Acute bacterial or fungal infection requiring
        intravenous antibiotics at the time of registration; 3.2.7.4 Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary
        Disease exacerbation or other respiratory illness requiring hospitalization or precluding
        study therapy at the time of registration; 3.2.7.5 Hepatic insufficiency resulting in
        clinical jaundice and/or coagulation defects; Note, however, coagulation parameters are not
        required for entry into this protocol. 3.2.7.6 Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS)
        3.2.7.7 Pre-existing ≥ grade 2 neuropathy; 3.2.7.8 Prior organ transplant. 3.2.8 Pregnancy
        or women of childbearing potential and men who are sexually active and not willing/able to
        use medically acceptable forms of contraception; this exclusion is necessary; 3.2.9
        Significant pre-existing hearing loss, as defined by the patient or treating physician.
