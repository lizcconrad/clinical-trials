      The purpose of this study is to improve the communication skills of physicians who transition
      lymphoma cancer patients from the end of treatment to survivorship.

    <description>(MSKCC and MD Anderson baseline data only) The study team will look for qualitative themes to better understand the content of these conversations and the need for survivorship care planning. Half of these recordings were with MSKCC patients and physicians and half were with MD Anderson patients and physicians.</description>

    <description>The overall design follows a cluster-randomized, clinical trial design. Although an apparently statistically-efficient design would have us randomize patients, the CST intervention must be delivered to physicians at four participating sites (MSKCC, Maimonides, MD Anderson, and Moffitt/TGH). Therefore, participating sites will be stratified by size and randomized to either experimental (initial survivorship planning consultation) or control (initial wellness rehabilitation consultation) in a multiple-level, cluster-randomized design, which protects against physician contamination of the experimental intervention within any site.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Physicians:

          -  who treat patients with DLBCL and HD as per self report

        Patients of Physicians:

          -  have a new diagnosis of Hodgkin's or Diffuse Large B-cell Lymphoma as per pathology
             report or physician assessment in medical record and/or clinical judgment of the
             treating physician treated with curative intent.

        For part 1 - have scans indicating remission and completing planned chemotherapy and/or
        radiation therapy. The treating physician will determine that clinical remission has been
        achieved based on their best judgment.

        For part 2 (longitudinal phase): - have new scans indicating remission and completing
        planned chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy. The treating physician will determine that
        clinical remission has been achieved based on their best judgment.

          -  be at least 18 years old

          -  speak English well enough, in the judgment of the consenting professional, to be able
             to understand all aspects of the study, provide informed consent, and be able to
             complete all study measures.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Physicians:

          -  who do not have adequate patients in their clinical practice to meet the 8 patient
             enrollment requirement for patients with either DLBCL or HD as per self report

        Patients of Physicians:

          -  show evidence of cognitive impairment severe enough to preclude giving permission to
             the study staff, or completing the survey instruments of the study.

          -  as per physician judgment, patient's prognosis and/or co-morbidities make them
             inappropriate for participation in a survivorship study.

        For Part 2 ONLY (longitudinal phase):

          -  those who consented to part 1, consult recording, of the study.
