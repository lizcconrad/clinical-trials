  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Early intervention for maltreated infants can improve mental and physical health throughout
      life and benefit families and society as a whole. The New Orleans Model provides intensive
      assessment and treatment for families of maltreated preschool children in foster care, with
      recommendations to court about adoption, or permanent return to birth families. The New
      Orleans Model appears to have led to better informed decisions about permanent placement and
      to better child mental health in Louisiana. The investigators propose an exploratory
      randomised controlled trial investigating the effectiveness of the New Orleans Model in the
      Scottish context, informing the development of an economic model to explore the potential
      cost-effectiveness. Families with a maltreated child under 5 years of age will be offered the
      New Orleans Model or &quot;case management&quot; i.e. quality assured services as usual, using random
      allocation. The investigators will measure outcome using well validated measures of
      parent-child interaction, cognition and attachment.

      The first 5 months of this trial - from December 2011 to April 2012 - is an internal pilot or
      &quot;implementation period&quot;. During this time we have fewer research staff, both services will
      just have started and we will only be collecting selected outcome measures. These will be the
      Principle Outcome Measure, the Infant-Toddler Social-Emotional Assessment (ITSEA), plus the
      Disturbance of Attachment Interview (DAI) and Parent-Infant Global Assessment of Functioning
      (PIR-GAS). We hope to include data from implementation period in our trial analysis, but if
      results are very different due to services &quot;bedding in&quot;, we may not do so
