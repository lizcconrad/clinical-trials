  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Lung cancer is the leading cause of death in the world. Overall 5-year survival rate is fewer
      than 10% and the effectiveness of conventional chemotherapy is limited. The new knowledge
      shows the correlation between genetic alteration and effective of chemotherapy. Therefore
      non-surgical modalities to obtain tumor specimens for genetic alteration analysis are
      particularly critical in lung cancer, since many patients have advanced disease at the time
      of first presentation, and are therefore not eligible for radical surgery. Endobronchial
      ultrasound-guided transbronchial needle aspiration (EBUS-TBNA) samples obtained during
      diagnosis of lung cancer can be used for molecular analysis that will predict response to
      treatment and prognosis. In this study, we will detect specific target molecules related to
      the effectiveness of treatment (surgery, chemotherapy, radiotherapy) and prognosis in
      patients with lung cancer using EBUS-TBNA samples and its combined with xenograft technology.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Age 18 years or older.

          -  Patients with confirmed or suspected lung cancer who require EBUS-TBNA as part of
             their staging investigations of the mediastinum will be considered for the trial.

          -  Patients with undiagnosed enlarged lymph nodes in the mediastinum suspicious for lung
             cancer in which a tissue diagnosis is required.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients who are deemed on clinical grounds not to be medically fit for a
             bronchoscopy.

          -  Patients where there is a high clinical suspicion of lymphoma.
