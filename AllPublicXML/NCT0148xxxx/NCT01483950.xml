      This study is non-interventional study of patients who are treated with any HMGCoA reductase
      inhibitors (rosuvastatin, simvastatin,atorvastatin and fluvastatin) available in Bosnia and
      Herzegovina for at least 6 months. Data collection for each patient will take place at a
      single visit. The investigators will complete Case Report Form (CRF) with patient's
      demographic, the presence of the factors for high cardiovascular risk, current treatment,
      cholesterol value as well as with further treatment decision.
