  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      An excellent bowel cleansing is mandatory to increase the diagnostic accuracy of colonoscopy.
      Failure to adequately cleanse the bowel for colonoscopy can lead to missed lesions, prolonged
      procedure duration and repeated procedures at earlier intervals. Emerging solid evidence is
      pointing out the need of switching from preparation the day before to regimens in which half
      or even more of the preparation is administered the same day of the procedure, which have
      extensively demonstrated to provide a significantly better cleansing, being well tolerated.
      Preparation can be fully administered the same day for afternoon procedures, whereas
      split-dose regimens fit better with morning colonoscopies. However, the ideal regimen for
      early morning colonoscopies is still to be elucidated. The second part of the preparation for
      these patients is usually recommended to be taken during sleeping time (2-3 am) on the belief
      that intake of fluids should be completely halted at least four hours prior to the
      colonoscopy procedure Sodium picosulphate is a unique orange-flavoured cleansing agent dosed
      as two powder sachets. Mayor advantages in comparison with current alternatives are
      relatively small volumes (each sachet is mixed with only 150-250 mL of water) and a more
      pleasant taste. It provides similar bowel cleansing than sodium phosphate and polyethylene
      glycol solutions administered the day before. Nonetheless, focus on split-dose regimens has
      been set on several polyethylene glycol (either high-volume or low-volume) regimens, but no
      data are available for split-dose sodium-picosulphate regarding colonoscopy in adults.

      The aim of the study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of a sodium-picosulphate
      low-volume split-dose regimen, in which the second-half of the preparation and fluids intake
      are allowed until 2 hours for early morning colonoscopies and until 2-6 hours for morning
      colonoscopies, comparing this split-dose regimen with standard cleansing the day before with
      sodium picosulphate/magnesium citrate.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Justification of the study:

      Several split-dose bowel cleansing regimens have raised over the last decade aiming to
      substitute standard preparation the day before. These split-dose regimens (based on sodium
      phosphate and polyethylene glycol solutions) have demonstrated better cleansing scores, so it
      is probably more important the time that preparation is given rather than the type of
      solution. However, the time to administer the second half of the solution in split-dose
      regimens for morning colonoscopies remains controversial. A major concern of split-dose
      regimens is the risk of aspiration pneumonia during sedation if liquids have been
      administered quite close to the procedure. As such, the second part of the preparation is
      usually given early in the morning (2-3 am) in order to have a safety-period of at least four
      hours prior to the colonoscopy. However, this is quite disturbing for patients and may hamper
      the adherence to further colonoscopies. Furthermore, On the other hand, no study addressing
      the role of split-dose Citrafleet has been published to date

      Therefore it is necessary to make a controlled clinical trial to directly compare &quot;the day
      before&quot; and &quot; split-dose&quot; regimens with Citrafleet for morning colonoscopies. In order to
      maximize the efficacy of the split-dose regimens, the time period between fluids intake and
      the colonoscopy will be shortened up up to 2 hours for morning colonoscopies scheduled from 9
      to 11 am and up to 3 hours for that scheduled after 11 am. The results of this study will
      conclude whether there is still room for improvement in bowel cleansing for morning
      colonoscopies, using more palatable low-volume solutions without interrupting sleep time.
