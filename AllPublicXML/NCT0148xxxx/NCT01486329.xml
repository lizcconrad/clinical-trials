      First-in-human phase I dose escalation study in patients with locally advanced, inoperable
      and stage IV pancreatic cancer to examine safety, tolerability, and immune response to the
      investigational VEGFR-2 DNA vaccine VXM01 to examine safety and tolerability, clinical and
      immunogenic response to the investigational vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2
      (VEGFR-2) DNA vaccine VXM01, and to define the maximum tolerated dose.
