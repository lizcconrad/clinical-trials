  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Collection of tissues for analysis from patients undergoing elective neck dissection.

      The hypothesis of the study is that specific genetic alterations occur in head and neck
      cancers that have spread to regional and/or distant sites, and these alterations can be
      identified from biopsy specimens to allow more accurate staging of tumor and better treatment
      planning.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The standard of care for the treatment of most squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck
      is surgical extirpation of the primary tumor and elective neck dissection to remove regional
      nodes at risk for spread. Via this treatment regimen, the investigators will be able to
      prospectively obtain tissues for analysis from patients undergoing elective neck dissection.

      The specific aims of this study are to compare gene expression between head and neck tumors
      with and without regional lymph node metastases, and to compare gene expression between head
      and neck tumor with and without distant metastases.

      Tissue samples from patients undergoing elective neck dissection will be collected. Primary
      tumors and adjacent normal tissue from unaffected areas will be collected at the time of
      surgery. All tissue dissection and removal are part of the standard of care for this type of
      surgical procedure. Remaining resected tissue will be used for research.
