  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The diagnosis of allergic rhinitis to dust mites is difficult and based on three elements :
      suggestive symptoms of clinical sensitization to dust mites (rhinitis), the existence of an
      IgE sensitization defined by skin tests and / or specific IgE positive to mite and finally
      the presence of mite allergens in the environment where the patient is symptomatic.
      Unfortunately, the link between symptoms and exposure to dust mites is rarely found and
      according to in the literature, 30% of rhinitis sensitized to house dust mites did not react
      during a conventional nasal provocation test (TPNC) to dust mites. Thus, TPNC to dust mite
      has an interest in the diagnosis of allergic rhinitis to dust mites when there remains a
      doubt due to the poly sensitization of the patient, or the lack of specific symptoms and / or
      the variability of the allergic symptoms during the year. However, this test has not been
      completely validated with a study including a significant number of patients. That's why the
      investigators plan a prospective single-center comparative open study with the main objective
      is to determine the sensitivity and specificity of conventional nasal provocation test (TPNC)
      in 120 patients of 18 to 65 years old with allergic rhinitis sensitized to dust mites and
      patients with allergic rhinitis not sensitized to dust mites. The investigators secondary
      objective is to compare the TPNC a faster TPN-called &quot;minute&quot; (60 minutes) and which allow a
      wider use. If the investigators demonstrate the validity of TPN then it would become the gold
      standard needed to decide on a desensitisation to mites.
