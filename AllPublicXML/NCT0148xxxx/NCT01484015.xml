    <textblock>
      This randomized pilot clinical trial studies how well giving prolonged infusion compared to
      standard infusion of cefepime hydrochloride works in treating patients with febrile
      neutropenia. Giving cefepime hydrochloride over a longer period of time may be more effective
      than giving cefepime hydrochloride over the standard time.

      OBJECTIVES:

      I. The objective of this study is to describe outcomes associated with prolonged infusion (3
      hours) compared to standard infusion (30 minutes) cefepime (cefepime hydrochloride) among
      patients being treated empirically for febrile neutropenia.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized 1 of 2 treatment arms.

      All patients receive cefepime hydrochloride intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes as their first
      dose.

      ARM I: Patients receive cefepime hydrochloride intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes.

      ARM II: Patients receive cefepime hydrochloride IV over 3 hours. Treatment repeats every 8
      hours.
