    <measure>Feasibility of a motivational tobacco cessation intervention</measure>
    <time_frame>2 years</time_frame>
    <description>The study will test whether the percentage of eligible and enrolled study participants who complete the assigned intervention is significantly different from a population of percentages centered at 45%, i.e., the &quot;null population percentage,&quot; considered a percentage too low to be compatible with feasibility.&quot;</description>

    <time_frame>2 years</time_frame>
    <description>Assess potential factors influencing study participation by community organizations&quot; and, as the description, &quot;Descriptive statistics will be summarized by participating community organizations on each organization's &quot;Implementation Factors&quot; assessment, an agency study participation measure developed for this project. The measure assesses how many clients the agency has referred, what means were used to recruit, and what barriers to recruitment were encountered, and an open-ended question is provided for additional input.&quot;</description>

    <description>This study is a pilot intervention trial examining the feasibility of a motivational smoking cessation intervention using respiratory biomarker feedback in low income PLWHA. The plan is to recruit a pilot sample of 50 eligible and consented participants, randomized at a 1:1 ratio into either the Treatment As Usual (TAU) condition or the experimental (Aspiration, Inspiration Respiration, or AIR) intervention condition.</description>

    <description>Participants in the Treatment as Usual study arm will be provided with the following: 1) brief smoking cessation counseling as recommended in the Public Health Service treatment guidelines; 2) direct referral to the NY/NJ State Quitline; 3) a brochure that describes the Quitline services and provides contact information via telephone or internet; 4) a NY State brochure on HIV and smoking that identifies the specific risks of smoking for PLWHA; and 5) referral assistance to participants who present with untreated co-morbid conditions.</description>

    <description>Participants in the Aspirations, Inspiration, and Respiration study arm will receive all of the components of Treatment as Usual along with these additional components: 1) a lung age test to determine the ability and functioning of their lungs; 2) a personal lung health report with their lung age, the CO level of their breath, and a summary of their respiratory symptom assessment; 3) a review of this personal lung health report with a study counselor, 4) motivational interviewing techniques guided by Self-Determination Theory concepts to explicitly elicit at least one life aspiration of the patient and encourage discussion of such aspirations using an autonomy-supportive approach.</description>
