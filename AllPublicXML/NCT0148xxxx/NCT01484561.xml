    <measure>Adjusted Geometric (Geo) Mean-Fold Change at End of Period 1 From Baseline in Measured Glomerular Filtration Rate (mGFR)</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1 of Period 1, Day 43 of Period 1</time_frame>
    <description>Glomerular filtration rate (GFR) is an index of kidney function. GFR describes the flow rate of filtered fluid through the kidney. GFR can be measured directly or estimated using established formulas. mGFR was determined using iohexol serum clearance using compartmental modeling of the iohexol serum concentration-time data. mGFR values were normalized to 1.73 meters squared (m^2) body surface area. A normal GFR is greater than (&gt;)90 milliliters per minute (mL/min), although children and older people usually have a lower GFR. Lower values indicate poor kidney function. A GFR &lt;15 mL/min is consistent with kidney failure. Baseline was defined as the mean of the values obtained at Run-in and on predose in Period 1/Day 1.</description>

        <title>Adjusted Geometric (Geo) Mean-Fold Change at End of Period 1 From Baseline in Measured Glomerular Filtration Rate (mGFR)</title>
        <description>Glomerular filtration rate (GFR) is an index of kidney function. GFR describes the flow rate of filtered fluid through the kidney. GFR can be measured directly or estimated using established formulas. mGFR was determined using iohexol serum clearance using compartmental modeling of the iohexol serum concentration-time data. mGFR values were normalized to 1.73 meters squared (m^2) body surface area. A normal GFR is greater than (&gt;)90 milliliters per minute (mL/min), although children and older people usually have a lower GFR. Lower values indicate poor kidney function. A GFR &lt;15 mL/min is consistent with kidney failure. Baseline was defined as the mean of the values obtained at Run-in and on predose in Period 1/Day 1.</description>

        <description>HAQ-DI: participant-reported assessment of ability to perform tasks in 8 categories of daily living activities: dress/groom; arise; eat; walk; reach; grip; hygiene; and common activities over past week. Each item scored on 4-point scale from 0 to 3: 0=no difficulty; 1=some difficulty; 2=much difficulty; 3=unable to do. Overall score was computed as the sum of domain scores and divided by the number of domains answered. Total possible score range 0-3 where 0 = least difficulty and 3 = extreme difficulty.</description>
