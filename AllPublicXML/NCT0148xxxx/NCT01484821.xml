    <textblock>
      Sarcopenia is known to be associated with loss in muscle mass that results from a reduced
      number of muscle fibres, an atrophy of remaining muscle fibres, and an increased infiltration
      of non-contractile tissue (collagen, fat). Accentuated by cancer and treatments, sarcopenia
      impairs muscle function resulting in a higher risk of physical disability and death. The
      commonly used test for sarcopenia screening consists in a DEXA (Dual energy X-ray
      absorptiometry) scan. However, this test can't provide structural muscle information. In
      contrast, the mechanical properties of muscle tissue can be explored using an acoustic
      radiation force impulse (ARFI). The question remains whether muscle sonoelastography using
      ARFI imaging could be helpful for sarcopenia screening.

      For this, volunteers will be recruited in three groups: ≤ 30 years (Gr A) and ≥ 70years, both
      without any serious chronic disease, and patients ≥ 70 years presenting curative cares for
      cancer (Gr C).

      The volunteers belonging to the groups A and B will be followed during one day. The patients
      included in the group C will be followed during 6 months. For this latter group; the first
      visit (t0) will take place before treatment and the second visit will take place 6 months
      later (t6months) Volunteers will have clinical examinations (weight, stature, BMI,
      performance status/ ECOG) and will be evaluated on their nutritional status (MNA-SF, 24h
      dietary recall) and physical capacities (IPAQ, SPPB, lower limb muscle strength, 6-min walk
      test, QLQ-C30 items relative to the fatigue symptom).
