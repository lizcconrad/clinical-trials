  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The clinical benefits of sunitinib and sorafenib have been demonstrated in patients with
      cytokine-refractory metastatic renal cell carcinoma. Sunitinib has also been shown to improve
      progression free survival and overall survival in a comparative study with interferon-alpha.
      When sunitinib is used as first-line molecular-targeted therapy, switching to sorafenib is
      one of the treatment options after disease progression. Reversely, when sorafenib is used as
      first-line molecular-targeted therapy, sunitinib is used as second-line therapy. The goal of
      cancer treatment is cure, and if cure is not possible, it is to prolong survival. In this
      study, sunitinib or sorafenib will be administered as first-line molecular-targeted therapy
      and treatment switched to the other test drug, sorafenib or sunitinib, when disease
      progression is detected to assess which treatment sequence produces longer progression free
      survival and offers a better safety profile (causing fewer adverse events). The purpose of
      this trial is to compare progression free survival of first line sunitinib versus sorafenib,
      and that of two treatment sequences, i.e. sunitinib followed by sorafenib versus sorafenib
      followed by sunitinib.
