    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, single-armed, open label study on the efficacy and safety of
      sequential IP therapy(Irinotecan plus cisplatin) and octreotide lar in the treatment of GI
      poorly diffrentiated Neuroendocrine carcinoma. Patient with written consents will enter the
      phase one step of the trial, receiving IP therpy. Once the IP therapy has been finished
      without disease progression or progression occurs during the treatment, the patient will
      enter the phase two step of the trial, receiving octreotide treatment. The primary endpoint
      is progression free survival in the two steps respectively and secondary endpoint is disease
      control rate, overall survival and safety

    <description>The primary objective is to investigate the overall progression free suvival for irinotecan plus cisplatin and octretide. The respective PFS of the two treatment steps will also be investigated. The result will be compared with the history treatment outcomes for patients of poorly differentiated neuroendocrine carcinoma.</description>

    <time_frame>3 years</time_frame>
    <description>The secondary objective also includes the investigation on the safety profiles of the two interventions, irinotecan plus cisplatin treatment and octretide. The safety profile will be described using incidence of AEs and SAEs, using CTCAE criteria</description>
