        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients must have histologically or cytologically confirmed malignant pleural
             mesothelioma.

          -  Patients must have advanced and/or metastatic disease, incurable by standard
             therapies.

          -  All patients must have a tumour block from their primary or metastatic tumour
             available and consent to release the block for correlative analyses.
             Centre/pathologist must have agreed to the submission of the specimens in both Stage I
             and II of accrual. For patients entered in Stage I of accrual, if no archival tissue
             is available, patient must undergo a biopsy prior to registration.

          -  All patients entered in Stage II of accrual must have an accessible tumour lesion
             (from primary or metastatic disease) for a fresh biopsy, which is formalin fixed and
             paraffin embedded. These patients must consent to this biopsy for entry on the trial.

          -  Presence of clinically and/or radiologically documented disease. At least one site of
             disease must be unidimensionally measurable as follows:

          -  Chest X-ray ≥ 20 mm CT scan (with slice thickness of ≤ 5 mm) ≥ 10 mm longest diameter
             Physical exam (using calipers) ≥ 10 mm Lymph nodes by CT scan ≥ 15 mm measured in
             short axis All radiology studies must be performed within 21 days prior to
             registration (Exception: Within 28 days if negative).

          -  Age ≥ 18 years.

          -  Patients must have a life expectancy of at least 12 weeks.

          -  ECOG performance status 0 or 1. Performance Status 2 patients are eligible, if, in the
             opinion of the investigator, they are suitable for inclusion in the study and are
             likely to be compliant with the study procedures (in particular the recommendations
             for supportive care and dose modification).

        Previous Therapy

        Cytotoxic Chemotherapy:

          -  Patients are eligible after first line cytotoxic chemotherapy has failed

          -  Patients must have received one, but no more than one, combination chemotherapy
             regimen for advanced disease, which must have contained a platinum agent, and
             treatment failure must have been documented

             o Exchange of one chemotherapy agent for another within a combination chemotherapy
             regimen due to toxicity (and not due to progressive disease) is not considered a new
             regimen in the following circumstances

               -  Carboplatin is substituted for cisplatin due to nephrotoxicity or ototoxicity

               -  One agent in the combination regimen is changed due to hypersensitivity occurring
                  in the first cycle

          -  28 days must have elapsed since last chemotherapy treatment (at least 6 weeks for
             nitrosoureas or mitomycin C) and patient must have recovered from toxic effects.

        Other Anti-Cancer Therapy:

        • Patients may have received other non-cytotoxic investigational therapy; 28 days must have
        elapsed since last treatment, such as anti-angiogenic or growth factor antagonists.

        Radiation:

        Patients may have had prior radiation therapy. A minimum of 28 days must have elapsed
        between the end of radiotherapy and registration onto the study. Radiation must have
        involved &lt; 30% of functioning bone marrow and there must be measurable disease outside the
        previously irradiated area (patients whose sole site of disease is in previously irradiated
        area are ineligible) unless there is evidence of progression or new lesions have been
        documented, in the irradiated field). [Exceptions may be made however for low dose
        palliative radiotherapy].

        Previous Surgery:

        Previous major surgery is permitted provided that it has been at least 28 days prior to
        patient registration and that wound healing has occurred.

        Laboratory requirements must be done within 7 days prior to registration) Hematology:
        Granulocytes (ANC) ≥1.5 x 109/L Platelets ≥100 x 109/L Chemistry: Bilirubin ≤ULN AST and
        ALT ≤2.5 x ULN Calcium ≤3 mmol /L INR ≤1.5 x ULN Serum creatinine ≤ULN Or Creatinine
        clearance ≥60 ml/min if creatinine is &gt;ULN Creatinine clearance to be measured directly by
        24 hour urine sampling or as calculated by Cockcroft Formula:Females: GFR=1.04 x(140-age)x
        weight in kg serum creatinine in μmol/L; Males: GFR=1.23 x (140-age)x weight in kg serum
        creatinine in μmol/L

          -  Patient consent must be appropriately obtained in accordance with applicable local and
             regulatory requirements. Each patient must sign a consent form prior to registration
             in the trial to document their willingness to participate.

          -  Patients must be accessible for treatment, response assessment and follow-up. Patients
             registered on this trial must be treated and followed at the participating centre.
             This implies there must be reasonable geographical limits (for example: 1 ½ hour's
             driving distance) placed on patients being considered for this trial. Investigators
             must assure themselves the patients registered on this trial will be available for
             complete documentation of the treatment, response assessment, adverse events and
             follow up.

          -  In accordance with NCIC CTG policy, protocol treatment is to begin within 2 working
             days of patient registration.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with a history of other malignancies, except: adequately treated non-melanoma
             skin cancer, curatively treated in-situ cancer of the cervix, or other solid tumours
             curatively treated with no evidence of disease for ≥5 years.

          -  Patients with known brain metastases. (A head CT is not necessary to rule out brain
             metastases, unless there is clinical suspicion of CNS involvement). Patients with
             known brain metastases will be excluded from this trial due to their poor prognosis
             and their likelihood of developing progressive neurologic dysfunction that would
             confound the evaluation of neurologic and other adverse events.

          -  History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic
             composition to PF-03446962.

          -  Patients receiving concurrent treatment with other anti-cancer therapy or other
             investigational anticancer agents.

          -  Patients with any of the following cardiovascular findings are to be excluded:

               -  QTc prolongation ( defined as a mean QTc interval with Bazetts correction equal
                  to or greater than 470 msec) in screening ECG or history of familial long QT
                  syndrome. An ECG must be done within 14 days prior to registration.

               -  Patients with resting BP consistently higher than, systolic &gt; 150 mmHg and/or
                  diastolic &gt; 100 mmHg (in the presence or absence of a stable dose of
                  anti-hypertensive medication) or poorly controlled hypertension, history of
                  labile hypertension or poor compliance with anti-hypertensive medication.

               -  Patients who have experienced untreated and/or uncontrolled cardiovascular
                  conditions and/or have symptomatic cardiac dysfunction (unstable angina,
                  congestive heart failure, myocardial infarction within the previous year or
                  cardiac ventricular arrhythmias requiring medication, history of 2nd or 3rd
                  degree atrioventricular conduction defects). Patients with a significant cardiac
                  history even if controlled, should have a LVEF &gt; 50%.

          -  History of pulmonary embolism within the past 12 months; exceptions may be made for

          -  History of cerebrovascular accident (CVA) or transient ischemic attack within 12
             months prior to study entry.

          -  Patients with overt bleeding from any site (&gt; 30 ml bleeding/episode) within 3 months
             of study entry are not eligible. No clinically relevant hemoptysis (&gt; 5 ml fresh
             blood) within 4 weeks prior to study entry is permitted. Patients with only flecks of
             blood in sputum are permitted.

          -  Patients who require use of therapeutic doses of anticoagulants such as warfarin,
             heparin or low molecular weight heparin (except for low doses for prophylaxis). INR
             must be done within 7 days prior to registration.

          -  Patients with bowel obstruction or any condition or gastrointestinal tract disease
             that would increase the risk for gastrointestinal perforation, including abdominal
             fistula, gastrointestinal perforation, or intra-abdominal abscess within 28 days of
             treatment.

          -  Patients with serious illness or medical condition which would not permit the patient
             to be managed according to the protocol including, but not limited to:

               -  History of significant neurologic or psychiatric disorder which would impair the
                  ability to obtain consent or limit compliance with study requirements;

               -  Active uncontrolled infection;

               -  Any other medical conditions that might be aggravated by treatment;

               -  Serious or non-healing wound, ulcer, or bone fracture.

          -  The following are exclusions for enrollment on the study:

               -  Pregnant or lactating women. (N.B.: All women of childbearing potential must have
                  a negative pregnancy test within 7 days prior to registration).

               -  Women must be post-menopausal, surgically sterile or use two reliable forms of
                  contraception while on study and for 6 months after discontinuing therapy. Men
                  must be surgically sterile or use a barrier method of contraception with
                  spermicide. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while
                  participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician
                  immediately.
