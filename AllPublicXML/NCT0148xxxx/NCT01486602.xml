      This phase I trial studies the side effects and the best dose of hypofractionated radiation
      therapy when given together with chemotherapy in treating patients with stage III non-small
      cell lung cancer that cannot be removed by surgery. Hypofractionated radiation therapy
      delivers higher doses of radiation therapy over a shorter period of time and may kill more
      tumor cells and have fewer side effects. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as paclitaxel and
      carboplatin, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the
      cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Giving
      hypofractionated radiation therapy together with chemotherapy may kill more tumor cells.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the maximum-tolerable radiotherapy (RT) dose fraction for accelerated
      hypofractionated radiotherapy with concurrent chemotherapy.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the rate of radiographic response to treatment. II. To estimate the rates of
      progression: local/regional/distant. III. To estimate the progression-free survival. IV. To
      estimate the overall survival.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of accelerated hypofractionated radiotherapy.

      CONCURRENT THERAPY: Patients receive paclitaxel IV over 1 hour and carboplatin IV over 30-60
      minutes on days 1 and 8. Treatment repeats every 14 days for 2 courses in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients also undergo accelerated
      hypofractionated radiotherapy using 3-dimensional conformal radiation therapy or
      intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) once daily, 5 days a week, for approximately 4-5.5
      weeks.

      CONSOLIDATION THERAPY: Beginning 4 weeks after completion of radiotherapy, patients receive
      paclitaxel IV over 3 hours and carboplatin IV over 30-60 minutes on day 1. Treatment repeats
      every 21 days for 2 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 1 month, every 3 months for
      2 years, and then every 6 months for 3 years.

    <description>Concurrent Therapy (1 cycle = 14 days, Cycles 1-3): Patients will receive paclitaxel 45 mg/m^2 by IV over 1 hour weekly followed by carboplatin AUC 2 by IV over 30-60 minutes for 4 weeks (there will be no chemotherapy during Cycle 3). Patients will receive radiotherapy concurrently for up to 5.5 weeks, depending on the cohorts the patient is registered defined per the protocol.
Consolidation Therapy (1 cycle = 21 days, Cycles 4-5): Four weeks following the end of radiotherapy patients will receive paclitaxel 200 mg/m^2 by IV over 3 hours followed by carboplatin AUC 6 by IV over 30-60 minutes on day 1 of each 21 day cycle for a total of 2 cycles (days 1 and 22).</description>
