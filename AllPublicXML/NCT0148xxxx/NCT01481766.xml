  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The pre-school years are critical years for children to acquire early learning skills such as
      language, fine motor and social skills; this is termed early child development. Primary care
      doctors (family doctors and pediatricians) are in a unique position to identify children with
      health or developmental problems. Screening is the process of testing healthy people for the
      earliest signs of health problems, followed by treatment, with the expectation that screening
      will improve the health of those screened. The focus of this research is screening young
      children for the earliest signs of iron deficiency (low blood iron levels) followed by
      treatment with oral iron.

      Previous research has shown that children with later stages of iron deficiency have serious
      delays in their development. Some research has shown that these delays may persist into young
      adulthood often with a significant reduction in intelligence. Early stages of iron deficiency
      may be difficult for parents or doctors to detect, and a blood test is usually needed.
      However, Canadian guidelines do not recommend screening all children for iron deficiency,
      because there is not enough good quality research to prove that screening is effective.

      In this study, the investigators will ask parents to allow their child between the ages of 1
      to 3 years to have a blood test for iron levels. If the blood level is low, the child will be
      randomly assigned to receive either oral iron liquid for 4 months plus diet counseling, or a
      placebo liquid plus diet counseling. A psychologist will measure each child's early learning
      ability before and after the treatment. If this approach to screening children's blood iron
      levels followed by treatment improves children's development, parents and doctors may
      consider that routine blood screening tests are justified. Overall, this research is an
      important step to improving the ways in which primary care doctors can ensure that children
      have the best start to life-long health and achievement.

    <description>The Mullen Scales of Early Learning assess the cognitive functioning of young children from birth to 68 months. The assessment is based on the child's responses to activities prepared by the trained examiner. Five skill areas are measured: Gross Motor and four cognitive skills (summarized into an Early Learning Composite score) - Fine Motor, Visual Reception, Receptive Language, and Expressive Language. The raw scores for each scale can be converted into age-adjusted normalized scores.</description>

Growth indicators will include - z-scores for weight for height (WHZ), weight for age (WAZ), height for age (HAZ) and BMI for age (BMI-AZ). BMI will be calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared.</description>
