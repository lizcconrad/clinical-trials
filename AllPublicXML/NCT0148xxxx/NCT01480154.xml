      This phase I trial studies the side effects and the best dose of Akt inhibitor MK2206
      together with hydroxychloroquine in treating patients with advanced solid tumors, melanoma,
      prostate or kidney cancer. Akt inhibitor MK2206 may stop the growth of tumor cells by
      blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as
      hydroxychloroquine, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by
      killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Giving
      Akt inhibitor MK2206 together with hydroxychloroquine may kill more tumor cells.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To define the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of MK-2206 (Akt inhibitor MK2206) and
      hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) when used in combination.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine side effects and activity of MK-2206 and hydroxychloroquine when used in
      combination.

      II. To determine if hydroxychloroquine alters the pharmacokinetics of MK-2206 due to a
      drug-drug interaction.

      III. To validate biomarkers for autophagy detection.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of Akt inhibitor MK-2206.

      Patients receive Akt inhibitor MK2206 orally (PO) on days 1, 8, and 15. Beginning on course
      2, patients also receive hydroxychloroquine PO twice daily (BID) on days 1-21. Courses repeat
      every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 4 weeks.
