  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The use of robotic surgery in the management of gynecologic cancers has increased
      exponentially in the United States since the implementation of technology in 2005. In Canada,
      access to the system is limited because of a lack of government funding. The government has
      been reluctant to fund this technology because robust data, on the true impact to patient
      care, is lacking.

      This project will prospectively examine outcomes of women, with early stage endometrial
      cancer, treated surgically. Open surgery will be compared to minimally invasive surgery (MIS)
      which will include conventional laparoscopy and robotic surgery. The data collected will
      include detailed assessment of surgical data, peri-operative events, quality of life
      analysis, health economic evaluation and evaluation of MIS rates.

        New patients in the gynecologic oncology clinic will be offered the surgery that is deemed
        appropriate by their individual surgeon based on the patient's medical and surgical
        histories, type of malignancy, and the surgeon's expertise in open surgery, laparoscopy
        and/or robotic surgery.
