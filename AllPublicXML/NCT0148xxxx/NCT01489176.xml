      The purpose if this study is to examine how effective Regadenoson is in detecting coronary
      artery disease during a stress echocardiogram when Optison is administered. Optison is a
      contrast agent that improves the images of the heart on the echocardiogram (echo) machine.
      Optison is approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to use during stress
      echocardiograms. Regadenoson is a commercially available rapid acting stress agent that is
      used to chemically increase the heart rate and is approved for nuclear imaging tests.
      Regadenoson is a FDA approved drug but not for the intended use in this study.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Stress perfusion imaging has primarily been done with radionuclide scintigraphy or single
      photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) and has not reached its full clinical potential
      because of the poor spatial resolution of SPECT, increased expense of this procedure, patient
      exposure to ionizing radiation, and lack of availability. The A2A receptor agonist
      Regadenoson has been utilized to detect myocardial perfusion abnormalities during SPECT
      myocardial perfusion imaging.

      A 100 patient pilot study (Regadenoson Real Time Perfusion Imaging Trial, IRB #566-08-FB)
      demonstrated the feasibility and accuracy of real-time perfusion echocardiography (RTPE) in
      detecting coronary artery disease following Regadenoson bolus injection and Definity as an
      ultrasound contrast agent. The aim of this study is to determine whether similar feasibility
      and accuracy can be achieved with Optison (a Food and Drug Administration approved ultrasound
      contrast agent that differs slightly in microbubble size and composition) in detecting
      coronary artery disease (CAD) following Regadenoson bolus injection. As with the original
      study, sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of perfusion and wall motion analysis to
      identify a coronary stenosis &gt;50% in diameter by quantitative angiography will be analyzed.
