      The purpose of the study is to determine the safety and efficacy of the use of Bendamustine
      in combination with a commonly used combination chemotherapy to treat relapsed and refractory
      multiple myeloma. The study will be conducted in two phases. Participants in phase I will
      receive 1 of 4 escalating doses of bendamustine. Once the maximum tolerated dose of
      bendamustine is determined phase II of this trial will begin. Participants in phase II will
      receive the maximum tolerated dose of bendamustine in combination with standard of care
      chemotherapy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Multiple myeloma is a multi-organ neoplastic disorder caused by the clonal proliferation of
      plasma cells. It has an incidence of about 4.5/100,000 per year in the U.S., making it the
      second most common hematologic malignancy. For many years, alkylating agents have been the
      backbone of treatment. The combination of melphalan and prednisone was, for many years, the
      standard of care for patients who were not candidates for autologous transplantation.
      Melphalan continues to be the primary conditioning agent for autologous transplant,and
      cyclophosphamide has also gained a foothold in the treatment of this disease.

      The introduction of novel agents has fundamentally changed the landscape of treating this
      disease, although the true effects on survival are not yet known. Immunomodulatory agents and
      proteosome inhibitors, including thalidomide, lenalidomide and bortezomib, have been used in
      both newly diagnosed and relapsed patients. Currently, there is intense clinical research on
      the optimal way to combine these novel agents with the traditional backbones of treatment -
      including alkylators, with one another and, eventually, with the subsequent iterations of
      these classes of drugs. However, despite the therapeutic excitement surrounding this disease,
      nearly all patients will relapse, and cure remains an elusive goal for all but a rare
      handful.

    <description>toxicity is defined as the inability to complete cycle 1 due to the following: Grade 3 or higher non-hematologic toxicity that are clearly not related to disease progression or intercurrent illness
nausea, vomiting, diarrhea,
Grade 3 or 4 venous thromboembolic events
Grade 4 hematologic toxicity defined as: thrombocytopenia with platelets less than or equal to 10,000 on more than one occasion despite transfusion support</description>

    <description>The primary objective of the phase II portion of this study is to determine the overall response rate (Minor Response (MR), partial response (PR), very good partial response (VGPR), complete response (CR), and stringent complete response (SCR) in patients treated with bendamustine in combination with weekly bortezomib, plus lenalidomide and dexamethasone. ORR will be calculated as the percentage of patients who achieve a MR or better after up to 8 cycles of protocol therapy.</description>

    <description>Phase I of the study will determine the safest dose of Bendamustine that can be combined with standard chemotherapy. Bendamustine will be given in doses of 25, 50, 75, 100, and 125 mg/m2. The first group of 3 patients to enter the study will receive a 25 mg/m2 dose of Bendamustine. If this dose is found to be safe, the next 3 patients will receive 50 mg/m2. The dose will continue to increase until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD)is found. Once the MTD is found the study will progress to phase II.</description>
