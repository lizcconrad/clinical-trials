  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to find out what effects, good and/or bad, that ganetespib and
      bortezomib has on you and your cancer. The investigators will determine the side effects of
      different dose levels of ganetespib when given alone and the effect it has on your cancer
      alone. The investigators will also determine the side effects of ganetespib at different dose
      levels when given in combination with bortezomib and the effect the combination has on your
      cancer. The study will measure levels of the drug in your blood and bone marrow as well.

      Bortezomib is a proteasome inhibitor that is approved by the US Food and Drug Administration
      (FDA) that is used for the treatment of multiple myeloma. The brand name for bortezomib is
      Velcade®.

      Ganetespib is considered &quot;investigational&quot; because it has not received approval from the Food
      and Drug Administration for general use, although it has been previously tested in humans.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients who have received chemotherapy, immunomodulatory drugs (e.g., lenalidomide,
             thalidomide or pomalidomide), immunotherapy, radiation therapy, or any investigational

             blockers, beta-blockers or diuretics. NOTE: Use of these medications for the treatment
             of hypertension is allowed.

          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, human
             immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive subjects receiving combination antiretroviral
             therapy, severe or systemic infection, or psychiatric illness/social situations that
             would limit compliance with study requirements.

          -  Other medications, or severe acute/chronic medical or psychiatric condition, or
             laboratory abnormality that may increase the risk associated with study participation
             or study drug administration, or may interfere with the interpretation of study
             results, and in the judgment of the investigator would make the subject inappropriate
             for entry into this study.
