      The purpose of this study is to determine the effect of theobromine on blood lipid parameters
      in healthy subjects. Secondary objectives are to determine the effect of cocoa and an
      interaction effect of cocoa and theobromine on blood lipid parameters.

      Hypothesis: theobromine has a positive effect on blood lipid parameters.
