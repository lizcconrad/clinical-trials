      The purpose of this research study is to determine whether low intensity resistance training
      with concurrent application of a peripheral blood flow restriction device to the exercising
      limb will elicit increased quadriceps strength, functional gains, ability to complete
      knee-related activities of daily living, mobility, and quality of life in individuals at risk
      for developing symptomatic knee osteoarthritis (OA). It is known that higher quadriceps
      strength is protective against developing symptomatic knee OA.1 However, people at risk for
      knee OA frequently do not tolerate the high intensity resistance training that is generally
      believed necessary to increase muscle strength. Partial blood flow restriction (PBFR) to the
      exercising muscle has been reported to result in strength gains, while requiring lower levels
      of joint loading.2 This method may be better tolerated, enabling efficacious exercise in
      older adults who may not tolerate high knee joint loads.

      To asses the efficacy of a 4 week low-intensity resistance training program with concurrent
      application of PBFR to the exercising limbs to improve quadriceps strength and size, leg
      muscle power, and mobility in individuals at risk for developing symptomatic knee
      osteoarthritis,we will test the following hypotheses. In comparison with low-intensity
      resistance training without use of PBFR, a four-week low-intensity resistance-training
      program with PBFR will:

      Primary Hypothesis: Increase (a) double leg-press 1RM strength and (b) isokinetic knee
      extensor strength

      Secondary Hypotheses:

        1. Increase quadriceps muscle volume assessed by MRI

        2. Increase lower limb muscle power on (a) double leg-press at 40% 1RM and (b) a timed
           stair climb

        3. Not adversely effect knee pain or quality of life assessed by the Knee injury and
           Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS) questionnaire

      Over 9.3 million adults over the age of 60 are afflicted with symptomatic knee osteoarthritis
      (OA) characterized by radiographic findings and consistent knee pain or stiffness.
      Furthermore, our research has indicated that reduced strength is a risk factor for incident
      symptomatic knee OA and progressive knee OA in women.1, 3 In light of this finding, there is
      a need to increase quadriceps strength to attenuate worsening of this disease. Studies and
      practice have long indicated that high intensity resistance training is the most efficient
      means of eliciting skeletal muscle hypertrophy and strength gains.2, 4 The American College
      of Sports Medicine as well as the National Strength and Conditioning Association have
      indicated that a resistance training intensity of greater than 65% of the one-repetition
      maximum (1 RM) is the minimum intensity needed to achieve desired muscle hypertrophy and
      strength gains.2, 4 This is problematic for those suffering from symptomatic knee OA. Loading
      an already painful joint at 65% of (1 RM) would be poorly tolerated and possibly injurious
      for an individual already suffering knee pain and stiffness during activities of daily
      living. With the inability to perform the exercises prescribed to elicit the necessary
      strength gains, knee OA sufferers find themselves unable to alleviate debilitating pain that
      can result in significant decreases in quality of life. Fortunately, a method of training,
      called partial blood flow restriction (PBFR), may offer older adults and particularly those
      with knee OA, the ability to develop the strength gains necessary to attenuate disease
      progression without requiring deleterious joint loading. There is mounting evidence that this
      training modality serves as a stimulator of muscle growth even when performed at relatively
      low intensities.

      PBFR was developed in Japan. Its basic principles involve the restriction of blood flow to
      the exercising muscle with the purpose of increasing muscle mass. However, participants are
      able to elicit similar strength gains performing exercises at, for example, only 30% of 1RM
      to those attained through conventional high intensity resistance training. Current PBFR
      training methods are the result of 40 years of research and development.5 Recent studies have
      demonstrated efficacy and some mechanisms for the effect of PBFR training eliciting
      significant isometric and isokinetic strength gains as well as increasing ability of adults
      to perform functional tasks.6 Exercising at only 30% 1RM, PBFR training may benefit older
      adults suffering from knee OA by enabling development of the strength necessary to protect
      against disease worsening while avoiding the need to load the joint at deleterious levels.

      This study is a follow-up study to IRB#201101711 that we completed earlier this year. That
      study demonstrated tolerance and safety of the protocol. However, the increases in strength
      were of a smaller magnitude than we hoped to elicit. The protocol for this follow-up study is
      very similar to the prior study. We have made some changes in an effort to maintain
      tolerability and safety, while hopefully eliciting a greater clinical benefit. Specifically,
      we have reduced the study duration from 9 to 4 weeks and have selected a more efficient
      exercise protocol that will both reduce subject burden while also halving the length of time
      that the PBFR cuffs will be worn for each exercise session. The prior study was too gentle to
      strengthen the quadriceps muscles, so we have increased the resistance from 15% of their
      maximum to 30% of their maximum. This is still low intensity compared with usual weight
      lifting that would be at &gt;65%. We believe that these changes will increase benefit to
      participants while reducing the time burden.
