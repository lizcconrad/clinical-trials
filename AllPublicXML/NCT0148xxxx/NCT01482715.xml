  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Part 1 (Completed Enrollment) - The purpose of the first part of the study was to evaluate
      the safety of different doses and dosing regimens of oral rucaparib administered daily to
      patients with solid tumors.

      Part 2A (Completed Enrollment) and Part 2B (Completed Enrollment) - The purpose of the second
      part of the study is to determine the safety and clinical activity of the RP2D of oral
      rucaparib administered daily to patients with a known deleterious BRCA mutation (germline or
      somatic).

      Part 3 (Completed Enrollment) - The purpose of the third part of the study is to further
      evaluate PK of higher dose strength tablets at the RP2D in patients with any advanced solid
      tumor, inclusive of lymphoma, with evidence of a BRCA mutation (germline or somatic).

      Rucaparib (CO-338; formerly known as PF 01367338 and AG 14699) is an orally available, small
      molecule inhibitor of poly-adenosine diphosphate [ADP] ribose polymerase (PARP) being
      developed for treatment of ovarian cancer associated with homologous recombination [HR] DNA
      repair deficiency (HRD). The safety and efficacy of rucaparib has been evaluated in several
      Phase 1 and Phase 2 studies.

      An oral formulation is the focus of current development efforts. Rucaparib is currently being
      investigated as monotherapy in patients with cancer associated with BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations.
      For this study, it is anticipated that rucaparib will promote cell death in the
      BRCA-deficient tumor cells of ovarian cancer patients with evidence of a germline mutation,
      thereby limiting tumor progression and providing therapeutic benefit.

          -  Received treatment with chemotherapy, radiation, antibody therapy or other
             immunotherapy, gene therapy, vaccine therapy, angiogenesis inhibitors, or experimental
             drugs 14 days prior to first dose of rucaparib and/or ongoing adverse effects from
             such treatment &gt; NCI CTCAE Grade 1 (Grade 2 non-hematologic toxicity to most recent
