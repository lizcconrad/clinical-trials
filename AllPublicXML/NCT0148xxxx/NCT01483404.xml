      This project investigates wether the intra-capsular hematoma, that often occurs after
      fracture of the femural neck, decreases the capillary blood flow of the caput femoris.

      During operation the measuring device of the O2c-machine in placed on the joint capsula first
      and afterwards, after surgical opening of the capsula, on the femur directly. The integral of
      the microcirculation of both parts of the femur is measured in both settings. So the
      capillary blood flow is measured with the hematoma still in situ, eventually putting pressure
      on the caput femoris and after the capsula has been opened, the pressure relieved and the
      hematoma removed. Both measurements are compared for each patient.

      The O2c-machine measures non-invasive with light waves and laser-doppler. The sounding rod is
      packed in a sterile tube to prevent any contamination of the operation site.
