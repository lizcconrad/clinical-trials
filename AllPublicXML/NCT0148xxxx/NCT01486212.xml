  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Oxygen is necessary for the survival of oxygen consuming organisms. But the organisms
      metabolism alter the oxygen to free radicals. Free radicals are molecules which due to their
      structure can react with other molecules resulting in cell damage. This damage is due to
      several mechanisms.

      This is e.g what happens when human tissue is cut of from blood supply for a time, and the
      blood supply is again restored. The damage following the restoration of blood is known as
      &quot;ischemia-reperfusion injury&quot;. The reopening of the vessels and thereby supplying oxygenated
      blood to the deprived tissue can in it self contribute to cell death due to excessive amounts
      of free radicals. Antioxidants can neutralize free radicals and thereby minimize their
      damage.

      The purpose of the investigators methodology study is to make an ischemia-reperfusion model
      on healthy volunteers (on the lower limb) to examine the expression of markers that are
      expressed in the muscle and the blood when blood supply is cut of to an area and later
      restored. The investigators wish to measure the product of the damage caused by free radicals
      and the levels of antioxidants.

      If the investigators can produce elevation of oxidative and inflammatory markers, this model
      can be used to test antioxidative intervention.
