    <textblock>
      Hypofractionated regimen in high-risk prostate cancer will allow the investigators to deliver
      higher biological doses to targets in order to improve tumor control and with acceptable
      rectal toxicity compared to conventional fractionation.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patient is 18 years of age or older

          -  Patient has histologically proven adenocarcinoma of prostate gland by needle core
             samples or TURP with assigned Gleason score. Prostate biopsy performed within 180 days
             of enrollment (date of consent).

          -  Patient has high-risk prostate cancer (stage T3 or T4) and/or PSA greater than or
             equal to 20 ng/ml and/or Gleason score 8 to 10

          -  No clinical or radiological evidence of nodal or distant metastasis(es).

          -  In the opinion of the treating oncologist, patient is fit to undergo radical external
             beam radiotherapy to the prostate. Patients are accessible for treatment and follow
             up.

          -  Patient does not have history of inflammatory bowel disease, anal stenosis, colorectal
             surgery, or repeated endoscopic examinations/interventions related to anorectal
             diseases.

          -  No history of prostatectomy, transurethral resection of prostate on more than one
             occasion or previous pelvic radiotherapy.

          -  No history of androgen suppression for greater than or equal to 6 months and patient
             is willing for androgen suppression treatment as per standard or at physician's
             discretion.

          -  No previous malignancy within last five years except BCC or SCC skin or highly curable
             malignancy where a prognosis for cure is &gt; 80%.

          -  Patient signed informed consent.
