  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to compare the effect of monitored, home-based exercise versus
      hospital-based exercise on the quality of life of patients with congestive heart failure.
      Secondary objectives are to assess the effect of the intervention on exercise capacity and
      caregiver burden.

      The investigators hypothesize that the exercise training in the home-based environment will
      be superior to hospital based exercise training.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Congestive heart failure (CHF) is a chronic disease that is associated with enormous burden
      of illness. Patients with CHF have diminished health-related quality of life, and due to the
      high demand associated with their everyday activities and self-management, there is
      consequently a burden upon family caregivers. Though exercise is a component of clinical
      practice guidelines for the management of CHF, previous studies have not examined the
      interrelationships among changes in exercise capacity, health-related quality of life (HRQL)
      and important predictor variables such as self-efficacy, as a result of exercise training in
      CHF patients. Furthermore, research to date has failed to examine whether a hospital-based or
      a home-based approach to exercise is the best-suited strategy for long-term adoption and
      benefit from exercise training. Thus, the most important effective approach to, and
      environment for, exercise training to improve the health and self-management of CHF patients
      has not yet been determined. This study will address some important gaps in the existing
      literature related to the benefits of exercise in CHF, specifically how different exercise
      approaches and strategies contribute to an individual's HRQL and self-efficacy.

      This is a prospective, randomized controlled trial using a two-group, repeated measures
      design. Male and female patients with New York Heart Association (NYHA) Functional Class
      I-III CHF will be eligible to participate. Participants will be randomized to receive either
      supervised, hospital-based exercise or monitored home-based exercise. The participants in the
      study will train for a period of six months and will be reassessed six months following
      completion of the intervention to assess sustainability of any observed changes.

    <description>Participants in the home-based group will be advised to exercise, a minimum of 3 times per week, but will be encouraged to exercise a total of 5-7 days per week as per CACR and ACSM guidelines. Prescriptions will include the same elements of those for the hospital group:
5-10 min warm-up
30 min aerobic interval training (walking or stationary bicycle)
10 min cool-down
Home-based participants will be asked to record their exercise in an exercise log book and will receive bi-weekly telephone calls from exercise personnel to monitor progress, assess and document adherence, revise the exercise prescription if necessary and provide support and education. Patient safety will be monitored during each call and serious health concerns will be relayed, with the patient's permission, to their primary health provider. Patients in this group will be encouraged to call the exercise specialist or kinesiologist with concerns or questions throughout the study.</description>

    <description>Patients in the hospital-based group will participate in supervised, on-site, group exercise sessions 3 times per week, but will be encouraged to exercise a total of 5-7 days per week as per CACR and ACSM guidelines. Trained exercise personnel (kinesiologists and exercise specialists) will supervise these sessions. Exercise sessions will include:
5-10 min of warm-up
30 min of aerobic interval training using stationary cycles, treadmills and arm ergometers
10 min of cool down
Exercise will be tracked by the participant in exercise log books.</description>
