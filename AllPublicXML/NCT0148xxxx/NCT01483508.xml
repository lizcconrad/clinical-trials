  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether or not the intake of dietary procyanidins
      (oligomers of flavanols) contribute to the systemic presence of flavanols in healthy humans.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Flavanols and their oligomeric derivatives, the procyanidins, are plant-derived compounds
      normally present in the human diet. Accumulating data demonstrate a causal role for flavanols
      in mediating the cardiovascular benefits associated with the consumption of
      flavanol-/procyanidin-containing foods. Evidence for a direct, causal role for procyanidins
      in this context is far less profound. As this is often based on the poor absorption of
      procyanidins, it has been proposed that procyanidins may indirectly contribute to the
      systemic presence of bioactive compounds via derivatives generated from the breakdown or
      catabolism of procyanidins in the gastrointestinal tract. These postulated 'breakdown
      products' include: i) flavanols, putatively generated by acid hydrolysis in the stomach, and
      ii) series of phenolic compounds, including 5-(3,4-dihydroxyphenyl)-gamma-valerolactone, that
      are produced from procyanidin catabolism by the gut microbiome. Verification or rejection of
      these suppositions could significantly impact the interpretation of epidemiological-/dietary
      intervention data, and the design of food-content data bases. To address this question,
      healthy volunteers will consume specially designed cocoa-based dairy drinks containing
      flavanols and procyanidins (dimers to decamers) either together or individually.
