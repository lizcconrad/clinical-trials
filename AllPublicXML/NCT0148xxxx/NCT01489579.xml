  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether giving more structured information to
      patients over the phone about quitting tobacco helps to increase the chance that they will
      try to quit. The results of this study will help provide direction in developing a more
      standard way of helping patients to quit.

      Study Hypothesis:

      Brief, structured, telephone tobacco cessation counseling delivered by clinical pharmacy
      specialists will significantly increase the percentage of self-reported tobacco cessation
      attempts compared to usual care among patients enrolled in a cardiovascular risk reduction
      program.

    <description>The patients in the BST counseling group will receive tobacco cessation counseling by a trained CPCRS pharmacist as part of their routine CPCRS care. The counseling will not be scripted, but must contain three key components (recommendation to quit, discussion/recommendation of tobacco cessation medications, and discussion/recommendation of tobacco cessation methods/strategies (Appendix C). These are the same items measured by the National Committee for Quality Assurance (NCQA) for Healthcare Effectiveness and Data Information Set (HEDIS) reporting. A standard KPCO document will be mailed to the patients following the BST counseling containing information about available resources (&quot;Ready to quit&quot; patient handout</description>

These interventions include any of the following: no action, mailed information on the resources available to help aid tobacco cessation, telephone counseling, and/or assistance in getting tobacco cessation medications. Pharmacists who are randomized to Usual Care will be asked to continue their current approach for tobacco cessation recommendations</description>
