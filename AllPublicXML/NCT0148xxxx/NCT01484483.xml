    <textblock>
      This observational study, conducted by the Kenya Society for Hematology and Oncology, will
      develop a Breast Cancer and Care Registry (BRECC) for Kenya. Data on demographic, clinical
      and pathological characteristics, treatment and clinical outcome will be collected from newly
      diagnosed breast cancer patients. Breast cancer patients will be recruited into this registry
      cohort and followed up for a period of not less than five years.
