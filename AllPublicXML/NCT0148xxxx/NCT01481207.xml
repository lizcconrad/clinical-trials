  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Neonatal hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy (HIE) is a serious neurological condition
      characterised by acute or subacute brain injury arising from perinatal hypoxia. HIE is
      thought to affect approximately 0.2% of live births, and is associated with a high risk of
      mortality or long-term neurological disability.

      Accurate biomarkers for long-term neuro-developmental outcome following HIE are extremely
      important both for clinical management and the evaluation of therapeutic approaches.
      According to a recent meta-analysis, the ratio of the cerebral concentrations of lactate and
      N-acetyl aspartate (NAA), two neuro-metabolites detectable with magnetic resonance
      spectroscopy (MRS), currently represents the most accurate prognostic indicator of outcome
      following HIE. However, for various technical reasons standard MRS methods do not offer
      optimal sensitivity for detecting lactate, which may potentially be improved with a custom
      lactate editing MRS sequence. In addition, while perfusion has also been suggested as a
      potential biomarker for neuro-developmental outcome following HIE, due to a paucity of MR
      perfusion imaging studies in neonates, the prognostic accuracy of perfusion MR measures has
      not been evaluated in comparison with more established MR biomarkers. The aims of this study
      are:

        1. to evaluate the relative sensitivity of a custom lactate editing MRS pulse sequence
           (specialist software) relative to the standard point resolved (PRESS) MRS sequence for
           detecting lactate in neonates with suspected HIE.

        2. to evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of MR perfusion measures in comparison to
           MRS measures as predictors of neuro-developmental outcome at 2 years.

    <description>The primary end-point will be reached when lactate and perfusion data have been collected from 30 neonates. The efficacy of the custom-MRS lactate editing sequence will be assessed relative to that of the standard MRS sequence for the detection of lactate (by comparing the lactate concentration (in mM) measured from the lactate edited MR spectra to that measured from the standard MR spectra).</description>

    <description>The secondary end-point will be reached upon completion of a neurological development assessment at the age of 2 years. Patients will be classified as having a good or poor outcome based on their motor skills at age 2, and the prognostic accuracy (eg sensitivity and specificity for predicting neuromotor outcome) of the standard and new MRI and MRS sequences will be assessed.</description>
