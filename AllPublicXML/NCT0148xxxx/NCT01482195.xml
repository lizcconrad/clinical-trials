  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A recombinant adeno-associated virus serotype 2 (rAAV2) vector has been altered to carry the
      human MERTK (hMERTK) gene. This vector has been shown to restore vision in animal models that
      resemble human MERTK-associated Retinitis Pigmentosa (RP), an incurable retinal degeneration
      that causes severe vision loss. The proposed study is an open label, Phase I clinical trial
      of subretinal rAAV2-VMD2-hMERTK administration to individuals with MERTK-associated retinal
      disease. This trial will lead to a greater understanding of the safety and thereby potential
      value of gene transfer in MERTK-associated retinal disease and will have implications for
      other forms of retinal degenerative disease amenable to this type of intervention.

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  MERTK-associated retinal disease;

          -  VA: 20/100 or less in worse eye

          -  Ability to perform tests of visual and retinal function;

          -  Good general health based on a complete physical examination and hematology and
             chemistry studies performed at a pre-treatment evaluation;

          -  Ability to comply with research procedures;

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Pre-existing eye conditions that would preclude the planned surgery or interfere with
             the interpretation of study endpoints or surgical complications (for example,
             glaucoma, corneal or lenticular opacities);

          -  Complicating systemic diseases (such as medical conditions causing immunosuppression)
             that would preclude the gene transfer, ocular surgery or known sensitivity or allergy
             to medications planned for use in the peri-operative period;

          -  Use of anti-platelet agents that may alter coagulation within 7 days prior to study
             agent administration;

          -  Use of immunosuppressive medications;

          -  Pregnancy or breastfeeding;

          -  Individuals (males and females) of childbearing potential who are unwilling to use
             effective contraception for 1 year following agent administration and barrier
             contraception for 3 months following agent administration;

          -  Any other condition that would prevent a subject from completing follow-up
             examinations during the course of the study and that, in the opinion of the
             investigator, makes the subject unsuitable for the study.

          -  Current, or recent (within the past 30 days, or 10 half lives of the drug)
             participation, in any other research protocol involving investigational agents or
             therapies.

          -  Recent (within past 6 months) receipt of an investigational biologic therapeutic
             agent.Subjects will not be excluded based on their gender, race or ethnicity.
