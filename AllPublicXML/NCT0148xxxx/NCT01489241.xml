  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate whether the introduction of a short-term
      telemonitoring program for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patients discharged
      from the hospital after disease exacerbation produces benefits in terms of a reduction in
      hospital readmissions and health related quality of life. In addition the trials evaluate the
      economical and organisational impact of the services and examine their acceptability by
      patients and health professionals.

      The purpose of this study is to the evaluate the use of a close phone-based tele-monitoring
      platform will reflected by less hospital re-admissions, will change their generic and disease
      specific quality of life compared with usual care. Following this; it is also hypothesized
      that this will also lead to less patients' deaths. In addition the patients' satisfaction
      using the telemedicine service will be studied. A Cost-Effective Analysis will evaluate the
      tele-health service compared with the usual care from the health and social perspective.

    <description>Patients in the control group receive usual care and visit the outpatient department at 4 and at 12 weeks after discharge when pulse rate, oxygen saturation and spirometry is performed. In the case of clinical deterioration during the study, the patients contact as usual their general practitioner. Usual care of COPD patients consists of regular visits to the specialist or primary care clinics every time a medication change is made or a medical examination is needed</description>

    <description>Within 24 hours after patient's discharge, the telemedicine equipment is installed at the patient's home and patients are trained in the use of the equipment. Patients are followed by a dedicated telehealth centre. Patients at home are asked to fill out each morning the CAT questionnaire and to record extra use of COPD relief medications. Patients in stable conditions perform telespirometry and teleoximetry at 4 and 12 weeks. When a clinical worsening is detected (increase in CAT score by 5 points or higher on two consecutive days) the patient is contacted and asked to perform ad hoc telespirometry and teleoximetry and to send the data to the telehealth centre.</description>
