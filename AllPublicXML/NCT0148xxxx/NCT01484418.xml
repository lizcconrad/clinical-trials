  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic low back pain often results in psychosocial and physical disability. A subgroup of
      these patients shows fear of (re)injury and avoidance behaviour leading to higher disability.
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether exposure in vivo is more effective in the
      treatment of fear avoidant chronic back pain patients than psychological treatment as usual
      (cognitive behavioural psychotherapy).

    <description>Exposure in vivo for fear avoidant chronic low back pain patients. This treatment means that the individual is exposed to movements and tasks that have been avoided due to fear of (re)injury. The treatment begins after three educational lessons including the rational and developing a fear hierarchy. Exposure phase includes 10 exposures sessions which are highly individualized. Behavioral experiments can be included to correct catastrophic misinterpretations. The main purpose of this intervention type is to reduce pain related disability via diminishing fear avoidance.</description>

    <description>Cognitive behavioural psychotherapy for fear avoidant chronic low back patients. The therapy is modularized in three main parts. The educational lesson is followed by the module graded activity which represents the behavioral part of the program. The second module comprises relaxation. And the last part contains cognitive interventions. Cognitive behavioural intervention techniques are employed to support the patient in the process of coping with chronic pain: i.e. reduction of disability and improving functional ability.</description>
