      This study is designed to examine the effects of speech therapy on ability to produce speech
      sounds in persons with acquired apraxia of speech.

    <textblock>
      This study is designed to investigate the effects of Sound Production Treatment (SPT; a
      treatment for acquired apraxia of speech) on sound production accuracy in persons with
      chronic apraxia of speech (AOS). Organization of practice (blocked practice or randomized
      practice) will be manipulated in an effort to determine the most efficacious application of
      SPT. A combination of group and single-subject experimental designs will be completed with 24
      speakers with AOS (2 groups of 12 participants).

Treatment stimuli representing two different sound targets were presented during treatment/practice with all stimuli for each target being grouped together. Treatment sessions were 50-60 minutes long. Treatment was administered three times per week for a total of 20 sessions, spanning approximately 7 weeks.</description>
