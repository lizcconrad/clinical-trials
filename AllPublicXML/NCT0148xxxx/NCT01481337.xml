  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The endoscopic management of patients on anti platelet agents is a wide problem more and more
      common, with prevalence of patients on this type of therapy steadily increasing. The risk of
      bleeding on antiplatelet during an endoscopic examination can be major. The risk of
      cardiovascular thrombotic accident in dirty shutdown of anti platelet, was recently described
      as significant (4-5%). Current recommendations for polypectomy allow the gesture as aspirin
      and are based on literature data scarce, often retrospective. Such work may be for a lack of
      increased bleeding risk during a colonic polypectomy under aspirin. There is to date no
      significant data published on the implementation of the endoscopic mucosal resection
      (mucosectomy) under aspirin. It is necessary to achieve a national multicenter observational
      study on a large scale in the daily practice of colonic polypectomy / mucosectomy in patient
      taking aspirin.

      The aim of the study is to determine the incidence of immediate and delayed bleeding colonic
      polypectomy and mucosectomy with aspirin. The patients undergoing colonoscopy and taking a
      long-term aspirin therapy and presenting a major risk of thromboembolism or medium will
      incluables. Inclusion will be achieved for those patients receiving aspirin colonoscopy after
      signing a specific consent. Polypectomy will be possible according to the recommendations of
      the French Society of Digestive Endoscopy. Upon discovery of a lesion to be resected by
      mucosectomy, the patient will benefit from the mucosectomy. The study is observational,
      multicenter, prospective, national. The polypectomies / colonic mucosectomies will be made
      using the conventional techniques and the current recommendations. The immediate and delayed
      hemorrhage meet specific definitional criteria. The number of patients to be included will be
      1000. The duration of the study inclusions will be 36 months. The trial will be conducted in
      full compliance with laws, regulations and ethical aspects.

      It is expected in this work that the incidence of post-polypectomy bleeding under aspirin is
      the same. The rate of bleeding reported in the post mucosectomy size is higher compared to
      the polypectomy: it is however expected that the rate of bleeding in the post mucosectomy
      with or without aspirin is indifferent. It will follow a recommendation of French society
      adapted to endoscopy for this type of procedure
