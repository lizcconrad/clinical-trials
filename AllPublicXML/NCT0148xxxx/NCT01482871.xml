      The objective of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of ophthalmic intravitreal
      injection of ALG - 1001 in human subjects with diabetic macular edema. The primary endpoint
      of this study is observation of dose limiting toxicity and maximum tolerated dose. The
      secondary endpoint of this study is observation of a clinical effect in BCVA (ETDRS letters)
      and OCT central macular thickness.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Male or female subjects, 18 years of age or older.

          2. Patient (male or female) with active diabetic macular edema (DME).

          3. Patient whose study eye has a best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) of 20/50 to 20/160
             ETDRS equivalent (65 letters to 36 letters), that in the opinion of the investigator
             is primarily due to DME will be intravitreally injected with 0.10 cc containing
             1.5mg/100µl or 2.5mg/100µl of ALG-1001. Decrease in BCVA must be assessed based on
             clinical exploration, macular thickening, presence of clinical significant macular
             edema and/or OCT findings consistent with diabetic macular edema.

          4. Patient whose study eye has a best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) of 20/200 or worse
             ETDRS equivalent (35 letters or less), that in the opinion of the investigator is
             primarily due to DME will be intravitreally injected with 0.10 cc containing
             5.0mg/100µl or 7.5mg/100µl of ALG-1001. Decrease in BCVA must be assessed based on
             clinical exploration, macular thickening, presence of clinical significant macular
             edema and/or OCT findings consistent with diabetic macular edema.

          5. Patients Intra-Ocular Pressure (IOP) is under control, IOP ≤ 25 mm

             6. Patient that has Chronic or Recurrent Uveitis. 7. Patient that has undergone
             Vitrectomy (anterior or pars plana) in the study eye.

             a history of intravitreal injections of any type in the study eye within the last 45
             days prior to study enrollment.

             10. Patient has a history of focal laser of any type in the study eye within the last
             90 days prior to study enrollment.

             11. Patient has a history of cataract surgery complications/vitreous loss in the study
             eye.

             12. Patient has congenital eye malformations in the study eye. 13. Patient has a
             history of penetrating Ocular Trauma in the study eye. 14. Patient is mentally
             handicapped. 15. Patient is Pregnant or Nursing female. If subject is 18 to 60 years
             old. Negative pregnancy test during the screening window.
