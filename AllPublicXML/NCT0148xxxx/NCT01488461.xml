    <textblock>
      Congenital ataxias (CA) are rare, non progressive diseases, characterized by psychomotor
      retardation, hypotonia followed by ataxia. The presence of the &quot;molar tooth&quot; on MRI allowed
      to define Joubert syndrome, a peculiar form of CA. Apart from this group, CA are mostly
      associated with cerebellar atrophy or hypoplasia without molar tooth on MRI. CA are a
      clinically as well as genetically heterogeneous group of diseases. Early-onset ataxias are
      progressive but may be difficult to distinguish from CA in the first years of the disease. To
      date, few genes responsible for CA have been identified: ABC7 (X-linked CA associated with
      sideroblastic anemia), SLC9A6 (X-linked CA associated with severe mental retardation, autism
      and epilepsy), GPR56 (CA associated with polymicrogyria), ATCAY (pure CA in Cayman isolate);
      the involvement of the ATCAY and ABC7 genes has never been assessed in a large cohort of CA
      patients.

      Primary objective:

      To assess the frequency of mutations of the ATCAY and ABC7 genes in patients affected with
      non Joubert congenital or early-onset ataxia.

      Secondary objective:

      To identify new loci and/or genes responsible for CA To further describe the clinical
      phenotype of the CA and to assess the frequency of the various clinical types (pure CA/CA
      associated with spasticity/ syndromic CA, congenital/early-onset CA, sporadic/familial CA).

      To describe the clinical phenotype of CA related to mutations in one of analysed genes.

      All patients will be examined by a geneticist or a neuropediatric. All clinical data will be
      collected.

      Strategy of the molecular study :

        1. for all multiplex and consanguineous families a linkage analysis (loci ATCAY and ABC7
           and others AC known genes) will be performed.

        2. For all sporadic patients as well as linked multiplex and consanguineous families :
           sequencing of all coding exons of the gene ATCAY and others AC known genes.

        3. For all sporadic male patients and linked families : sequencing of all coding exons of
           the gene ABC7.

        4. For all patients with suggestive features : sequencing of all coding exons of the gene
           GPR56, VLDLR, NHE6 or other candidate gene.

        5. In consanguineous families : linkage analysis using SNP-array and analysis of candidate
           genes present in the regions of extended homozygosity

        6. linkage analysis in dominant families and analysis of candidate genes in the linked
           regions.

        7. If a new AC locus is identified (using linkage or CGH array), this gene will be
           sequenced in all patients.
