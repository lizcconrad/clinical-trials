  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Beta-blockers should be administered to all patients with heart failure stages II to IV NYHA.
      It should also be administered to patients with stage I after myocardial infarction. The low
      ejection fraction, especially after myocardial infarction is a strong indication for
      beta-blockers, as many studies indicate that administration of these drugs substantially
      reduces cardiovascular mortality. Beta-blockers reduce mortality and hospitalizations and
      improve the operational phase for all categories of patients with heart failure. Since
      beta-blockers, only carvedilol, metoprolol, and recently visoprololi nevimpololi have shown
      these benefits and thus, only those have to be administered.

      The clinical study Carvedia aims to observe and record the action of beta-blocker carvedilol
      on cardiac function in patients with heart failure or reduced left ventricular ejection
      fraction after acute myocardial infarction.

      The relationship between stroke volume, which is extruded from the left ventricle gives a
      measure for the restrictive left ventricular function. Any patient with known cardiovascular
      disease should undergo assessment of left ventricular function by measuring the ejection
      fraction. Several studies have shown that when the ejection fraction (LVEF), which measures
      the heart's ability to eject blood to the aorta does not exceed 40% (natural price ^ 50%)
      increased dramatically in the post-infarction mortality. The ejection fraction as a reliable
      predictor, can be measured by ultrasonography. The reduced ejection fraction is associated
      with an increased risk of life-threatening arrhythmias, heart failure and death. The low
      ejection fraction, especially after myocardial infarction is a strong indication for
      beta-blockers, as many studies indicate that administration of these drugs substantially
      reduces cardiovascular mortality.
