  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the relationship between lipid-induced inflammation
      and ovarian androgen secretion in women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS); and to examine
      the effect of salsalate and polygonum cuspidatum extract (PCE) containing resveratrol on
      lipid-induced inflammation, ovarian androgen secretion, body composition and ovulation in a
      subset of normal weight women with PCOS.

    <textblock>
      The investigator hypothesizes that in women with PCOS, HCG administration will stimulate an
      exaggerated ovarian androgen response, dairy cream ingestion will stimulate white blood cells
      to generate an inflammatory response, and that there is a relationship between HCG-stimulated
      ovarian androgen secretion and the inflammatory response to dairy cream ingestion regardless
      of body fat status. Thirty (30) women with PCOS (10 normal weight with normal abdominal
      adiposity, 10 normal weight with increased abdominal adiposity and 10 obese) and 30 ovulatory
      control women (10 normal weight with normal abdominal adiposity, 10 normal weight with
      increased abdominal adiposity and 10 obese) will participate over a 3-year period.

      The investigator also hypothesizes that both salsalate and PCE administration for 12 weeks
      will attenuate the ovarian androgen response to HCG administration and the inflammatory
      response to dairy cream ingestion, reduce abdominal adiposity, increase insulin sensitivity
      and induce ovulation in normal weight women with PCOS. A subset of 16 women with PCOS of
      which 8 will receive salsalate (4 normal weight with normal abdominal adiposity and 4 normal
      weight with increased abdominal adiposity) and 8 will receive PCE (4 normal weight with
      normal abdominal adiposity and 4 normal weight with increased abdominal adiposity) will
      participate in this intervention over a 3-year period. This pilot project will help determine
      the feasibility of conducting a larger double-blind, randomized trial in women with PCOS to
      further test the latter hypothesis.
