    <textblock>
      Sensory reconstruction of the finger pulp is a challenging problem. This article reports
      repair of the finger pulp defect using the dorsal digital island flap. Both dorsal branches
      of the proper digital nerves (PDNs) were used for maximal sensory restoration.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      From February 2008 to May 2009, the flap harvested from the dorsum of the middle phalanx of
      the same finger was used in 12 fingers in 12 patients. The flaps ranged in size from 2.0 ×
      2.0 cm to 2.8 × 2.2 cm. The mean pedicle length was 1.2 cm. Neurorrhaphy between the dorsal
      branches of the PDN and PDN was performed in both sides in all cases. Sensibility of the
      reconstructed finger pulp was evaluated by static 2-point discrimination (2PD) and
      Semmes-Weinstein monofilament test. The range of motion of the donor fingers was measured.
      The data were compared to those of the opposite sides.

    <description>The patients were assessed at follow-up by an independent senior surgeon who did not attend the treatments. Evaluation included active range of motion (ROM) of the DIP and proximal interphalangeal (PIP ) joints, and static 2-point discrimination (2PD) and Semmes-Weinstein monofilament test of the reconstructed finger pulps. These measurements were compared with those on the contralateral site. According to the Michigan Hand Outcomes Questionnaire (MHQ), patients reported their satisfaction with the appearance of the injured hand. The questions based on a 5-point response scale.</description>
