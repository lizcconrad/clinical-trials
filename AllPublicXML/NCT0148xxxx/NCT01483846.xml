  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1b study involving multiple oral doses of AV-101 in healthy male and female
      subjects. The safety, pharmacokinetics, and antihyperalgesic effect of AV-101 on
      capsaicin-induced hyperalgesia will be assessed.

      Healthy subjects will be randomized into three dose cohorts (360, 1,080, and 1,440 mg) to
      receive daily oral doses of AV-101 for 14 consecutive days. Each cohort has 12 subjects on
      active drug and 4 subjects on placebo. Safety, PK, and antihyperalgesic effects of treatment
      with AV-101 will be assessed.

      At the screening visit between Day -28 and Day -7 before randomization, 250 Î¼g of capsaicin
      will be intradermally delivered into the volar aspect of one forearm. Subjects must report a
      pain score of at least 4 out of 10 to qualify for the study. On Day 1 and Day 14 the
      following data are collected: (1) neurosensory testing (thermal sensation, thermal pain,
      touch, and mechanical pain) on the forearm; (2) neurocognitive evaluation; and (3) 12-lead
      electrocardiogram, blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate, and temperature. PK samples
      will be collected on Days 1, 2, 14, and 15. The capsaicin-induced pain will be assessed at
      screening, on Day 1, and Day 14. An intradermal injection of capsaicin into the forearm on
      Day 1 and Day 14 will be followed by the efficacy measures. On Day 1 before administration of
      the first dose, subjects will be given a paper diary to record daily self-administration of
      each dose, concomitant medications, and adverse events during the 14-day treatment period.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  A subject will be eligible for participation in the full study only if all of the
             following criteria are met:

               1. Be male or female, aged 21 to 60 years inclusive, healthy, able and willing to
                  provide written informed consent to participate in the study.

               2. Be able to read and speak English sufficiently to understand and follow the study
                  instructions, including completion of pain intensity rating scales.

               3. For males, must use birth control (condom) to prevent fathering children; for
                  females must be nonlactating, not pregnant, and using a reliable contraception

                  analgesics, central alpha agents (e.g., clonidine), alpha blockers (e.g.,
                  praxosin, terazosin), beta blockers, calcium channel blockers, or ACE inhibitors.

              12. Use within 7 days before and during the entire period of study drug dosing of
                  long-acting nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAIDs) such as piroxicam or
                  naproxen.
