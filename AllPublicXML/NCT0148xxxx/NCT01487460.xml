  <brief_title>Safety, Tolerability, Pharmacokinetics and Pharmacodynamics of TAP311 in Healthy Subjects and Dyslipidemic Patients</brief_title>
  <official_title>A First-in-human Randomized, Double-blind, Placebo-controlled, 4-part Study to Assess Safety, Tolerability, Pharmacokinetics (Including Open Label Study of Food Effect and Interaction With Simvastatin) and Pharmacodynamics of Interwoven Single- and Multiple-ascending Doses of TAP311 in Healthy Subjects and Dyslipidemic Patients.</official_title>

  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will assess the safety, tolerability, and effect of TAP311 on blood lipids in
      healthy subjects and in patients who have dyslipidemia. The effect of food on TAP311
      concentration in blood and effect of TAP311 administration on simvastatin concentration will
      also be assessed in healthy volunteers.
