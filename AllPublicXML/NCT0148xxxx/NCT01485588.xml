    <description>Phase 1 is designed to evaluate the safety and tolerability of single ascending doses of hI-con1 and to determine the MTD that can be administered by intravitreal injection. Assessments that will be conducted are OCTs, FAs, Blood Pressure, Color Fundus, VA Acutiy, Labs, Ophthalmic exams, and IOPs. They will be occurring at screening through week 24.</description>

    <description>Phase 2 is designed to evaluate the safety of 3 injections of hI-con1 using the MTD and one dosage level lower than the MTD or standard of care Lucentis administered by intravitreal injection. Assessments that will be conducted are OCTs, FAs, Blood Pressure, Color Fundus, VA Acutiy, Labs, Ophthalmic exams, and IOPs. They will be occurring at screening through week 24.</description>

    <time_frame>24 Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>For both Phase 1 and Phase 2, preliminary efficacy will be assessed by change from baseline in visual acuity, fluorescein leakage, retinal thickness and fibrosis, if detectable, based on fundus examination, fundus photography, fluorescein angiography and OCT.</description>

        Ocular Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Active choroidal neovascularization (CNV) associated with age-related macular
             degeneration, as evidenced on fluorescein angiography and OCT, with the following
             lesion characteristics:

          -  Subretinal hemorrhage if present &lt; 50% of total lesion size

          -  During Phase 1, the 4th, 5th, and 6th subjects enrolled in each cohort must have total
             lesion area &lt; 6 DA (total area of detachment) (15.24 mm2), of which at least 50% must
             be actively leaking, and 30% should be classic on the angiography as determined by a
             reading center, and no more than 3 prior injections of any therapy for the treatment
             of CNV.

          -  For Phase 2, total lesion area &lt; 6 DA (total area of detachment) (15.24 mm2), of which
             at least 50% must be actively leaking, and 30% should be classic on the angiography as
             determined by a reading center and no more than 3 prior injections of any therapy for
             the treatment of CNV.

          -  BCVA for Phase 1: 20/ 80 - count fingers in the study eye; visual acuity in the fellow
             eye must be the same or better than the study eye

             must be the same or better than the study eye

          -  Only one eye of each subject will be treated in the study. If both eyes are eligible,
             the study eye will be the eye with the worst visual acuity. If visual acuity is the
             same in both eyes, the eye with the most active CNV will be selected to be the study
             eye

          -  Clear ocular media and adequate pupillary dilation in the study eye to permit fundus
             photography for screening

          -  Intraocular pressure of 21 mm Hg or less in the study eye.

             Posurdex®, Medidur®) in the study eye

          -  Significant media opacities, including cataract, in the study eye which might

             (Day 1), or participation in any other clinical trial of an investigational agent or
             investigational therapy within thirty (30) days of Baseline (Day 1). Participation in
             clinical trials of oral supplements of vitamins and minerals for the prevention of
             neovascular AMD (e.g. AREDS2) are allowed, as are studies that do not involve the
             administration of an investigational agent and/or investigational therapy

          -  Undiagnosed acute illness first observed during screening or between screening and
             baseline, or severe concurrent medical conditions that, in the investigator's
