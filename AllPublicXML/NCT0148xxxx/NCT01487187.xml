  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Very preterm babies frequently develop problems with their blood circulation during the first
      few days after birth. These circulation problems could affect the oxygen and blood flow to
      their brain and lead to effects such as bleeding in the head or delayed developmental
      milestones later in life. Currently the care for such problems may include transfusion of
      intravenous fluids or blood to the baby and/or giving the baby medications that can help
      circulation.

      The current practice at the delivery of these babies is to immediately clamp their umbilical
      cords after birth. Recent research studies have shown that giving more of the baby's own
      blood to them at birth by delayed cord clamping (waiting for clamping the cord for about
      30-90 seconds) or by milking the cord, may reduce the number of blood transfusions that these
      babies may need later on. It may also improve their initial blood pressure and reduce the
      chances of bleeding in their heads.

      More research is needed to prove if either delayed cord clamping or milking the cord at birth
      will be better in terms of improving these babies' health.

      The aim of this study is to find out if adding some blood to these babies' circulation,
      through milking the cord at birth, could prevent or reduce the possible problems with blood
      circulation and the reduced blood flow to the brain that some of these babies may have after
      birth.

      The investigators will also investigate if milking the cord at birth could improve their
      long-term developmental outcome.

      Hypothesis: In preterm infants less than 31 weeks' gestation, milking the umbilical cord 3
      times prior to clamping, compared to immediate clamping after birth will improve systemic
      blood flow (as assessed by improving superior vena cava flow measured by heart ultrasound in
      the first 24 hours after birth)

      Eligible mothers will be randomized prior to delivery once preterm labour is established
      (cervical dilatation &gt; 4cm and preterm birth is considered inevitable or delivery is
      indicated for maternal or fetal indications) to either milking of the umbilical cord of their
      infants (intervention group) or to clamp the cord as per standard practice (currently it is
      the immediate cord clamping) after birth (control group). Randomization will be done in
      variable block sizes and will be concealed by using opaque envelopes prepared ahead of time
      from a randomization table. Envelopes will be opened before the time of delivery.
