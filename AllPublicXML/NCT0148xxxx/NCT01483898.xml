      This study is designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of ixmyelocel-T, a
      patient-specific expanded multicellular therapy, for the treatment of patients with critical
      limb ischemia (CLI). The study is a randomized, vehicle controlled (placebo)study in CLI
      patients who have no option for revascularization procedures. All patients randomized will
      undergo a small volume bone marrow aspiration in a 15-minute outpatient or in-office
      procedure. All patients will receive injections of either ixmyelocel-T or vehicle-control
      into their pre-identified index leg. Patients will be followed for 18 months.
