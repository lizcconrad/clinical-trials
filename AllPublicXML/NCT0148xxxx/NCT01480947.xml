  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Diarrhea due to acute enteritis is a common symptom in the children. Lots of patients are
      infected by rotavirus or salmonella.

      Base on the past researches, there is benefit effect of probiotics on patients with diarrhea
      or acute enteritis. In this clinical study, bio-Three, a probiotic which contains three
      independent probiotics, will be used in patients with acute diarrhea.

      This is a single site, controlled clinical research. About 80 patients will be enrolled into
      this study to evaluate the benefit effect of bio-Three among patients with acute enteritis
      due to rotavirus or salmonella or other unknown reason. Patients will be diagnosed and
      screened by inclusion and exclusion criteria and only eligible patients will be enrolled into
      this study.

      Intervention: Subjects were randomly assigned to receive control treatment (intravenous
      fluid, oral rice and half strength milk formula) or add-on treatment of the probiotics
      (Bio-three®) to the control treatment.

      Main outcome measures: Quantitative Vesikari scales and qualitative severe diarrhea (Vesikari
      scale≥11) Exclusion criteria included immunodeficiency, severe abdominal distension with risk
      of bowel perforation, severe infection or sepsis, history of gastrointestinal tract surgery,
      and probiotics use in the preceding 1 week.
