    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, dose-ranging study of CNTO 1959 in patients with moderate to severe
      plaque psoriasis. Patients who satisfy all inclusion and exclusion criteria will be assigned
      by chance to one of 7 treatment groups: a placebo group (a placebo is a treatment identical
      in appearance to CNTO 1959 but does not contain active drug), 1 of 5 dose groups for CNTO
      1959, or adalimumab. Patients assigned to adalimumab will be dosed according to the labeled
      dosing for psoriasis. At Week 16, patients initially assigned to placebo will begin receiving
      CNTO 1959. Patients initially assigned to CNTO 1959 will continue to receive the same
      assigned dose level of study agent from Week 16 through Week 40. Patients receiving
      adalimumab will continue the labeled dosing regimen. All patients will be reassessed for
      clinical response every 4 weeks from Week 4 through Week 40. Patients will continue dosing
      through Week 40, with a subsequent efficacy and safety follow-up visit at Week 52. Patient
      safety will be monitored throughout the study.

    <measure>Percentage of Participants With Physician Global Assessment (PGA) Score of Cleared (0) or Minimal (1) at Week 16</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 16</time_frame>
    <description>PGA of psoriasis is used to determine the participant's psoriasis lesions overall at a given time point. Lesions were graded as erythema [0 (no evidence of plaque) to 5 (dusky to deep red coloration)], induration [0 (no plaque evaluation) to 5 (marked plaque evaluation)] and scaling [0 (no evidence of scaling) to 5 (severe; very thick tenacious scaling)]. The total score was calculated as average of the 3 severity scores and rounded to the nearest whole number score to determine the PGA score and category (0= cleared; 1= minimal; 2= mild; 3= moderate; 4= marked and 5= severe).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Participants Who Achieved Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) 75 Response at Week 16</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 16</time_frame>
    <description>The PASI is a system used for assessing and grading the severity of psoriatic lesions and their response to therapy. In the PASI system, the body is divided into 4 regions: the head, trunk, upper extremities, and lower extremities. Each of these areas is assessed separately for the percentage of the area involved, which translates to a numeric score that ranges from 0 (indicates no involvement) to 6 (90 percentage (%)-100% involvement), and for erythema, induration and scaling, which are each rated on a scale of 0 to 4. The PASI produces a numeric score that could range from 0 (no psoriasis) to 72. PASI 75 response was defined as at least a 75% reduction in PASI relative to Baseline.</description>

    <description>PGA of psoriasis is used to determine the participant's psoriasis lesions overall at a given time point.

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) Score at Week 16</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 16</time_frame>
    <description>The DLQI is a 10-item questionnaire that measures the impact of skin disease on participant's quality of life. Each question was evaluated on a 4-point scale ranging from 0 (not at all) to 3 (very much); where higher scores indicate more impact on quality of life. The DLQI total score ranges from 0 (not at all) to 30 (very much): 0-1 = no effect at all on the participant's life; 2-6 = small effect on the participant's life; 7-12 = moderate effect on the participant's life; 13-18 = very large effect on the participant's life; 19-30 = extremely large effect on the participant's life. Higher scores indicate more impact on quality of life of participants.</description>

        <description>PGA of psoriasis is used to determine the participant’s psoriasis lesions overall at a given time point. Lesions were graded as erythema [0 (no evidence of plaque) to 5 (dusky to deep red coloration)], induration [0 (no plaque evaluation) to 5 (marked plaque evaluation)] and scaling [0 (no evidence of scaling) to 5 (severe; very thick tenacious scaling)]. The total score was calculated as average of the 3 severity scores and rounded to the nearest whole number score to determine the PGA score and category (0= cleared; 1= minimal; 2= mild; 3= moderate; 4= marked and 5= severe).</description>

        <title>Percentage of Participants Who Achieved Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) 75 Response at Week 16</title>
        <description>The PASI is a system used for assessing and grading the severity of psoriatic lesions and their response to therapy. In the PASI system, the body is divided into 4 regions: the head, trunk, upper extremities, and lower extremities. Each of these areas is assessed separately for the percentage of the area involved, which translates to a numeric score that ranges from 0 (indicates no involvement) to 6 (90 percentage (%)-100% involvement), and for erythema, induration and scaling, which are each rated on a scale of 0 to 4. The PASI produces a numeric score that could range from 0 (no psoriasis) to 72. PASI 75 response was defined as at least a 75% reduction in PASI relative to Baseline.</description>

Each of these areas is assessed separately for the percentage of the area involved, which translates to a numeric score that ranges from 0 (indicates no involvement) to 6 (90 percentage (%)-100% involvement), and for erythema, induration and scaling, which are each rated on a scale of 0 to 4. The PASI produces a numeric score that could range from 0 (no psoriasis) to 72. PASI 75 response was defined as at least a 75% reduction in PASI relative to Baseline.</description>

        <description>PGA of psoriasis is used to determine the participant’s psoriasis lesions overall at a given time point. Lesions were graded as erythema [0 (no evidence of plaque) to 5 (dusky to deep red coloration)], induration [0 (no plaque evaluation) to 5 (marked plaque evaluation)] and scaling [0 (no evidence of scaling) to 5 (severe; very thick tenacious scaling)]. The total score was calculated as average of the 3 severity scores and rounded to the nearest whole number score to determine the PGA score and category (0= cleared; 1= minimal; 2= mild; 3= moderate; 4= marked and 5= severe).</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) Score at Week 16</title>
        <description>The DLQI is a 10-item questionnaire that measures the impact of skin disease on participant's quality of life. Each question was evaluated on a 4-point scale ranging from 0 (not at all) to 3 (very much); where higher scores indicate more impact on quality of life. The DLQI total score ranges from 0 (not at all) to 30 (very much): 0-1 = no effect at all on the participant's life; 2-6 = small effect on the participant's life; 7-12 = moderate effect on the participant's life; 13-18 = very large effect on the participant's life; 19-30 = extremely large effect on the participant's life. Higher scores indicate more impact on quality of life of participants.</description>
