  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      For patients with Immunoglobulin E (IgE)-mediated food allergy, the current management
      includes identification of the causative food and avoidance. Egg allergy is among the most
      common causes of IgE-mediated food allergy in children, affecting approximately 1.6% of
      children (its prevalence is higher in children with atopic dermatitis or other food
      allergies). Given the prevalence of egg and the difficulty to avoid it in the diet, we aim to
      investigate the safety and efficacy of baked egg oral immunotherapy.

      The primary objective is to study the efficacy of baked egg oral immunotherapy. The secondary
      objectives are to determine the safety of allergen-specific immunotherapy for egg allergy
      through ingestion of baked egg products and whether it will ultimately lead to a desensitized
      state for native egg. We will also examine if quality of life is improved by expansion of
      diets.

      Subjects aged six to 17 years with a history of egg protein allergy will be recruited from
      The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP) Allergy practice (main campus and satellite
      locations).

      Prior to and after the desensitization to baked egg, we will conduct double blind
      placebo-controlled food challenges to native egg protein. During the desensitization phase,
      we will give increasing doses of baked egg (meringue cookie or equivalent) on a weekly basis,
      as tolerated.

      The primary endpoint of the study includes the percentage of subjects who can successfully
      complete the food challenge to native egg once they have completed the desensitization
      protocol to baked egg. Secondary outcome measures include egg-specific IgE, quality of life
      before and after desensitization, and egg skin prick test size.

      Immunocap testing (bloodwork) will be performed prior to and upon completion of the
      desensitization protocol. This testing is considered standard of care in the management of
      food allergies.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Subjects must satisfy all inclusion criteria:

          1. Subjects must be age six to 17 years and have a history of egg allergy. Subjects shall
             maintain strict avoidance of consumption of all egg protein containing foods.

          2. Subjects will have a history (within the past six months) of a positive skin prick
             test to egg extract or an immunocap IgE level greater than 0.35 kU/L, and a positive
             allergic reaction history to egg within the past 12 months.

             a. Subjects will be accepted to the study if they have had a positive food challenge
             conducted at CHOP in the three months prior to the start of the study.

          3. Subjects must be in good health, as determined by medical history and physical
             examination performed by a study physician.

          4. Females of childbearing potential must be using an effective method of contraception,
             including abstinence, and agree to continue to practice an acceptable method of
             contraception for the duration of their participation in the study.

             If a positive pregnancy test was obtained during the study, the subject will be asked
             to withdraw from the study.

          5. Informed consent of parent or legal guardian is required.

        Exclusion Criteria:
