    <textblock>
      This study will be the first to examine the efficacy of using a brief, computerized HIV risk
      reduction intervention in treatment courts.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Four hundred consenting treatment drug court participants will be randomly assigned to either
      an HIV intervention group (n = 200) or an attention control group. All clients will attend
      their regularly scheduled status hearings which are scheduled approximately every six weeks.
      Clients in the HIV intervention group will receive a brief computerized, self-administered
      HIV risk reduction intervention following each of their first three status hearings. Clients
      in the attention control condition will view a series of educational life-skill videos of
      matched length following each of their first three status hearings. The primary outcome will
      be engagement in high risk behaviors as measured by the Risk Assessment Battery (RAB).
      Secondary HIV-related outcomes will include: (1) rate of HIV testing, (2) condom procurement,
      and (3) self-reported condom use. Tertiary outcomes related to treatment court compliance
      will include: (1) drug court graduation, (2) urinalysis-confirmed drug abstinence, (3) case
      management attendance, and (4) satisfaction with case management. In addition, we will
      conduct preliminary cost and cost-effectiveness analyses on the delivery of the brief
      computerized HIV intervention. Assessments will be conducted at baseline and 9- and 15-months
      post admission.

    <description>Individuals assigned to the experimental condition will complete the self-directed CARE HIV intervention during each of their first three sessions. The 20 minute intervention sessions involve several components including a brief risk assessment, review of identified risks, structured skill building videos, and the development of a risk prevention action plan. Because of the adaptive nature of the CARE program, the content of each session will be tailored to address the current risks of the participant. While the main focus of the intervention is on risk, individuals who report being HIV infected will receive a referral to treatment if they are not currently receiving medical care and their session will address, among other things, adherence to HIV care.</description>
