  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The most common congenital heart disease is the ventricular septal defect, and after surgical
      closure of a such defect, an arrythmia called the right bundle branch block, is very
      frequent. Therefore the aim of this study is to investigate if this group of patients has
      inferior outcomes compared to the group without this arrythmia after surgical closure and
      compared to a group of healthy control subjects.

      All patients will be undergoing 1. exercise testing, 2. echocardiography, 3. echocardiography
      during exercise, and 4. MRI. The perspective is the ability to point out a group of patients
      with a possible need of further intervention, and additionally to increase the awareness of
      protecting the electrical system of the heart during the operation.

    <textblock>
      Right bundle branch block is an exceedingly frequent complication in heart surgery, and
      especially in patients who have undergone surgical closure of a ventricular septal defect
      which is the most common congenital heart disease. How this bundle branch block effects the
      right ventricle of the heart on a long-term basis for this group of patients, is still
      unknown.

      As a part of a PhD-study we therefore will try to illustrate this by echocardiography, MRI,
      exercise testing and other investigations 15 to 20 years after the surgical procedure. The
      study population thus consists of three different groups: 1. Patients whom undergone surgical
      closure of ventricular septal defect without postoperative right bundle branch block, 2.
      VSD-operated patients with right bundle branch block and 3. Healthy controls with no
      significant medical issues matched on age and sex. By carrying out the tests mentioned the
      right ventricles systolic function, diastolic function, the patients maximal exercise
      capacity and a lot of other parameters will be evaluated in the three groups of patients and
      compared amongst each other. The perspective therefore is the ability to point out a specific
      group of patients with an inferior outcome and with a possible need for further intervention.
      An additional perspective is to increase the awareness of protecting the bundle branch during
      the operation.
