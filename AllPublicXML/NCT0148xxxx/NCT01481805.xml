      To explore biomarkers predictive of clinical response to sorafenib in unresectable
      hepatocellular carcinoma using the Prometheus Platform To analyze expression and activation
      status of receptor tyrosine kinases in signal transduction pathways in FNA samples and
      circulating tumor cells.

      To identify negative predictive markers to sorafenib. To elucidate signal transduction
      pathway attributable to sorafenib resistance. To monitor changes in the RTK activation status
      during sorafenib treatment using circulating tumor cells.

      To analyze correlation between the quantity of circulating tumor cells and circulating
      endothelial cell precursors and treatment response to sorafenib.
