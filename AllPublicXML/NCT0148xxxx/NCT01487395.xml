  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The early assessment of new drugs for Alzheimer's disease remains difficult because of the
      lack of predictive end-point. The use of a battery including different parameters could
      improve this early development of new drugs. Nevertheless, the interest of such a battery
      should previously be validated with the yet marketed AD drugs

      The aim of the present study is to test the effect of a 15-day treatment with donepezil on a
      mixed battery associating cognitive assessment, imaging and neurophysiological tests in
      healthy volunteers.

      This multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled, cross-over study is double-blind controlled
      and is conducted in 3 centers located in France (Lille, Marseille and Toulouse).

      18-30 years old, healthy volunteers, without any neurological or psychiatric impairment, will
      complete 2 test sessions in a randomized order: one with a 15-day treatment with donepezil,
      the other with placebo, and will be submitted to a mixed battery during the 14th and 15th day
      of the treatment. The primary outcome of the study will be based on cognitive assessment,
      imaging parameters and neurophysiological parameters.
