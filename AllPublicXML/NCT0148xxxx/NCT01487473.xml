      The main purpose of this study is to determine the degree to which Mindfulness-Based Stress
      Reduction, a group-based psychological therapy that includes mindfulness meditation
      exercises, reduces depression, anxiety, stress, pain intensity, and interference of pain with
      daily life among adult chronic pain patients.

      The second purpose is to examine the role of attention in improving psychological and
      physical health for chronic pain patients.
