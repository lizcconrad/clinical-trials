  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The proposed study is designed to utilize a self-hypnosis DVD home-training program for
      parents to use with their children to teach self-hypnosis techniques for inducing relaxation
      and hypnotic analgesia. These relaxation techniques can be employed to manage anticipatory
      anxiety, distress, and pain during an invasive medical procedure, for example, voiding
      cystourethrography (VCUG). The study will examine the efficacy of this intervention for
      children undergoing VCUG procedures.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Pediatric care professionals and parents seek safe ways to make invasive medical procedures
      less stressful and traumatic for children. However, for unpleasant procedures that require
      child cooperation, this task becomes difficult. Home-training in self-hypnotic relaxation may
      provide an inexpensive, yet systematic method for improving the overall medical care of
      children undergoing invasive medical procedures. The proposed study is designed to utilize a
      self-hypnosis DVD home-training program for parents to use with their children to teach
      self-hypnosis techniques for inducing relaxation and hypnotic analgesia. The study will
      examine the efficacy of this intervention for children undergoing urethral catheterization
      for VCUG procedures. Parents will be instructed to watch the DVD and practice the
      self-hypnosis exercises every day for a week with their child prior to the upcoming
      procedure. Parents are encouraged to practice self-hypnosis during their child's VCUG
      procedure. Both parents and children will be asked to complete a series of questionnaires
      before and following the procedure.

    <description>Crying will be assessed by having the child point to a picture on a continuous visual analog scale of 6 different faces representing increasing levels of distress, ranging from a smiling face to a face crying intensely.</description>

    <measure>Distress: Parent Report</measure>
    <time_frame>Same day - one week after procedure</time_frame>
    <description>Parent assessments of child distress (fear, pain, and crying)and overall trauma will be completed on 5-point scales, ranging from &quot;not at all&quot; to &quot;extremely&quot;. Parents will also rate of how traumatic the present VCUG procedure was compared with the previous one was completed on a 6-point scale ranging from &quot;much less traumatic&quot; to &quot;much more traumatic.&quot;</description>

    <measure>Distress: Observational Ratings</measure>
    <time_frame>Same day - while the child is undergoing the VCUG procedure. Time can range from minutes - hours of observation.</time_frame>
    <description>A research associate will rate the child's distress from the time he or she enters the procedure room until the procedure is completed. A modified 8-point version of the Torrance Global Mood Scale will be used.</description>

    <time_frame>Directly following procedure - up to 30 minutes following the end of procedure.</time_frame>
    <description>Immediately after the procedure, the attending radiologist and the technician each will be asked to rate the degree of difficulty of conducting the procedure. Staff will be asked to make the ratings with respect to children of similar ages on a 7-point scale ranging from &quot;far easier&quot; to &quot;far more difficult.&quot;</description>
