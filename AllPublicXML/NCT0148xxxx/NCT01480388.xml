    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to assess the efficacy, safety and tolerability of JNJ-39758979
      at doses of 10, 30, 100, and 300 mg/day compared with placebo (inactive medical substance) in
      patients with active rheumatoid arthritis despite concomitant treatment with methotrexate
      (MTX).

    <textblock>
      This is a double-blind (neither physician nor patient knows if the patient is receiving
      JNJ-39758979 or placebo), multicenter, randomized (patients are assigned to treatment by
      chance), placebo-controlled, dose range finding study of JNJ-39758979 in patients with stable
      methotrexate treatment through Week 24. The study will consist of 4 periods: a screening
      period, a 24-week placebo-controlled period, a 24-week extension period, and a 5-week safety
      follow-up period. The duration of participation in the study for an individual patient will
      be up to 59 weeks (including screening). All patients will be randomly assigned in a
      1:1:1:1:1 ratio to receive placebo or JNJ-39758979 10 mg, 30 mg, 100 mg, or 300 mg once
      daily. At Week 24, all patients remaining in the placebo group will start to receive
      JNJ-39758979 300 mg/day. Safety assessments and evaluations to determine the efficacy of
      JNJ-39758979 to reduce the signs and symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis will be performed at
      study visits. The extension and safety follow-up periods of this study will continue through
      Week 53 in order to assess the safety and for maintenance of efficacy of patients.
