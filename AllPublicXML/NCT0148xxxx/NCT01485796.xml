  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to acquire additional data on safety and tolerability of
      recombinant human hyaluronidase (rHuPH20) facilitated subcutaneous treatment of Immune
      Globulin Infusion (Human), 10% (IGI, 10%) and to assess the mode of product administration.

      Following a discussion with the FDA at the end of July 2012, all participants still active in
      the study stopped treatment with rHuPH20 to assure safety of the participants participating
      in the study and went into a safety follow-up.

      During this safety follow-up period, participants underwent treatment with the licensed
      product IGI, 10% (Gammagard Liquid). The intravenous or subcutaneous administration route was
      at the discretion of the participant and the investigator.

    <description>In Study Epoch 1 PIDD patients that are already on intravenous treatment or subcutaneous treatment will be enrolled and treated with IGI, 10% and rHuPH20 subcutaneously, with a short dose/interval ramp-up (Epoch 1) consisting of one 1-week dose and interval and one 2-week dose and interval. The ramp-up (Epoch 1) is followed by Epoch 2 which consists of approximately 6 months (24 weeks) of IGI, 10% and rHuPH20 treatment. For subjects pretreated intravenously (IV), this treatment will occur every 3 or 4 weeks (at a 3-week or 4-week dose, respectively), depending on the subject´s previous IV dosing schedule. For subjects pretreated subcutaneously (SC), treatment will also occur every 3 or 4 weeks (at a 3-week or 4-week dose, respectively), at the discretion of the investigator and subject.</description>

          <title>Subcutaneous Treatment With IGI, 10% and rHuPH20</title>
          <description>Subcutaneous treatment with IGI, 10% and rHuPH20 occurred in 2 study epochs. In Epoch 1, PIDD patients that were already on intravenous (IV) or subcutaneous (SC) treatment were treated with IGI, 10% and rHuPH20 subcutaneously, with one 1-week dose and interval and one 2-week dose and interval. Epoch 2 was to consist of approx. 6 months (24 weeks) of IGI, 10% and rHuPH20 treatment. For subjects pretreated IV, this treatment was to occur every 3 or 4 weeks (at a 3-week or 4-week dose, respectively), depending on the subject´s previous IV dosing schedule. For subjects pretreated SC, treatment was also to occur every 3 or 4 weeks (at a 3-week or 4-week dose, respectively), at the discretion of the investigator and subject. However, treatment with rHuPH20 was stopped as of August 2012 following a discussion with the FDA, and subjects still active in Epoch 2 were switched to a safety follow-up. During the safety-follow up, subjects received IGI, 10% by either the IV or the SC route.</description>

          <title>Subcutaneous Treatment With IGI, 10% and rHuPH20</title>
          <description>This analysis set comprises all subjects exposed to study drug in Epoch 1 and Epoch 2. In Epoch 1, PIDD patients that were already on intravenous (IV) or subcutaneous (SC) treatment were treated with IGI, 10% and rHuPH20 subcutaneously, with one 1-week dose and interval and one 2-week dose and interval. Epoch 2 was to consist of approx. 6 months (24 weeks) of IGI, 10% and rHuPH20 treatment. For subjects pretreated IV, this treatment was to occur every 3 or 4 weeks (at a 3-week or 4-week dose, respectively), depending on the subject´s previous IV dosing schedule. For subjects pretreated SC, treatment was also to occur every 3 or 4 weeks (at a 3-week or 4-week dose, respectively), at the discretion of the investigator and subject. However, treatment with rHuPH20 was stopped as of August 2012 following a discussion with the FDA, and subjects still active in Epoch 2 were switched to a safety follow-up (IGI, 10% by IV or SC route).</description>

          <description>This analysis set comprises all subjects exposed to study drug in Epoch 1 and Epoch 2. In Epoch 1, PIDD patients that were already on intravenous (IV) or subcutaneous (SC) treatment were treated with IGI, 10% and rHuPH20 subcutaneously, with one 1-week dose and interval and one 2-week dose and interval. Epoch 2 was to consist of approx. 6 months (24 weeks) of IGI, 10% and rHuPH20 treatment. For subjects pretreated IV, this treatment was to occur every 3 or 4 weeks (at a 3-week or 4-week dose, respectively), depending on the subject´s previous IV dosing schedule. For subjects pretreated SC, treatment was also to occur every 3 or 4 weeks (at a 3-week or 4-week dose, respectively), at the discretion of the investigator and subject. However, treatment with rHuPH20 was stopped as of August 2012 following a discussion with the FDA, and subjects still active in Epoch 2 were switched to a safety follow-up (IGI, 10% by IV or SC route).</description>

          <description>Treatment with rHuPH20 was stopped as of August 2012 following discussion with the FDA. This decision was based on theoretical risks of exposure to anti-rHuPH20 antibodies, not because of any clinical adverse events. 26 subjects still active in Epoch 2 of the study went into a safety follow-up period and were treated with IGI, 10% (GAMMAGARD LIQUID) either intravenously or subcutaneously.</description>
