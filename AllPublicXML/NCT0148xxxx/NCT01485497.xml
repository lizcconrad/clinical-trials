  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether the Optical coherence tomography (OCT) can
      image the structure and geometry of hollow organs of the upper airway in sleep disorder. The
      research can identify the obstruction sites that help the select the appropriate treatment
      for potential surgical candidates.

    <textblock>
      The National Commission on Sleep Disorders Research estimated that 18 million Americans
      suffer from obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) The majority of them are undiagnosed and untreated
      at this time.

      The current diagnostic gold standard for OSA is in-laboratory, a full night polysomnography
      (PSG). However, PSG is unable to provide information on upper airway structure and anatomy,
      and cannot identify the obstruction sites. OSA can lead to severe health complications
      including hypertension, heart failure, memory impairment, motor vehicle and work accidents,
      decreased work productivity, and increased risk of death.
