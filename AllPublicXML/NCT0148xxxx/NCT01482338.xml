  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether low-dose combine oral contraceptives (COC)
      containing desogestrel 150 mg and drospirenone 3 mg are effective in the treatment of
      Premenstrual symptoms.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Premenstrual syndrome is commonly reported 20-90 percent in reproductive-aged women. Only a
      small percentage of women (2 to 5%) have significant premenstrual symptoms defined as
      Premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD). The exact symptoms and their intensity vary from
      woman to woman and even from cycle to cycle.While exact causes of PMS are not fully
      understood,current thinking suspects that fluctuation of endogenous sex hormones are
      relevant. The standard 21/7 design may induce menstrual-related symptoms including headache,
      mood swings, abdominal cramping, bloating, and breast tenderness that increase during the
      last week of active pills extending along the 7-day hormone free interval(HFI). The decline
      in endogenous estradiol levels during HFI may be responsible for the estrogen-withdrawal
      symptoms. While a new COC with drospirenone introduced in 24/4 design has been shown in
      clinical trials to significantly improve the symptoms of PMS, there has been questioned about
      efficacy of the other kind of COC which has optimal properties, for example, good-control
      cycles extend to the similar 24/4 regimen.
