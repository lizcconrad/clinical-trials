    <textblock>
      This study will be an open-label, non-randomized, absorption, metabolism, and excretion study
      of [14C]-GDC-0980 administered as a 10-mg oral dose to 6 healthy postmenopausal and/or

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Medically healthy as determined by the absence of clinically significant findings in
             the medical history, physical examination, vital signs, 12-lead ECG, and clinical
             laboratory evaluations within the reference range for the test laboratory, unless
             deemed not clinically significant by the Investigator

          -  Female subjects of non-childbearing potential, as defined as either: postmenopausal
             and without recent history of menorrhea as documented either by physician note or
             confirmed by serum follicle-stimulating hormone level consistent with postmenopausal
             status, or surgically sterile

          -  BMI range within 18.5 to 29.9 kg/m2, inclusive

          -  Negative test for selected drugs of abuse at Screening and at Check-in

          -  Negative hepatitis panel (including hepatitis B surface antigen [HBsAg], hepatitis C

             intestine inflammation such as Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis, which required
             immunosuppressants

          -  Use of potent proton-pump inhibitors such as omeprazole, lansoprazole,
             dexlansoprazole, esomeprazole, pantoprazole, and rabeprazole

             within 12 months prior to Check-in. The previous radiolabeled study drug must have
             been received more than 6 months prior to Check-in for this study and the total
             exposure from this study and the previous study will be within the recommended levels
             considered safe

          -  Exposure to significant radiation 12 months prior to Check-in

          -  Use of any tobacco-containing or nicotine-containing products within 3
             months/approximately 90 days prior to Check-in or positive urine screening for
             cotinine

          -  Participation in any other investigational study drug trial in which receipt of an
             investigational study drug occurred within 5 half-lives or 30 days, whichever is
             longer, prior to Check-in

          -  Use of any prescription medications/products within 14 days prior to Check-in, unless
             deemed acceptable by the Investigator

          -  Use of any over-the-counter (OTC), non-prescription preparations within 7 days prior
             to Check-in

          -  Use of alcohol-, grapefruit-, or caffeine-containing foods or beverages within 72
             hours

          -  Poor peripheral venous access

          -  Donation of blood from 30 days prior to Screening or of plasma from 2 weeks prior to
             Screening

          -  Receipt of blood products within 2 months prior to Check-in

          -  Any acute or chronic condition that, in the opinion of the Investigator, would limit
             the subject's ability to complete and/or participate in this clinical study
