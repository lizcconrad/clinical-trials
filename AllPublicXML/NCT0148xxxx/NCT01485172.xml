    <textblock>
      This study is a fixed dose, dose response study to characterize the dose response for
      ropinirole PR in early stage PD patients (Hoehn &amp; Yahr stages I-III). After screening and
      baseline assessments, subjects will be randomized to one of six final target treatment groups
      (placebo, 2, 4, 8, 12 or 24mg/day ropinirole PR). The study will consist of a screening
      period, an up-titration period, a maintenance period, a down titration period and a follow up
      period. This study utilizes change from baseline in the UPDRS motor score as the primary
      endpoint, in line with that used in the ropinirole PR monotherapy pivotal study
      (SK&amp;F101468/168). Clinical review of the primary and secondary endpoints will be performed in
      order to establish the lowest maximally effective therapeutic dose.

    <measure>Change From Baseline (BL) in Unified Parkinson Disease (PD) Rating Scale (UPDRS) Motor Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 4 of the Maintenance Period (Study Week 17)</time_frame>
    <description>The UPDRS is a clinician based rating scale used to measure motor impairments and disability. The UPDRS assesses six features of PD impairment. These are evaluated using a combination of data collected by interview and examination of the participant. One of the six features include the Part III - Motor Examination where scores can range 0-108 where the maximum score indicates the worse condition. BL is defined as the last non-missing assessment measured on or before the first dose date. The change from BL was calculated by subtracting the BL values from the individual post-randomization values. The least squares(LS) means were estimated using the mixed model repeated measures(MMRM) adjusting for BL UPDRS motor score and race(white versus other) or by using the non-parametric rank analysis of covariance(ANCOVA).</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 4 of the Maintenance Period (Study Week 17)</time_frame>
    <description>The total UPDRS score was calculated by the sum of the values for each component (Part I + Part II + Part III) as determined by the physician. The UPDRS Part I scores mentation, behavior and mood and scores can range from 0-16. The UPDRS Part II is the Activities of Daily Living (ADL) score and can range from 0-52. The UPDRS Part III is the Motor Examination (Total Motor Score [TMS]) and scores range from 0-108. The total UPDRS (Part I + II + III) scores can range from 0-176 with the higher score indicating the worse condition. Tests were performed when the participant is in the &quot;on&quot; state of Parkinson's. Baseline is defined as the last non-missing assessment measured on or before the first dose date.

    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 4 of the Maintenance Period (Study Week 17)</time_frame>
    <description>The UPDRS Part I scores mentation, behavior and mood as determined by a physician and participants were tested during the &quot;on&quot; phase of Parkinson's. This component of the UPDRS is the total score for 4 items (the items 1- 4 include intellectual impairment, thought disorder, motivation/initiative, and depression) and may have a value ranging from 0 to 16 as determined by a physician where 16 indicates the maximum score and the worse condition. All 4 items have to be present for a total score to be calculated. If one or more items are missing, the total score for the component will also be missing. Baseline is defined as the last non-missing assessment measured on or before the first dose date. The change from Baseline will be calculated by subtracting the Baseline values from the individual post-randomization values.</description>

    <description>The CGI-I scale allows the investigator to rate the participant's total improvement since the beginning of treatment (Baseline). Baseline is defined as the last non-missing assessment measured on or before the first dose date. The scale is rated from 1-7 where 1 = &quot;very much improved&quot;, 2 = &quot;much improved&quot;, 3 = &quot;minimally improved&quot;, 4 = &quot;no change&quot;, 5 = &quot;minimally worse, 6 = &quot;much worse&quot;, and 7 = &quot;very much worse&quot;.

        <title>Change From Baseline (BL) in Unified Parkinson Disease (PD) Rating Scale (UPDRS) Motor Score</title>
        <description>The UPDRS is a clinician based rating scale used to measure motor impairments and disability. The UPDRS assesses six features of PD impairment. These are evaluated using a combination of data collected by interview and examination of the participant. One of the six features include the Part III – Motor Examination where scores can range 0-108 where the maximum score indicates the worse condition. BL is defined as the last non-missing assessment measured on or before the first dose date. The change from BL was calculated by subtracting the BL values from the individual post-randomization values. The least squares(LS) means were estimated using the mixed model repeated measures(MMRM) adjusting for BL UPDRS motor score and race(white versus other) or by using the non-parametric rank analysis of covariance(ANCOVA).</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in UPDRS Parts II and III Combined</title>
        <description>The UPDRS Part II is the Activities of Daily Living (ADL) score and can range from 0-52 as determined by the physician. The UPDRS Part III is the Motor Examination (Total Motor Score [TMS]) and is defined as the total score, ranging from 0-108 as determined by the physician, of the tests given in the motor examination section. The combined scores of Parts II and III can range from 0-160 with the higher score indicating the worse condition. Tests were performed when the participant is in the &quot;on&quot; state of Parkinson's. Baseline is defined as the last non-missing assessment measured on or before the first dose date. The change from Baseline will be calculated by subtracting the Baseline values from the individual post-randomization values.</description>

          <title>Change From Baseline in UPDRS Activities of Daily Living</title>
          <description>The UPDRS Part II is the Activities of Daily Living (ADL) score and can range from 0-52 as determined by the physician. The higher score indicates the worse condition. Tests were performed when the participant is in the &quot;on&quot; state of Parkinson's. Baseline is defined as the last non-missing assessment measured on or before the first dose date. The change from Baseline will be calculated by subtracting the Baseline values from the individual post-randomization values.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in the Total UPDRS Score (Parts I-III)</title>
        <description>The total UPDRS score was calculated by the sum of the values for each component (Part I + Part II + Part III) as determined by the physician. The UPDRS Part I scores mentation, behavior and mood and scores can range from 0-16. The UPDRS Part II is the Activities of Daily Living (ADL) score and can range from 0-52. The UPDRS Part III is the Motor Examination (Total Motor Score [TMS]) and scores range from 0-108. The total UPDRS (Part I + II + III) scores can range from 0-176 with the higher score indicating the worse condition. Tests were performed when the participant is in the &quot;on&quot; state of Parkinson's. Baseline is defined as the last non-missing assessment measured on or before the first dose date. The change from Baseline will be calculated by subtracting the Baseline values from the individual post-randomization values.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in the UPDRS Part I (Mentation)</title>
        <description>The UPDRS Part I scores mentation, behavior and mood as determined by a physician and participants were tested during the &quot;on&quot; phase of Parkinson's. This component of the UPDRS is the total score for 4 items (the items 1- 4 include intellectual impairment, thought disorder, motivation/initiative, and depression) and may have a value ranging from 0 to 16 as determined by a physician where 16 indicates the maximum score and the worse condition. All 4 items have to be present for a total score to be calculated. If one or more items are missing, the total score for the component will also be missing. Baseline is defined as the last non-missing assessment measured on or before the first dose date. The change from Baseline will be calculated by subtracting the Baseline values from the individual post-randomization values.</description>
