      As endovascular procedures become more complex, there is a growing need for 3D image overlay
      to assist with device guidance and placement. Currently, a 3D image is typically created
      intra-operatively using 3D rotational angiography (3D-RA) or cone-beam CT (XperCT). This 3D
      image may then be overlaid on live fluoroscopy to provide 3D guidance information (Dynamic 3D
      Roadmapping). Philips Healthcare multimodality overlay products allows registration of a
      pre-acquired MR/CT or 3D rotational image to live fluoroscopy.

      Endovascular treatment is performed under the guidance of an X-ray angiography system.
      Fluoroscopy and conventional 2D digital subtraction angiography (DSA) are used to navigate
      the interventional device (and implant) across the lesion to achieve a correct bridging of
      the diseased region of the vessel, while excluding the involvement of patent vessels.
      Drawbacks of these peripheral interventions include the radiation dose, use of contrast, and
      need for a clinician with excellent wire-handling skills. The use of 2D imaging alone may not
      be enough to describe the three-dimensional(3D) relationship between interventional devices
      (and implants) and the complex vascular anatomy, often making positioning, deployment and
      evaluation suboptimal. In addition, the endovascular approach can lead to complications such
      as in-stent thrombosis and type II endoleak (in the case of aortic aneurysms) for which 2D
      imaging along is again sub-optimal for re-intervention planning and guidance.
