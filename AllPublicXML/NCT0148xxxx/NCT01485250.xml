  <brief_summary>

      Background:

        -  Individuals often participate in clinical trials to seek new therapies and free medical
           treatments for their illnesses or chronic conditions. However, less is known about the
           motivations of the healthy individuals who volunteer for research studies.

        -  Although many healthy volunteers participate in clinical trials for financial
           compensation, the particular risks involved in testing drugs that have not been tried in
           human clinical trials pose potential dangers for healthy volunteers in Phase I studies.
           More research is needed to understand the motivations of volunteers who participate in
           Phase I clinical trials.

      Objectives:

      - To evaluate the primary and secondary motivations of healthy participants in research
      studies.

      Eligibility:

      - Individuals at least 18 years of age who are healthy volunteers in selected Pfizer Phase I
      clinical trials.

      Design:

        -  Individuals who express interest in participating in specific Pfizer Phase I drug
           studies will be asked to complete a short questionnaire after completing the standard
           consent session for the study.

        -  Those who enroll in the trial will be asked to complete a second questionnaire prior to
           discharge from the study.

      This healthy volunteer motivation study is a sub-study of Phase I drug development studies
      conducted by Pfizer International. The substudy is designed to evaluate the primary and
      secondary motivations of healthy participants in research studies, as well as the process by
      which participants decide to participate, including their consideration of any risks,
      benefits, compensation and other factors, and the relationship of these factors to cultural
      and sociodemographic variables. Data will be collected via self-administered surveys at 2
      possible time points, 1) after going through the consent process at the beginning of
      participation in the primary study, and 2) towards the end of the study participation.
