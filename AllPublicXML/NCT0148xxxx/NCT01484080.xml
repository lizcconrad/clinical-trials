  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators plan to study the efficacy of the combination of weekly paclitaxel + BIBF
      1120 in early breast cancer using a neoadjuvant schedule and a randomized phase-II trial
      design, comparing the efficacy vs. weekly paclitaxel alone, followed by surgery and
      subsequent standards of care (anthracycline based chemotherapy, radiation or hormonal
      blockade).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, multicenter, Phase I dose-escalation study to assess the safety and
      tolerability of oral (PO) BIBF 1120 administered with intravenous (IV) paclitaxel (80 mg/m2
      on days 1, 8 and 15 every 3 weeks) to patients with breast cancer (see Figure 1 for the study
      flow chart). BIBF 1120 will be administered twice daily PO for 21 consecutive days (Days 1 to
      21) in 3-week cycles (morning dose is skipped on the paclitaxel administration days)
