      The purpose of this study is to determine the relative bioavailability and pharmacokinetic
      profiles from three strengths of a new tablet formulation of ASP015K and to evaluate the
      safety and tolerability after a single dose of three different strengths of a new tablet
      formulation.

      Eligible subjects will be admitted on Day-1 and remain confined on the unit for 16 days. Each
      subject will receive a single dose of study drug per the defined treatment periods on the
      mornings of Day 1, Day 6 and Day11. There will be a minimum of 5 days between each
      consecutive dose group. Any subject discontinuing the study prior to completion should have
      all end of study evaluations completed.
