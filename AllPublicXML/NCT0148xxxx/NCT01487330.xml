    <textblock>
      The purpose of this first-in-human study is to assess the technical feasibility, deployment
      characteristics, and safety of the 23mm SJM Transfemoral Transcatheter Heart Valve and
      delivery system in subjects with severe symptomatic aortic stenosis (AS).

      This is a single center, prospective, non-randomized, first-in-human investigational study
      without concurrent or matched controls.

      Data will be collected at baseline, procedure, discharge (date of hospital discharge or 7
      days post-implant, whichever occurs first), 30 days post implant, 3 months post implant, 6
      months post implant, and 12 months post implant.
