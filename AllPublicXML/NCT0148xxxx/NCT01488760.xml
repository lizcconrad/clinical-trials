    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study was to evaluate feed-forward contraction of the transversus
      abdominis and thickness of the transversus abdominis, obliquus internus, and obliquus
      externus during calm and standardized respiration in low back pain patients and pain-free
      subjects.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Low back pain patients have alterations in abdominal wall function, especially in the
      feed-forward activation of transversus muscle during limbs movements. However, there are no
      reports on the abdominal function in low back pain patients during physiological respiratory
      movement.
