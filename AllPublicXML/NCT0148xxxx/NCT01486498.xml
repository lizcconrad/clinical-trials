    <textblock>
      Grass pollen and house dust mites (HDM) are the most common allergens causing allergic
      rhino-conjunctivitis (RC) and/or asthma (A). Subcutaneous allergen specific immunotherapy
      (SCIT) reduces symptoms and use of medication. The purpose of SABAL is to assess the effect
      of SCIT on disease severity classifications in terms of number of days affected- and sick
      days on patients with grass pollen and/or HDM induced disease. These outcome measures will be
      gathered in one single measure: Quality Adjusted Life Years (QALY)

        The intervention group consisted of 254 patients receiving subcutaneous allergen specific
        immunotherapy (SCIT) with grass pollen and/or house dust mite extracts. The control group
        consisted of 317 patients with grass pollen and/or house dust mite allergy, who were not
        receiving SCIT.
