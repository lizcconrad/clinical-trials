  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The use of capecitabine based preoperative chemoradiation and adjuvant chemotherapy is
      standard treatment of locally advanced rectal cancer. It has reduced local recurrence rate to
      less than 10%, but has only had limited effect on overall survival due to the constantly high
      (more than 30%) rate of distant metastasis.

      Complete eradication of the primary tumour observed in the histopathological specimen
      (pathological complete response, pCR) correlates with a favourable overall prognosis so
      obtaining a pCR might be beneficial. The aim of the study is to investigate whether the
      addition of capecitabine based chemotherapy before preoperative chemoradiation and also
      before the operation improves pathological complete remission rate in locally advanced rectal
      cancer with acceptable toxicity. Secondary objectives are to evaluate pathological
      downstaging rate, histopathological R0 resection rate,sphincter preservation rate,
      perioperative surgical complication rate, local control, DFS, OS, late toxicity and quality
      of life.
