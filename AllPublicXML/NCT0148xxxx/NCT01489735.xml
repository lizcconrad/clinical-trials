  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There are three main directions for use GerdQ in practice. First of all, GerdQ can be used to
      diagnose GERD with an accuracy comparable to the accuracy of diagnosis of GERD by the
      specialist (gastroenterologist). Using GerdQ can evaluate the impact of disease on the
      patient's life and help in choosing treatment of GERD, as well as direct assessment of
      treatment efficacy.

      In connection with mentioned above, this study is devoted to the estimation of possibility to
      use GerdQ in routine practice of Russian physicians.
