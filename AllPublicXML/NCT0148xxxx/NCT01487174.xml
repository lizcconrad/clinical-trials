  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study involves treatment with KD019 or erlotinib in patients with Non-small cell lung
      cancer (NSCLC) who have progressed after first- or second- line chemotherapy. It is
      hypothesized that KD019 can prolong survival compared with erlotinib.

  <overall_status>Terminated</overall_status>
  <why_stopped>
    Kadmon has made a business decision to terminate the study due to slow enrollment. Note the
    decision to terminate the study was not related to safety issues
