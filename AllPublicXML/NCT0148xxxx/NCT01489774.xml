      Study objectives

        -  To evaluate the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of escalating single oral
           doses of CJ-12406 in healthy male subjects.

        -  To evaluate the pharmacodynamics of CJ-12406 after multiple oral administrations to
           healthy male subjects.

        -  To evaluate the effect of food on the pharmacokinetic of a single oral dose of CJ-12406
           in healthy male subjects.
