      The aim of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of an anticholinesterase treatment in
      patients aged 75 and over, hospitalized with delirium.

      Study type : Interventional Study design: randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study
      during one month and a 11-month follow-up

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Delirium affects up to 50% of hospitalized patients aged 75 and over. Delirium increases risk
      of comorbid illness, hospital length of stay, institutionalization, and death. Patients with
      diagnosed or undiagnosed cognitive impairment are at risk to develop delirium. In a
      prospective study, half of elderly patients with delirium seen in the emergency department
      had cognitive impairment.

      Hypothesis: cholinesterase inhibitors reduce duration and severity of delirium

      Main objective:

      - to assess the efficacy of cholinesterase inhibitors in patients aged 75 and over
      hospitalized with delirium

      Secondary objectives:

        -  to describe at one year the percentage of these patients who have a diagnosis of
           Alzheimer's disease and associated disorders

        -  to assess the sensitivity to cholinesterase inhibitors in the sub-group of patients with
           a diagnosis of dementia at one year Design and methods Multicenter, randomized,
           controlled study with two parallel arms: a rivastigmine group and a placebo group. The
           study includes a treatment period of one month and a follow-up of 11 months.

      Evaluation of the delirium severity will be conducted with DRS-R98 severity each day during
      the hospitalization.

      At day 14, according to DRS-R98 severity score, interruption of treatment or upward dose
      titration At day 30, last treatment (active or placebo) administration and evaluation with
      CAM, DRS-R98 severity, MMSE and DSM IV dementia criteria. In case of dementia diagnosis,
      investigator (MD) will identify the etiologic diagnosis.

      At month 3 and 12, evaluation with CAM, DRS-R98 severity, MMSE and DSM IV dementia criteria,
      number of consultation and hospitalization. In case of dementia diagnosis, , investigator
      (MD) will identify the etiologic diagnosis.
