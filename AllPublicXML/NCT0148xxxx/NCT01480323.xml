  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The current clinical trial shall clarify a synergistic effect with regards to efficiency by
      the combination of intratumoral injection of interleukin-2 (IL-2) and the intra-venous
      application of ipilimumab.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Intratumoral injection of interleukin-2 (IL-2) into melanoma metastases is a highly efficient
      local treatment. Furthermore, a systemic effect is assumed based on the observation of a
      favorable long term outcome. However, objective responses in untreated lesions have not been
      observed yet. Ipilimumab seems to be efficient in a subset of treated patients by inhibition
      of down-regulation of tumor-specific cellular immune-responses. In the context of the
      proposed trial, we assume (i) that ipilimumab could potentiate systemic melanoma-specific
      immune responses, which are primarily induced by intratumoral IL-2 and (ii) that these immune
      responses become more effective with regards to not IL-2 injected distant lesions. Therefore
      we assume a synergistic effect with regards to efficiency by the combination.
