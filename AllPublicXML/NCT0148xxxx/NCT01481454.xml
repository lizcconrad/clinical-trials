    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to assess the safety profile of a quadrivalent influenza vaccine
      (QIV) and to demonstrate that 3 different industrial lots of QIV induce an equivalent immune
      response in children/adolescents (9 to 17 years of age) and adults (18 to 60 years of age).

      Primary Objective:

        -  To describe the safety profile (injection site reactions and systemic events) of each
           vaccine during the 21 days following vaccination, and serious adverse events (including
           adverse events of special interest) throughout the study in all adult and
           child/adolescent participants.

      Secondary Objectives:

        -  To demonstrate that the 3 different industrial lots of quadrivalent influenza vaccine
           (QIV) induce an equivalent immune response at 21 days post-vaccination in both age
           groups (lot consistency)

        -  To describe the compliance of the immunogenicity of QIV to the European Medicines Agency
           Note for Guidance (NfG) (CPMP/BWP/214/96) in each age group.

      All participants will receive a single injection of their assigned vaccine during Visit 1.
      They will be followed up for safety and immunogenicity through Day 21 post-vaccination (Visit
      2), and also monitored for safety for up to 6 months post-vaccination.
