    <textblock>
      Colonoscopy withdrawal times are a critical element in determining quality of colonoscopy;
      however, few studies have evaluated specific factors that may influence the duration of
      withdrawal, and specifically short withdrawal times. Other factors affecting polyp detection
      rate, one element of quality of colonoscopy, also need further study. By collecting data on
      hundreds of colonoscopies performed by 9 endoscopists, our goal was to identify factors
      associated with withdrawal time, inappropriately short withdrawal times, and polyp detection
      rate during colonoscopy.

      Background:

      Colonoscopy withdrawal times are a critical element in determining quality of colonoscopy;
      however, few studies have evaluated specific factors that may influence the duration of
      withdrawal, and specifically short withdrawal times. Other factors affecting polyp detection
      rate, one element of quality of colonoscopy, also need further study.

      Objective:

      To identify factors associated with withdrawal time, inappropriately short withdrawal times,
      and polyp detection rate during colonoscopy.

      Design:

      Data were prospectively collected (05/08-06/09) on 802 colonoscopies conducted by 9 blinded
      endoscopists, including patient age and sex, indication, colonoscope insertion and withdrawal
      time, biopsies performed, number/size of polyps and method of resection, bowel preparation
      quality, time of day, day of week, endoscopist, position of the procedure within the
      endoscopist's slate, and call status of the endoscopist.

      Setting:

      This study was conducted at a single tertiary care hospital, St. Paul's Hospital, in
      Vancouver, British Columbia.
