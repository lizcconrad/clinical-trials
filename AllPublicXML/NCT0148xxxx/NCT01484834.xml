  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this research was to investigate different intervention strategies in the
      workplace and their impact on quality of life of workers from companies in the city of
      Londrina, Parana, Brazil.

      The interventions were composed by exercise in the workplace and educational interventions.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The workplace has special features about human behaviors. Studies (Shepard 1996, Pratt 2008)
      has shown that workers participate of this kind of health promotion programs for various
      reasons: One reason is the convenience of doing something without having to look for it;
      another reason is group support, many workers who share difficulties due to their working
      demands can find support in each other, so that they could change health behavior.
      Furthermore there are patterns of formal and informal communication that can contribute to
      help more people to become healthier making their environment better. Finally, the norms of a
      corporate behavior can unite the group of workers seeking same objectives.

      Additionally the literature has shown that adults increased workload, job insecurity and
      pressure to perform tasks (Sparks 1997). These facts has been shown that workplace is
      different from community based interventions and leisure interventions.

      The outcomes proposed to study are different from other studies since the interventions focus
      changes in behaviors. Sedentary behavior has shown to have 23% of deaths from major chronic
      disease (WHO 2002).

      As the populations rises around the world and with the prolonged life expectancies, the
      number of people with chronic diseases will raise (WHO 2006). By having positive changes in
      health behavior the costs of public health can be reduced. Studying different types of
      interventions and testing its efficacy in different places can help the policy makers to
      create healthier environments.

      There are strategies being developed in the workplace, but its efficacy is being challenged.
      There are some researches that show no evidence to prove the continuity of these
      interventions and there are evidences proving the opposite, positive changes in clinical
      outcomes as diabetes, blood pressure and elevated blood cholesterol. In addition some
      measures as BMI, anthropometric, fitness level have shown good association as prediction of
      development of chronic disease with low cost (Dishman 2004).

    <description>The instrument contains 80 questions, of which 67 were structured in 5 points Lickert Scale. QVS-80 has four domains: Health Domain (Health) Physical activity (PA), occupational environment domain (AO) and perception of QoL (QOL). The health domain is composed of 30 questions, and the thirteen initial questions refer to history of the existence of chronic diseases such as hypertension, diabetes, obesity, dyslipidemias, bronchitis, allergic rhinitis and cancer; the remaining questions relate to lifestyle and living habits, such as quality of sleep, smoking and consumption of alcohol. The domain of physical activity consists of 15 questions on physical activity. The Domain workplace consists of 11 questions about the physical activity at work and occupational environment. The Domain perception of QoL consists of 24 questions about personal characteristics, and autonomy. The syntax of QVS-80 put the results in a scale of 0 -100 points (the higher the better).</description>

    <description>The level of physical activity was evaluated by the questionnaire of quality of life. (QVS-80). The physical activity domain is composed of 15 questions considering the ammount of physical activity practiced during leisure time. The instrument is structured in 5 points Lickert Scale. The syntax of QVS-80 put the results in a scale of 0 -100 points (the higher the better).</description>

    <description>The occupational environment was assessed by the quality of life questionnaire. (QVS-80). It considers physical aspects like accessibility and psycologic aspects such as stress. The domain consists of 11 questions about occupational environment. The syntax of QVS-80 put the results in a scale of 0 -100 points (the higher the better).</description>

The interventions with physical exercise in the workplace, were performed in the morning shift and had duration of three months with 15 minutes each and were applied three times per week every other day. In order to keep the workers motivated and participating in the exercise in the workplace, the sessions were very varied, using broomstick, latex tubes, exercises in pairs, massage, sitting exercises and relaxation on mats.</description>

        <description>The instrument contains 80 questions, of which 67 were structured in 5 points Lickert Scale. QVS-80 has four domains: Health Domain (Health) Physical activity (PA), occupational environment domain (AO) and perception of QoL (QOL). The health domain is composed of 30 questions, and the thirteen initial questions refer to history of the existence of chronic diseases such as hypertension, diabetes, obesity, dyslipidemias, bronchitis, allergic rhinitis and cancer; the remaining questions relate to lifestyle and living habits, such as quality of sleep, smoking and consumption of alcohol. The domain of physical activity consists of 15 questions on physical activity. The Domain workplace consists of 11 questions about the physical activity at work and occupational environment. The Domain perception of QoL consists of 24 questions about personal characteristics, and autonomy. The syntax of QVS-80 put the results in a scale of 0 -100 points (the higher the better).</description>
