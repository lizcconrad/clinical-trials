        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Male or female subjects ≥ 18 years at the time of signing informed consent.

          2. Subject is diagnosed with symptomatic multiple myeloma based on the International
             Myeloma Working Group Diagnostic Criteria (Kyle 2009):

               -  Monoclonal plasma cells in the bone marrow ≥ 10% and/or presence of a
                  biopsy-proven plasmacytoma.

               -  Monoclonal protein present in the serum and/or urine. If no monoclonal protein is
                  detected (non-secretory disease), then ≥ 30% monoclonal bone marrow plasma cells
                  and/or a biopsy-proven plasmacytoma is required.

               -  Myeloma-related organ dysfunction

          3. The myeloma disease burden must be measurable with at least one of the following
             criteria (Durie et al. 2006):

               -  Serum M-protein ≥ 10 g/l

               -  Urine M-protein ≥ 200 mg/24 h

               -  Involved FLC ≥ 100 mg/l provided serum FLC ratio is abnormal

               -  Bone marrow plasma cells &gt; 30%

          4. Subject has a Karnofsky performance status of ≥ 60.

          5. Voluntary written informed consent before performance of any study-related procedure
             not part of normal medical care, with the understanding that consent may be withdrawn
             by the subject at any time without prejudice to future medical care.

          6. Subject is willing and able to comply with the protocol as judged by the investigator.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Any prior systemic therapy for multiple myeloma.

          2. Other therapies such as biologic therapy and chemotherapy less than 3 months prior to
             screening.

          3. Any prior treatment with doxorubicin or other anthracycline.

          4. Concurrent or recent (less than 2 weeks prior to Screening) radiotherapy or surgery.

          5. Prior glucocorticoid treatment of multiple myeloma exceeding dexamethasone 20mg/day
             for a maximum of 7 days. Topical glucocorticosteroid therapy to treat non-malignant
             comorbid disorders is permitted.

          6. More than or equal to grade 2 peripheral neuropathy according to the NCI-CTC criteria
             on clinical examination within 14 days before enrolment (Day 1 of Cycle 1).

          7. Evidence of mucosal or internal bleeding and/or platelet counts &lt; 50 x 10^9/l.
             Platelet transfusions may not be used to meet PLT eligibility criteria.

          8. Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) &lt; 1 x 10^9/l. Growth factors may not be used to meet
             ANC eligibility criteria.

          9. Hemoglobin &lt; 5.0 mmol/l. The subject may be included after correction of the
             hemoglobin level by transfusion or treatment with erythropoietin.

         10. Alanine aminotransferase (ALAT) &gt; 2 x ULN.

         13. Any condition, including laboratory abnormalities, that in the opinion of the

             one additional effective method (condom, diaphragm, cervical cap) AT THE SAME TIME, at
             least 28 days before she or he starts ACVDL and for at least 28 days after the last
             dose of ACVDL.

         17. Serious medical or psychiatric illness likely to interfere with participation in this
             clinical study.
