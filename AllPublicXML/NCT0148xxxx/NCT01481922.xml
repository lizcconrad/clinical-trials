  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is intended to help guide the choice of needle diameter when performing a lumbar
      puncture.

      Smaller spinal needles have been shown to decrease rate of adverse events such as post-lumbar
      puncture headache and hearing loss.

      The main drawback to using smaller needles is diminished flow rate; some textbooks recommend
      using needles no smaller than 22 gauge because of the slow flow rate though others recommend
      smaller needles, namely 22-24 gauge.

      Some authors have described a successful use of spinal needles as small as 25 gauge when
      performing a lumbar puncture.

      The investigators do not believe that the flow-rate difference between 22 and 24 gauge
      needles is significant enough to justify using the larger needles.

      The investigators trial will compare the Whitacre 22 gauge and Whitacre 24 gauge needles for
      flow rate, and incidence of the known complications of pain during procedure and backache at
      8 and 15 days post-procedure.

      The investigators will also look at whether smaller needles are associated with less pain
      during the procedure and less backache the next 2 weeks after the procedure.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this randomized, double-blinded clinical trial is to assess whether a 24 gauge
      spinal needle can provide an acceptable flow rate of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) when compared
      to the traditionally used 22 gauge needle.

      Smaller needles, according to The Therapeutics and Technology Assessment Subcommittee of the
      American Academy of Neurology are 'associated with reduced frequency of post-lumbar puncture
      headache (Level A recommendation).'

      Given that flow rate of CSF is the limiting factor when choosing a spinal needle gauge, two
      previous studies have compared various needle sizes for adequacy of flow. These studies,
      however, have important limitations and have not led to a clear consensus in clinical
      practice. For instance, one study used a 0,9 % solution of sodium chloride at room
      temperature, the other used an 'artificial CSF solution' of unknown viscosity and nature.

      Patients referred to the neurological day center of the Montreal Neurological
      Institute/Hospital for lumbar puncture will be recruited to the study. Participants will be
      randomized to have the puncture with a Whitacre 22 or 24 gauge needle.
