  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research is to evaluate and validate the performance of non-invasive
      imaging modalities for assessment of skin. A pressure cuff occlusion will be used to
      stimulate blood flow dynamic that these instruments are designed to sense. The researcher
      currently plan to assess only basic feasibility of the imaging instruments.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary reason for including pressure cuff occlusion in this protocol is to test the
      performance of Multi-Spectral Imaging and Laser Speckle Imaging can measure in the full range
      of vascular conditions ranging from ischemic (under-perfused or unsaturated) to hyperemic
      (over-perfused and over-saturated).

        1. .Modulated Imaging a non-contact optical imaging technology can detect the concentration
           of total hemoglobin, deoxygenated and oxygenated hemoglobin in absolute amounts in units
           of millimoles / unit volume of tissue measured.

        2. . Laser Speckle Imaging a non-contact optical imaging technology consists of a coherent
           light source, camera, and image acquisition system. This image device can measure and
           compare relative flow in vasculature at varied time points.
