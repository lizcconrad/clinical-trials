  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Composites and Urinary Bisphenol-A Study (CUBS) is a clinical study of dental composite
      for its effects on urinary bisphenol-A levels. The study will enroll approximately 139
      children recruited from study-affiliated clinical sites in New England.The primary aim of
      CUBS is to test the hypothesis that urinary bisphenol-A (BPA) concentrations increase after
      composite restoration placement. BPA is a chemical used in the synthesis of matrix monomers
      and has been shown to have harmful effects in toxicological studies in laboratory animals.
      Currently it is unknown whether dental composite restorative materials containing monomers
      that are derived from BPA result in chronic low-dose BPA exposure in children.

      Study subjects will be new or existing patients of the clinical sites who are in need of
      dental restorations, meet all eligibility criteria, and provide informed consent/assent to
      participate. Subjects will be asked to provide two pre-treatment urine samples and three
      post-treatment samples. Urine collections occur next-day and 14 days after treatment, with
      one final urine collected approximately 6 months later (marking the end of the subject's
      active study participation). Data will be collected from the clinician's standard oral
      examination (including new and existing dental treatments), the data collector's measurements
      of height and weight and interviews administered to the parents/guardians to assess
      sociodemographic and other relevant factors (e.g., recent food/beverage consumption).
      Confidentiality will be maintained by assigning each subject a unique number and using only
      this number or aggregate data in all study reports. All study records will be securely
      maintained with access limited to essential study personnel only.

    <measure>Change in Urinary Bisphenol A Level (BPA) From Baseline to 6 Months</measure>
    <time_frame>From Baseline to 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>BPA was measured, corrected for specific gravity, in ng/mL. We corrected BPA for specific gravity (SG) using the formula: BPA * [(meanSG - 1)/(SG - 1)], where meanSG is the mean of the SG for the samples examined. Urine samples were collected twice pre-treatment and the geometric mean of BPA at each pre-treatment visit was used as the baseline BPA. Change in BPA was computed using BPA at follow-up minus BPA at baseline. Analysis of change in BPA was done using the arithmetic mean.</description>

        <title>Change in Urinary Bisphenol A Level (BPA) From Baseline to 6 Months</title>
        <description>BPA was measured, corrected for specific gravity, in ng/mL. We corrected BPA for specific gravity (SG) using the formula: BPA * [(meanSG – 1)/(SG – 1)], where meanSG is the mean of the SG for the samples examined. Urine samples were collected twice pre-treatment and the geometric mean of BPA at each pre-treatment visit was used as the baseline BPA. Change in BPA was computed using BPA at follow-up minus BPA at baseline. Analysis of change in BPA was done using the arithmetic mean.</description>

        <title>Change in Urinary Bisphenol A Level (BPA) From Baseline to 1 Day After the Second Dental Treatment</title>
        <description>BPA was measured, corrected for specific gravity, in ng/mL. We corrected BPA for specific gravity (SG) using the formula: BPA * [(meanSG – 1)/(SG – 1)], where meanSG is the mean of the SG for the samples examined. Urine samples were collected twice pre-treatment and the geometric mean of BPA at each pre-treatment visit was used as the baseline BPA. Change in BPA was computed using BPA at 1 day after the second dental treatment minus BPA at baseline. The second dental treatment was scheduled as per treatment needs and the schedules of the dentist and patient. It was typically 3-4 weeks after the first dental treatment. Analysis of change in BPA was done using the arithmetic mean.</description>
