  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Otitis media is more common in young children and it is estimated that 75% of all children
      experience at least one episode before the age of three. Otitis media is one of the common
      pediatric diagnoses and recurrent episodes account for the most commonly performed surgical
      procedure. Despite this a high degree of inaccuracy exists in diagnosis of this condition
      which depends on subjective assessment of the ear drum via direct visualization using an
      otoscope. Researcher can use Diffuse optical spectroscopy and diffuse optical imaging for the
      analysis of ear drum and the middle ear.

      The research can use low energy laser signal light from Diffuse optical spectroscopy that is
      harmless to the tissues and sends them into the ear canal to measure the tissue optical
      properties including the absorption of the laser signal and the amount of signal that will be
      backscattered by the ear drum. These measurements will then be analyzed using a
      microprocessor to determine presence of fluid or inflammation of the eardrum.

      Diffuse optical spectroscopy an imaging method use near- infrared light to measure absolute
      tissue concentrations of oxyhemoglobin, deoxyhemoglobin, water, and lipids, as well as subtle
      changes in water and protein binding states
