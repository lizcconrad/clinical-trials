  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This clinical study is a scientific study on patients who do not have any limbal stem cells.
      In this clinical study tissue is taken from the inside of the mouth, and cells from that
      tissue (epithelial cells) will be grown to form a multilayered cell-sheet, called CAOMECS,
      which is then transplanted onto the cornea. This transplantation method should repair the
      damage of the cornea.

      The aim of this study is to see if the transplantation of CAOMECS renews the surface of the
      eye, by preventing the growth of the conjunctiva over the cornea and stopping new small blood
      vessels forming.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open clinical study without a control group, which means that all patients will be
      given the study treatment (CAOMECS).

      Adults as well as minor patients can participate in this clinical trial.

      CAOMECS is undergoing a clinical trial, which means that it has not yet been officially
      approved for the treatment of this disease. Up to now it was clinically tested in France, on
      26 people with limbal stem cell loss.

      Study objective

      The objective of this study is to restore the ocular surface epithelium of patients with
      total LSCD by preventing or reducing recurrent conjunctivalization and neovascularization up
      to 12 months post-transplantation.

      Methodology

      This is a prospective, open, multi-center study with CAOMECS in patients with total LSCD.
      Stem cells will be isolated from an oral mucosa biopsy and will be grown in cell culture. The
      resultant epithelial cell-sheets will then be transplanted to the ocular surface of the
      respective patients under general anesthesia. After transplantation patients may be
      hospitalized according to routine clinical practice.

      Overall, the study will consist of a screening visit where eligibility will be evaluated, the
      day of the biopsy, the day before the transplantation where baseline data will be evaluated,
      the transplantation (day 0), and a follow-up period consisting of nine visits at days 1, 5,
      and 10 and months 1, 3, 6, 12, 24, and 36. Other visits as clinically indicated may also
      occur.
