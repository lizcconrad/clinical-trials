      Study in healthy volunteer to see effect of AZD5069 and placebo on neutrophil number and
      function (phagocytosis and oxidative burst) in the circulation, following a burst of
      strenuous exercise and following subcutaneous injection of granulocyte-colony stimulating
      factor (G-CSF)
