  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will be performed only at the Jewish General Hospital. It will investigate the
      effect of treatment with aliskiren, an inhibitor of renin, a substance produced by the kidney
      that constricts arteries and raises blood pressure, on the blood vessels, specifically the
      arteries, of subjects who have diabetes and elevated blood pressure (hypertension).

      To investigate blood vessels, different techniques will be used. For large arteries, these
      will be studied by non invasive methods using detection of the pulse wave or using ultrasound
      over the skin of the neck, the wrist and the groin. To study small vessels, the investigators
      will perform a biopsy on the buttock, under local anesthesia, and obtain a small sample of
      tissue from under the skin, from which the vessels will be dissected. The investigators have
      performed many hundreds of these small biopsies over the past 20 years for similar studies
      without any complications. The biopsies are very well tolerated. From this research the
      investigators will thus be able to learn what the structure and function of these vessels is
      in these patients, in comparison to a normal healthy group.

      The hypertensive diabetic subjects will then be assigned by chance (randomized trial) to
      treatment with the renin inhibitor aliskiren or a comparator, the diuretic
      hydrochlorothiazide. Aliskiren is a relatively new drug used to treat hypertension that is
      very well tolerated and is now being evaluated in numerous trials in hypertensive diabetic
      individuals. The diuretic is a well-know agent used to treat high blood pressure now for many
      years, and which is very well tolerated. Physicians, nurses and scientists involved in the
      study will be unaware of who is receiving which drug, as will be the patients (this is the
      meaning of double-blind trial). However, if there is any problem, the secret code will be
      broken and the individual withdrawn from the study. Subjects will be treated for a year, and
      the study procedures (non invasive and the biopsy) repeated at 6 months and after one year of
      treatment. During the study, blood samples will be drawn and urine collected at certain
      intervals to ensure safety of the treatment.

      Once tissues are obtained they will be studied in the laboratory. The study of the vessels
      will allow treatment us to determine how the treatment with the renin inhibitor aliskiren
      affects the structure and function as well as cellular and molecular aspects of arteries of
      hypertensive diabetic persons. The investigators expect these studies to provide us knowledge
      on mechanisms and perhaps new targets for future therapies of cardiovascular disease and
      hypertension.
