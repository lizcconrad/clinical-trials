  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To compare the development of posterior capsule opacification (PCO) between eyes with and
      without a history of diabetes mellitus (DM) after single-piece hydrophobic acrylic
      intraocular lens (IOL) implantation 4 years postoperatively.Diabetes mellitus would not
      increase the incidence of PCO at 4 years.

    <textblock>
      There is a paucity of available literature that prospectively evaluates the development of
      PCO with the single-piece hydrophobic acrylic IOL implantation in diabetic versus
      non-diabetic eyes on a long-term basis. Therefore, this study was designed to compare the
      degree of PCO after cataract surgery between diabetic and age-matched non-diabetic patients.
      This prospective, observational case control study comprised patients who underwent
      phacoemulsification .The patients were asked to return for postoperative follow-up visits at
      1 month, 1 year and 4 years.

      the digital images were analyzed for PCO .

Patients with uncomplicated age-related cataract who were otherwise healthy constituted the controls (n=75 eyes).</description>
