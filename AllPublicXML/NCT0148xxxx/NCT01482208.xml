      Study will verify ability of infant Hydration Monitor (IHM) to assess changes of hydration
      status in newborns and infants by means of ultrasound velocity measurements through muscle
      tissues. Changes of tissue hydration will be followed during first days of life in newborns
      and in acute diarrhea in small children during re-hydration therapy. Weighting and clinical
      dehydration symptoms will be used as controls.
