  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Preclinical data in lung cancer cell lines showed that EGFR mutation can potentially be a
      positive predictor for sensitivity to BKM120. Furthermore, when the erlotinib-resistant model
      H1975 (LR858 and T790M mutation) was treated with BKM120, significant tumor control was
      observed (Novartis internal data). Therefore, combining BKM120 with erlotinib could
      potentially down-modulate PI3K-Akt activity resulting in a synergistic effect on cell growth
      inhibition and enhancing the response to erlotinib.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicentered, open-label, non-randomized Phase II study of BKM120 and erlotinib in
      patients with advanced NSCLC previously sensitive to erlotinib. After six patients are
      enrolled and complete one treatment cycle a safety analysis of adverse events (AEs) will be
      conducted to assure there are no unexpected or prohibitive toxicities of the combination. The
      planned study enrollment will continue to up to 37 patients. Duration of a patient's
      participation in the study will vary. Treatment will continue as long as the patient is
      benefitting from the treatment, has no evidence of disease progression, and does not meet any
      criteria for discontinuation or withdrawal.

Stable Disease (SD) is defined as neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR, nor sufficient increase to qualify for progressive disease, taking as reference the smallest (nadir) sum LD since start of treatment.</description>
