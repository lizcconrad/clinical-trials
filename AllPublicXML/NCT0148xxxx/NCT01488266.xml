  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to compare the efficacy and safety of aripiprazole as
      adjunctive therapy versus switching to different class of antidepressants for treating major
      depressive disorder partially or minimally responsive to ongoing antidepressant treatment.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Most guidelines have suggested that those nonresponders or partial responders should be
      considered for a switch, combination or augmentation of treatment. Traditional augmentation
      agents, lithium, triiodothyronine (T3), buspirone, dopamine agonists, and stimulants have
      been commonly used for this patient population with limited supporting data. Recently,
      augmentation of atypical antipsychotics with antidepressant therapy has become a more
      commonly accepted treatment practice. This strategy has proven to be useful for enhancement
      of antidepressant effect, showing increased remission rates and early treatment effects on
      core depressive symptoms, and comorbid symptoms as well as antidepressant- mediated side
      effects (e.g., sexual dysfunction). Although, we have some limited treatment options to treat
      such patients as described above, it is not clear which treatment option would be best or
      acceptable for those patients in clinical practice yet.

      Among above augmentation agents, aripiprazole is the first drug approved by U.S. FDA. as an
      augmentation therapy to antidepressants in the treatment of patients with MDD showing
      imminent efficacy and reliable safety profile through adequately-powered well-designed
      controlled clinical trials.

    <description>patients who are randomly assigned to adjunctive aripiprazole are treated with a starting dose of 2.5 (or 5) mg/day of aripiprazole, which can be increased weekly in 2.5~5mg/day increments to a maximum dose of 15 mg/day based on assessment of tolerability and clinical response. Doses can be decreased at any visit, based on tolerability; They continue to receive the same fixed-dose of the previously used antidepressant throughout the study period when patient is assigned to aripiprazole augmentation group.</description>
