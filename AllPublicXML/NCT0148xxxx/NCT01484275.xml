  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of siltuximab compared with
      placebo (an inactive substance that is compared with a drug to test whether the drug has a
      real effect in a clinical trial) in patients with high-risk smoldering multiple myeloma
      (SMM).

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized (treatment assigned by chance), double-blind (neither patient nor
      investigator know which treatment is given), multicenter study to evaluate the safety and
      efficacy of siltuximab compared with placebo in patients with high-risk SMM (defined as bone
      marrow plasma cells &gt;=10% and either serum monoclonal protein &gt;=3 g/dL, or abnormal free
      light chain ratio &lt;0.126 or &gt;8 and serum M-protein &lt;3 g/dL but &gt;=1 g/dL). Approximately 74
      patients will receive either siltuximab or placebo by intravenous (IV, injection into a vein)
      infusion every 4 weeks until progression to symptomatic multiple myeloma, unacceptable
      toxicity, withdrawal of consent, or the end of the study (approximately 4 years after
      randomization of the last patient). Efficacy, pharmacokinetics, immunogenicity, and potential
      biomarkers will be assessed at time points defined in the protocol. Patient reported outcomes
      (European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer, Quality of Life
      Questionnaire-Core 30, Brief Pain Inventory [worst pain], Non-Chemotherapy Anemia Symptom
      Scale) will be administered before any procedure or treatment at each visit. Patient safety
      will be monitored throughout the study.
