  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Water method with water exchange has been shown to reduce medication requirement and pain
      experienced during colonoscopy. It increases the success rate of cecal intubation in sedated
      and unsedated patients undergoing screening colonoscopy. Exchange of water during scope
      insertion minimizes distension of the colonic lumen and decreases loop formation. Exclusion
      of air from the colon during insertion by omission of air insufflations and suction removal
      of residual air prevent elongation of the colon. These maneuvers facilitate colonoscopy
      insertion in average patients and may enhance the success of difficult colonoscopy.

      Prior abdominal or pelvic surgery is an independent factor for difficult colonoscopy, the
      probable adhesion may change the anatomy and increase the discomfort of patients. We
      postulate that these patients may benefit from using the water method for colonoscopy. In
      this proposal we test the hypothesis that compared with conventional air insufflations the
      water method with water exchange significantly enhances the success rate of cecal intubation
      in patients with prior abdominal or pelvic surgery.

      The aim of the study is to compare the outcome of colonoscopy using the water method versus
      the conventional air method in patients with prior abdominal or pelvic surgery. The primary
      outcome is cecal intubation success rate. The secondary outcomes include cecal intubation
      time, maximum pain score during colonoscopy, overall pain score after colonoscopy and adenoma
      detection rate.

    <description>Colonoscopy will be performed without medications and aided by water infusion in-lieu of air insufflation during insertion of the colonoscope. The water infusion involves putting warm sterile water into the colon to open up the colon for advancement of the colonoscope until the end of the colon (cecum) is reached. The water is delivered via a needle adaptor or the built-in scope irrigation channel by an infusion pump equipped with a foot switch which will be controlled by the endoscopist. Infused water used to cleanse residual fecal matter will be suctioned as needed to clear the colonic lumen.</description>
