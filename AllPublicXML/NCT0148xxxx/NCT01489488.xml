      Primary objective: To determine oral bioavailability of the liquid formulation intended for
      pediatric use and potential food effects in healthy adults.

      Secondary objective: To evaluate safety and tolerability measured by physical examination
      findings, vital signs, electrocardiogram (ECG), laboratory parameters, and adverse events
      (AEs).
