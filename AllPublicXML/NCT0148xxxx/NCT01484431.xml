    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study to see how much study drug is in the blood after dosing children
      with pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) and to establish the correct dose for further
      clinical research.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      During Period I, tadalafil will be administered orally, once daily, at a low dose for
      approximately 5 weeks followed by a high dose for approximately 5 weeks. Dose levels are
      calculated based on body weight cohorts. Heavy weight cohort &gt;=40 kg, middle weight cohort
      &gt;=25 kg to &lt;40 kg. Light weight cohort&lt;25 kg. Participants who complete Period 1 may continue
      taking tadalafil in Period 2 for at least 2 years. Starting dose will not exceed the maximum
      weight range dose established in Period 1 and may be adjusted based on available safety and
      efficacy information.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Currently have a diagnosis of PAH that is either:

               -  idiopathic (including hereditary), related to collagen vascular disease, related
                  to anorexigen use, associated with surgical repair, of at least 6 month duration,
                  of a congenital systemic to pulmonary shunt (for example, atrial septal defect,
                  ventricular septal defect, patent ductus arteriosus).

          -  Have a history of the diagnosis of PAH established by a resting mean pulmonary artery
             pressure ≥25 mm Hg, pulmonary artery wedge pressure ≤15 mm Hg, and a pulmonary
             vascular resistance (PVR) ≥3 Wood units via right heart catheterization. In the event
             that a pulmonary artery wedge pressure is unable to be obtained during right heart
             catheterization, participants with a left ventricular end diastolic pressure &lt;15 mm
             Hg, with normal left heart function, and absence of mitral stenosis on
             echocardiography can be eligible for enrollment

          -  Have a World Health Organization (WHO) functional class value of I, II or III at the
             time of enrollment

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Have pulmonary hypertension related to conditions other than specified above,
             including but not limited to chronic thromboembolic disease, portal pulmonary
             hypertension, left-sided heart disease or lung disease and hypoxia

          -  History of left-sided heart disease, including any of the following:

               -  clinically significant (pulmonary artery occlusion pressure [PAOP] 15 to 18 mm
                  Hg) aortic or mitral valve disease (that is, aortic stenosis, aortic
                  insufficiency, mitral stenosis, moderate or greater mitral regurgitation)

               -  pericardial constriction

               -  restrictive or congestive cardiomyopathy

               -  left ventricular ejection fraction &lt;40% by multigated radionucleotide angiogram
                  (MUGA), angiography, or echocardiography

               -  left ventricular shortening fraction &lt;22% by echocardiography

               -  life-threatening cardiac arrhythmias

               -  symptomatic coronary artery disease within 5 years of study entry as determined
                  by the physician

          -  History of atrial septostomy or Potts Shunt within 3 months before administration of
             study drug

          -  Unrepaired congenital heart disease
