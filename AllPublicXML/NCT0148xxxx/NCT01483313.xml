  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Animal studies showed that many general anesthetics might result in neuron apoptosis and
      neurocognitive impairment in the developing brain. However results from human studies are
      conflicted. In present study, the investigators examined the association between early
      exposure to anesthesia and surgery for minor surgery and intelligence changes in adolescence
      using the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children.
