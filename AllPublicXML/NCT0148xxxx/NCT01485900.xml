      Primary Objective:

        -  To assess the tolerability and safety of repeated oral ascending doses of SAR407899A in
           patients with moderate chronic kidney disease (CKD) on stable angiotensin converting
           enzyme-inhibitor (ACE-I)

      Secondary Objectives:

        -  To assess in patients with moderate CKD the effect of concomitant multiple dose of
           SAR407899A and ACE-Is on office and 24-hr ambulatory blood pressure and heart rate

        -  The effect of repeated multiple doses of SAR407899A on the pharmacodynamic response to
           ACE-Is (AcSDKP)

        -  The pharmacokinetic profile of repeated oral administration of SAR407899A during
           co-administration of ACE-Is
