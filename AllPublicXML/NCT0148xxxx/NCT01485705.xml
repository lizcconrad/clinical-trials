      The aim of the study is to determine the frequency of sub-optimal care in the initial care
      (before arrival at the intensive care unit) of children from &quot;West France regions&quot; suffering
      of severe bacterial infections.The characteristic &quot;optimal or not&quot; of the initial medical
      care will be determined by 2 independent experts, blinded from each other and blinded from
      the issue of the care. In case of a discordance between the two experts, a third expert will
      be demanded. Three possibilities of conclusion will be proposed to the experts: &quot;sure
      sub-optimal medical care&quot;, &quot;possible suboptimal care&quot; and &quot;optimal care&quot;.

    <intervention_name>Retrospective examination by experts whether care given fo child admitted at the ICU for suspicion of bacterial infection (not nosocomial) was optimal or not</intervention_name>
    <description>When child is admitted at Intensive Care Unit (ICU) for suspicion of bacterial infection that is not nosocomial, data on child's infection and cares received, is completed on an electronic Case Report Form (e-CRF) by Doctor of ICU. Characteristic &quot;optimal or not&quot; of initial medical care is then determined by the independent experts blinded from issue of the care.</description>
