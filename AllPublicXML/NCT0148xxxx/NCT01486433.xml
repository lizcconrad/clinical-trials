  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective is to determine the effect of multiple doses of Epanova® (omega fatty
      acids) on the pharmacokinetics (PK) of multiple 40 mg doses of simvastatin.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study is testing the hypothesis that there is no interaction between Epanova and
      concomitant administration of simvastatin and aspirin. No drug interaction will be claimed
      if, following concomitant administration of simvastatin, aspirin and Epanova or only
      simvastatin and aspirin, the 90% confidence intervals (CIs) for the geometric mean ratios
      (GMRs) of the back-transformed PK parameters, area under the plasma concentration versus time
      curve (AUC0-tau) and concentration at the end of a dosing interval (Cmax,ss), for simvastatin
      and beta- hydroxysimvastatin acid,fall within 80%-125%.

          2. Body mass index (BMI) ≥ 18 and ≤ 29.9 (kg/m2).

          3. Medically healthy with clinically insignificant screening results. Hemoglobin must be
             ≥ the lower limit of normal.

          4. Continuous non-smokers who haven't used nicotine-containing products for at least 6
             months prior to the first dose.

          5. Voluntarily consent to participate in the study and to follow the restrictions and
             procedures outlined for the study.

          6. Females must be of non-childbearing potential, and have undergone sterilization
             procedures at least 6 months prior to the first dose or be postmenopausal with
