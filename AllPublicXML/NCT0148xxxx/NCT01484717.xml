  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cigarette smoking remains the most common source of preventable morbidity and mortality in
      the United States, with in excess of $167 billion in economic costs per year. Contingency
      management (CM), in which tangible incentives are provided contingent on a target behavior
      like abstinence, is highly efficacious in improving substance abuse treatment outcomes and is
      receiving increased attention for smoking cessation. Expired carbon monoxide (CO) is the most
      common objective smoking status test used in smoking research and treatment. Unfortunately,
      multiple CO tests/day are typically required to detect all smoking and reinforce sustained
      abstinence. The resulting logistical and resource limitations greatly limit the application
      of this potentially powerful quit smoking toolset. This study addresses these limitations by
      examining the effectiveness of using interactive voice response technology (IVR) to implement
      CM. Smokers who want to quit (N = 90 randomized) will receive 2 quit preparation sessions
      based on public health guidelines for smoking cessation and set a target quit date.
      Participants will be randomly assigned to 1 of 2 treatment conditions: (a) IVR-S consisting
      of objective smoking status monitoring using IVR, telephone counseling and transdermal
      nicotine and (b) IVR-CM, consisting of the same monitoring, telephone counseling and
      transdermal nicotine plus IVR-based CM for smoking abstinence. It is hypothesized that
      abstinence rates will be higher in the IVR-CM condition compared to the IVR-S, supporting a
      combined IVR CM approach, and thereby greatly increasing the applicability of these powerful
      smoking cessation tools.
