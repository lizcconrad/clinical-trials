    <textblock>
      Study BEL115123 is a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, multinational study of
      belimumab (10 mg/kg) to investigate the efficacy and safety of belimumab in subjects with MG.
      The study will enroll male and female outpatients (&gt; or equal to 18 years of age) with a
      diagnosis of MG who are 1) acetylcholine receptor (AChR) antibody positive or muscle specific
      kinase (MuSK) antibody positive, 2) on current standard of care therapy, and 3) continue to
      exhibit signs of MG. The study will include 3 phases: a 4 week screening period, a 24 week
      treatment period, and a 12 week follow-up period. IP will be administered intravenously on
      Days 0, 14, 28 and then every 28 days through and including Week 20. At Week 24, primary
      outcomes will be obtained. Follow up evaluations will be conducted at Weeks 28, 32 and 36 for
      all subjects. The primary objective of this study is to assess the efficacy of belimumab as
      evaluated by the change in the quantitative myasthenia gravis (QMG) score.

    <measure>Mean Change From Baseline for Quantitative Myasthenia Gravis (QMG) Score at Week 24</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>The QMG is a 13 item ordinal scale which measures ocular, bulbar, extremity fatigue and strength, along with respiratory function. The total QMG score was calculated by adding the score of each of the 13 individual QMG questions. Possible scoring on the QMG range from 0 (normal) to 39 (severe). A lower score indicates a better clinical outcome. The QMG score at Baseline is the average of the screening and Week 0 Baseline scores. Change from Baseline was calculated by subtracting the Baseline value from the post-baseline value. The differences in adjusted least square means were presented (Belimumab 10 mg/kg minus Placebo). A negative treatment difference indicates benefit relative to placebo. The analysis method was Mixed-Model Repeated Measures adjusted for Treatment, Visit, Baseline QMG Score, Treatment by Visit, and Baseline QMG Score by Visit.</description>

        <title>Mean Change From Baseline for Quantitative Myasthenia Gravis (QMG) Score at Week 24</title>
        <description>The QMG is a 13 item ordinal scale which measures ocular, bulbar, extremity fatigue and strength, along with respiratory function. The total QMG score was calculated by adding the score of each of the 13 individual QMG questions. Possible scoring on the QMG range from 0 (normal) to 39 (severe). A lower score indicates a better clinical outcome. The QMG score at Baseline is the average of the screening and Week 0 Baseline scores. Change from Baseline was calculated by subtracting the Baseline value from the post-baseline value. The differences in adjusted least square means were presented (Belimumab 10 mg/kg minus Placebo). A negative treatment difference indicates benefit relative to placebo. The analysis method was Mixed-Model Repeated Measures adjusted for Treatment, Visit, Baseline QMG Score, Treatment by Visit, and Baseline QMG Score by Visit.</description>

        <title>Median Time to QMG Response Which is Sustained From Earliest Time Point at Which Improvement by &gt;=3 Points From Baseline is Observed and Maintained Through Week 24</title>
        <description>A sustained response during the treatment phase is when a participant improves by &gt;=3 points from Baseline at Week 12, and the participant maintains at least a 3 point improvement from Baseline through Week 24. The QMG is a 13 item ordinal scale which measures ocular, bulbar, extremity fatigue and strength, along with respiratory function. The total QMG score was calculated by adding the score of each of the 13 individual QMG questions. Possible scoring on the QMG range from 0 (normal) to 39 (severe). A lower score indicates a better clinical outcome. The QMG score at Baseline is the average of the screening and Week 0 Baseline scores.</description>

        <title>Mean Change From Baseline for QMG Score at Week 28, Week 32 and Week 36</title>
        <description>The QMG is a 13 item ordinal scale which measures ocular, bulbar, extremity fatigue and strength, along with respiratory function. Total QMG score was calculated by adding the score of each of the 13 individual QMG questions. Possible scoring on the QMG range from 0 (mild) to 39 (severe). A lower score indicates a better clinical outcome. The QMG score at baseline (BL) is the average of the screening and Week 0 BL scores. Change from BL was calculated by subtracting the BL value from the post-BL value. The differences in adjusted least square means are presented (Belimumab 10 mg/kg minus Placebo). A negative trt difference indicates benefit relative to placebo. Analysis method was Mixed-Model Repeated Measures adjusted for Trt, Visit, BL QMG Score, Trt by Visit and BL QMG Score by Visit. Only follow-up visits are presented but the analysis also includes all trt phase visits. Only those par. available at indicated time points (represented by n=X in the category titles) were analyzed.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants Worsening by &gt;=3 Points From Baseline Through to Week 24 in the MGC Score</title>
        <description>The total MGC score was calculated by adding the score of each of the 10 individual MGC questions. Possible total MGC scores range from 0 (normal) to 50 (severe). A lower score indicates a better clinical outcome. Baseline is defined as the participants last available assessment prior to initiation of study IV infusion. Proportions compared using exact analyses stratified by the observed median baseline score (&lt;= median, &gt; median). Exact odds ratios, double the exact one-sided p-values and exact confidence intervals were presented. Participants with missing data were assumed to have a worsening response.</description>

        <description>The total MGC score was calculated by adding the score of each of the 10 individual MGC questions. Possible total MGC scores range from 0 (normal) to 50 (severe). A lower score indicates a better clinical outcome. Baseline is defined as the participant's last available assessment prior to initiation of study IV infusion. Change from Baseline was calculated by subtracting the Baseline value from the post-BL value. The differences in adjusted least square means are presented (Belimumab 10 mg/kg minus Placebo). A negative treatment difference indicates benefit relative to placebo. The analysis method was Mixed-Model Repeated Measures adjusted for Treatment, Visit, Baseline MGC Score, Treatment by Visit, and Baseline MGC Score by Visit. Only follow-up visits are presented but the analysis also includes all treatment phase visits. Only those participants available at the indicated time points (represented by n=X in the category titles) were analyzed.</description>

        <description>The total MG-ADL score was calculated by adding the score of each of the 8 individual MG-ADL questions. Possible total MG-ADL scores ranges from 0 (normal) to 24 (severe). A lower score indicates a better clinical outcome. Baseline is defined as the participants last available assessment prior to initiation of study IV infusion. Change from Baseline was calculated by subtracting the Baseline value from the post-baseline value. The differences in adjusted least square means are presented (Belimumab 10 mg/kg minus Placebo). A negative treatment difference indicates benefit relative to placebo. The analysis method was Mixed-Model Repeated Measures adjusted for Treatment, Visit, Baseline MG-ADL Score, Treatment by Visit, and Baseline MG-ADL Score by Visit. Only those participants available at the indicated time points (represented by n=X in the category titles) were analyzed.</description>

        <description>The total MG-ADL score was calculated by adding the score of each of the 8 individual MG-ADL questions. Possible total MG-ADL scores range from 0 (normal) to 24 (severe). A lower score indicates a better clinical outcome. Baseline is defined as the participant's last available assessment prior to initiation of study IV infusion. Change from Baseline was calculated by subtracting the Baseline value from the post-Baseline value. The differences in adjusted least square means are presented (Belimumab 10 mg/kg minus Placebo). A negative treatment difference indicates benefit relative to placebo. The analysis method was Mixed-Model Repeated Measures adjusted for Treatment, Visit, Baseline MG-ADL Score, Treatment by Visit, and Baseline MG-ADL Score by Visit. Only follow-up visits are presented but the analysis also includes all treatment phase visits. Only those participants available at the indicated time points (represented by n=X in the category titles) were analyzed.</description>
