  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the study is to assess whether human subjects can be made tolerant
      to intravenously administered Crotoxin and achieve higher and more therapeutically effective
      doses levels without the previously reported adverse effects associated with bolus i.m.
      administration.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Crotoxin has been shown to induce neurotoxic tolerance in animals allowing them to receive
      high doses associated with effective anti-tumor activity in the absence of adverse side
      effects.

      The study plans to demonstrate this effect in human subjects using two dose escalation
      protocols; slow and fast. It is believed that this approach will prevent toxic side effects
      to subjects.

      The route of administration has not been employed clinically and is designed to avoid the
      myonecrotic effects of intramuscular injections. The target maximum dose is almost double
      that off the previously reported MTD.

      The revised protocol incorporates continuous infusion with a mobile pump and includes active
      suppression of the allergic reaction by pre-treatment administration of antihistamines.

        Subjects will:

          1. Be adult patients with histologically confirmed advanced solid tumors (excluding basal
             cell, colon, pancreatic and stomach cancers) who have progressed despite standard
             therapy, or for whom no standard therapy exists.

          2. Have an ambulatory PS (ECOG 0-1).

          3. Have tumor evaluation made within 28 days before study drug administration

          4. Have completed radiotherapy or chemotherapy or any other anticancer therapy (including
             experimental therapy) more than 4 weeks prior to enrolment into the trial and must
             have recovered from all acute side effects of these treatments

          5. Have a life expectancy greater than 3 months

          6. Have an age ≥ 18 years

          7. Have normal marrow function with the following haematological parameters normal; Hb
             ≥10g/dl, WBC ≥4.0 x10E9/L, neutrophil count ≥ 2.0 x 10E9/L and platelets ≥100 x10E9 /L

          8. Have no medically significant impairment of cardiac or respiratory functions&lt;

          9. Have adequate hepatic function with Total bilirubin 1.5 x N and Transaminases &lt; 2.5 x
             N (&lt; 5 x N in case of liver metastasis).

         10. Have no history of prior severe allergic reactions to venoms

         11. Have Creatinine clearance &gt; 50 mL/min.
