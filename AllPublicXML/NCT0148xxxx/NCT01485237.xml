  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main purpose of this study is to review the resource utilization of severe adult H1N1
      pneumonia undergoing antiviral and oxygen therapy, mechanical ventilation and support with
      pulmonary rescue therapies ( nitric oxide, ECMO, HFO) in critically ill patients in Winnipeg.
      Secondary objectives include, comparison of resource utilization to other similar disorders
      (viral pneumonia, bacterial pneumonia, septic shock, ARDS). The investigators will also look
      at the percentage of patients that required ICU care as compared to those who could be cared
      for on medical wards. The investigators will determine the resources used by both groups and
      compare. Finally the investigators will record the frequency of chronic comorbidities in
      hospitalized adult H1N1 patients.
