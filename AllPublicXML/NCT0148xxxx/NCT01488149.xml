  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Intrapartum epidural analgesia has been associated with adverse breastfeeding outcomes. One
      potential mechanism involves transfer of epidural fentanyl across the placenta and neonatal
      blood-brain barrier, where it can subsequently attenuate neonatal exhibition of feeding
      behaviors, such as latching and swallowing, during the immediate postpartum period. Vigorous
      feeding behavior during the first days of life is a significant predictor of long-term
      breastfeeding success at 3 and 6 months. In a randomized, controlled, double-blinded study,
      neonatal Neurologic and Adaptive Capacity Scores (NACS) were significantly lower when mothers
      received &gt;150 mcg epidural fentanyl versus bupivacaine-only analgesia, and mean umbilical
      cord fentanyl concentration was significantly higher in the &gt;150 mcg versus &lt;150 mcg group.

      The investigators hypothesize that epidural fentanyl-bupivacaine analgesia is significantly
      associated with decreased breastfeeding rates at hospital discharge and with neonatal
      deficits in latching onto the breast and swallowing during the first three hours of life, and
      that a significant dose-response relationship exists with respect to total micrograms
      fentanyl infused.

      The investigators will perform a prospective cohort study of all parturients age 18+ at UHCMC
      over a three-month period, excluding those with multiples gestation, Cesarean section, or
      neonatal intensive care unit admission. From patient charts, the investigators will record
      the following variables: number of neonates delivered; type of delivery (spontaneous vaginal
      / operative vaginal / Cesarean section); whether the neonate was admitted to the intensive
      care unit; the mother's age, height, weight, gravity, parity, intention to breast-feed at the
      time of hospital admission, number of children previously breast-fed, and ethnicity;
      gestational age at the time of delivery; administration of oxytocin for labor augmentation
      and in what quantity; duration of active labor; antibiotic administration; neonatal APGAR
      scores at 1 and 5 minutes postpartum; and whether opioids or antibiotics were administered
      before and/or after the delivery and at what exact time. We will also record whether each
      patient received an epidural during labor and, if so, the duration of this epidural infusion
      and the total micrograms fentanyl delivered; neonatal feeding behavior as quantified by the
      LATCH scores assigned to each breast-feeding interaction that occurs on the postpartum care
      floor; whether the mother is breast-feeding her baby at the time of discharge from the
      hospital, and if not, then her primary reason for not doing so (as communicated during the
      standard postpartum lactation consultation); and how long mother and baby stayed in the
      hospital post-delivery.
