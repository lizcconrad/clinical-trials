  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hand eczema is a common disease which often gives a chronic course thus affecting many
      functions in daily life. The body of evidence related to self-management of chronic hand
      eczema is poor. Better methods to support self-management of patients with chronic hand
      eczema may potentially improve the prognosis of a disease which is both a tremendous burden
      to the individual and to the society. The purpose of this trial is to evaluate the effect of
      a newly designed guidance programme offering individual counselling compared to conventional
      information with written information sheets.

    <description>The intervention is founded upon three concurrent elements. Firstly, a SKIN-profile generated by data from a baseline questionnaire (S=Susceptibility, K=Competencies, I=Individual characteristics, N=Necessary precautions).
Secondly, a patient self-management book which includes a patient's log and is offered in both an online and a physical form. Also support to self-management is offered through possible asynchronous communication and networking.
Finally, a counselling consultation with a nurse, trained within dermatology.</description>
