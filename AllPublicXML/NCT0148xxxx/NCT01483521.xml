    <textblock>
      This is a proposed home visitation program for families of children with externalizing
      behaviors who are on the wait list for psychiatric assessment at BC Children's hospital. The
      aim of this program is to implement and evaluate a home visitation strategy in order to
      support those waiting up to four months to consult a psychiatrist.

    <textblock>
      The Home visitation program was developed in response to long wait lists for the Infant
      Psychiatry Program. This home visitation program intervention consists of the following
      components: Developmental guidance, empowerment of parents while respecting the parent-child
      attachment, and child centered interactional guidance. The home visitors ( a PhD student and
      a Masters level student) visit consenting families and gave the parents an opportunity to
      voice their concerns regarding their child's behaviors. They were instructed to co-construct
      a play that had to be child led. Home visitors facilitated this task. Parents completed the
      Child Behavior Checklist and Parenting Stress Index prior to and after the intervention.
      These home visitations occurred approximately once a month whilst the families were on the
      wait list for clinical assessment and treatment. Those families that were randomized in
      control group did not receive any intervention.

      Extended description of the protocol, including information not already contained in other
      fields.

    <description>Experimental arm consisted of randomized waitlist families who received home visitation where mothers were taught to play with their children in a developmentally appropriate manner and also engaged in a co-construction task.
Control arm families did not get any active intervention. Parents from both arm types completed pre and post questionnaires to measure child's externalizing behaviors and parenting stress.
Parents from experimental group were encouraged to keep a diary of their play record.</description>
