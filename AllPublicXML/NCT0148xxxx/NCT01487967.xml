  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This pilot intervention study will test the feasibility and acceptability and explore the
      outcomes of an urban, primary care-based intervention to measure families' preferences and
      goals for Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) treatment and structure clinical
      care to reach these goals.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The intervention includes provision of enhanced, culturally appropriate education about ADHD
      and its treatment, completion of a validated preference and goal instrument, use of this
      instrument in the ADHD treatment decision-making process, and tracking of preferences and
      goals over time.
