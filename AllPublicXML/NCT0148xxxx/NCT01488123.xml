      intervention will improve quality of life in recent breast cancer survivors.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cancer associated symptoms and impaired quality of life remain significant problems for
      patients despite advances in cancer treatment. Few effective treatment options exist for
      these symptoms. Integrative medicine is rising in popularity in the United States; however,
      few integrative medicine modalities have been rigorously studied. Ayurveda, a whole system of
      medicine that originated in the Indian subcontinent, has its own system of diagnostics and
      therapeutics, and among its strengths are wellness and prevention. We aim to perform a
      prospective single arm clinical study of a manualized Ayurvedic approach in breast cancer
      survivors with impaired quality of life. Specifically, we aim to develop the manualized
      Ayurvedic intervention; to assess feasibility; and to determine whether clinically meaningful
      effects can be achieved with the intervention.

    <description>The manualized intervention will begin with an initial clinic visit (approximately 90 minutes) with the Ayurvedic practitioner in which the patient's diagnosis will be determined, an overview of Ayurveda will be given, and the initial treatment will be recommended based on the Ayurvedic diagnosis. Follow-up visits will range between 30 and 60 minutes in duration. The treatment modalities employed in the study will include nutrition, lifestyle, yoga, and marma (a treatment similar to acupressure).</description>
