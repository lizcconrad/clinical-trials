      This retrospective study will review the Anderson Orthopaedic Institute's initial experience
      among a consecutive series of 126 patients who had primary total hip arthroplasty using a
      metal-on-metal articulation consisting of a DePuy Pinnacle cup with an Ultamet liner coupled
      with a 36-mm cobalt-chrome alloy femoral head. The relationship between metal ion levels, cup
      orientation, osteolysis, radiographic implant stability and clinical outcome measures
      including component revision, complications, patient satisfaction and Harris Hip Scores will
      be evaluated.

    <textblock>
      Metal-on-metal bearings for total hip arthroplasty are an alternative to traditional
      polyethylene bearing surfaces and hip simulators studies have shown that metal-on-metal
      bearings have lower wear than metal-on-polyethylene bearings. In addition, simulator studies
      indicate that the amount of wear decreases as head size increases allowing the use of larger
      head diameters than possible with other bearing surfaces. Since dislocation is currently the
      most common reason for reoperation in the United States, representing 22.5% of hip revisions,
      the combination of low wear and larger head sizes to reduce dislocation hold the promise of
      improving outcome among total hip arthroplasty patients. While there are potential advantages
      to metal-on-metal bearings, a few concerns have been noted in the literature. Although the
      total volume of wear is low with these bearings, the articulation generates metal debris that
      may be related to patient and surgical factors such as implant positioning. Despite a reduced
      wear volume, there is also the possibility that an increased bioreactivity associated with
      metal debris might induce an osteolytic response or local tissue hypersensitivity reaction.

      This study will retrospectively review the outcome of a consecutive series of 126 patients
      who had 131 primary THAs performed between April 2001 and November 2002 at the Anderson
      Clinic with a Pinnacle acetabular cup, an Ultamet insert and a 36-mm cobalt-chrome alloy
      femoral head. These total hip arthroplasties represent the Anderson Orthopaedic Institute's
      in initial experience with this implant. The relationship between metal ion levels, cup
      orientation, osteolysis, radiographic implant stability and clinical outcome measures
      including component revision, complications, patient satisfaction and Harris Hip Scores will
      be evaluated. The outcome data from our analysis will also be compared with the data from
      other published series with metal-on-metal bearing surfaces. Serial radiographs obtained as
      part of routine post-operative care will be used to evaluate osteolysis, implant stability
      and radiographic complications such as periprosthetic fracture. The area of each osteolytic
      region will be measured on the AP pelvic x-ray using Martell's Hip Analysis Suite. Computed
      tomography (CT) scans obtained as part of routine follow-up will be also analyzed to identify
      regions of acetabular osteolysis. The volume and location of each osteolytic defect
      identified on CT will be evaluated using three-dimensional image analysis software (Analyze,
      Biomedical Imaging Resource, Rochester, MN). A three-dimensional (3D) reconstruction of the
      pelvis, cup and acetabular osteolytic lesions will also be generated from the CT image data.
      This reconstruction will be oriented to simulate the AP pelvic radiographic view. Cobalt and
      chromium ion level data will be compiled for patients who had blood drawn to evaluate metal
      ion levels. The mean and median blood metal-ion levels for these patients will be calculated
      and the results will be compared to the metal-ion levels reported in the literature.

            <title>Cup Abduction Angle</title>
            <description>The Cup Abduction Angle quantifies the amount of tilt associated with the hemispheric implant implanted inside a patient's pelvis to replace their hip socket. When an anterioposterior (front-to-back) x-ray is taken, the angle between the face of the cup and a horizontal line defines the Cup Abduction Angle. The line defining the face of the cup is drawn through the uppermost and lowest edges of the cup's projection on the x-ray. For this study, the Cup Abduction Angle was measured from digitized x-rays using Dr. John Martell's Hip Suite Analysis Software (University of Chicago, Chicago, IL).</description>

            <title>Cup Anteversion Angle</title>
            <description>The Cup Anteversion Angle quantifies the front-to-back rotation of the hemispheric implant implanted inside a patient's pelvis to replace their hip socket. When an anterioposterior (front-to-back) x-ray is taken, the circular face of the cup projects onto the x-ray as an ellipse. The ratio of the major axis of the ellipse to the minor axis can be used to calculate the anteversion. A cup rotated anteriorly has positive anteversion. A cup rotated posteriorly has negative anteversion. For this study, the cup Anteversion Angle was measured from digitized x-rays using Dr. John Martell's Hip Suite Analysis Software (University of Chicago, Chicago, IL). Taken together, the abduction and anteversion angle quantify the three-dimensional orientation of the cup.</description>

            <description>The Harris Hip Score is an outcome measure used for hip replacements that ranges from 0 (worst) to 100 (best). The score consists of a series of questions related to hip pain, function and range of motion that accumulate a different number of points depending on the response choices. At the time of their follow-up visits, patients completed a standardized questionnaire that included components of the Harris Hip Score and the physician completed a standardized evaluation which included range of motion assessment.</description>
