  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will test 200 people to see if an experimental nasal spray has an effect on
      symptoms of the common cold if used when the symptoms start. At the first visit to the
      clinic, potential subjects will have tests to make sure they qualify to participate in the
      study.

      If they qualify, they will have an equal chance of receiving the experimental nasal spray or
      a sham nasal spray (one that does not have the experimental formula). At the first visit,
      subjects will receive their assigned nasal spray and use it once at the clinic. They will
      also receive a booklet called a diary. Subjects will take the rest of their treatments for
      day 1 at home, and for the next six days, they will use the nasal spray four times per day
      and record their symptoms in the diary, as instructed. Then subjects will come back to the
      clinic for a final visit.

      This is an investigation in healthy subjects with early signs of common cold. Subjects will
      be randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive either Polymeric Nasal Spray or a matching
      placebo nasal spray.

      Subjects will be screened for eligibility and randomized to treatment at the Screening/
      Randomization Visit (Day 1). Subjects will apply the first dose of the nasal spray at this
      visit under supervision. The other applications will take place at home on Day 1. On Days 2
      through 7, subjects will use their assigned nasal spray as 2 sprays per nostril, 4 times per
      day.

      One Follow up Visit will be conducted within 3 days of the last application of nasal spray.

      Enrollment will continue until 200 subjects have completed the investigation (100 per
      treatment group). The subject and the investigative staff will be blinded to the assigned
      nasal spray.

      Efficacy will be measured, and recorded in the subject's diary, and safety will be assessed
      by reported AEs and ADEs.
