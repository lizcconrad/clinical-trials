      This prospective study will evaluate the Bigliani/Flatow prosthesis. The aims of this study
      are to establish the safety, effectiveness, and value of the prosthetic system, and to
      collect information from expert shoulder surgeons as to features of the implants,
      instruments, and techniques which may be further improved. In this study, the investigators
      hypothesize that this prosthetic device will significantly improve long-term patient-based
      outcomes, functional status and quality of life.

    <textblock>
      Over the last two decades, total shoulder joint replacement - or arthroplasty - has become a
      commonly performed procedure for the treatment of painful arthritis of the shoulder, and
      numerous studies have demonstrated its success. During this time, much has been learned about
      the efficacy, as well as the complications, of the procedure, and since its introduction in
      the 1950's, shoulder arthroplasty has undergone an evolution in design. The value of such
      innovations has not yet been determined and will depend on the results of long term follow-up
      studies. The purpose of this study is to provide follow-up information and design
      modification directives.

    <description>Other than the Bigliani/Flatow device, there will be no difference in treatment between those patients undergoing arthroplasty with the Bigliani / Flatow prosthesis and those who previously received other prosthesis. APatients who decide to participate in the study will complete various forms prior to surgery (The Informed Consent, Contact Information Form, Demographics Module, and standard outcomes forms such as American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeon Score form, Constant's Score form, and the Simple Shoulder Test, EuroQOL and SF-36). The patient will also complete forms postoperatively at 3-month, 6-month, 1-year, 2-year, 3-year, 4-year and 5-year intervals (American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeon Score form, Constant's Score form, Simple Shoulder Test, EuroQOL and SF-36).</description>

             certified surgeon.

          -  Class IV or higher anesthetic risk.

             debridement procedure.

             demonstrated at time of the surgery that precludes the total shoulder replacement.
