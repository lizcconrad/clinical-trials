      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of NOX A12 in combination
      with a background therapy of bendamustine and rituximab (BR) chemotherapy in previously
      treated patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      CLL cells express high levels of CXCR4 chemokine receptors, which cause leukemia cell
      migration and adhesion to stromal cells secreting the CXCR4 ligand, CXCL12 (or
      stromal-derived-factor 1, SDF-1). NOX A12 is a specific CXCL12 antagonist and may improve BR
      therapy by disrupting CXCR4-CXCL12 interactions, thereby mobilizing CLL cells from protective
      tissue microenvironments to the blood. Furthermore, SDF-1 inhibition may alter the activation
      status of CLL cells, thereby triggering apoptosis or sensitization of CLL cells towards
      chemotherapy.

    <description>Pilot Group (NOX-A12 single agent, and combined with BR):
3 cohorts of 3 patients will receive treatment with NOX-A12 alone at a single dose of 1, 2 or 4 mg/kg i.v. 2 weeks before the combination treatment of NOX-A12 and BR begins.The combination of NOX-A12 and BR will follow a dose titration design beginning at 1 mg/kg NOX-A12 (cycle 1), proceeding to dose levels of 2 mg/kg (cycle 2) and 4 mg/kg (cycle 3) NOX-A12 in combination with BR. This is followed by consolidation in cycles 4-6 when NOX-A12 will be kept at the highest individually titrated dose.
Expansion Group (NOX-A12 in combination with BR):
Expansion patients will not receive single agent NOX-A12, but will receive combination treatment as for the pilot group.</description>
