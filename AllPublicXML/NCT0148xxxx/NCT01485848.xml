      Primary Objectives: o Run-in Phase: Determine a dose of EP-100 at which the initial
      benefit/risk of paclitaxel combined with EP-100 can be studied. o Randomized Phase: Compare
      the anti-tumor effects of EP-100 combined with weekly paclitaxel versus paclitaxel alone in
      patients with ovarian cancer. Secondary Objectives: o Randomized Phase: Quantify any
      significant changes in the safety profile of weekly paclitaxel alone compared to the doublet
      combination of paclitaxel with EP-100. o Determine an initial benefit/risk profile for this
      new drug combination.

      Total duration of the study for each participant is 9 to 10 months, consisting of a 1 month
      screening period, a 6 to 7 months treatment period, and a 30 day follow-up. All patients with
      stable disease or who have achieved partial or complete response and for whom dosing has been
      safe and reasonably well-tolerated may continue additional treatment cycles on the same
      regimen. Any patient whose imaging assessment shows disease progression after receiving at
      least two cycles of single agent weekly paclitaxel on ARM 1 may then be offered treatment
      with the combination of EP-100 plus paclitaxel in the same dose regimen as ARM 2.

        Inclusion criteria:

          -  Adult patients with histologically confirmed epithelial ovarian carcinomas; these will
             include primary peritoneal and fallopian tube carcinomas. Patient's tumor shown to be

             study's central laboratory.

             progressed during or recurred after treatment with a paclitaxel and/or platinum
             regimen for advanced disease.

          -  Evaluable disease based on criteria of the Gynecologic Intergroup Response Evaluation
             Criteria in in Solid Tumors.
