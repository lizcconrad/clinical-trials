    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare an technology-based weight maintenance intervention
      using action plans, videos discussion boards and health behavior tracking (weight, calories
      in and out, pedometer steps) with a technology-based standard advice group to facilitate
      health management, resourcefulness and health status for rural middle-aged women.

      The purpose of this research project is to evaluate the influence of a theory-based
      intervention using the Health Effects of Life Transitions for Women Model to promote
      maintenance of initial weight loss. The intervention will be designed to promote physical
      activity to prevent weight regain among an underserved and vulnerable population of rural,
      mid-life women. The intervention delivered through action plans, videos, discussion boards
      and health behavior tracking (weight, calories in and out, pedometer steps) to facilitate
      health management, resourcefulness and health status will be compared with the standard
      advice group who receives newsletters and health behavior tracking (weight) to initiate,
      increase, or sustain physical activity for weight maintenance.
