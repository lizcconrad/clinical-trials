  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to characterize the feasibility and impact of a diagnostic tool
      that may help clinicians identify when patients are at higher risk of visiting the hospital
      for a heart failure event. The study will use a non-experimental device that is inserted just
      under the skin of the chest, which continuously monitors the heart rhythm in combination with
      an experimental web-based heart failure risk status. Patients with atrial fibrillation and
      heart failure will be evaluated to collect data about the potential of this risk status to
      help improve patient outcome.

    <description>Subjects in the Control arm will be observed between implant and month 12. During this time, the standard device diagnostic suite will be used as it would normally, in the office using the programmer, or by data transmission from the patient's home (or another remote location). At month 12 through study close (month 18), study doctors for the all subjects will have access to the risk status.</description>

    <description>The experimental IDENTIFY-HF Risk Status developed for this study will be used to change standard device data to a heart failure risk status. The risk status and standard device trend data are provided to study doctors for remote management of their patients' heart failure using study specific protocols. The risk status inputs are: night heart rate, heart rate variability, atrial fibrillation burden, ventricular rate during atrial fibrillation, patient activity.
Based on pre-defined thresholds for each of the above inputs, as well as data trends, a heart failure score is derived. The heart failure score is then classified as: &quot;Low&quot;, &quot;Medium&quot;, &quot;High&quot;, or &quot;Very High&quot;.</description>
