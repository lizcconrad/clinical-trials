  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this prospective study, the investigators will evaluate and compare the usefulness of
      functional and volumetric informations obtained by 18F-FDG PET and MRI before and after the
      palliative chemotherapy with the aim of predicting tumor response and prognosis in patients
      with advanced Non-small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC).

      Study cohort will undergo PET/CT and MRI scans prior to chemotherapy and after the first
      chemotherapy cycle. MRI scans include DCE-MRI and DWI. The following parameters will be
      calculated using these values:

        1. Metabolic parameters on FDG-PET A. SUV change ratio (SCR) = SUVpost/SUVpre B. MTV change
           ratio (VCR) = MTVpost/pre C. TLG change ratio = SCR X VCR

        2. Perfusion parameters on DCE-MRI A. Kep B. K-trans C. ve

        3. Diffusion parameters on DWI A. Mean ADC B. fDM
