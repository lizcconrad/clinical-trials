  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with Acute Myelogenous Leukemia (AML) who relapse after an allogeneic stem cell
      transplant cell receive decitabine to up regulate cancer antigen expression, followed by a
      donor lymphocyte infusion and an autologous dendritic cell (DC). Vaccine Dendritic cells are
      pulsed with overlapping peptides derived from MAGE-A1, MAGE-A3, and NY-ESO-1.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      For vaccine production, mature DC will be pulsed with overlapping peptides mixes derived from
      full-length NY-ESO-1, MAGE-A1, and MAGE-A3.
