  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The present study intends to clarify whether there is positional mandibular stability in
      patients to be submitted to orthognathic surgery. In case of any instability exists, it is
      needed to understand if this could be related to a particular type of dentofacial deformity
      or could have any short-term or long-term influence on outcomes of the orthognathic surgery.

    <textblock>
      Treatment of skeletal discrepancy nowadays is mainly performed by combination of clinical and
      surgical procedures in which orthodontics intends to align the teeth according to their
      respective alveolar bone and the surgical procedure - orthognathic surgery - realign the jaws
      in an adequate position among themselves and related to the rest of the craniofacial
      skeleton. Orthognathic surgery has developed throughout the years technically as well as
      regarding fixation devices for the operated segments, providing prediction of results with a
      low complication incidence. A debate point is related to the possible instability of the
      mandibular position as a reference for surgical planning due to its articulation with the
      temporal fossa, the temporomandibular joint. However, studies have shown that not always the
      mandible position obtained for the articulator reflects the position observed in subjects
      after induction of general anesthesia. Since there is no evidence that indicates that any
      alteration of the position of the mandible could influence the outcomes of a orthognathic
      surgery nor any relationship of a certain type of dentofacial deformity that would be
      beneficiated by an specific order of surgery or skeletal reference (maxilla or mandible), the
      present study intends to clarify some of these questions.

        Data will be obtained from subjects to be submitted to orthognathic surgery by the
        Department of Oral &amp; Maxillofacial Surgery of the Hospital Geral Universitário of the city
        of Cuiabá - Brazil during the period of March 2012 through March 2013. Considering the
        local demand, thirty subjects are expected to be included in the research.
