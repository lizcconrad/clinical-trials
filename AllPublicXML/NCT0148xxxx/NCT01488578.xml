    <textblock>
      The objective of this surveillance is to collect information about 1) adverse drug reaction
      not expected from the Package Insert (unknown adverse drug reaction), 2) the incidence of
      adverse drug reactions in this surveillance, and 3) factors considered to affect the safety
      and/or efficacy of this drug.

      All the subjects whom an investigator prescribes the first Detrusitol Capsule should be
      registered consecutively until the number of subjects reaches target number in order to
      extract patients enrolled into the investigation at random.
