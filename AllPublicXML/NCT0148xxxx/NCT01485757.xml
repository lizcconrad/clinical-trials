      HYPOTHESIS The investigators primary hypothesis is that peripheral endothelial function and
      exercise tolerance will be abnormal in the population of young heart transplant patients at
      baseline, and that each will show a trend towards improvement following a 12 week course of
      oral L-arginine, with regression towards the baseline following the 12 week washout period.
