  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Liver stiffness measurement (LSM) using Fibroscan速(EchoSens, Paris, France) is a newly
      introduced noninvasive tool that generates an elastic wave using a vibrator applied to the
      thoracic wall at the level of the right lobe of the liver and measures the prolongation
      velocity of the wave, which is directly associated with liver stiffness (LS). Although recent
      advances in surgical techniques and perioperative management have made with established
      perioperative management have now made it possible to perform hepatectomies as a safe
      procedure with minimum mortality, the possibility of massive blood loss and resultant
      transfusion during hepatectomy still exist. The objective of this research was to identify
      the role of liver stiffness measurement for the prediction of intraoperative blood loss and
      postoperative recovery after elective right hepatectomy.
