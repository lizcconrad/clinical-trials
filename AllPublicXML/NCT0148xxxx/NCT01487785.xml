  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase Ib study includes two phases: dose escalation phase and safety expansion phase.

      During the dose escalation phase, successive cohorts of eligible patients (minimum 3 and
      maximum 6 evaluable patients per cohort) will receive increasing oral doses of LDE225
      administered on a continuous once daily (QD) dose in combination of gemcitabine. This phase
      of the study will determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and/ or recommended dose for
      expansion (RDE) of LDE225 administered in combination with gemcitabine in locally advanced or
      metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma patients.

      During the safety expansion phase, once the MTD of LDE225 is established, additional patients
      will be enrolled and treated at the MTD of LDE225 in combination with gemcitabine in order to
      further evaluate its safety, tolerability and explore the potential efficacy of the combined
      treatments on the patients in locally advanced or metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma.

    <description>Patients will receive increasing doses of LDE225 (from 400 mg), depending on the cohort they are assigned to, orally once daily and standard doses of gemcitabine (1000 mg/m2) on days 1, 8 and 15 of every 28-day cycle. Patients will receive the study treatment until they progressed, experience unacceptable toxicity, withdraw from the study, or the investigator decides it is in their best interest to discontinue the study treatment.</description>
