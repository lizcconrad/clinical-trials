        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Genetically confirmed diagnosis of FXS

          -  At Screening and first baseline, vital signs, body weight and body mass index (BMI)
             must be age-specific within normal ranges.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Use of any other investigational drug within 30 days or 5 half-lives (whichever is
             longer) of the investigational drug prior to screening until end of study visit.

          -  History of hypersensitivity to AFQ056 or any mGluR antagonist.

          -  Female patients who are confirmed or suspected to be sexually active.

          -  History or presence of any clinically significant disease of any major system organ
             class, within the past 2 years prior to screening including but not limited to
             psychiatric, neurological, cardiovascular, endocrine, metabolic, renal, or
             gastrointestinal disorders (except for typical features of FXS).

          -  Smokers.

          -  Loss of â‰¥10% of total blood volume within 8 weeks (or less if required for this age
             group and/or by local regulation) prior to dosing or longer if required for this age
             group and/or by local regulation.

          -  Significant illness that did not completely resolve at least four weeks prior to the
             first baseline visit.

          -  Any abnormal laboratory values at screening or first baseline that are in the opinion
             of the investigator clinically significant and may jeopardize the safety of the study
             subject.

          -  Use of (or use within at least 5 half lives before dosing) concomitant medications
             that are strong/moderate inhibitors or inducers of CYP1A1/2, CYP2C9/19 or CYP3A4

          -  History or presence of Hepatitis B/C or HIV at screening
