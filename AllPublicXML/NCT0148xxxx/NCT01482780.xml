  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to analyze the potential of pressure controlled intermittent coronary
      sinus occlusion (PICSO) to prevent/reverse the ischemic burden as well as reperfusion injury.
      To achieve insight into the clinical significance of this local preconditioning effect,
      global hemodynamics, cardiac performance and clinical outcome in the first 30 days will be
      related to the ability of this intervention to protect the myocardium in elective surgical
      procedures, ameliorating cellular decay and preserving the microcirculation therefore
      improving graft flow, reducing enzyme leakage and finally improving myocardial performance.

      -  Patients undergoing elective coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) will be enrolled in
           this study.

        -  A computerized randomization process is used to obtain similar distributions within each
           group. Stratification will be done by the severity of coronary artery disease, age and
           sex.

        -  Routine blood sampling will be performed the day before surgery as well as a
           transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) study to determine ventricular volumes and valvular
           function.

        -  A modified Minnesota quality of Life questionnaire will be assessed and these data will
           be compared with 30 days outcome data screened in an outpatient environment.

        -  A 12 lead electrocardiogram will be obtained. To assess eligibility and to assure
           grouping (stratification &amp; randomization) patients will be scored using the additive
           EuroSCORE. Pre-, intra-, and postoperative (up to 72 hrs) measurements of myocardial
           enzyme leakage will be performed using standard diagnostic procedures (cardiac troponin
           T, CK-MB, and total creatine kinase), as well as serial electrocardiograms and
           echocardiograms.

        -  Perioperative infarction will be assessed as the development of new persistent regional
           wall motion abnormalities in echocardiography together with electrocardiographic
           alterations and CK-MB increases and new Q-wave PMI.

        -  Sequential cytokine analyses (IL-1, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IL-17, VEGF and TNF- alpha )
           preoperatively, at the beginning of the operation, the beginning of ECC and 6,24 h and
           30 days postop.

        -  Serial quantification of global and regional wall motion will be recorded using TEE
           measurements during surgery.

    <description>Enzyme leakage (Troponin T, CK-MB) will be measured preoperatively, at the beginning of the operation, the beginning of ECC at the time of reperfusion the arrival on the ICU and 6,12,24,48 and 72 hours postop and the area under the curve will be calculated (AUC until 72 hours).

PICSO reduces troponin T leakage about 30 % measured by AUC until 72h in comparison to controls.
PICSO improves 30d and long-term outcome</description>
