    <description>This was a data collection for engineering development to demonstrate SuperSTAT 2.0 NIBP software algorithm meets the engineering specifications. Engineers reviewed data produced by each blood pressure determination to work on new software algorithm in development. This was not conducted as program was terminated prematurely.
