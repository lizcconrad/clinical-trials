    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the effect and safety of AZD6765 in patients with
      major depressive disorder who exhibit inadequate response to antidepressants. AZD6765 is a
      channel blocker of the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) class of glutamate receptors.

    <measure>Change From Baseline to Week 6 in the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) Total Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Week 6</time_frame>
    <description>A 10-item scale for the evaluation of depressive symptoms. Each MADRS item is rated on a 0 to 6 scale. The MADRS total score is calculated as the sum of the 10 individual item scores; the total score can range from 0 to 60. Higher MADRS scores indicate higher levels of depressive symptoms.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline to Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>A 3-item, self-administered scale that measures the extent a patient is impaired by their disease. Higher scores indicate more severe impairment. The SDS total score is calculated as the sum of the score for the 3 intercorrelated domains (school/work, social life, and family life/home responsibilities), ranges from 0 (no impairment) to 30 (most severe impairment).</description>

    <measure>Change in Severity of Depressive Symptoms as Measured by Change From Baseline in the Clinical Global Impression-Severity (CGI-S) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>Clinical Global Impression - Severity (CGI-S) scale rates the severity of the patient's illness at the time of assessment, range from 1 (normal, not ill) to 7 (very severely ill).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Severity of Depressive Symptoms as Measured by the CGI-I Response (Defined as CGI-I Rating of &quot;Very Much Improved&quot; or &quot;Much Improved&quot;) at Week 6</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Week 6</time_frame>
    <description>A 3-part, clinician-administered scale that rates the improvement or worsening of the patient's illness from randomization (baseline). Each item is scored on a 1 to 7 scale. CGI-I scores &gt;4 indicate worsening, while scores &lt;4 indicate improvement.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline to Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>A 16-question self-report inventory that includes the 9 Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th Edition, Text Revision (DSM-IV-TR) criteria symptom domains: sad mood, concentration, self-outlook, suicidal ideation, involvement, energy/fatigability, sleep disturbance (4 items: initial, middle, late insomnia, and hypersomnia), appetite/weight increased or decrease (4 items), and psychomotor agitation/retardation (2 items).

    <participant_flow>
      <recruitment_details>This multicenter study was conducted in Chile, Slovakia, South Africa, and the United States between 16 December 2011 and 26 August 2013. A total of 542 patients were enrolled in the study and of these, 302 patients were randomized to treatment. 240 patients were not randomized to treatment due to eligibility criteria not being fulfilled.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>The study had a screening/washout period of up to 42 days, a 12-week double blind treatment period, and a 14-day follow-up period. Patients received 3 infusions per week during Weeks 1 to 3,1 infusion per week during Weeks 4 to 6, and 1 infusion every other week during Weeks 7 to 12.</pre_assignment_details>

        <description>A 10-item scale for the evaluation of depressive symptoms. Each MADRS item is rated on a 0 to 6 scale. The MADRS total score is calculated as the sum of the 10 individual item scores; the total score can range from 0 to 60. Higher MADRS scores indicate higher levels of depressive symptoms.</description>

          <description>A 10-item scale for the evaluation of depressive symptoms. Each MADRS item is rated on a 0 to 6 scale. The MADRS total score is calculated as the sum of the 10 individual item scores; the total score can range from 0 to 60. Higher MADRS scores indicate higher levels of depressive symptoms.</description>

        <description>A 3-item, self-administered scale that measures the extent a patient is impaired by their disease. Higher scores indicate more severe impairment. The SDS total score is calculated as the sum of the score for the 3 intercorrelated domains (school/work, social life, and family life/home responsibilities), ranges from 0 (no impairment) to 30 (most severe impairment).</description>
