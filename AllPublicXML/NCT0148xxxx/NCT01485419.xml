  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Traumatic injury is a major public health problem with an immense societal cost. Despite
      improvements in trauma management, patients continue to suffer significant morbidity and
      mortality. Evidence suggests that males and females tolerate severe injury differently with a
      greater protection afforded to females. Determining the mechanisms responsible for these
      sex-based outcome differences after injury, focusing specifically on the early sex-hormone
      environment post-injury, may allow those at highest risk for poor outcome to be predicted and
      promote interventions that can improve outcomes for all injured patients. The goal of this
      study is to determine if the early sex hormone environment soon after injury has effects on
      the intensity of the immune response, resuscitation and blood transfusion requirements, and
      important clinical outcomes including mortality, organ failure and infection, following
      significant injury.
