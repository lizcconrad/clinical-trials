  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study evaluates the impact of a new conditional cash transfer (CCT) program (Thayi Bhagya
      Yojana) to promote child birth in obstetric facilities in the state of Karnataka, India in
      order to determine its policy value and to guide efforts to improve maternal and infant
      health outcomes nationally. In addition, the study includes a large randomized evaluation of
      performance-based incentive payments to providers to improve quality of medical care provided
      during delivery and actual health improvement in the providers' patient populations and their
      catchment areas.

      The evaluation study will first provide new evidence on the effectiveness of demand-side
      strategies to increase institutional deliveries and improve childbirth outcomes. Second, the
      study will analyze one of the first implementations of direct rewards to providers for health
      improvement in a developing country. Third, the study will provide critical new insight into
      dynamics between demand and supply-side incentives in improving population health outcomes as
      either complements or substitutes.

      The study uses household survey to collect data from mothers on socio-economic, human
      capital, quality of life variables (including below poverty line [BPL] index components) and
      as well as information about deliveries, fertility histories, morbidity and mortality (for
      mothers, infants, and children), birth related complications, health service use and
      spending. Additionally, provider surveys will collect data on infrastructure, staffing,
      provider qualifications, provider knowledge and process measures of provider performance.
