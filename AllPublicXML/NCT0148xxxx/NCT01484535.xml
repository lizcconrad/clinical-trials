    <intervention_name>Ankle Aspiration</intervention_name>
    <description>Ankle aspiration will be performed through either a standard anterolateral or anteromedial approach, depending on the conditions of the soft tissue. The anterolateral approach will be the preferred method due to the higher reproducibility of intra-articular needle placement. The anteromedial approach will be reserved for patients whose soft tissues over the anterolateral portal are compromised. Sterile preparation of the limb will be achieved with the use of chlorhexidine or Betadine. An 18 gauge needle will be introduced into the ankle joint and a syringe will be used to aspirate the ankle until no more hemarthrosis is able to be removed. The amount of hemarthrosis aspirated will be recorded. Following the procedure, care will continue as per standard of care.</description>

    <intervention_name>Ankle aspiration Standard Anterolateral</intervention_name>
    <description>Placebo ankle aspiration will be performed through a standard anterolateral. Sterile preparation of the limb will be achieved with the use of chlorhexidine or Betadine. An 18-gauge needle will be introduced into the skin. The needle will be held in the skin for 5-10 seconds in an effort to simulate the pain and time-lag experienced with aspiration. The needle will not pass the fascia or ankle joint capsule. Following the procedure, care will continue as per standard of care.</description>
