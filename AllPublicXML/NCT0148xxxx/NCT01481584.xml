      The objective of the study is to evaluate the nutritional and physiological properties of two
      canola proteins focusing on the bioavailability in humans.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The physiological effects of a single administration of two different industrially
      manufactured canola proteins (hydrolyzate, isolate) were investigated compared to soy
      protein.

      Twenty-eight healthy men (ø 25 years) completed a double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover
      study. The subjects were randomly divided into two groups (group A: canola protein isolate
      and soy protein isolate and group B: canola protein hydrolyzate and soy protein isolate).
      After a three-day run-in period, on the intervention day, the subjects consumed a protein
      drink containing 30.0 g protein powder added to a final volume of 500 mL tomato juice. Half
      of the subjects in each group consumed a protein drink containing 30.0 g canola protein, the
      other half received the soy protein. After taking of fasting blood samples in the morning of
      the intervention day, blood samples were drawn at regular intervals for a period of eight
      hours. At the end of the run-in period and on the intervention day, a 24-hour urine
      collection took place.

      Within a second experiment (after 4 weeks), the protein source was crossed within the four
      subgroups for the second intervention.
