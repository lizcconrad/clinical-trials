  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is the most common reproductive disorder in women of
      reproductive age and despite decades of research the etiology the disorder is not known. The
      characteristic hyperandrogenism and anovulation is associated with abnormal neuroendocrine
      function and insulin resistance. Obesity is a common correlated phenotype of Polycystic ovary
      syndrome and weight gain worsens the reproductive and metabolic complications. Currently
      there is no evidence-based treatment plan for infertility in Polycystic ovary syndrome; yet
      weight loss by dietary restriction and regular exercise are strongly advocated. Weight loss
      and increased insulin sensitivity appear to drive improvements in reproductive outcomes in
      women with Polycystic ovary syndrome; however, the mechanism connecting these changes with
      the reproductive axis is not fully understood.

      The goal of this study is to determine (using dietary restriction, exercise training,
      metformin or no treatment), the effects of weight loss and/or improved insulin sensitivity on
      reproductive function (neuroendocrine and ovarian) in obese women with Polycystic ovary
      syndrome.

Total energy expenditure as measured by a 14-day doubly labeled water (DLW) study will be used to determine the baseline energy intake of each subject. There will be no gradual ramping of dietary restriction. The 25% energy reduction goal will apply from the first day of the intervention for a period of 24 weeks. Subjects will be asked to not modify their normal level of physical activity.</description>

    <description>For the aerobic training component, subjects are required to meet a weekly energy expenditure target of 10 kcal per kg of body weight per week (KKW).
The resistance training program will be performed 2 days a week. The resistance program includes 9 exercises. The 9 primary exercises are seated chest press, seated row, shoulder press, lat pull down, double leg press, leg extension, leg curl, back extension and abdominal crunch.</description>
