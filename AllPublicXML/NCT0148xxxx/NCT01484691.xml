  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This will be a single center study of asthmatic subjects and healthy controls which will
      investigate mechanisms of asthma through detailed molecular analysis of airway tissues and
      fluids. The primary goal will be investigate the role of microRNAs in Th2-driven inflammation
      in asthma. The investigators hypothesize that asthma is associated with abnormal expression
      of miRNAs in T cells which favors differentiation into Th2-cells. The investigators further
      hypothesize that asthma is heterogeneous based on the presence and absence of Th2-driven
      inflammation and that abnormalities in T cell miRNA expression will be most prominent in a
      subgroup with high levels of Th2-driven inflammation (as assessed using molecular markers
      that the investigators have previously established). Finally, the investigators hypothesize
      that inhaled corticosteroids will normalize the T-cell miRNA abnormalities observed in
      asthma, as corticosteroids treat Th2-driven inflammation. The samples collected will also
      facilitate the pursuit of secondary analyses designed to investigate mechanisms of
      inflammation and remodeling in asthma as well as molecular phenotypes of asthma.

    <description>Identification of T cell miRNAs which are differentially expressed in asthma as compared to healthy controls. We will measure a panel of ~200 miRNAs by qPCR (yielding normalized copy numbers for each miR) and identify differential expressed based on a false discovery rate &lt;0.05.</description>

    <description>Identification of T cell miRNAs which normalized by 8 weeks of treatment with inhaled corticosteroids in asthma (as compared to an untreated group). We will measure the same miRNAs by qPCR as identified in the other Primary Outcome (1 week time frame) and define normalization by treatment as a significant difference between change from 0 to 8 weeks in the corticosteroid treated group as compared to the untreated group (false discovery rate &lt;0.05).</description>
