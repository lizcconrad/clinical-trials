    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the pharmacokinetics of OROS hydromorphone in
      healthy adult Taiwanese participants after the oral administration of a single 16 mg dose.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-center, open-label (all people know the identity of the intervention),
      single-dose study in healthy adult Taiwanese participants. A minimum of 6 participants
      identified as having the UGT2B7 *2/*2 variant genotype and 12 participants identified as
      having the UGT2B7 *1/*1 wild type genotype will be included in the study. The study will
      explore the impact of genetic polymorphism in the UGT2B7 gene (occurrence of variants of this
      gene) on the pharmacokinetics (how the drug is absorbed in the body, distributed within the
      body, and how it is removed from the body over time) of OROS hydromorphone. This study
      consists of a screening phase followed by a 5-day open-label treatment phase. During the
      screening phase, a blood sample will be collected for a genetic test to confirm the presence
      of the UGT2B7 gene. During the study period, upon completion of a 12-hour overnight fast,
      participants will receive a single oral 16-mg dose of OROS hydromorphone in the morning of
      Day 1. Blood samples will be collected through 72 hours after dosing for the determination of
      plasma hydromorphone and hydromorphone 3-glucuronide concentrations. The safety and
      tolerability of 16-mg OROS hydromorphone will also be assessed. The total study duration for
      each participant is approximately 33 days.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Participation in the DNA analysis to confirm UGT2B7 genotype status
