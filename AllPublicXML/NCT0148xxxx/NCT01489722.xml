    <textblock>
      The purpose of this open label study is to evaluate the safety, tolerability,
      pharmacokinetics, and efficacy of AZD1208 in patients with recurrent or refractory Acute
      Myelogenous Leukemia (AML). This study will have two parts. In Part A, patients will receive
      escalating doses to identify the maximum tolerated dose (MTD). In Part B, the efficacy of the
      maximum tolerated dose will be evaluated in a expanded group of patients.
