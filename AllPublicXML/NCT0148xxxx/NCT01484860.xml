  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase II study to see how useful study drug AUY922 is in patients with metastatic
      pancreatic cancer who have received or are intolerant to first-line chemotherapy.

      AUY922 is an intravenous drug that blocks a protein called heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90).
      Hsp90 works by keeping a number of other proteins stable and active, including many proteins
      that are involved in tumor growth and death. When Hsp90 is blocked from working, it is
      believed that many of the other proteins that it stabilizes will also be blocked, which will
      cause tumor growth to slow or stop.

      During the study, patients will visit the clinic once a week, every 4 week cycles to receive
      AUY922 intravenously and to have tests and procedures done. As part of the study, archived
      tumor tissue will be collected and patients will be asked to have blood samples taken for
      pharmacokinetic testing. Patients will be invited to take part in an optional banking of
      blood samples for future studies.

      The primary hypothesis of this study is that AUY922 improves disease control rate compared
      with what would be expected from best supportive care.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single arm open label Phase II clinical trial evaluating the efficacy of AUY922 in
      patients with advanced pancreatic cancer who have been previously treated with or are
      intolerant to first line chemotherapy. The primary objective is to assess the efficacy of
      this agent by assessing the disease control rate (DCR) (objective response plus prolonged
      stable disease (&gt;16 weeks).

      The current standard therapy for patients who have advanced, metastatic or inoperable
      pancreatic cancer previously treated with or intolerant to first line chemotherapy is best
      supportive care. New treatment options are urgently needed.

      Heat shock protein 90 (HSP90) is an ATP-dependent molecular chaperone protein involved in the
      stabilization of a number of membrane and intracellular proteins including HER2, BCR-ABL,
      C-SRC, EGFR, RAF, VEGFR, AKT, and RAS. Many of these proteins are highly expressed in
      pancreatic adenocarcinoma.

      AUY922 is a novel isoxazole-based HSP90 inhibitor. AUY922 acts by inhibiting HSP90 ATPase
      activity (IC50 of 30 nm) and preventing the formation of a multichaperone complex between
      HSP90 and other heat shock proteins. This then prevents HSP90 from performing its functions
      on client proteins.
