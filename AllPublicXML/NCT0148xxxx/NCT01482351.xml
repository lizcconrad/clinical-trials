  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of the research is to determine the power and the feasibility of the study design
      and methods to inform a full-scale clinical trial that will determine whether treatment of
      obstructive sleep apnea in older adults with mild cognitive impairment delays cognitive
      decline and preserves everyday function.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      We will collect pilot data from 110 participants on 1-year outcomes of treatment of
      obstructive sleep apnea using continuous positive airway pressure and the validity of
      neuroimaging for measuring clinical change in persons with mild cognitive impairment and
      obstructive sleep apnea. The results will inform the study design, sample size, participant
      recruitment and retention methods, and measures for a full-scale trial.

    <description>Daytime sleepiness be assessed using ESS. The ESS asks the respondent to rate the likelihood of falling asleep in eight specific situations using a four-point Likert scale ranging from never dozing to high chance of dozing. The scale significantly correlates with the frequency of apneas and is a clinical and research standard for the assessment of daytime sleepiness. Persons with cognitive impairment are able to complete the scale. It requires 5 minutes to complete.</description>

  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study - Clinicians' Global Impression of Change Scale [ADCS-CGIC]</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline at 1 year</time_frame>

    <measure>Neuroimaging Biomarker: Hippocampal Volume</measure>
    <time_frame>Change in hippocampal volume between baseline and 1 year follow-up magnetic resonance imaging scan.</time_frame>
    <description>Change in hippocampal volume between baseline and 1 year follow-up scan (atrophy) will be quantified automatically using unbiased registration between 2 time points. Structural and calibration scans used in this protocol have been adopted from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative [ADNI] protocol.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Neuroimaging Biomarker: Regional Brain Volume and Thickness.</measure>
    <time_frame>Change in regional brain volume and thickness between baseline and 1 year follow-up magnetic resonance imaging scan.</time_frame>
    <description>Structural effects of CPAP outside of the hippocampus will be measured using FreeSurfer software to automatically estimate hemispheric and lobar cortical thickness; cortical and subcortical gray matter volume; white matter volume; and ventricular volume. The FreeSurfer longitudinal module will be used to estimate change in these measures.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Neuroimaging Biomarker: Hippocampal Subfield Volumes.</measure>
    <time_frame>Change in hippocampal subfield volume between baseline and 1 year follow-up magnetic resonance imaging scan</time_frame>
    <description>We will perform automatic segmentation of hippocampal subfields in the baseline T2-weighted turbo spin echo [TSE] images. This will estimate volumes of subfields CA1, CA2, CA3, dentate gyrus, subiculum, and entorhinal cortex. We will then quantify longitudinal change in subfield volumes using the approach for the whole hippocampus, modified to account for anisotropic voxel size in TSE images.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Neuroimaging Biomarker: Ischemic Lesion Volume.</measure>
    <time_frame>Change in ischemic lesion volume between baseline and 1 year follow-up magnetic resonance imaging scan</time_frame>
    <description>The volume of white matter hyperintensity (leuokoaraiosis) will be assessed in CSFsuppressed T2-weighted (FLAIR) structural MRI. A semi-automated intensity-based segmentation technique will be used to identify cortical and subcortical strokes as well as ischemic lesions in subcortical white matter considered to be the sequelae of hypoperfusion.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Neuroimaging Biomarker: Cerebral Blood Flow.</measure>
    <time_frame>Change in cerebral blood flow between baseline and 1 year follow-up magnetic resonance imaging scan</time_frame>
    <description>ASL perfusion MRI provides regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) in absolute units of ml/100g/min. Arterial Spin Labeling [ASL] signal processing will follow established procedures in our laboratory using the ASL data processing toolbox (ASL tbx). CBF will then be quantified within cortical gray matter, hippocampal gray matter, and white matter regions based on FreeSurfer templates.</description>
