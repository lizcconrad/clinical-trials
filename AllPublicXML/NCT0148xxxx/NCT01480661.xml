    <textblock>
      In this study the possible changes in airway geometry and function induced by 6 month oral
      treatment with Daxas® (roflumilast) will be evaluated. The use of functional respiratory
      imaging (FRI) on the phenotyping of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patients
      will be examined. The study population consists of 40 severe COPD patients, global initiative
      for chronic obstructive lung disease (GOLD) stages III until IV.

      Imaging parameters will be assessed and the correlation with lung function and health related
      quality of life will be checked before and after treatment.
