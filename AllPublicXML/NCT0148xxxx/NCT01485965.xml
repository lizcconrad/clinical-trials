  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this study is to assess the effect of food upon the pharmacokinetics
      (PK) of SEN0014196 in subjects with Huntington disease (HD).
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In addition to the pharmacokinetic endpoints, the study will assess the safety and
      tolerability of 100 mg once daily (qd) doses of SEN0014196 over 14 days in subjects with HD
      and explore potential biomarkers for use in subsequent Phase 2/3 studies.

    <measure>To determine the effect of food on the repeated dose pharmacokinetics of SEN0014196 at 100 mg once daily in subjects with Huntington's disease</measure>
    <time_frame>14 Days</time_frame>
    <description>The effect of food on the PK of SEN0014196 will be evaluated for the following parameters: maximum observed plasma concentration (Cmax), time of maximum observed plasma concentration(tmax), AUC from time zero to the length of the dosing interval (tau) (AUC0-τ), AUC from time zero to the last quantifiable concentration (AUC0-last), AUC from time zero to infinity (AUC0-∞), terminal elimination half-life (t1/2), and terminal elimination rate constant (λz).</description>

    <measure>Pharmacodynamics</measure>
    <time_frame>14 Days</time_frame>
    <description>The following PD biomarkers will be assessed: soluble huntingtin levels and huntingtin acetylation status (by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay [ELISA] and liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry [LC-MS/MS]).</description>

    <measure>To determine the safety and tolerability of repeated doses of SEN0014196 at 100 mg once daily in subjects with Huntington's disease</measure>
    <time_frame>14 Days</time_frame>
    <description>Safety assessments include: AEs, ECGs, vital signs, body weight and height, clinical laboratory evaluations (serum biochemistry and hematology), urinalysis, physical and neurological examinations, C-SSRS, and UHDRS.</description>
