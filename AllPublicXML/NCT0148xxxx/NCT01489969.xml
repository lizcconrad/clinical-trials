      This is a phase II study. It is conducted using a randomized, double-blind, 3-arm placebo
      controlled, parallel group design. Eligible patients will be randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to
      receive Neu-P11 20 mg, Neu-P11 50 mg or placebo for 4 weeks The objective of this study is to
      assess the efficacy of Neu-P11 (20 and 50mg) on sleep continuity parameters in insomnia
      patients aged 18-80 years, following the first two nights (immediate effect) and at the end
      of 4 weeks of double-blind treatment. The primary efficacy endpoint in this study is Latency
      to Persistent Sleep (LPS) measured by polysomnogram (PSG) at the first two nights of
      treatment (nights 15-16 of the study; mean of two consecutive nights recordings). The
      secondary endpoints are number of awakenings after sleep onset and the duration of wake after
      sleep onset measured by PSG at the first two nights of treatment (nights 15-16 of the study;
      mean of two consecutive nights recordings).

          2. Suffering from primary insomnia according to DSM-IV criteria (307.42 primary insomnia,
             Appendix 25.1) (based on a Sleep History Questionnaire (SHQ) that is given to the
             patient at Visit Day 0, Appendix 25.1).

          3. Reported subjective sleep latency of at least 30 minutes on at least three nights per
             week for at least one month and subjective WASO of at least 45 minutes per night on at
             least 3 nights per week for at least one month (based on the SHQ).

          4. Subjects with habitual bed time within the range of 21:00-01:00 (inclusive), as
             reported by the subject during screening on Day 0.
