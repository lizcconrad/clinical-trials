    <textblock>
      This study will be a double-blind, randomized, parallel-group, active comparator design.

      Twenty-four patients with knee osteoarthritis (OA) will be randomized to be treated with a
      single IA injection of 10, 40, or 60 mg of FX006 or 40 mg of commercially available
      triamcinolone acetonide.

      Each patient will be evaluated for a total of 6 weeks following a single IA injection.
      Following screening, safety, PK and pharmacodynamics will be evaluated during one (1) 48-hour
      in-patient period (Day -1 to Day 2), two (2) 24-hour in-patient periods (Day 14-15 and Day
      42-43) and seven (7) out-patient visits (Days 3, 4, 5, 8, 22, 29 and 36).
