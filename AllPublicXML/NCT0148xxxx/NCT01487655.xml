  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Color Doppler Imaging (CDI) has been providing information about ocular blood flow over the
      past decades. This non-invasive procedure based on ultrasound technique has identified
      increased resistance and decreased systolic blood velocities to exist in the ophthalmic
      arteries of glaucoma patients. However, existing data has provided very little information
      regarding the analysis of the Doppler waveform in itself and to whether variables such as
      early systolic acceleration or systolic/diastolic velocity ratios are of any significance in
      glaucoma disease. In other medical specialties using CDI technology, such as nephrology or
      cardiology for instance, this analysis has been part of the normal routine. This information
      has been used in screening patients for disturbed circulation such as arterial stenosis or
      providing information regarding prognosis of renal and hepatic transplants have been used for
      decades now.

      What is the normal characteristics of the waveform Doppler analysis? To answer this, the
      investigators will create a normative database using healthy controls.

      Are there signs of altered stiffness or compliance in the ophthalmic arteries of glaucoma
      patients? To answer this, the analysis of early acceleration acceleration and detection of an
      early peak systolic will be done on the Doppler curves of glaucoma patients and compared to
      the healthy normative database.

      Are there any difference between the two types of glaucoma [primary open-angle glaucoma
      (POAG) and normal-tension glaucoma (NTG)]? The investigators will compare the variables of
      the ophthalmic artery waveform in these two groups.

      Do any of these Doppler waveform variables have any clinical significance? To answer this,
      the investigators will search for the existence of any correlation between the waveform data
      and both functional (visual field testing) and structural (Confocal scanning laser
      ophthalmoscopy - CSLO) variables of the glaucoma groups.

    <description>Color Doppler Imaging of the ophthalmic artery will provide the waveform of the vessel. There will be a operator-dependent identification of the slope at the beggining of the cardiac cycle and a quantification of the early systolic acceleration. This numberical data will then be compared between healthy and glaucoma groups. Such variables will further be compared to the clinical data (functional - visual field defects and structural - CSLO).</description>

    <time_frame>Hospital stay, average 3 hours</time_frame>
    <description>Using the CDI-provided ophthalmic artery waveform, there will be an operator-dependent analysis of systolic and diastolic mean blood flow velocities. the ratio between these two variables will be calculated and the numerical data obtained will be compared between the healthy and glaucoma groups. Such ratio will furthermore be compared to functional and structural damage (visual field damage and CSLO, respectively).</description>
