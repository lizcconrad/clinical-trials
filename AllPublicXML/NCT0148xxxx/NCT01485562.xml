    <textblock>
      A double-blind individual randomized controlled study of misoprostol vs. placebo for
      treatment in homebirths in the Chitral district, in the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province in
      Pakistan. The purpose of the study is to assess the overall clinical and programmatic
      effectiveness of Traditional Birth Attendants (TBAs) administering 800 mcg sublingual
      misoprostol to treat Postpartum Haemorrhage (PPH) at the community level.

      The study will recruit pregnant women who deliver at home. All women enrolled in the study
      will receive misoprostol for prevention (600 mcg oral dose). Women diagnosed with PPH will be
      randomized to receive either a) standard care + 800 mcg sublingual misoprostol (four 200 mcg
      tablets) or b) standard care + four placebo tablets resembling misoprostol. In this setting,
      standard care is uterine massage and/or compression and referral to the nearest health
      facility or attendance by the Lady Health Visitor/ Community Health Nurse.
