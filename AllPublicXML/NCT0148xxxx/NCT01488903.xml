  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Not many studies examined genetic determinants of obesity in women. As pre-menopausal and
      post-menopausal women appear to have different propensities for fat deposition, genetic loci
      linked with obesity-related phenotypes might be different by menopausal status. So far, there
      is no large scale of genetic study deciphering common obesity focusing on women population to
      examine the contributions of aging and change in menopausal status to obesity in Taiwan. The
      investigators propose this study to compare phenotypic profiles of obesity and
      cardio-metabolic factors in pre-menopausal and post-menopausal women. The study will examine
      the contributions of aging and change in menopausal status to the changes of obesity-related
      traits during the transition from pre-menopause to post-menopause period, and will evaluate
      the contribution of genetic susceptibility on body fat deposition among women at different
      stage of menopause.

      Not many studies examined genetic determinants of obesity in women. As premenopausal and
      postmenopausal women appear to have different propensities for fat deposition, genetic loci
      linked with obesity-related phenotypes might be different by menopausal status. So far, there
      is no large scale of genetic study deciphering common obesity on women focusing on the
      interaction between aging and menopause in Taiwan. The investigators propose this study to
      compare phenotypic profiles of obesity and cardiometabolic factors in a large group of
      premenopausal and postmenopausal women. The study will examine the contributions of aging and
      menopausal status to the changes of obesity-related traits, and will evaluate the
      contribution of genetic susceptibility on body fat deposition among women at different stage
      of menopause. The investigators plan to recruit two groups of subjects: 600 premenopausal,
      and 600 postmenopausal women. Each woman will receive anthropometric and blood pressure
      measurements, fasting blood sampling for lipids, and an optional 75-g oral glucose tolerance
      test for insulin resistance. Dual energy X-ray absorptiometry will also be used for body
      composition measurements among the study women if they agree to receive this optional
      examination. The investigators will collect blood samples for DNA extraction and select
      several candidate genes to study the associations between susceptible genes and
      obesity-related traits. The investigators anticipate that the results generated from the
      study will provide valuable data to a better understanding of the pathogenesis of common
      obesity during transition from premenopause to postmenopause in women.
