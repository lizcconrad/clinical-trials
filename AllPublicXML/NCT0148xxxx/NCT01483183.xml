    <textblock>
      The purpose of Part 1 of this study is to determine the maximally tolerated dose of
      OPC-108459 in patients with paroxysmal and persistent atrial fibrillation (AF).

      The purpose of Part 2 of this study is to determine potential efficacy of dose(s) of
      OPC-108459 for the treatment of paroxysmal and persistent atrial fibrillation.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This trial will test the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic characteristics of ascending
      doses of OPC-108459 in separate populations of paroxysmal and persistent AF subjects.

      The trial will consist of two parts. Each part will evaluate two populations of subjects
      presenting for cardioversion in a hospital setting.

      Cohorts of paroxysmal and persistent subjects may have their dose increased independently.

    <participant_flow>
      <recruitment_details>This trial was conducted in 40 participants at 10 trial sites in the following 3 countries: Germany, Spain, and the United States.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>The trial consists of two parts (Part 1 and Part 2). Each part evaluates two populations of participants for cardioversion in a hospital setting; one diagnosed with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (AF) and the second diagnosed with persistent AF. However, Part 2 was not conducted and therefore is not included in this document.</pre_assignment_details>

      <restrictive_agreement>The only disclosure restriction on the PI is that the sponsor can review results communications prior to public release and can embargo communications regarding trial results for a period that is less than or equal to 60 days from the time submitted to the sponsor for review. The sponsor cannot require changes to the communication and cannot extend the embargo.</restrictive_agreement>
    </certain_agreements>
    <limitations_and_caveats>The trial was terminated after Part 1 enrollment completed. It did not progress due to many factors including slow enrollment, limited site activity in pre-screening, absence of reproducible efficacy signal and increased costs.</limitations_and_caveats>
