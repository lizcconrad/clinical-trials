  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      With Contrast Enhanced UltraSound (CEUS) cancer induced neovascularisation can be visualised
      with the potential to improve ultrasound imaging for prostate cancer detection and
      localisation significantly. The past years numerous studies have been performed with CEUS,
      all basing their results on subjective judgement of the investigator. CEUS image
      interpretation is difficult and requires a well-trained expert. To overcome these
      difficulties CEUS quantification techniques can be of use. The techniques used in this
      protocol have been developed in cooperation with the Technical University in Eindhoven (TU/e)
      and BRACCO, Geneva.

      The investigators hypothesize improvement of the PCa detection rate with quantification,
      compared with subjective CEUS interpretation and known numbers in literature.

      Also a comparison between quantification results and tumour differentiation grade (Gleason
      score) will be made, the investigators hypothesize a positive correlation.
