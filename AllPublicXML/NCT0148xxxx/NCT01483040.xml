  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The PeerScope B System™ by PeerMedical Ltd. is intended to provide visualization (via a video
      monitor) and therapeutic access to the lower intestinal tract. The lower intestinal tract
      includes, but is not restricted to the organs, tissues and subsystems: large bowel and cecum.
      The device is introduced rectally, as with any standard colonoscope when indications
      consistent with the need for the procedure are observed in the adult patient population.

      The purpose of this prospective clinical study is to establish the usability of the PeerScope
      B System™ when used during standard colonoscopy procedure.

      The study population is comprised of patients indicated for colonoscopy.

      The primary endpoint is reaching the cecum of the colon with PeerScope B System™.Secondary
      endpoints:

        1. The first secondary endpoint is the incidence of complications using the PeerMedical
           colonoscope.

        2. The second secondary endpoint is successful therapeutic interventions as biopsies,
           polypectomies, APC etc.

        3. The third secondary endpoint is the procedure time.

        4. The fourth secondary endpoint is the subjective evaluation of the additional view angle
           by the physician.

        5. The fifth secondary endpoint is patient satisfactory.

      Founded in 2009, PeerMedical develops colonoscopes capable of wide view angle at the press of
      the button. The PeerScope B System™ is an endoscopic platform that enables the physician to
      get a wide angle view while maintaining all of the features commonly used during
      Gastrointestinal (GI) procedures with very limited learning curve and in service process. The
      current standard devices have viewing limitations. By adding this viewing functionality,
      PeerMedical will potentially empower physicians to improve polyps detection and cancers
      within the colon.

    <description>Cancer of the colon and rectum is second only to lung cancer as the leading cause of cancer-related deaths in the United States.Each year, about 1.23 million new cases of bowel cancer are diagnosed worldwide, 333,000 in Europe alone. Colorectal cancer almost always starts in a benign growth called a polyp. Polyps originate in the inner lining of the colon, where they may be visible in a screening test known as colonoscopy. Recent research has shown that appropriate screening and treatment can alleviate much of the suffering associated with colorectal cancer and reduce the number of deaths caused by this malignancy</description>
