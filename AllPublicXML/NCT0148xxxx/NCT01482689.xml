      The main aim of the present study is to compare the bioavailability of vitamin D from cod
      liver oil and multivitamin tablets given to healthy individuals under the same conditions, as
      well as to study the influence of gender and ethnicity on vitamin D absorption. Healthy
      subjects will be randomised into two parallel groups receiving 10 micrograms (400 IU) per day
      of vitamin D3 from one fish oil capsule or one solid multivitamin tablet, respectively. Serum
      samples will be drawn at baseline and after four weeks (28 days) for the analysis of
      25-hydroxyvitamin D, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D, parathyroid hormone, and tartrate resistant
      acid phosphatase in serum.

    <description>One capsule per day for 4 weeks (28 days). The fish oil group receives a daily supplement of one fish oil capsule, specially manufactured for the present study by Peter Möller (now Möller's, Nydalen, Norway). The fish oil capsules are aimed to contain a dose of cholecalciferol identical to the dose already found in the multivitamin tablets by analysis in an independent laboratory (AS Vitas, Oslo, Norway), and similar doses of vitamin A. In addition, the fish oil capsule contains vitamin E and n-3 fatty acids.</description>

    <description>One tablet per day for 4 weeks (28 days). The multivitamin group receives a daily supplement of one multivitamin tablet of type Vitaplex ABCD (Cederroth AS, Revetal, Norway), a common vitamin supplement sold in grocery stores in Norway. In addition to 10 micrograms (400 IU) of cholecalciferol,the multivitamin tablet contains vitamin A and the water-soluble vitamins: B1, B2, B6, Niacin, pantothenic acid, and vitamin C.</description>
