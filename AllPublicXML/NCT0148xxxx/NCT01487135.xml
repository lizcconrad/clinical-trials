  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of EVP-6124 at therapeutic and
      supratherapeutic concentrations on cardiac repolarization in healthy subjects.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Subjects will be randomized to six treatment sequences of 10 subjects each. Subjects will be
      admitted to the clinic on Day -1 before dosing. Each of the EVP-6124 and placebo treatment
      periods (blinded) will include a 10-day/9-night confinement to the Clinical Pharmacology Unit
      (CPU) with study drugs being administered on Day 1 and Day 2. The moxifloxacin treatment
      period (open-label) will include a 3-day/2-night confinement to the CPU with moxifloxacin
      administration on Day 1.

      The study will include 2 washout periods in which each washout starts from the time of the
      last dose of the preceding treatment period to the first dose of the next treatment period.
      The washouts following the EVP-6124 or placebo treatments will be 30 days while the washout
      following the moxifloxacin treatment will be 7 days. Follow-up visit (5 to 10 days following
      discharge from the CPU).

    <description>Change-from-baseline in Fridericia's correction QTc (ΔQTcF) and change-from-baseline in Bazett's correction QTc (ΔQTcB) will be secondary variables.
The placebo-corrected baseline-adjusted QTc (ΔΔQTc), calculated as differences between time-matched mean change-from-baseline QTc values obtained on Day 1 (low dose) and on Day 2 (high dose) of the EVP-6124 treatment relative to the corresponding QTc values obtained on Day 1 and Day 2 of the placebo treatment, will be evaluated to quantify the effect of EVP-6124 on cardiac repolarization.</description>
