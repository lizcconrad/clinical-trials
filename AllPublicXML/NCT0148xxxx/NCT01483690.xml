    <textblock>
      This is a pilot study using decitabine and vorinostat before and during chemotherapy with
      vincristine, dexamethasone, mitoxantrone, and peg-asparaginase in pediatric patients with
      acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Decitabine is a demethylating agent and vorinostat is a HDAC inhibitor. The use of
      demethylating agents and HDAC inhibitors in combination have been previously shown to have
      synergistic effects in altering neoplastic pathways of cancer cells and be well tolerated in
      human clinical studies. With the ability of decitabine and vorinostat to alter the abnormal
      cellular pathways of leukemic blasts and essentially turn off anti-apoptotic proteins, the
      leukemia cells have become primed for cytotoxic cell kill via chemotherapeutic agents. This
      study will ask the question as to whether or not the combination of decitabine and vorinostat
      followed by chemotherapy is feasible and whether it can positively impact outcome in patients
      with relapsed or refractory acute lymphoblastic leukemia.

          -  Patients will be excluded if they have a systemic fungal, bacterial, viral or other
             infection that is exhibiting ongoing signs/symptoms related to the infection without
             improvement despite appropriate antibiotics or other treatment.

          -  Patients will be excluded if there is a plan to administer non-protocol chemotherapy,
             radiation therapy, or immunotherapy during the study period.

          -  Patients will be excluded if they have significant concurrent disease, illness,
             psychiatric disorder or social issue that would compromise patient safety or
             compliance with the protocol treatment or procedures, interfere with consent, study
             participation, follow up, or interpretation of study results.

          -  Patients will be excluded if they have had any positive fungal culture in the last 30
