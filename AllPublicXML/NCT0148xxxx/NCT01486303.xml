    <description>The investigators generated a contour line on the face using Moire's system, and then took a picture with a digital camera Ixus750 (Canon, Tokyo, Japan). Three independent evaluators will read the contour lines near the cheek and the perioral region in the printed digital image and grade images base on the Criteria for evaluating Moire's topography (Skin Research and Technology 2007;13:280-284). The average values from three evaluators will be used in subsequent calculations.</description>
