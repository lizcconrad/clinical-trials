      Study has two parts:

        1. Dose-finding: to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and to evaluate the safety
           and tolerability of RAD001 (everolimus , Afinitor®) in combination with BEZ235 in
           patients with advanced solid tumors.

        2. Dose-expansion: to assess safety and tolerability of RAD001 and BEZ235 at the MTD in
           patients with ER+/HER2- metastatic breast cancer and metastatic renal cell cancer

    <description>Patients will receive first dose of RAD001 at 2.5mg/5mg/10 mg weekly or 2.5mg/5mg daily in combination of BEZ235 at 50 mg/100 mg/200 mg/300 mg/400 mg twice a day. In the initial cohort of the dose finding phase, patients will receive a single 2.5 mg dose of RAD001 on Cycle 1 Day 1 and the combination therapy of RAD001 2.5 mg/week and BEZ235 200 mg bid starting on Cycle 1 Day 8. Dose escalation phase: patients will start RAD001 and BEZ235 on Cycle 1 Day 1 with both study drugs being administered at the center. Dose expansion phase: the first 15 patients enrolled at selected sites will take RAD001 as monotherapy from Day 1 to Day 7 (for PK sampling). The combination therapy of RAD001 and BEZ235 will start on Day 8. All remaining patients will receive the combination therapy of RAD001 and BEZ235 starting on Cycle 1 Day 1.</description>

    <intervention_name>RAD001 + BEZ235</intervention_name>
    <description>RAD001 is formulated as tablets of 2.5 mg and 5 mg strength, blistered in units of 10 tablets (for oral use) each. Blisters should be opened only at the time of dministration as the drug is both hygroscopic and light-sensitive. RAD001 should be administered immediately after a meal with a large glass of water. BEZ235 is supplied as 50-mg, 200-mg, 300-mg and 400-mg sachets (for oral use). BEZ235 is packaged in aluminum foil bags. Bags are packaged in a box. Patients will receive RAD001 in combination with BEZ235.</description>
