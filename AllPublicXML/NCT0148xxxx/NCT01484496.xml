  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 3, multi-center, international, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled,
      52-week study to evaluate the efficacy, safety and tolerability of belimumab administered
      subcutaneously (SC) (200 mg weekly) in adult subjects with active Systemic Lupus
      Erythematosus (SLE). Approximately 816 SLE subjects will be randomized, with a target of
      about 544 subjects receiving belimumab and 272 subjects receiving placebo. Subjects
      completing the 52-week double-blind period can enter a 6-month open-label extension in which
      all subjects receive belimumab 200 mg SC weekly.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Par. Achieving a SLE Responder Index (SRI) Response Rate at Week 52</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 52</time_frame>
    <description>SRI response is defined as &gt;=4 point reduction, from Baseline in safety of estrogen in lupus national assessment (SELENA) systemic lupus erythematosus disease activity index (SLEDAI) score, no worsening (increase of &lt;0.30 points from Baseline) in physician's global assessment (PGA) and no new British Isles Lupus Assessment Group of SLE clinics (BILAG) A organ domain score or 2 new BILAG B organ domain scores compared with Baseline. Analysis was performed using a logistic regression model for the comparison between belimumab and placebo with covariates treatment group, Baseline SELENA SLEDAI score (&lt;=9 vs. &gt;=10), Baseline complement levels (low C3 and/or C4 vs. no low C3 or C4) and race (black vs. other).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Time to First Severe Flare (as Measured by the Modified SLE Flare Index)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Day 0, prior to dosing) to Week 52</time_frame>
    <description>Time to first severe SLE flare is defined as the number of days from treatment start date until the participant met an event (event date - treatment start date +1). Analyses of severe SLE flare was performed on modified SELENA SLEDAI SLE flare index that excludes severe flares that were triggered only by an increase in SELENA SLEDAI score to &gt;12 (since this may only represent a modest increase in disease activity). Only post-baseline severe flares were considered.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Par. Whose Average Prednisone Dose Had Been Reduced by &gt;=25% From Baseline to &lt;=7.5 mg/Day During Weeks 40 Through 52 in Par. Receiving Greater Than 7.5 mg/Day at Baseline</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Day 0, prior to dosing), Weeks 40 through Week 52</time_frame>
    <description>For the analysis of steroid use, all steroid dosages were converted to a prednisone equivalent in mg. The average daily prednisone dose was calculated taking into account all steroids taken intravenously, intramuscularly, SC, intradermally and orally for both SLE and non-SLE reasons. A responder was defined as having a prednisone reduction by &gt;=25% from Baseline to &lt;=7.5 mg/day during Weeks 40 through 52. At Baseline, the average daily prednisone dose was the sum of all prednisone doses over 7 consecutive days up to, but not including Day 0, divided by 7. For this analysis, the average prednisone dose was the total prednisone dose during weeks 40 through 52 divided by the number of days during Weeks 40 through 52. Analysis was performed using a logistic regression model with covariates treatment group, Baseline prednisone dose, Baseline SELENA SLEDAI score, (&lt;=9 vs &gt;=10), Baseline complement levels (low C3 and/or C4 vs. no low C3 or C4) and race (black vs. other).</description>

Analyses of severe SLE flare was performed on modified SELENA SLEDAI SLE flare index that excludes severe flares that were triggered only by an increase in SELENA SLEDAI score to &gt;12 (since this may only represent a modest increase in disease activity). Only post-baseline severe flares were considered.</description>

        <description>For the analysis of steroid use, all steroid dosages were converted to a prednisone equivalent in mg. The average daily prednisone dose was calculated taking into account all steroids taken intravenously, intramuscularly, SC, intradermally and orally for both SLE and non-SLE reasons. A responder was defined as having a prednisone reduction by &gt;=25% from Baseline to &lt;=7.5 mg/day during Weeks 40 through 52. At Baseline, the average daily prednisone dose was the sum of all prednisone doses over 7 consecutive days up to, but not including Day 0, divided by 7. For this analysis, the average prednisone dose was the total prednisone dose during weeks 40 through 52 divided by the number of days during Weeks 40 through 52. Analysis was performed using a logistic regression model with covariates treatment group, Baseline prednisone dose, Baseline SELENA SLEDAI score, (&lt;=9 vs &gt;=10), Baseline complement levels (low C3 and/or C4 vs. no low C3 or C4) and race (black vs. other).</description>
