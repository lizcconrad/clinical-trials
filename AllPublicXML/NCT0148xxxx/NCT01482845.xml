    <textblock>
      This study will investigate safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of ABT-126 in up to 20
      male and female subjects, between 55 to 90 years of age with mild to moderate Alzheimer's
      disease on stable doses of acetylcholinesterase inhibitors.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized, multiple-dose, parallel group,
      multicenter study. Up to 20 male and female subjects with mild to moderate Alzheimer's
      disease (AD) who are taking stable doses of acetylcholinesterase inhibitors will be enrolled
      in this study. The study will be conducted in up to four sites. Within 28 days prior to study
      drug administration, subjects will be screened based on National Institute of Neurological
      and Communicative Disorders and Stroke/Alzheimer's Disease and Related Disorders Association
      (NINCDS/ADRDA) criteria for probable AD, Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and Modified
      Hachinski Ischemic Scale (MHIS) scores, medical history, physical examination, neurological
      examination, vital signs, ECG, laboratory tests and response to Columbia-Suicide Severity
      Rating Scale (C-SSRS).

      Subjects will be divided into two groups of 10 subjects each. In each group, 8 subjects will
      receive ABT-126 and two subjects will receive matching placebo. Group 1 will be administered
      Dose 1 of ABT-126 or placebo. Group 2 will be administered Dose 2 ABT-126 or placebo. All
      doses will be administered once daily in the morning for 10 days.

        Inclusion Criteria

          1. Male or female and age between 55 and 90 years, inclusive.

          2. The subject meets the National Institute of Neurological and Communicative Disorders
             and Stroke/Alzheimer's Disease and Related Disorders Association (NINCDS/ADRDA)
             criteria for probable Alzheimer's Disease (AD).

          3. The subject has a Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) total score of 16 to 26,
             inclusive, at Screening Visit.

          4. The subject has a Modified Hachinski Ischemic Scale (MHIS) score of â‰¤ 4 at Screening
             Visit.

          5. The subject must be on a stable dose of donepezil or rivastigmine for at least 1 month
             prior to study drug administration.

          6. The subject has had a computerized tomography or magnetic resonance imaging scan,
             interpreted by a radiologist or neurologist, within 36 months prior to randomization
             and after the subject met NINCDS/ADRDA diagnostic criteria for probable AD. The scan
             must not show evidence for an alternative etiology for dementia.

        Exclusion Criteria
