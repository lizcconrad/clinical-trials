    <textblock>
      The objectives of this study are to compare frequency and severity of moderate to severe
      vasomotor symptoms in postmenopausal women treated with applied relaxation (AR) with an
      untreated control-group (CG) and to investigate if Health Related Quality of Life improve in
      the AR-group compared to an untreated CG.To study if salivary cortisol excretion would change
      within the AR treated group compared with the control group.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Approximately 70% of women in Europe and North America experience hot flashes and night
      sweats during the climacteric period. Many women abstain from hormonal therapy because of
      side effects or contraindications such as breast cancer or thrombosis.

      Different alternative therapies for alleviation of hot flashes are described in the
      literature. Both pharmacological treatments, different types of natural remedies,
      acupuncture, life-style changes and mind-body therapies are suggested as promising therapies.
      Applied relaxation (AR) is a technique influenced on cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) using
      coping mechanism and conditioning. Previous study with healthy postmenopausal women showed
      promising results on hot flash frequency with an average decrease of more than 70 % with
      persisting effect three months after therapy and also HRQoL significantly increased probably
      due to better sleep and diminished vasomotor symptoms. But the method must be further
      investigated before strong evidence-based conclusion can be drawn.

      Cortisol is a potent stress hormone regulated by the hypothalamic-pituitary axis. The factors
      underlying how alternative treatment works and the mechanism underlying improvements in
      symptoms are not fully understood.

    <intervention_name>Applied Relaxation (AR)</intervention_name>
    <description>AR is a technique influenced on cognitive behavioral therapy using coping mechanism and conditioning. AR focuses on muscle relaxation, where breathing is used for the conditioning of the relaxation. AR implies participation in 10 group sessions during a period of 12 weeks. A therapist will see the women assigned to AR in a group consisted of 6-8 women. The weekly sessions will last for 60 minutes each and are based on a scheme from Öst. The women will be told to practice each component daily.
During the first session a lecture about menopause and about theories of the mechanisms behind hot flashes will be given.
The aim of applying AR in view of coping with vasomotor symptoms will be discussed. The group is given a rationale of applying AR as a coping technique for handling sudden unanticipated symptoms by quick calming down, and thus gaining control over the situation.</description>
