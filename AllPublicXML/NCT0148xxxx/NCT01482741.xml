  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Risks from imaging-related radiation exposure have become a popular topic in the media.
      Because these tests are commonly applied to patients at a cancer center, it is important to
      understand what patients know, how they feel about what they know, where they get their
      information, and how satisfied they are with available risk-benefit communication on this
      topic.

      The purpose of this study is to understand how cancer patients perceive risks and benefits of
      diagnostic radiation and their satisfaction with healthcare communication on this topic.

    <description>Participants will complete a pre-focus group demographic questionnaire. Focus group participants will be asked to report the following: current age; gender; race/ethnicity; income; highest education attained; occupation; and cancer stage if participant has a cancer history. Participants who are parents of pediatric patients will also report their child's current age, gender, and cancer stage. Ten questions will be developed by the investigators and posed to each group by the moderator to solicit the desired information. The objective for the focus groups will be to systematically explore three domains: 1) what participants know about radiation as it relates to medical imaging; 2) how what they know or believe about radiation shapes their attitudes about it; 3) and participant perceptions regarding the availability and adequacy of their sources, including risk-benefit communication with health care providers</description>
