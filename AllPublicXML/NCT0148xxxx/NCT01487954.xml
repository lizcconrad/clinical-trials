    <textblock>
      This phase II trial is studying how well alkaline water works in reducing skin toxicity in
      women with breast cancer undergoing radiation therapy. Alkaline water may reduce radiation
      therapy-related skin toxicity in patients with breast cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

      I. The goal of this two-phase study is to assess the rate of grade 2 or higher
      radiation-related skin toxicity in adult patients with breast malignancies after
      administration of alkaline (pH 9.0) or distilled (pH 7.0) water consumed immediately prior to
      and after daily radiation treatments.

      OUTLINE:

      FEASIBILITY PHASE: Patients undergo external beam radiation therapy once daily (QD), 5 days a
      week for 6 weeks. Patients drink 8 ounces of alkaline water within 30 minutes immediately
      prior to and after undergoing radiation therapy.

      INTERVENTION PHASE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

      ARM I: Patients undergo external beam radiation therapy QD, 5 days a week for 6 weeks.
      Patients drink 8 ounces of alkaline water within 30 minutes immediately prior to and after
      undergoing radiation therapy.

      ARM II: Patients undergo external beam radiation therapy as in arm I. Patients also drink 8
      ounces of distilled water within 30 minutes immediately prior to and after undergoing
      radiation therapy.

      Treatment continues in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 1 month.

    <description>Information will include the type, severity, time of onset and resolution of its onset, and its probable association with the study regimen. Frequency tables will be constructed to summarize observed incidents by severity and type of toxicity during weekly radiation treatment and 1 month after radiation treatment.

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients must have histologically or cytologically confirmed stage 0-IV breast cancer
             and have a treatment plan consisting of 62Gy (31 fractions) of total breast radiation
             therapy to be eligible; patients are eligible if they have received any number of
             prior chemotherapies; patients having received chemotherapy prior to radiation will be
             stratified among randomization groups during the second phase of this study

          -  Life expectancy of greater than 3 months

          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status =&lt; 2 (Karnofsky &gt;= 60%)

          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients receiving any investigational chemotherapeutic agents during planned
             radiation or any prior breast or chest wall radiation treatments are excluded

          -  Patients receiving concurrent chemotherapy are excluded because of an increased
             relative risk of skin toxicity; patients taking daily proton-pump inhibitor or
             H2-blocker antacid medications are excluded because of predicted interference of
             alkaline water consumption and stomach pH; herceptin for the purposes of this clinical
             trial would be considered a chemotherapy, and as such, patients receiving herceptin
             chemotherapy during radiation would not be eligible for participation in this protocol

          -  Patients with a history of any prior malignancy except non-melanoma skin cancer or
             carcinoma in-situ of the cervix not in remission for twelve months are excluded;
             patients with known brain metastases are excluded from this clinical trial because of
             their overall poor prognosis

          -  Pregnancy excludes female patients from this study because radiation is potentially
             teratogenic and abortifacient; screening beta-hcg levels and clinically-indicated
             diagnostic tests will be used to determine eligibility
