  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Maintenance therapy has been considered as an important component to prolong survival in
      patients with advanced Nonsquamous Non-small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC). Previous studies have
      confirmed that pemetrexed is one of the effective drugs in improving progression-free
      survival for stage IIIb-IV nonsquamous non-small cell lung cancer. With the periodic
      deliveries of pemetrexed, however,the functioning status and immune system may get worse,
      which subsequently has an negative impact on patient's quality-of-life. Immunotherapy with
      autologous cytokine-induced killer (CIK) cells can activate the antitumor defense mechanism
      through stimulating immune response and altering the interaction between tumor and its host.
      This effect may result in improved tumor control and survival, as well as a better quality of
      life. To test the hypothesis, a randomised controlled study was conducted to compare CIK
      cells with pemetrexed as maintenance therapy for stage IIIb-IV nonsquamous non-small cell
      lung cancer.
