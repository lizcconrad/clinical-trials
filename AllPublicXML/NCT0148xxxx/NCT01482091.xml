    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if intranasal fentanyl can decrease the pain of
      patients with sickle cell disease who present to the pediatric emergency department with a
      vaso-occlusive crisis.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Principles of therapy for treatment of vaso-occlusive crises include early aggressive
      analgesic therapy with opiates and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents as well as fluid
      administration. It is known that there is a significant delay in time to administration of
      analgesics in children with VOC in the ED. The most easily modifiable factor that contributes
      to delayed opiate administration is route of administration.

      Intranasal medication administration is an easy, rapid way to administer opiates with minimal
      discomfort as well as bypassing first past metabolism and the blood brain barrier. Intranasal
      fentanyl has been shown to be a safe and effective analgesic for treatment of acute pain in
      children, reaching therapeutic effect in 2-10 minutes after administration.

      The investigators believe that intranasal fentanyl therapy will be able to provide expedited
      and effective pain therapy to patients with sickle cell disease presenting to the pediatric
      emergency department with a vaso-occlusive crisis

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Pain Score 20 Minutes After Administration of Study Drug</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 20 minutes after administration of study drug</time_frame>
    <description>Change in pain score between 0 and 20 minutes using the Wong Baker FACES pain scale (WBFPS). The WBFPRS has six faces, with each face representing an increasing severity of pain the more rightward it is on the scale (0 is the lowest score , which represents the least amount of pain, while 10 is the highest score which represents the greatest level of pain).. Each face has an even number underneath it, consecutively.
To calculate the change, the reported pain score at 20 minutes was subtracted from the reported baseline pain score. Thus, the higher change in pain score is indicative of a GREATER change in pain (i.e. greater decrease in pain at 20 minutes compared to baseline). The greatest possible changes in pain would be a 10 (pain score of 10 at baseline and 0 at 20 minutes) representing a DECREASE in pain between the two time points, and -10 (pain score of 0 at baseline and 10 at 20 minutes) representing a INCREASE in pain between the two time points.</description>

    <participant_flow>
      <recruitment_details>Subjects were PRE-CONSENTED for the study in the outpatient hematology clinic, inpatient floors prior to discharge or a separate emergency department (ED) visit prior to discharge. This was done to prevent decision making while under emotional duress of a vaso-occlusive crisis (VOC).
PRE-CONSENT occurred from 12.12.2011-1.8.2015</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>124 subjects were consented for the study. The study drug was only administered one time in the ED if subjects met all inclusion and exclusion criteria when they arrived with a VOC. Only 49 of the 124 consented subjects received the study drug.</pre_assignment_details>

        <title>Change in Pain Score 20 Minutes After Administration of Study Drug</title>
        <description>Change in pain score between 0 and 20 minutes using the Wong Baker FACES pain scale (WBFPS). The WBFPRS has six faces, with each face representing an increasing severity of pain the more rightward it is on the scale (0 is the lowest score , which represents the least amount of pain, while 10 is the highest score which represents the greatest level of pain).. Each face has an even number underneath it, consecutively.
To calculate the change, the reported pain score at 20 minutes was subtracted from the reported baseline pain score. Thus, the higher change in pain score is indicative of a GREATER change in pain (i.e. greater decrease in pain at 20 minutes compared to baseline). The greatest possible changes in pain would be a 10 (pain score of 10 at baseline and 0 at 20 minutes) representing a DECREASE in pain between the two time points, and -10 (pain score of 0 at baseline and 10 at 20 minutes) representing a INCREASE in pain between the two time points.</description>

        <title>Change in Pain Score at 10 Minutes</title>
        <description>Change in pain score between 0 and 10 minutes using the Wong Baker FACES pain scale (WBFPS). The WBFPRS has six faces, with each face representing an increasing severity of pain the more rightward it is on the scale (0 is the lowest score , which represents the least amount of pain, while 10 is the highest score which represents the greatest level of pain).. Each face has an even number underneath it, consecutively.
To calculate the change, the reported pain score at 10 minutes was subtracted from the reported baseline pain score. Thus, the higher change in pain score is indicative of a GREATER change in pain (i.e. greater decrease in pain at 10 minutes compared to baseline). The greatest possible changes in pain would be a 10 (pain score of 10 at baseline and 0 at 10 minutes) representing a DECREASE in pain between the two time points, and -10 (pain score of 0 at baseline and 10 at 10 minutes) representing a INCREASE in pain between the two time points.</description>
