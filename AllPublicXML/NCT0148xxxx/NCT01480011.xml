  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with various malignancies who are taken up for high dose chemotherapy followed by
      stem cell transplant (blood and marrow transplant) have very high chances of developing
      severe oral mucositis (between 95-100%). This mucositis not only causes significant morbidity
      but also hampers quality of life so much so that patients at times feel difficult to continue
      treatment.

      No definite treatment exists for prevention or treatment of oral mucositis in this group of
      patients. Though one study has suggested that use of IV palifermin (a keratinocyte growth
      factor) will reduce duration and severity. Palifermin is very expensive and not available in
      country. Recently the investigators have shown effectiveness of a probiotic Lactobacillus CD
      2 in reducing incidence and severity of chemo-radiotherapy induced mucositis in head and neck
      squamous cell cancer patients. (Published online in European Journal of Cancer:
      http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ejca.2011.06.010). No significant toxicity has been reported with
      its use.

      Now, the investigators want to study the efficacy of this drug to reduce severity of
      mucositis in patients undergoing hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. The drug will be
      supplied by CD Pharma India Private Limited.

      The investigators further give undertaking that study will be carried as per good clinical
      practices (GCP) and declaration of Helsinki.
