      This is a new potential use for the product Adapalene 0.3%, which is currently an FDA
      approved topical treatment used for the treatment of acne.

      Senile purpura is a common sign of aging that appears in the form of dark blotches on the
      skin and is caused by bruising.

      Older adults tend to be more prone to bruising, since as people age, their skin becomes
      thinner and more fragile.
