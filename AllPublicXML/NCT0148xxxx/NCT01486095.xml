    <textblock>
      Treatment of bifurcation lesions with drug-eluting stents (DES) (especially when a double
      stent technique is used) is associated with a higher risk for stent thrombosis. Different
      factors may play a role in the higher risk for stent thrombosis in bifurcation lesions.
      Possible mechanisms are delayed endothelialisation due to the action of the drug, coating
      polymers, or overlapping stent segments, incomplete stent apposition at specific sites in the
      bifurcation lesion and higher thrombogenicity due to turbulent flow at the bifurcation site.
      In human pathological data, the RUTSS (ratio of uncovered to total stent struts) appears to
      be the most powerful predictor of stent thrombosis.

      This prospective study will assess the differences in stent strut coverage and stent strut
      apposition after complex bifurcation lesion treatment with the dedicated AXXESS Biolimus
      A9-eluting bifurcation stent at the bifurcation site and additional Biomatrix Biolimus
      A9-eluting stents in the distal main vessel and the side branch versus treatment with the
      culotte technique using the Xience Prime everolimus-eluting stents.

      BACKGROUND: There is an ongoing controversy over the efficacy and safety of different
      bifurcation stenting techniques. Critical considerations are the rate of restenosis at the
      side branch ostium, and completeness of healing at sites of overlap of stent struts, which
      may affect the risk of stent thrombosis.

      AIMS: To compare vessel healing at 9 months using OCT imaging for two different treatment
      techniques for treating bifurcation lesions. Quantitative assessment of OCT images will be
      used to assess re-endothelialisation and quality of strut apposition to the vessel wall.

      METHODS: Patients with true bifurcation lesions with involvement of a significant side branch
      requiring a stent will be randomly assigned to one of two treatment strategies. Group A will
      comprise 20 patients which will be treated with the Axxess™ Drug Eluting Coronary Bifurcation
      Stent System (Biosensors Europe SA) where additional Biomatrix™ Drug Eluting Coronary Stent
      Systems (Biosensors Europe SA) are implanted into the distal main branch (MB) and the side
      branch (SB) as required. Group B will consist of 20 patients which will be treated with the
      culotte technique using Xience Prime everolimus-eluting stents (Abbott-Vascular, US). Kissing
      balloon dilatation using non-compliant balloons will complete the index procedure in all
      cases. At 9 months, control angiography for all patients (with QCA using dedicated software)
      and OCT (of both main vessel and side branch) will be performed.

      ENROLMENT PLAN:

      Start: Third quarter of 2011 Enrolment period: ± 12 months Clinical follow-up: 5 years
      Angiographic and OCT results expected third quarter of 2013

    <description>After mandatory predilatation, a self-expanding, conically shaped nickel-titanium AXXESS biolimus A9-eluting stent is placed at the level of the carina. The device is available in 3.0 and 3.5 mm calibre and 11 and 14 mm length. Depending on the lesion anatomy, additional Biomatrix™ Drug Eluting Coronary Stent Systems are placed distally if necessary. The procedure is completed with kissing balloon postdilatation using non-compliant balloons sized to the reference vessel diameter of the distal branches. Before this kissing balloon inflation, consecutive high pressure inflations should be performed in both branches.</description>

    <description>The culotte technique consists of stenting one of both branches of the bifurcation lesion first, and after balloon dilatation of the stent meshes, stenting the uncovered branch through the first stent and leaving the main vessel covered with two overlapped stents. The procedure is terminated by kissing balloon dilatation of both branches using non-compliant balloons sized to the reference vessel diameter of the distal branches. Before this kissing balloon inflation, consecutive high pressure inflations should be performed in both branches.</description>
