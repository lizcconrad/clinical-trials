  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This dose-escalating study consists of 3 parts (A, B and C) and will evaluate the safety,
      pharmacokinetics and efficacy of RO5479599, alone or in combination with cetuximab or
      erlotinib, in participants with metastatic and/or locally advanced malignant HER3-positive
      solid tumors. Cohorts of participants will receive escalating doses of intravenous RO5479599
      as monotherapy (Part A) or in combination with cetuximab (in Part B) or with erlotinib (in
      Part C) followed by an extension phase for each part.

      In an imaging substudy, participants will receive one or two doses of zirconium-89-labeled
      RO5479599 (89ZrRO5479599) in addition to unlabeled RO5479599 to evaluate the in vivo
      biodistribution and organ pharmacokinetics of RO5479599.
