  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this project is to reduce health disparities in obesity risk among 8-10 year
      old African American girls using a culturally sensitive and developmentally appropriate
      internet-based program with no face-to-face interaction. This study will conduct an outcome
      evaluation to test short and longer term effects on obesity risk.

      This research will conduct an outcome evaluation on a promising web based obesity prevention
      program for 8-10 year old African American girls. A pilot study with 80 girls established its
      feasibility: recruitment goals were met; attrition rates were &lt; 10%; logon rates to the
      online program were 74.5%; and statistically significant increases in fruit and vegetable
      consumption and time spent being physically active were observed. The outcome evaluation will
      recruit 400 child-parent pairs to examine short and longer term effects of the program on
      obesity risk. It will also conduct mediation analyses to examine pathways of effect. At the
      end of the study, the web based program will be hosted on the CNRC web site. Although the use
      of the internet as a method for changing health behavior is not new, the use of an internet
      program alone, with no face to face interaction, is novel. This is one of the first programs
      to attempt this, particularly in an at-risk population.

    <description>The girls randomized to this arm of the study will view an interactive story about 6 8-10 year old African American girls who seek to find clues to solve a mystery about the town in which they live. The episodes will contain information about healthy nutrition and physical activity, as well as basic information about physical activity and kitchen safety tips, developmentally appropriate recipes, and portion sizes. Girls randomized to this arm of the study will also engage in key behavior change procedures, such as goal setting, problem solving, and self monitoring.</description>

    <description>This is an 8 episode intervention, delivered entirely over the internet. Each episode, girls will view an interactive story in which 6 8-10 year old African American characters attempt to solve a mystery about their town. The online program will include information about healthy nutrition (i.e., consuming more fruit, vegetables, water) and physical activity. There will be two groups; one group (the experimental group) will view the interactive story and participate in key behavior change procedures, such as personal goal setting, problem solving, and self monitoring activities. The second group (the active comparator group) will view the online stories but will not engage in key behavior change procedures.</description>
