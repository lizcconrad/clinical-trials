    <textblock>
      The objectives of the study are to observe and document the efficacy and safety of 5 or more
      Adacolumn treatments, administered once weekly over 5 or more weeks, in a specific subset of
      ulcerative colitis patients. The patient subset of interest is those with moderate/severe,
      steroid-dependent, active ulcerative colitis with insufficient response or intolerance to
      immunosuppressants and/or biological agents.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients enrolled into the study will be between 18 and 75 years old and have moderate
             to severe, steroid-dependent, active ulcerative colitis documented by clinical
             symptoms, endoscopic findings and histology. Patients will have an ulcerative colitis
             clinical activity (CAI) of ≥6 and an endoscopic activity index (EAI) of ≥4. Patients
             will have an insufficient response or intolerance to immunosuppressants and/or
             biological treatment agents. Patients are required to have adequate peripheral venous
             access to allow completion of apheresis treatment.
