      Assess DWI MRI in patients with early Rheumatoid Arthritis to determine whether the MRI
      method will assist in differentiating poor prognosis bone oedema more effectively than
      traditional T2 weighted MRI.

      Aim 1: To compare DWI MRI with T2 weighted MRI for the discrimination of different types of
      bone oedema lesions in patients with early RA.

      Aim 2: To examine the association between the presence of different types of bone oedema
      lesions detected on DWI MRI and T2 weighted MRI and the development of subsequent joint bone
      erosion as detected on i) MRI and ii) standard plain radiographs.
