  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Use of sedatives and analgesics is common in mechanically ventilated patients hospitalized in
      Intensive Care Unit (ICU). That is called &quot; sedation &quot; and aimed to reduce both pain and
      anxiety and also to allow an effective and atraumatic mechanical ventilation. However,
      sedation excess and ventilator support excess, both in duration and intensity, are associated
      with an excess morbidity. Patients usually are systematically sedated after having been
      intubated. Then, sedation is stopped first before ventilator support is weaning. Several
      studies shown that rationalized protocols of sedation and ventilation orderings had a
      beneficial impact on non surgical patients' outcome. Feasibility of these protocols in
      surgical patients is still unknown. Moreover, no study has evaluated an optimized paired
      strategy of sedation-ventilation based on the priority setting of ventilation. This priority
      setting of ventilation should increase patient's comfort in spite of increasing sedatives and
      analgesics dosing. An paired sedation-ventilation protocol optimized for both duration and
      intensity of these treatments could improve surgical patients' outcome in ICU.

      Intervention group:

        -  Continuous use of sedatives and analgesics (commonly called &quot;sedation&quot;) will be stopped
           upon enrolment.

        -  Ventilator asynchrony in Volume assist Controlled Ventilation (VCV) will be treated by
           switching to Pressure Support Ventilation (PSV) or adjusting setting of VCV.

        -  Pain, anxiety and agitation will be treated by priority setting of the mechanical
           ventilator aimed to deliver the most comfortable ventilator support and secondly by
           adding analgesics and/or psychoactive drugs without inducing a coma state.- Persistent
           ventilator asynchrony or persistent agitation will be treated by 6-hours continuous
           sedation periods.

        -  Extubation will be performed according to criteria defined by the national consensus on
           mechanical ventilation weaning, which are based on a daily spontaneous breathing trial
           in the absence of any sedation.

      Control group (standard practices):

        -  Continuous use of sedatives and analgesics (commonly called &quot;sedation&quot;) will be daily
           stopped according to criteria defined by the national consensus on sedation for ICU
           patients.- During the period before the interruption of sedation, ventilator asynchrony
           in VCV will be treated by increasing the depth of sedation and then the dose of opioids.

        -  During the period before the interruption of sedation, pain, anxiety and agitation will
           be treated by a priority adjustment of sedation according to the nurse driven protocol
           recommended by the national consensus on sedation for ICU patients.- During the period
           after the interruption of sedation, ventilator asynchrony will be treated by switching
           to the PSV mode. In case of return to VCV, asynchrony will be treated by restart of
           sedation.

        -  During the period after the interruption of sedation, pain, anxiety and agitation will
           be treated as for the intervention group.

        -  Extubation will be performed according to criteria defined by the national consensus on
           mechanical ventilation weaning, which are based on a daily spontaneous breathing trial
           in the absence of any sedation.
