  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is primarily designed to evaluate the impact of AVONEX PEN autoinjector on work
      capacity of participants with multiple sclerosis (MS) starting on this device. This study
      will also evaluate as secondary endpoints various patient-reported outcomes over the
      short-term (1 month), including adherence, treatment satisfaction and convenience, and the
      long-term (12 and 24 months), including adherence, persistence, quality of life (QOL),
      treatment satisfaction and convenience. It will also assess health resource utilization by MS
      participants starting on AVONEX PEN autoinjector, as well as overall safety/tolerability, and
      will correlate all secondary outcomes with the primary (i.e., work capacity).

      <textblock>
        Enrollment will consist of approximately 500 participants who have been prescribed AVONEX
        PEN in accord with its labeling (Product Monograph). This will include participants who are
        na√Øve to disease modifying therapies (DMTs) as well as those who are being switched from
        another injectable DMT.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Key Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Must be prescribed AVONEX PEN as per local labeling (Product Monograph) and enrolled
             in MS Alliance (MSA) program

          -  If being switched from another DMT, must be on this DMT for at least 6 months

          -  Last DMT the subject is switched from must be injectable

          -  Must be able to physically demonstrate use of the AVONEX PEN autoinjector device and
             be able to self-administer the injections

          -  Must give written informed consent. If required by local law, candidates must also
             authorize the release and use of protected health information (PHI)

          -  Must be able to understand and comply with the protocol

        Key Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Female subjects considering becoming pregnant while in the study or who are currently
             pregnant or breast-feeding

          -  Current enrollment in any investigational study involving drug, biologic or non-drug
             therapy

          -  Participation in other clinical studies within the past 6 months

          -  Treatment with immunosuppressive regimens (e.g. cyclophosphamide, azathioprine,
             methotrexate or mitoxantrone) or with intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) in the last 6
             months

          -  The most recent DMT the subject is switched from is non-injectable (i.e., oral)

          -  Other unspecified reasons that, in the opinion of the Investigator or Sponsor, make
             the subject unsuitable for enrollment
