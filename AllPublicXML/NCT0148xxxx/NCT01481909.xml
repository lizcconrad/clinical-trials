      Study title:

      An exploratory, randomised, double-blind, placebo controlled crossover study to assess the
      efficacy of 20 mg Rupatadine on the treatment of mastocytosis symptoms.

      Study code:

      SMART-2010-1 Principal Investigator, Co-Investigator, sponsor, and study centre (acc. to § 40
      Abs. 4 AMG) Dr. med. F. Siebenhaar, Prof. Dr. Med. M. Maurer, Allergie-Centrum-Charité,
      Department of Dermatology and Allergy, Charité - Universitätsmedizin Berlin, Charitéplatz 1,
      D-10117 Berlin Biometry and biostatistical analyses Division of Biostatistics and Clinical
      Epidemiology, Charité - Universitätsmedizin Berlin, Charitéplatz 1, D-10117 Berlin Monitoring
      Coordination Centre for Clinical Studies (KKS), Charité - Universitätsmedizin Berlin,
      Charitéplatz 1, D-10117 Berlin Clinical phase Phase II

      Primary objective:

      Reduction of wheal and flare type skin reaction after standardised provocation testing
      assessed by volumetric and thermographic measurements.

      Secondary objectives:

      Improvement of additional related symptoms (e.g. pruritus) and subjective affliction as
      assessed by symptom score, DLQI, Itchy-QoL and VAS.

      Study design:

      An exploratory, randomised, double-blind, placebo controlled crossover study

      Type and number of patients:

      Male and female patients (n = 30) with cutaneous mastocytosis and indolent systemic
      mastocytosis with skin involvement

      Main criteria for inclusion:

      Mastocytosis patients aged 18-65 years, signed written consent, no systemic corticosteroid or
      other immunosuppressive therapy, no permanent severe diseases Test product, dose and mode of
      administration 20 mg Rupatadine or placebo before provocation testing, oral administration
      (tablets)

      Duration of treatment:

      28 days (testing will be done at the day of last treatment)

      Assessment of efficacy:

        1. Assessment of wheal and flare development by planimetric analyses of digital
           photographic, volumetric, and thermographic imaging (time lapse) before and after
           treatment with study medication,

        2. Additional assessment of symptoms,

        3. Assessment of life quality

      Main criteria of evaluation:

      Efficacy

    <description>All patients included in this study will be subjected at the screening visit to a standardized provocation of Darier's sign by a device for standardized provocation testing (Hartmann and Siebenhaar 2009). Patients that exhibit positive skin test reactions will be enrolled, provided that they meet all inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria and that they give informed consent. Study patients will receive treatment for 28 days (minimal 25, maximal 30 days) before visit 1 and visit 2 including the same day before the provocation test (RUP 20mg/day or placebo according to randomization). All patients will receive antihistaminic rescue medication immediately after completing the testing when necessary.</description>
