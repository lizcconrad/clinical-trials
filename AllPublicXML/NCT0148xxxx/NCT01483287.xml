  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      IBS (irritable bowel syndrome) is a functional gastrointestinal disorder which is
      characterized by recurrent pain and/or discomfort, altered stool form, and abdominal
      distension. It has been established that food items such as beans, peas, lentils, peppers,
      and onions can increase gas production. What these have in common is that they all contain
      large amounts of complex carbohydrates. The enzymes in the small intestine are not able to
      fully digest these large molecules, which in turn are fermented by the colonic microflora.
      This fermentation is conducted through the production of short chain fatty acids and gases
      such as hydrogen and methane. Alpha-Galactosidase is an enzyme that has the ability to break
      down these indigestible carbohydrates to galactose and sucrose in the small intestine and to
      facilitate the absorption and minimize the gas production from bacteria in the colon.

      The aim of this study is to assess if the gastrointestinal symptoms, above all problems from
      gas and distension, is alleviated when the enzyme α-Galactosidase (present in Nogasin
      capsules) is ingested with food.

    <description>The study is conducted during a total of two days at two different occasions. Visit 1: The patients will be served breakfast and lunch at the gastro unit and dinner will be enclosed when the patient leave for home. At each meal (breakfast, lunch, and dinner) the participants will ingest three capsules with a total content of 1200 GaIU alpha-galactosidase-randomized to be either the enzyme (α-Galactosidase) or a non-active substance (placebo). Visit 2: The procedure from visit 1 will recur after at least two weeks has passed - except that the content of the capsules will be opposite from the first visit.
No other food or beverage are ingested from 1800 hours the evening before the intervention day until breakfast the day after intervention (no exact time).</description>
