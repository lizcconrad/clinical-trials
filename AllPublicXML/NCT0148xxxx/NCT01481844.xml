      The aim of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of sequential therapy, i.e. 5 days of PPI +
      amoxicillin followed by 5 days of PPI + two antimicrobial drugs( clarithromycin and
      tinidazole ) versus quadruple drug regimen( i.e.-14 days of PPI+ bismuth + metronidazole +
      tetracycline ) as second line treatment of H. pylori .

      a total of 101 patients were randomized to 2 groups : 50 in sequential group and 51 patients
      in quadruple group . mean age was 43 in both groups. In sequential therapy group 42
      patients(84%) completed the treatment , 39 patients returned to follow up . In quadruple
      group only 33 patients (64.7%) completed the treatment , 29 of them returned to follow up.

      Compliance to the treatment was significant better in sequential group comparative to
      quadruple .Sides effects connected to gastro-intestinal tract were reported in 27(65.9%) of
      quadruple group patients and in 19(43.2%)of sequential group.

      The H pylori was eradicated in 23 of 39 patients in sequential group(59%), and in 19 of the
      29 patients in quadruple group(65.5%). no comorbidities like smoking, diabetes or other
      influenced the efficacy of eradication.

      Sequential therapy showed the same eradication rate as second line treatment of H pylori as
      quadruple one, but was associated with better compliance and less adverse effects.

      Both treatments protocols failed to show an appropriate eradication rate in population of
      Southern Israel .

    <description>H pylori eradication is defined as a negative C-urea breath test 4-16 weeks after completion of tratment.]. (C-urea breath test- Patients are fasted for 4 h before testing. No test meal will be given, and a pre-dose breath sample is obtained. 75 mg of 13C-urea powder dissolved in 50 mL of water is then administered orally, and a second breath sample is collected 30 minutes later. Collected samples are analyzed using an isotope ratio mass spectrometer).</description>
