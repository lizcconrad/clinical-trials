  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Autologous stem cell transplant (ASCT) is an important therapy for patients with multiple
      myeloma, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, and Hodgkin's lymphoma. It has been shown to improve
      progression free survival and overall survival. However, it is a challenging treatment
      process both physically and psychologically. It is a procedure with many side effects that
      can be uncomfortable, painful, and at times, difficult to endure. Complementary therapies,
      such as music therapy, have potential to be an important adjunct in palliation of symptoms in
      patients undergoing chemotherapy.

    <textblock>
      Patients randomized to receive music therapy will receive 2 sessions of live music therapy,
      at least 48 hours apart, from a Music Therapist-Board Certified (MT-BC, certified through the
      Certification Board for Music Therapists) in their room. This will occur between days -1 and
      +5, with the first music therapy session being as close to day +1 as possible and the second
      session being at least 48 hours later (but no more than 96 hours later).

      Those patients randomized to standard therapy (no music therapy) are allowed to listen to
      music; however they will not receive interactive music therapy from a certified therapist.
      Following day +7, music therapy will be offered to all patients who are interested in
      participating.

      No narcotic or anti-emetic therapy will be administered for at least 2 hours prior to music
      therapy sessions or to assessments. Patients will rate nausea and pain at the beginning and
      end of the first music therapy session on a validated visual analog scale.12-14 The scale
      will be 10cm with the least nausea or pain at point 0 and the greatest nausea or pain at
      point 10. Patients will be asked to rate their nausea and pain on day +5 and day +7.

    <measure>Monitoring of physiologic responsiveness</measure>
    <time_frame>7 days</time_frame>
    <description>Compare non-invasive monitoring of physiologic responsiveness to provide an index of autonomic nervous system function, or general arousal. We hypothesize that arousal will decrease after music therapy, and will be indicated by a decrease in skin conductance, an increase in finger temperature, and an increase in heart rate variability. Measurements in the control group will provide a background level of how much physiologic arousal changes with time, independent of music therapy.</description>
