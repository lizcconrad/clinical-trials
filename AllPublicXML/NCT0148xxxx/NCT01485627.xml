      The purpose of this study is to (a) determine whether a combined intervention for patients,
      caregivers and physicians improves communication regarding treatment choices and prognosis in
      cancer, (b) to determine whether the intervention improves patient and caregiver well-being,
      quality of life and sense of peace, and (c) to determine whether the intervention affects
      health services utilization.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Aim 1a Improved patient-physician-caregiver communication</measure>
    <time_frame>3 years</time_frame>
    <description>Improved patient-physician-caregiver communication about prognosis and treatment choices (higher frequency of key pre-specified communication behaviors, coded from audio-recorded patient-caregiver-oncologist office visits).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Aim 1 Prolonged grief symptoms (Caregiver Bereavement)</measure>
    <time_frame>4 years</time_frame>
    <description>Examine whether a health care communication intervention for oncologists, patients, and caregivers leads to better mental health outcomes in caregivers following patient death. Hypothesis: Compared with control, intervention group caregivers will have lower levels of prolonged grief symptoms on the PG-13 (Primary outcome), depression, anxiety, and thoughts of death 7 months after the patient's death.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Aim 1b&amp;c Improved Patient-perceived communication</measure>
    <time_frame>3 years</time_frame>
    <description>Improved patient-perceived patient-physician-caregiver communication about prognosis and treatment choices, greater shared understanding (survey measures).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Aim 2 Patient and Caregiver well-being</measure>
    <time_frame>3 years</time_frame>
    <description>Greater patient and caregiver well-being, including quality of life and sense of peace (survey measures).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Aim 2 Caregiver Physical Health Outcomes</measure>
    <time_frame>3 years</time_frame>
    <description>Determine whether the intervention leads to better physical health outcomes in caregivers during bereavement following patient's death. Hypothesis: Intervention group caregivers will have better physical health summary scores on the SF-12 and lower levels of self-reported disability 7 months after the patient's death.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Aim 3 Health care utilization</measure>
    <time_frame>3 years</time_frame>
    <description>Changes in health care utilization. Fewer aggressive interventions in the last week of life and more palliative care and hospice consultations following the intervention (chart audit).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Aim 3 Other caregiver outcomes</measure>
    <time_frame>2 years</time_frame>
    <description>Examine whether caregiver outcomes are mediated by patient-reported quality of life and patient health care utilization (quantitative). Explore caregiver perspectives on decision-making and communication processes to link bereavement outcomes with VOICE study communication outcomes (qualitative).</description>
