    <textblock>
      This is a safety and tolerability study investigating the effect of HPP854 in subjects with
      mild cognitive impairment or a diagnosis of mild Alzheimer's disease. The study will assess
      the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic relationships of HPP854 in plasma, pharmacodynamic
      relationship in cerebral spinal fluid and plasma concentration profiles for Amyloid-Beta.
