  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study, the body temperatures of men and women undergoing elective surgery will be
      measured using the Temple Touch Pro. In the operating room, each patient's temperature will
      be measured with both the Temple Touch Pro and another one or two of the continuous reference
      methods used clinically for measuring the core temperature.

      The Medisim Temple Touch Pro thermometer combines a noninvasive, biocompatible patch and a
      receiving unit. The former is attached to the skin, while the latter is placed near the
      patient or the vital signs monitor and receives data from the patch. The core temperature
      equivalent is displayed. The Medisim Temple Touch Pro is based on the measurements made by
      conductive sensors that perform skin temperature measurements and then applies a special
      algorithm in order to calculate the body's temperature.
