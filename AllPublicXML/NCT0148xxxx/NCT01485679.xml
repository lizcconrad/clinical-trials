  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to evaluate whether the TEP-CT can be sensitive and specific in
      identifying degenerated intraductal papillary mucinous tumor of the pancreas.The results will
      be compared to those obtained by the pathological analysis of the removed piece of pancreas.

    <textblock>
      Before surgery is undertaken, a 18 fluoro-deoxy-glucose positrons emission tomography
      combined with computed tomography (18-FDG TEP-CT ) will be performed. The primary outcome of
      this study is to compare results of the TEP-CT with those obtained by the pathological
      analysis of the removed piece of pancreas.

    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>TEP-CT of the different 5 parts of the pancreas (head, uncus, isthmi, body and tail) will be interpreted by nuclearity Doctors. TEP-CT will be considered positive if there is a pathological fixation of the 18-FDG , defined as any focal or diffuse fixation of 18-FDG above the background level of fixation in the pancreas.
The anatomopathological analysis of the piece of pancreas removed during the ablative surgery will be considered as positive if the degree of dysplasia seen for each part of the pancreas is &quot;infiltrating carcinoma&quot;.
Results will then be compared in term of specificity.</description>
