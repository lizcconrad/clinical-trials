  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of a novel therapy for treatment of
      migraine, pain reduction and relief of associated symptoms during ongoing migraine attacks,
      and presence of a preventive effect two months post treatment. Another purpose is to
      investigate if and how this treatment affects manifestations of the autonomic nervous system
      activity.
