      The objective of this post market clinical investigation is to evaluate the clinical
      effectiveness of a minimally invasive vertebral augmentation procedure,
      Radiofrequency-Targeted Vertebral Augmentation (RF-TVA) as compared to non-operative
      management (NOM) for the treatment of appropriately diagnosed acute (≤ 8 weeks) painful
      osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures (VCF).

      This is a multi-center, prospective, randomized, post marketing clinical trial designed to
      evaluate the clinical effectiveness of a minimally invasive procedure,
      Radiofrequency-Targeted Vertebral Augmentation (RF-TVA), compared to Non Operative Management
      (NOM) for the treatment of appropriately diagnosed, acute (≤ 8 weeks), painful, osteoporotic
      vertebral compression fractures. Eligible subjects will be randomly allocated to receive
      either RF-TVA or NOM in a 1:1 randomization ratio. Subjects will be followed for 12 months
      post procedure. Primary effectiveness will be determined by comparing the Visual Analogue
      Scale for each treatment group for back pain from the baseline to the 1-month post procedure
      visit and between treatment groups at 1-month.

      Up to 15 sites will participate in this trial.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Subject is ≥ 21 and ≤ 90 years of age.

          2. Subject has one (1) to three (3) painful vertebral compression fracture(s) at T5-L5
             due to primary or secondary osteoporosis (i.e. non-malignant) and recent history of
             sudden onset of pain in area of index vertebra (e).

          3. Subject's index vertebra (e) is confirmed as the active source of back pain as
             evidenced by concordant pain and bone marrow edema via magnetic resonance imaging
             (MRI) or Computerized Tomography (CT) plus bone scan.

          4. Subject has a history of vertebral fracture-related back pain ≤ 8 weeks old at time of
             enrollment (confirmed by medical history).

          5. Subject has a pain related VAS score ≥ 5 on a scale of 0 to 10 at time of enrollment.
             Pain represents the worst level of back pain while standing, walking or elevating from
             chair, bed, or car during the preceding 24 hours associated with the index vertebra
             (e).

          6. Subject has a Roland Morris Disability Questionnaire (RDQ) score ≥ 10 on scale of 0 to
             24 at time of enrollment.

          7. Subject is a suitable candidate for minimally invasive VCF procedure.

          8. Subject has sufficient mental and physical capacity to comply with the Investigational
             Plan requirements and is willing and able to provide informed consent; agrees to
             release medical information for the purposes of this study; and agrees to comply with
             the Investigational Plan requirements and return for specified follow-up evaluations.

          9. Subject is a male; a documented infertile female (either postmenopausal or surgical
             contraception); or is a non-pregnant, non-lactating female of childbearing potential
             who agrees to use a medically accepted method of birth control throughout the duration
             of the trial.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Subject's VCF morphology is deemed unsuitable for RF-TVA in the judgment of the
             Investigator.

          2. Subject requires additional non-kyphoplasty or vertebroplasty surgical treatment for
             the index fracture.

          3. Subject has surgery to the spine planned for at least one (1) month following
             enrollment.

          4. Subject has high-energy trauma-related and/or, non-osteoporotic vertebral fractures.

          5. Subject has a spinal cord compression or significant canal compromise requiring
             decompression, in the judgment of the investigator.

          6. Subject has a neurologic deficit associated with the vertebral level(s) to be treated
             that is more severe than radiculopathy (e.g. myelopathy, cauda equina syndrome).

          7. Subject has irreversible coagulopathy or bleeding disorder.

          8. Subject requires, at time of enrollment, the use of high-dose steroids (e.g. ≥ 100 mg
             prednisone or 20 mg dexamethasone per day), intravenous (IV) pain medication, or nerve
             block to control chronic back pain unrelated to index VCF(s).

          9. Subject has significant clinical co-morbidities that may potentially interfere with
             the collection of data concerning pain and function.

         10. Subject has a known allergy to device materials (e.g. polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) or
             barium).

         11. Subject has a contraindication to local or general anesthesia.

         12. Subject has a medical and/or surgical condition contrary to the kyphoplasty or
             vertebroplasty procedure (e.g. presence of local or systemic infection).

         13. Subject is receiving Worker's Compensation.

         14. Subject is a prisoner.
