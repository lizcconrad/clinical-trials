    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the use of chemotherapy, radiation therapy and
      bevacizumab before surgery in patients with locally advanced rectal cancer (LARC).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      To determine the pathological complete response (pCR-TRG1) rate in patients treated with 2
      different schedule of bevacizumab plus primary chemotherapy and radiotherapy of the pelvic
      region when optimal surgery is applied.

      Bevacizumab will be given by intravenous infusion at the dose of 5 mg/kg concurrent with
      chemotherapy and radiotherapy every 2 weeks for 4 cycles from -14 days to start
      chemo-radiotherapy (classical schedule) or 4 days before the concurrent administration of
      chemotherapy and radiation therapy for 2 cycles if the number of TRG1 was not reached in the
      first stage with the classical schedule Simon's methods will be used to calculate sample
      size.Setting a and b errors as 0.05 and 0.20, respectively, and defining as minimum activity
      of interest (p0) a TRG1 rate=30%. In order to demonstrate a TRG1 rate ≥50% (p1), at least 6
      TRG1 on the first 15 patients, and at least 19 TRG1 on a total of 46 patients should be
      reported in the first and second stage, respectively.
