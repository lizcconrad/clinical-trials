  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the agreement of clinical performance between the
      proposed NeoPlex 4 assay and NeoPlex System and the comparator devices in clinical use in
      newborn screening programs for detection of T4, TSH, 17-OHP and IRT.

      The proposed (investigational) NeoPlex4 assay measures levels of thyroxine (T4), thyrotropin
      (hTSH), 17-alpha-OH-progesterone (17-OHP) and immunoreactive trypsinogen (IRT) from dried
      blood specimens (DBS) collected from neonates to screen for congenital hypothyroidism (CH),
      congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) and cystic fibrosis (CF). The Clinical Evaluation of the
      xMAP® NeoPlex4™ Assay (NeoPlex4) for Detection of T4, TSH, 17-OHP and IRT using the NeoPlex
      System is a multi-center method concordance study on a combination of prospectively collected
      neonatal dried blood spots and pre-selected archived frozen dried blood spots that have been
      demonstrated to be positive for 17-OHP (CAH), IRT (CF), and T4 or TSH (CH). The study will be
      conducted at selected sites that routinely perform newborn screening testing in the United
      States.

        Specimens will be derived from prospectively collected neonatal specimens and banked
        neonatal specimens originating from hospitals, birthing centers, and/or clinics. Newborn
        screening is currently performed on all neonates; there is no selection criterion for
        subjects.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  The dried blood spot specimen was collected on an FDA-cleared collection paper that
             has not yet passed its expiration dating.

          -  Prospective specimens used in this study should only be those collected for the first
             time from a subject, or initial collection specimens.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Collected within 24 hours of birth.

          -  Specimens stored at ambient temperature for greater than 14 days prior to testing.

          -  The specimen DBS appears diluted.

          -  The specimen DBS shows evidence of clotting, caking, layering or serum rings.

          -  The DBS punched disks were punched too close to the edge of the blood spot or show
             printed markings.

          -  The specimen or collection card was contaminated with fecal material.

          -  Non-eluting blood spot due to deterioration of sample caused by exposure to heat and
             humidity.
