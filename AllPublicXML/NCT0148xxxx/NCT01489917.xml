      The Provisional Heparin TherApy on Radial Artery Occlusion after transradial coronary
      angiography and patent Hemostasis (PHARAOH) study compares the strategy of standard a-priori
      heparin use in patients undergoing transradial coronary angiography to a strategy of
      provisional heparin administration only if patent hemostasis is not achievable.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Transradial access use for coronary angiography and intervention is increasing. Its efficacy
      in lowering access site complications, as well as increased patient comfort, has been proven
      unequivocally. One of the complications of transradial access is radial artery occlusion
      (RAO) that occurs with a variable incidence. It is population specific, with a higher
      prevalence in subsets, such as women, and patient's with small radial arteries. RAO is also
      known to be higher at hospital discharge and radial recanalization may spontaneously occur at
      later times. It is usually asymptomatic. Its main adverse impact is by limiting future
      transradial access from that radial artery. Since most of the patient's with atherosclerotic
      vascular disease may undergo several invasive procedures during their lifetime, prevention of
      RAO is of paramount importance.

      Heparinization, during the procedure, has been shown to be of benefit in lowering the
      incidence of RAO. Maintaining patency of the radial artery during hemostasis, has also been
      shown to be effective in prevention of RAO following transradial access. As maintenance of
      flow has potent antithrombotic effect, it is unclear whether systemic anticoagulation is
      still required in all cases.

      In some cases, it would be preferable to avoid heparin administration prior to coronary
      angiography. It is currently unknown whether it would be safe to refrain from heparin
      administration in case of transradial catheterization and patent hemostasis technique.

    <description>TR band (Terumo medical) applied. The TR band is then deflated gradually till pulsatile bleeding is observed under the transparent plastic inflatable chamber and then 1-2 cc of air is placed back in the TR band chamber to stop bleeding. The band is left in place for 2 hours and not adjusted further unless patient complained of symptoms or bleeding occurred.</description>

    <description>TR-band is placed and positioned similarly to the other study arm. However, in theses cases, patency is evaluated at the time of application of the TR-band, and monitored every 15 minutes afterwards till the band is removed and hemostasis completed. After TR-band placement, if maintenance of radial artery patency is obtained, no heparin is administered and TR band is left in place for 1-hour. If radial artery patency is not maintained, a bolus of heparin 50 U/kg or a maximum of 5000 units is administered and the band is left in place for 2 hours.</description>
