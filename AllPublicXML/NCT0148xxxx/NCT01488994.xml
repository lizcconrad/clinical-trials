      The secondary outcome measure: Area Under the Plasma Concentration Versus Time Curve From 0
      to 72 Hours (h) Post-infusion analysis was not done due to the different time-points for the
      last PK blood sample, AUC0-72 h was redundant and only total AUC was included in the PK
      analysis.

    <measure>Health-related Quality of Life (HRQoL): PedsQL™ Change From Baseline in Total Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>For this study, the PedsQL™ questionnaires for participants 2 to 7 years of age (parent-proxy versions for age groups 2-4 years and 5-7 years) and PedsQL™ Child version for participants 8 to 12 years of age were used.
The Peds-QL is a generic Health-Related Quality of Life (HR QoL) instrument designed specifically for a pediatric population. It captures the following domains: general health/activities, feelings/emotional, social functioning, school functioning. A 5-point score is used for each domain: from 0 (never) to 4 (almost always). Items are reversed scored and linearly transformed to a 0-100 scale as follows: 0=100, 1=75, 2=50, 3=25, 4=0 so that higher scores indicate better quality of life (QoL). The total score is the mean (average) of all scores from the 4 domains.
The change from baseline in total score is reported- a positive score indicates a better QoL compared to baseline and a negative score indicates a poorer QoL compared to baseline.</description>

    <measure>Health-related Quality of Life (HRQoL): Haemo-QoL, Change From Baseline in Total Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Haemo-QoL is a quality of life (QoL) assessment instrument for children and adolescents with haemophilia. As a hemophilia-specific instrument, this measure assesses very specific aspects of dealing with hemophilia. For the Haemo-QoL, higher scores indicate a worse quality of life. Scores on a scale range between 0 and 100.</description>

All participants received the same dosing schedule of study product during the study. After a washout period of 5-7 days, participants received an initial infusion of study product at a dose of 75±5 IU/kg for the PK assessment. For the prophylactic regimen, participants were treated with the recommended dose of 50 IU/kg of study product twice weekly ranging from 40-80 IU/kg for 26±1 weeks or for at least 50 EDs to study product, whichever occurred last.</description>

All participants received the same dosing schedule of study product during the study. After a washout period of 5-7 days, participants received an initial infusion of study product at a dose of 75±5 IU/kg for the PK assessment. For the prophylactic regimen, participants were treated with the recommended dose of 50 IU/kg of study product twice weekly ranging from 40-80 IU/kg for 26±1 weeks or for at least 50 EDs to study product, whichever occurred last.</description>

All participants received the same dosing schedule of study product during the study. After a washout period of 5-7 days, participants received an initial infusion of study product at a dose of 75±5 IU/kg for the PK assessment. For the prophylactic regimen, participants were treated with the recommended dose of 50 IU/kg of study product twice weekly ranging from 40-80 IU/kg for 26±1 weeks or for at least 50 EDs to study product, whichever occurred last.</description>

        <title>Health-related Quality of Life (HRQoL): PedsQL™ Change From Baseline in Total Score</title>
        <description>For this study, the PedsQL™ questionnaires for participants 2 to 7 years of age (parent-proxy versions for age groups 2-4 years and 5-7 years) and PedsQL™ Child version for participants 8 to 12 years of age were used.
The Peds-QL is a generic Health-Related Quality of Life (HR QoL) instrument designed specifically for a pediatric population. It captures the following domains: general health/activities, feelings/emotional, social functioning, school functioning. A 5-point score is used for each domain: from 0 (never) to 4 (almost always). Items are reversed scored and linearly transformed to a 0-100 scale as follows: 0=100, 1=75, 2=50, 3=25, 4=0 so that higher scores indicate better quality of life (QoL). The total score is the mean (average) of all scores from the 4 domains.
The change from baseline in total score is reported- a positive score indicates a better QoL compared to baseline and a negative score indicates a poorer QoL compared to baseline.</description>

            <description>Pediatric participants 6 to &lt; 12 years of age. All pediatric participants underwent pharmacokinetic (PK) assessment followed by prophylactic treatment with the study product. All participants received the same dosing schedule of study product during the study. After a washout period of 5-7 days, participants received an initial infusion of study product at a dose of 75±5 IU/kg for the PK assessment. For the prophylactic regimen, participants were treated with the recommended dose of 50 IU/kg of study product twice weekly ranging from 40-80 IU/kg for 26±1 weeks or for at least 50 EDs to study product, whichever occurred last.</description>
