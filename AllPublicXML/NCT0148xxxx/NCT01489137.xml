    <description>According to previous patient's response, the investigators will allocate the effect site concentration of remifentanil of next patient during head fixation. And, For this allocation of dose of remifentanil the investigators use biased coin design up-and-down method.
For the first patient, the dose of remifentanil would be fixed at 5.5ng/ml which we predict as EC90. And, step size of dose is 0.5ng/ml.</description>
