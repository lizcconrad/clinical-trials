  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chemoembolization of hepatocellular carcinoma lesions is an accepted and frequently used
      method for the palliative or curative treatment of these lesions. These attempts are being
      made to make these patients a better candidate for liver transplant or to provide palliation
      for their condition.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized prospective study with two arms, Drug-Eluting Beads with doxorubicin
      (DEB) and lipiodol ethanol mixture (LEM), with the goal to show non-inferiority of LEM, which
      if true will facilitate a simple alternative to DEBs. Patients will be randomized to one arm
      of the study and will remain in that arm if they need to have more embolization in the
      future. Both of the mentioned methods (DEB and LEM) fall within the standard of care.

    <description>Determined by European Association for the Study of the Liver (EASL) criteria a set of non-invasive criteria for HCC in cirrhotic patients. The diagnosis is established if two imaging modalities (US, CT, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)) show a coincidental nodule with arterial hypervascularization regardless of AFP levels, or if a single modality shows a lesion when the AFP levels are more than 400 ng/ml. Histologic diagnosis is required if the patient is non-cirrhotic or if the lesions are smaller than 2 cm.</description>
