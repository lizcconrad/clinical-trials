  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Recently a novel stimulation design was developed, called burst stimulation. In a non-placebo
      controlled pilot study burst stimulation seemed superior to tonic stimulation over a period
      extending more than 2 years, and even though an incidental finding, this design seemed
      capable of suppressing pain without mandatory induction of paresthesias. This permits for the
      first time to scientifically prove that spinal cord stimulation is better than placebo
      stimulation. A study was therefore initiated to find out whether spinal cord stimulation is
      indeed capable of suppressing neuropathic limb pain in a placebo controlled way.

      Patients receive three type of stimulation (burst, tonic and sham). We want to compare these
      different stimulation protocol to verify which one is the one the patient prefer the most and
      have the least side-effects (paresthesia)

        All patients were selected after multidisciplinary discussion with a specialized pain
        physician, a psychological and psychiatric evaluation was performed to rule out psychogenic
        pain as well as other psychiatric morbidity contraindicating an implant. After
        authorization by the psychologist and psychiatrist an implant was offered.

        Inclusion Criteria

          -  Patients enrolled in this study must meet the following inclusion criteria:

          -  Patient has Failed Back Surgery Syndrome;

          -  Patient has a simulator implanted at the dorsal column spinal cord powered by an
             EON/EON MiniÂ® internal pulse generator.

          -  Patient medication has remained stable for at least 4 weeks prior to baseline data
             collection;

          -  Patient agrees not to add or increase medication throughout the randomization trial
             period of the study;

          -  Patient is willing to cooperate with the study requirements including compliance with
             the treatment regimen and completion of all office visits.

        Exclusion Criteria

        A patient will be excluded from participation in this study if they meet any one of the
        following criteria:

             DSM-IV-TR criteria with psychotic characteristics;

          -  Patient has a history of life-threatening severe illness or is suffering from severe
             chronic disease other than the indication for the study;

          -  Patient has history of substance abuse or substance dependency in the past 6 months
             prior to baseline data collection;

          -  Patient currently participating in another clinical study;

          -  Patient with demand-type cardiac pacemakers, an infusion pump or any other implantable
             neurostimulator device except for the spinal cord stimulator under study;

          -  Patient is not willing to maintain current medication regimen;

          -  Female candidates of child bearing potential who are pregnant (confirmed by positive
             urine/blood pregnancy test), not using adequate contraception as determined by the
             investigator, or nursing (lactating) a child.
