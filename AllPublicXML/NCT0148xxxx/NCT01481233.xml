      The purpose of this study is to determine the prostate specific antigen response to
      continuous low dose oral colchicine.

      The investigators propose a simple phase II trial of oral colchicine at the standard
      prophylactic dose utilized for gout in men with CRPCa who have failed taxotere based
      chemotherapy. The investigators will utilize a simple modified Simon 2-stage design. The
      investigators plan to enroll 40 men for the study. The men should have completed prior
      taxotere based therapy or any other therapy post-taxotere including cabazitaxel one month
      prior to receipt of colchicine on trial. Staging with a baseline bone scan, CT and PSA as
      well as routine CBC, CMP and PAP. The dose of the drug can be escalated as tolerated to a
      maximum of 1.2 mg bid. The patient would be seen at 21 day intervals. After every 3 cycles of
      treatment, patient would be restaged with CT and bone scan. Patients with stable disease,
      partial response or complete response would continue therapy until either disease progression
      or intolerable toxicity after which the patient would be taken off study.
