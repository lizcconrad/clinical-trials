  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an observational prospective cohort study design to evaluate the safety of rapid
      Rituximab infusion at 90 minutes for Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma (NHL) patients. The secondary aim
      is to measure the number of rejected chemotherapy administration on schedule. Non-Hodgkin
      lymphoma patients who tolerated well for at least 2 cycles of standard infusion of Rituximab
      without grade 3 or 4 adverse events will be recruited in the study. In this study, the first
      20% of the total dose of rituximab will be administered over 30 minutes. When subjects
      tolerate the infusion and stable vital signs, the remaining 80% of the total dose will be
      administered over 60 minutes. Prior administration of Rituximab, premedication will be given
      to the subjects including PO Paracetamol 1g, IV Diphenhydramine 25/50mg and/or IV
      Hydrocortisone 100mg. The duration of subjects involvement in the study approximately takes
      72 hours. Adverse events that occur within the first 24 hours of infusion will be evaluated
      if related to Rituximab infusion as some subjects are receiving combination chemotherapy with
      rituximab. This study will recruit both in patients and out-patients. A phone call to monitor
      subject's health will be made post 24, 48, 72 hours of rituximab infusion. The findings from
      this study will add evidence to the safety of rapid Rituximab infusion at 90 minutes. If the
      outcome is favourable, NUH will consider adopting the new infusion rate for Rituximab
      infusion for patients who tolerated at least 2 cycles of standard infusion recommended by the
      drug manufacturer.

      The study hypothesizes that rapid Rituximab infusion at 90 minutes is safe for NHL patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The recommended guideline for Rituximab infusion for first cycle is to be commencing at an
      infusion rate of 50mg/hr for the first 30 minutes. If tolerated well, subsequent increments
      will step up to 50mg/hr every 30 minutes to a maximum dose of 400mg/hr. For second and
      subsequent infusions, the infusion rate commences at 100mg/hr with 30 minute increments of
      100mg/hr to a maximum dose of 400mg/hr. The first and subsequent infusion generally completes
      between 5-6 and 3-4 hours respectively.

      Lengthy infusions translate into higher costs and longer waiting times for patients due to
      scant resources. Therefore, there is growing interest globally in shortening the overall
      infusion times to either 90 or 60-minutes. A recent systematic review evaluating safety of
      rapid Rituximab infusion has confirmed that Rituximab at 90-minutes is safe for NHL patients.
      However 60-minute infusion was not recommended for neither NHL nor chronic lymphocytic
      leukemia (CLL) patients due to lack of evidence.

      Although the rapid Rituximab infusion at 90-minute has been tested among Singapore population
      in National Cancer Centre, it was not being evaluated among the cohort of patients who
      received treatment in National University Hospital Singapore. As rapid Rituximab infusion
      remain off label use, this research study intend to evaluate the safety of rapid Rituximab
      infusion at 90-minute among NHL patients.

      The selected doses will be 375mg/m2 as recommended and approved by FDA.
