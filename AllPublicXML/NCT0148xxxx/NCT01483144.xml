  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this randomized, double-blind, Phase III trial is to determine if the
      combination of eflornithine plus sulindac is superior to sulindac or eflornithine as single
      agents in delaying time to the first occurrence of any FAP-related event. This includes: 1)
      FAP related disease progression indicating the need for excisional intervention involving the
      colon, rectum, pouch, duodenum and/or 2) clinically important events which includes
      progression to more advanced duodenal polyposis, cancer or death.
