  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Treatment of late deformities following fractures of the orbitozygomaticomaxillary complex
      can be considered a formidable challenge, even to the skilled surgeon. However, the
      development of Computer-Assisted Navigation technology Offers new opportunities in the
      treatment of such deformities. With the help of navigation system,pre- and
      intraoperatively,the objective of any supporting medical device for reconstruction of the
      orbitozygomaticomaxillary complex would be visualization of the real and desired positions of
      the zygoma. In this randomized controlled trial, the investigators would like to evaluate the
      feasibility and accuracy of a new method for planning and realizing zygomatic osteotomies in
      cases of established post-traumatic deformities using computer assisted navigation.

      Treatment of late deformities following fractures of the orbitozygomaticomaxillary complex
      can be considered a formidable challenge. Even to the skilled surgeon, over-or
      underestimation of the displacement is likely to occur, leading to an unsatisfactory result
      caused by over- or undercorrection.However,The development of Computer-Assisted Navigation
      technology Offers new opportunities in the treatment of such deformities. With the help of
      navigation system,pre- and intraoperatively,the objective of any supporting medical device
      for reconstruction of the orbitozygomaticomaxillary complex would be visualization of the
      real and desired positions of the zygoma. In this randomized controlled trial, we would like
      to evaluate the feasibility and accuracy of a new method for planning and realizing zygomatic
      osteotomies in cases of established post-traumatic deformities using computer assisted
      navigation.
