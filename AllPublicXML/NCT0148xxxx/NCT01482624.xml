  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this clinical investigation is to determine whether
      post-arthroscopic treatment with 10 ml of 0.5% sodium hyaluronate (VISCOSEALÂ® SYRINGE) can
      relief pain, improve mobility and promote joint recovery, compared to the standard
      arthroscopy procedure alone, in patients undergoing arthroscopic procedure.

             the study.

          -  Concomitant disease of sufficient severity at study relevant joint (e.g. known or
             suspected infection, peripheral neuropathy or presence of hemarthros).

             period and the first 4 weeks of follow-up period.

          -  Subjects having a high probability of non-compliance to the study procedures according
             to investigator's judgement (like illiteracy, insufficient knowledge of local
