  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this clinical investigation is to determine whether
      post-arthroscopic treatment with 10 ml of 0.5% sodium hyaluronate (VISCOSEAL® SYRINGE) can
      relief pain, improve mobility and promote joint recovery, compared to the standard
      arthroscopy procedure alone, in patients undergoing arthroscopic procedure.

             months prior to study inclusion.

          -  Knee joint arthroscopy in study relevant joint within 6 months prior to study

          -  Concomitant disease of sufficient severity (e.g. uncontrolled diabetes mellitus,
             carcinoma, etc.), which in the opinion of the investigator, may put the patient at

             the study.

          -  Concomitant disease of sufficient severity at study relevant joint (e.g. known or
             suspected infection, peripheral neuropathy or presence of hemarthros).

             double barrier method, tubal ligation, vasectomised partner,…) during the treatment
             period and the first 4 weeks of follow-up period.

          -  Subjects having a high probability of non-compliance to the study procedures according
             to investigator's judgement (like illiteracy, insufficient knowledge of local
             language).
