      The objective of the study was to compare in real life clinical practice two treatment
      regimens: inhaled glucocorticosteroid + salmeterol and inhaled glucocorticosteroid +
      montelukast.

      48 month pre/post retrospective repeated measures design was used to compare the level of
      asthma control among patients continuously treated at the Outpatient Asthma and Allergy
      Treatment Center, Chair of Clinical Immunology and Microbiology, Medical University of Lodz,

    <description>A composite measure based on GINA 2006 guidelines and Asthma Control Questionnaire© (ACQ) by Juniper et al. Each of the five parameter was assessed on a three-level scale 2 - 1 - 0 and summed up to provide the final score between 0 (uncontrolled asthma) and 10 (controlled asthma). These parameters were:
Nocturnal dyspnea (none, 1, 1+);Daytime dyspena (none, 1, 1+);Wheeze (none, 1, 1+);short-acting β2-agonist utilization (0, less or half a container a year, more than half a container a year);FEV1 (&gt;90%,&gt;80%,&lt;80%)</description>
