  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There are growing evidences that gait speed is inversely associated with all causes mortality
      especially cardiovascular mortality among the elderly. The purpose of this study is to
      evaluate the predictive value of gait speed for cardiovascular events in patients after
      ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators will enroll patients capable of walking with STEMI. All patients will
      receive successful reperfusion therapy within 12-hour from onset. Gait speed during cardiac
      rehabilitation is measured. Cardiovascular events were defined as a composite of
      cardiovascular death, non-fatal myocardial infarction and non-fatal stroke, for an average
      follow-up period.
