  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This trial is conducted in Asia. The aim of this trial is to compare efficacy and safety of
      insulin detemir plus insulin aspart and NPH insulin plus human soluble insulin both in a
      basal bolus regimen with or without metformin in Chinese patients with type 2 diabetes.

      The trial adopts a group sequential design, where the analysis of the primary efficacy
      endpoint will be performed at the interim analysis, in addition to the final formal analysis.
      The decision to continue or stop the trial will be based on the result of the interim
      analysis.

    <time_frame>Week 2</time_frame>
    <description>FPG target was &lt; 6.0 mmol / L. Nocturnal hypoglycaemia was defined as a hypoglycaemic episode happened between 00:01 and 05:59 a.m. (both included).</description>

    <measure>Incidence of Hypoglycaemic Episodes</measure>
    <time_frame>Weeks 0-2</time_frame>
    <description>All events summarized were treatment emergent hypoglycaemic events. Hypoglycaemic episodes were summarized based on the ADA classification and also according to an additional definition.
Severe hypoglycemia: ADA definition. Minor hypoglycaemic episode: an episode with symptoms with confirmation by plasma glucose (PG) &lt; 3.1 mmol/l (56 mg/dl) and was handled by the subject himself/herself, or any asymptomatic PG value &lt; 3.1 mmol/l (56 mg/dl).
A hypoglycaemia episode was defined as nocturnal if the time of onset was between 00:01 and 05:59 a.m. (both included), otherwise it was diurnal.</description>
