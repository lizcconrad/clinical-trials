  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      AGS-003-005 is a rollover, open label, Phase II clinical study testing the biologic activity
      and safety of AGS-003 in subjects who have experienced either partial responses or prolonged
      stable disease and continue to benefit from ongoing treatment with AGS-003 in protocols
      AGS-003-004 or AGS-003-006.

      Rollover subjects from AGS-003-004 will continue with AGS-003 monotherapy booster dosing
      until disease progression or until a discontinuation criterion is reached.

      Subjects that progress on AGS-003 monotherapy (from the AGS-003-004 protocol) may start
      sunitinib treatment and re-initiate AGS-003 therapy beginning with the induction phase dosing
      schedule.

      Rollover subjects from AGS-003-006 will continue sunitinib dosing in combination with booster
      dosing of AGS-003 until disease progression or until a discontinuation criterion is reached.

      If a subject has disease progression due to a new tumor lesion, upon consultation between the
      investigator, Argos representatives and the Argos medical monitor, the subject may be
      considered for re-manufacture of study product (from the new metastatic lesion) and dosing
      with this new product in combination with sunitinib beginning with the induction phase dosing
      schedule.

      For those subjects initiating treatment with the induction phase as described above,
      restaging imaging occurs at screening (baseline), prior to the fifth dose in the induction
      phase (as applicable) and every 12 weeks during the booster phase (at the start of the
      sunitinib holiday, 2 weeks prior to the next AGS-003 dose).

      For subjects on combination therapy, if dosing with sunitinib is stopped due to
      sunitinib-related issues, treatment with AGS-003 may continue.

      Close-out visits will occur upon disease progression (other than circumstances discussed
      above which are eligible for re-induction) or upon decision to terminate the study by the
      sponsor.

      Quarterly follow-up for survival for each subject will occur by telephone interview for 1
      year following the last AGS-003 administration or study termination.
