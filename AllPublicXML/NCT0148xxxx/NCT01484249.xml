  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study was designed as a First In Man (FIM) trial to evaluate the feasibility and
      technical capability of the Claret CE Pro System in delivering two embolic filters to the
      brachiocephalic artery and the left common carotid artery during a Transcatheter aortic valve
      implantation (TAVI) procedure in order to protect the neurovasculature from debris liberated
      during the procedure.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) is a recently developed procedure whereby a
      prosthetic aortic valve is implanted percutaneously, and the procedure has demonstrated
      promising results in high risk surgical populations.

      TAVI currently requires the use of large bore (18-26F) catheter delivery systems that are
      often difficult to deliver to over the aortic arch to the aortic annulus. Available data
      indicate that TAVI is associated with a 4-12% procedural stroke rate and approximately 10%
      procedural mortality. It has been suggested that these strokes are most likely caused by the
      liberation of embolic debris either when the TAVI delivery catheter is advanced over the
      aortic arch or during the actual valve deployment. Given this situation, the availability of
      devices able to protect both hemispheres of the brain from potentially embolic debris during
      the TAVI procedure is an emerging clinical need.

      Claret Medical has developed a technology to provide protection to the neurovascular system
      during TAVI and other valve repair procedures.

    <description>Technical success defined as, successful delivery &amp; retrieval of the proximal &amp; distal filters.
The following Operator feedback was collected &amp; used to evaluate the primary endpoint.
Operators are asked to record, the indwelling time for the CE Pro System was used. Calculated as duration from the CE Pro System Insertion Start Time to Final Retrieval Stop Time.
Operators are asked to rate the CE Pro Systems performance based on a scale of 1 to 5, with 5 being the highest rating.</description>

    <description>The CE Pro System consists of a delivery catheter with an integrated proximal filter intended to be deployed in the brachiocephalic artery. In addition, the device has an articulating distal tip and a through lumen to allow a commercial intravascular filter to be back-loaded into the CE Pro System and be deployed into and retrieved from the left carotid artery.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject must be scheduled to undergo an endovascular aortic valve prosthesis implant
             procedure with the femoral artery as the intended access site for the valve delivery
             system.

          -  Female subjects of child bearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test within
             48 hours prior to the study procedure.

          -  Subject's left carotid artery and innominate artery diameters must be compatible with
             the Claret CE Pro System sizes available for the procedure (refer to package labeling
             for appropriate sizing information).

          -  Subject must have been informed of the nature of the study, agree to its provisions,
             and provide written informed consent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject requires an emergent procedure.

          -  Subject has carotid artery stenosis &gt;70% in either carotid artery.

          -  Subject innominate or left carotid artery reveals significant stenosis, ectasia,
             dissection or aneurysm at the ostium or within 3 cm of the ostium.
