      The purpose of this study is to determine if a healthy lifestyle intervention can
      significantly improve blood sugar control in type 2 diabetics over a course of 3 months.

      Peer reviewed research studies have proven the benefits of lifestyle interventions including
      the reversal of coronary artery disease and of diabetes. Experts agree that such a lifestyle
      must include a diet rich in whole, grown foods while low in saturated fat and cholesterol;
      regular physical activity; and healthy ways to cope with stress.

      There are several challenges with implementing such lifestyle interventions such as educating
      the general public and health care providers to the components of this lifestyle and in
      getting people to adopt these healthy lifestyle changes.

      While retreat-style, intensive lifestyle programs have shown that these obstacles can be
      overcome, they require monetary and time investments generally not feasible for the general
      public.

      A community-based, lifestyle program such as 'The Coronary Health Improvement Project'
      program offers similar potential benefits at a more reasonable cost. It does so through an
      intensive education (32 hours total) taught over 4 weeks, followed by an 8-week consolidation
      period which include live or DVD based group sessions, discussions led by a program
      facilitator, and medical monitoring.

      Kaiser Permanente, the leading Health maintenance organization in the nation, places special
      focus and significant resources into preventive medicine and health promotion, providing
      services to thousands of plan members but none with the level of intensity of 'The Coronary
      Health Improvement Project'.

      This study aims to determine if 'The Coronary Health Improvement Project' program can
      significantly improve blood sugar control in kaiser plan members with uncontrolled diabetes.

    <description>Baseline HbA1C will be measured within two weeks of the start of the intervention. Follow-up HbA1C will be measured at 12 weeks after the start of the intervention, as HbA1C is a measure of glycemic control over approximately 12 weeks.</description>

    <description>Baseline blood glucose readings will be checked one week prior to the start of the intervention, as well as weekly during the study for medication adjustment by a specialized Kaiser Permanente physician (weekly monitoring of blood glucose levels based on checks performed 3 times/day, for at least 3 consecutive days during the week, and then averaged). Follow-up blood glucose levels will be self-measured by patient glucometer, 3 times/ day, for at least 3 consecutive days. The average of these readings will be computed, as the &quot;average weekly blood sugar&quot;</description>

    <description>The Coronary Health Improvement Project' (CHIP; an intensive, community-based, lifestyle change program including a low saturated fat diet rich in whole, grown foods) has been shown to improve the health of diabetics through an intensive education taught over a 12 week period, but has not been studied in terms of its effect on HBAIC. Kaiser Permanente places significant resources into preventive medicine but does not have programs with the level of intensity of CHIP. This study aims to determine if Kaiser members with uncontrolled type 2 diabetes can achieve a significant improvement in their HBAIC after 12 weeks of participation in the CHIP program.</description>
