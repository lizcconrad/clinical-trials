  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Overweight and obesity are highly significant clinical and public health issues, affecting
      more than two-thirds of adults in this country; however, primary care clinicians often do not
      document overweight or obesity or discuss weight management with their patients. The
      objectives of the proposed research are to develop and evaluate a set of tools within
      electronic health records (EHRs) to assist primary care clinicians with the diagnosis and
      treatment of overweight and obesity and to help patients manage their weight.
