      The primary purpose of the study will be to look for biological biomarkers to determine which
      people with gum disease will have a worsening of the disease. A second objective of this
      study will be to look at the effects of periodontal treatment on the levels of the biomarkers
      that are identified.

      This multicenter clinical study will investigate biomarkers of periodontal disease
      progression. The study will enroll 375 subjects with periodontal disease and 125
      periodontally healthy subjects. All subjects will be monitored clinically and have samples
      taken every 2 months for 12 months for analysis of inflammatory and immunological biomarkers
      and microbial species. Subjects displaying periodontal disease progression greater than an
      established threshold will receive periodontal rescue therapy at progressing periodontal
      sites and continue with monitoring. Periodontally healthy subjects and non-progressing sites
      in subjects with periodontal disease will serve as controls. After 12 months, subjects with
      periodontal disease will receive periodontal therapy consisting of 4 quadrants of scaling and
      root planing. Periodontally healthy subjects will receive prophylaxis and scaling and exit
      the study. Following periodontal therapy, subjects with periodontal disease will be followed
      for a maintenance period of 6 months for clinical and biological monitoring. Statistical
      analyses will compare biomarkers and microbial species between periodontally healthy subjects
      and subjects with periodontal disease, between progressing and non-progressing periodontally
      diseased sites, and between periodontally diseased sites before and after periodontal
      therapy.

    <time_frame>After the baseline visit, subjects will return to the clinic every 2 months (± 7 days relative to baseline) for 12 months.</time_frame>
    <description>The primary study outcome will be progression of periodontal disease as determined by CAL. Initial disease progression at a site will be defined as loss of ≥2 mm in CAL at any assessment or follow-up visit compared with baseline. Subsequent disease progression will be similarly defined except that the loss in CAL will be compared with the last visit at which disease progression was detected.</description>

    <time_frame>Levels measured every 2 months for 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Biomarker levels will be compared between progressing and non-progressing periodontally diseased sites. The biomarkers include microbial species in saliva, GCF, and plaque and inflammatory and immunological markers in serum, saliva, and GCF. In addition, differences will be compared between diseased subjects before and after periodontal therapy and between periodontally diseased and healthy subjects.</description>

    <description>All subjects will have professional dental prophylaxis and periodontal therapy withheld for 12 months during the disease progression and monitoring phase. After 12 months, subjects with periodontal disease will receive periodontal therapy to consist of scaling and root planing, and periodontally healthy subjects will receive professional dental prophylaxis. Subjects with periodontal disease will also receive Supportive Periodontal Therapy at the 3- and 6-month post-therapy visits. Subjects showing periodontal disease progression greater than a predetermined threshold during the monitoring or maintenance phases of the study will be given rescue therapy consisting of placement of a local antibiotic at the site of disease progression.</description>

      The biological samples listed below will be obtained at baseline, each 2-month assessment
      visit for 12 months, and the 6-month post-therapy visit.

      Blood. Ten mL of blood will be obtained by venipuncture from the antecubital fossa. Subjects
      consenting to have a blood sample drawn for future DNA analysis will have an additional 7 mL
      of blood drawn at the baseline visit.

      Saliva. Each subject will provide a timed sample of whole saliva by expectorating into a
      sterile graduated cylinder.

      Gingival crevicular fluid. A GCF sample will be collected from the mesial and distal aspect
      of each posterior tooth (excluding third molars) using filter strips (Periopaper®) gently
      inserted 1 to 2 mm subgingivally. A total of up to 32 samples will be obtained.

      Subgingival plaque samples. Two plaque samples will be taken from the mesial and distal
      aspects of each posterior tooth (excluding third molars) for up to 64 samples.
