    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the study is to determine which baseline and yearly response factors
      (clinical and para clinical) predict overall disease-free status at Month 12 and Month 24,
      and clinical disease-free status in subsequent Months 36 and 48. The secondary objectives
      are: To identify prognostic factors at Baseline that predict overall disease-free status at
      Month 12, and to assess if yearly overall disease-free response factors predict overall
      disease-free status at Month 24; To evaluate clinical disease-free status (relapse, Expanded
      Disability Status Scale [EDSS]) at each analysis time point of Months 12, 24, 36, and 48; To
      identify prognostic factors at Baseline that predict clinical disease-free status at Month
      12, and to assess yearly clinical disease-free response factors that predict clinical
      disease-free status (relapse, EDSS) in subsequent years at Months 24, 36, and 48; To evaluate
      the impact of Tysabri at each analysis time point of Months 12, 24, 36, and 48 on the
      following: annualized relapse rate (ARR), sustained EDSS progression and improvement (24-week
      sustained); To evaluate the impact of Tysabri at each analysis time point of Months 12, 24,
      36, and 48 on the following: magnetic resonance image (MRI) measures: T2, T1, T1 with
      Gadolinium (Gd), brain atrophy; To evaluate the impact of Tysabri at Month 24 and Month 48 on
      the following: optical coherence tomography (OCT), Low and High Contrast Visual Acuity
      Assessment; To evaluate the impact of Tysabri at each analysis time point of Months 12, 24,
      36, and 48 on the following: cognitive impairment (Symbol Digit Modalities Test [SDMT]),
      capacity for work (Work Productivity and Activity Impairment Questionnaire [WPAI]), quality
      of life (QoL) (Multiple Sclerosis Impact Scale [MSIS-29])

    <description>Overall disease activity-free is defined as no relapses, no disability progression (RRMS), and absence of MRI disease activity (no gadolinium [gd])+ lesions, no new or enlarging T2-hyperintense lesions). A clinical relapse is defined as new or recurrent neurological symptoms, not associated with fever, lasting for at least 24 hours, and followed by a period of 30 days of stability or improvement. Sustained disability progression defined by at least a 1.0-point increase on the EDSS from a Baseline EDSS ≥1.0 that is sustained for 12 or 24 weeks, or at least a 1.5-point increase on the EDSS from a Baseline EDSS &lt;1.0 that is sustained for 12 or 24 weeks. The EDSS measures the disability status of people with multiple sclerosis on a scale that ranges from 0 to 10, with higher scores indicating more disability.</description>

    <description>A clinical relapse is defined as new or recurrent neurological symptoms, not associated with fever, lasting for at least 24 hours, and followed by a period of 30 days of stability or improvement. The ARR will be calculated by tabulating the total number of relapses experienced in the group divided by the number of days up to the end of study, and the ratio then multiplied by 365.</description>

    <description>The Work Productivity and Activity Impairment (WPAI) questionnaire is a validated instrument to measure impairments in work and activities. The WPAI yields four types of scores: 1. Absenteeism (work time missed) 2. Presenteeism (impairment at work / reduced on-the-job effectiveness) 3. Work productivity loss (overall work impairment / absenteeism plus presenteeism) 4. Activity Impairment WPAI outcomes are expressed as impairment percentages, with higher numbers indicating greater impairment and less productivity.</description>

    <description>The 29-item Multiple Sclerosis Impact Scale (MSIS-29) is a participant-reported outcome measure to assess the impact of MS on day-to-day life during the past 2 weeks from a participant's perspective; it measures 20 physical items and 9 psychological items. The physical score is generated by summing individual items and then transforming to a scale with a range of 0 to 100, where high scores indicate worse health.</description>
