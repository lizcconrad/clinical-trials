  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) is a rare and aggressive type of lymphoma, with only about 3,000
      cases diagnosed per year. MCL is considered a difficult cancer to treat. This study is being
      done to better understand how to treat MCL.

    <description>This is a phase I/phase II multi-institution trial. The phase I part of the trial will determine the MTD of cytarabine. The phase II part of the trial will examine the efficacy of the proposed regimen by evaluating the 3-year event-free survival (EFS) in patients with untreated mantle cell lymphoma. All patients in the study in both phases will undergo induction and consolidation with R-CHOP 14R-HIDAC, followed by RIT/HDT/ASCR.</description>

    <description>INDUCTION: R-CHOP-14 CHEMOTHERAPY: 4 cycles every 2 weeks ± 1 day All patients in the study in both phases will undergo induction and consolidation with R-CHOP 14R-HIDAC, followed by RIT/HDT/ASCR. Patients will undergo restaging scans 12 to 14 days following completion of R-CHOP 14, with CT, and FDG-PET. Patients demonstrating at least a PR may proceed to consolidation with R-HIDAC. CONSOLIDATION: R- HIDAC CHEMOTHERAPY: 2 cycles every 3 weeks ± 2 days After R-HIDAC, restaging will occur 17-21 days post cycle 2 with CT scan (or FDG-PET, if this was positive following R-CHOP-14). Radioimmunotherapy Dosimetric dose is given approximately 4-5 weeks after completing cycle 2 of R-HIDAC. This is to be preferred 1 week post restaging scans 17-21 days post cycle 2 of RHIDAC, and up to 2 weeks post-scans will be acceptable only if required by 131 I Tositumomab availability.</description>

             or MUGA.

          -  For patients ≥ age 60, a stress echocardiogram will be required, with same
             requirements as above.

          -  DLCO greater than or equal to 50% as determined by pulmonary function tests performed
             prior to initiation of treatment.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Prior treatment for mantle cell lymphoma, including more than 7 days of steroids,
             immunotherapy, radioimmunotherapy, or chemotherapy. This does not include patients who
             have initiated R-CHOP at an outside institution within 2 weeks of enrollment.
