  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In partnership with the Chicago Public Schools (CPS), the goal of this project is to test the
      effectiveness of a manualized mentoring and case management program for students in grades
      1-8. Most of the current policy and research attention on dropout has focused on the dropout
      decision itself, even though dropout is more likely to be simply the end point of a
      longer-term developmental process. This project seeks to learn more about the relative
      effectiveness of preventing dropout through mentoring and case management programs, and to
      learn more about the relative effectiveness of intervening early vs. later.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      High school graduation is tremendously protective against involvement with crime and
      violence, as well as against the risk of adult poverty, unemployment, and poor health. Most
      of the policy and research attention on dropout has focused on the dropout decision itself.
      Yet dropout is almost always the end point of a longer-term developmental process. For this
      project the investigators have raised nearly $7 million in external support from the U.S.
      Department of Education, the National Institutes of Health, and the William T. Grant
      Foundation to learn more about the relative effectiveness of preventing dropout by trying to
      re-engage children in school much earlier during their academic careers.

      Specifically, this project is motivated by findings from the late University of Chicago
      sociologist James Coleman indicating that one of the strongest protective factors against
      school failure for children is having a strong relationship with a pro-social adult -
      something that far too many children do not currently have, particularly those growing up in
      distressed family and community environments. The investigators are partnering with other
      researchers at Northwestern, Duke, and the University of Minnesota to test at large scale the
      effects of a structured mentoring and monitoring programs called Check &amp; Connect. To date,
      the project has completed its pilot year, and starting this academic year will work with
      nearly 500 elementary and middle school students distributed across 23 CPS schools on the
      West and South sides of the city. Students will receive Check &amp; Connect assistance for two
      academic years total.
