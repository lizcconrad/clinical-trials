        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patient must have biopsy proven high-grade (severe) dysplasia, carcinoma-in-situ or
             early stage adenocarcinoma;

          -  Patient may have received prior therapy; e.g. Nd-YAG laser, radiation therapy or
             chemotherapy. At least one month must have elapsed between prior treatments and PDT.

          -  Tumors can be primary or recurrent, Stage 0 or I, N0M (any).

          -  Patients must have no contraindications to endoscopy.

          -  Male or female patients must be 18 years old or older. Female patients must not be
             pregnant and must be practicing a medically acceptable form of birth control or be
             sterile or post-menopausal. A pregnancy test is required and must be negative.

          -  Patients must sign an Informed Consent according to FDA guidelines and be acceptable
             to the RPCI IRB.

          -  Patients must have a Karnofsky status 50 or above.

          -  Operable patients are not excluded.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with tumors of grade greater than T-1.

          -  Porphyria or hypersensitivity to porphyrin or porphyrin-like compounds.

          -  WBC &lt;2,000; platelet count &lt;50,000, prothrombin time 1.5 times above the upper normal
             limit.

          -  Patients with impaired renal and/or hepatic function (total serum bilirubin &gt;3.0 mg/d,
             serum creatinine &gt;3 mg%, alkaline phosphatase (hepatic) or SGOT &gt;3 times the upper
             normal limit.

          -  Patients on concurrent chemotherapy or radiation therapy will be excluded as well as
             those having received prior treatment for the esophageal cancer within 4 weeks of
             enrollment.

          -  If the patient has cancer other than non-melanoma skin cancer they must be deemed
             disease free by their treating physician.
