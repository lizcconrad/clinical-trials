  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Internet-based weight control programs have been shown effective in producing weight loss,
      but in-person delivery of behavioral weight control produces significantly greater weight
      loss than on-line delivery of the same program. Motivational Interviewing has been shown to
      increase weight loss when delivered as an adjunct to in-person weight loss programs but has
      not been examined in conjunction with web-based obesity treatment. Therefore, the overall
      goal of this project is to determine if the addition of on-line Motivational Interviewing to
      a web-based group behavioral obesity treatment program will augment weight loss outcomes.

      This randomized controlled trial is designed to determine whether weight losses in a group
      behavioral weight loss intervention conducted over the Internet are increased with the
      inclusion of individual, online MI sessions. All participants will receive the same online
      6-month group-based behavioral weight loss program followed by 12 months of weight
      maintenance. Overweight and obese adults at two study sties (N=426) will be randomized to (1)
      Internet intervention; or 2) Internet intervention with individual MI sessions occurring at
      three month intervals on a fixed schedule (Internet+MI-Fixed). Assessments will be conducted
      every six months and will include measures of body weight and height, diet and exercise
      behaviors, Quality of Life, adherence measures (eg., attendance, compliance with
      self-monitoring), social influence components, motivation, treatment satisfaction,
      demographic data and descriptive information regarding use of website components. A third arm
      was added for the final 3 intervention cohorts. All participants received the program as
      described above with the addition of motivational interviewing contingent on participants'
      attendance in classes.
