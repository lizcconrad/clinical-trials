  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To investigate the therapeutic effect of a selected probiotic mixture on the severity of AD
      in infants aged 0-15 months. The probiotic mixture has been studied in laboratory setting and
      has proven IL-10 stimulating effects. Therefore it is thought to decrease AD severity in
      young children (beyond the conventional treatment).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a highly prevalent chronic, itching, inflammatory skin disease that
      often presents in infancy. The disease can be the first manifestation of the so-called atopic
      march, the natural progression of allergic disorders, with subsequent development of asthma
      and allergic rhinitis. Approximately 40% of the children with AD will develop asthma later in
      childhood.

      Currently, topical corticosteroids are the mainstay treatment of atopic dermatitis; however,
      relapses are common and parents often fear possible side-effects, leading to non-compliance.
      There is increasing evidence that the intestinal microbiota plays an important role in the
      development of allergic diseases. Modulation of the intestinal microbiota with probiotics,
      living micro-organisms with immunomodulatory effects, could possibly offer a new way of
      treatment of allergic disease.

      Clinical trials investigating the preventive as well as therapeutic effect of probiotics on
      atopic dermatitis show inconsistent results. Systematic (Cochrane) reviews of all clinical
      trials (about treatment of AD by use of probiotics) concluded that the probiotic strains
      studied to date are not an effective treatment for AD; however, there is great heterogeneity
      between studies since many different probiotic strains are used. Because of the known strain
      specific capacity in immunomodulatory effects, some strains might have a greater effect than
      others.

      Better results can possibly be achieved by using a selected, (in laboratory setting) proven
      modulatory multispecies probiotic mixture, containing 6 different strains.

    <description>The primary outcome will be measured by change in the severity of AD by using the SCORAD score.
Other outcomes: subjective (parental) change in eczema severity, change in amount of and type of topical steroid use, quality of life during and after intervention (measured by ITQOL questionnaire), amount of respiratory tract infections, use of antibiotics, use of primary care medicine (general practitioner).
All used probiotic strains contain the QPS status. (serious) adverse events will be recorded systematically.</description>
