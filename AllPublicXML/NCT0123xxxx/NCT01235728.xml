  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a within-participant comparison study to investigate the efficacy of a 28-day regimen
      of MK-0873 2% cream twice a day (b.i.d.) compared to MK-0873 vehicle (matching placebo)
      b.i.d. as well as to a positive control comparator calcitriol 0.0003% (3 µg/g) in
      participants with plaque psoriasis. In order to be enrolled in the study, patients need to
      have at least two pairs (lesions AB and CD) of approximately similar plaque lesions in
      severity and size of surface area involved and located in approximately symmetric regions
      such as the trunk or limbs of the body. Participants will be randomly assigned to apply
      either MK-0873 or MK-0873 vehicle to plaque A or B and will be randomly assigned to apply
      MK-0873 or calcitriol to plaque C or D. It is hypothesized that MK-0873 cream formulation
      administered to participants with psoriasis by the topical route will result in a
      statistically greater percent target lesion severity (TLS) reduction in plaque lesion than
      will MK-0873 Vehicle on Day 29.

    <time_frame>Baseline and Day 29</time_frame>
    <description>Each lesion was evaluated for 3 components: erythema, induration, and scaling. Each component was given a score using the following scale: 0=none, 1=slight, 2=moderate, 3=marked, 4=very marked, with increasing score reflecting increased lesion severity. The TLS score (range 0 to 12) is calculated as the sum of the 3 components.</description>
