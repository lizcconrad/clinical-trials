    <textblock>
      This phase II trial is studying how well RO4929097 (gamma-secretase/Notch signalling pathway
      inhibitor RO4929097) works in treating patients with previously treated metastatic pancreatic
      cancer. RO4929097 may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some enzymes needed for cell
      growth.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the 6-month survival of patients with previously treated metastatic pancreas
      cancer treated with gamma secretase RO4929097.

      II. To determine the adverse events of RO4929097 in this patient population. III. To
      correlate changes in tumor markers with RO4929097 exposure.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the response rate and overall survival of this population treated with
      RO4929097.

      II. To correlate clinical outcome with tumor markers (including stem cell markers) obtained
      from pre- and post- treatment biopsies. (exploratory) III. To assess variants in genes
      involved in RO4929097 disposition and their relation to RO4929097 exposure.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive gamma-secretase/Notch signalling pathway inhibitor RO4929097 orally (PO)
      once daily on days 1-3, 8-10, and 15-17. Courses repeat every 21 days for up to 24 months in
      the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients may undergo tumor biopsy at baseline and on days 16 or 17 of course one for
      biomarker and other correlative studies. Blood samples may also collected at baseline and
      periodically during study for pharmacokinetic and angiogenesis marker studies.

      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed up periodically for 2 years.
