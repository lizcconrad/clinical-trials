      The purpose of this study is to test the ease of using a new device, called the GlowCap that
      reminds the patient to take their breast cancer hormone pill. The study will collect
      information about the experience with this device and what the patient thinks of its role in
      the daily pill taking routine.

    <description>Participants will be provided with a device called the GlowCap for a period of 30 days. The device has visual and auditory cues to help patients remember to take their medication at the same time each day. The GlowCap will be programmed to glow when it is time for each patient to take her medication. The GlowCap will initially glow bright orange for the first hour from the time the patient is scheduled to take the medication. During the second hour, the GlowCap system will play music in addition to continuing to glow. If after 2 hours the patient still has not opened the medication bottle, she will receive a phone call reminding her to take her medication.</description>
