  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study focuses on a new drug delivery system (Direct Antibiotic Delivery) to treat soft
      tissue infections. In this study, cefazolin is delivered directly to the target tissues using
      subcutaneous injection of antibiotic solution and then dispersed using high-frequency
      external ultrasound. Using this system, a much higher concentration of antibiotic can be
      achieved than through traditional treatment methods.

      Unlike traditional delivery methods, Direct Antibiotic Delivery does not rely on blood supply
      and is beneficial for subjects with Diabetes or subjects who have received radiation therapy
      and blood supply is limited.

    <textblock>
      In this study, the DOSAGE of cefazolin that is delivered is a fraction of that which is
      already FDA approved for intramuscular (IM) administration. However, the CONCENTRATION in the
      target area is much higher than what can be achieved through intravenous (IV) administration,
      while still being far less than what is approved for IM administration.

      Previous to this study, cefazolin was considered to be ineffective in treating
      Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) as it had only been tested at the
      concentrations that were attainable by traditional methods. Through our study and laboratory
      tests conducted at the Harford Hospital, Connecticut, we have confirmed that cefazolin can be
      effective against even the most resistant strains of MRSA if a high enough concentration is
      obtained.

      Under this study, treatment is only available to subjects that have already undergone
      standard therapy, but were not able to resolve the infection.

    <description>Cefazolin is approved for clinical use for some bacterial infections. The standard routes of administration are Intramuscular (IM) and intravenous (IV). For this study, the route of administration will be delivered using the Silberg TPS, which delivers the cefazolin by subcutaneous injection followed by external ultrasonic dispersion. The concentration delivered is one gram/100 ml saline. Cefazolin can safely be given IM at the much higher concentration of 1 gram/2.5 ml of saline. The maximum dose that may be administered is 3 grams in 300 ml, which is within the approved guidelines of a daily dose. The concentration of antibiotic will be the same; only the dose may vary depending on the size of the wound or area of induration. Each subject will receive only one treatment in this study.</description>

    <description>The TPS is FDA cleared for the subcutaneous infusion and ultrasonic dispersion of tumescent fluid excluding the parenteral delivery of drugs. Under this study, the TPS is a device to deliver cefazolin by subcutaneous injection followed by external ultrasonic dispersion. The TPS consists of a medical grade peristaltic pump that is used to infuse antibiotic solution using a sterile blunt-tipped infusion cannula into a superficial subcutaneous plane. After the cannula has been removed, high frequency external ultrasound is delivered transcutaneously over the area of infusion in order to disperse the antibiotic solution. The power density is within the range allowed for physical therapy.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects with pathologically confirmed presence of serious or immediately
             life-threatening soft tissue infection, cellulitis or open wound caused by bacteria
             for which cefazolin at this concentration is likely to have activity to inhibit the
             bacteria, for example, Staphylococcus species or Streptococcus species, Escherichia
             coli, Proteus mirabilis.

          -  Wounds must demonstrate the presence of skin and skin structure infection, which may
             be demonstrated by one or more of the following: Culture results as aforementioned,
             swelling of the tissues, discoloration, open wounds, and/or drainage, which may or may
             not be associated with pain and/or tenderness.

          -  Confirmed presence of soft tissue cellulitis caused by bacteria for which cefazolin is
             likely to have activity to inhibit the bacteria will be evidenced by microbiologic
             cultures taken no greater than ten (10) days prior to treatment.

          -  Subject must have previously been treated by a qualified licensed physician using
             traditional surgical and/or medical treatments, which may include courses of IV
             antibiotics, but where Subject was unable to resolve their infection through
             traditional surgical and/or medical treatments for soft tissue cellulitis caused by
             bacteria for which cefazolin is likely to have activity to inhibit the bacteria at a
             maximum concentration of 1 gram per 100 ml saline, as demonstrated by the presence of
             induration, redness, open wounds, and/or soft tissue swelling.
