      High doses of gabapentin are associated with pancreatic acinar cell tumors in rats, but there
      has been no post marketing pancreatic carcinogenicity signal with gabapentin as reported by
      spontaneous reports in AERS or in the published literature. In a published case-control
      screening study of the association of gabapentin with 55 cancers, the only cancer that met
      the screening criteria for possibly increased cancer risk with gabapentin exposure was renal
      (including renal pelvis) cancer. This association was judged to be likely due to or
      substantially accentuated by confounding by cigarette smoking, hypertension, and lifestyle
      (Cancer Causes Control 2009;20:1821-1835).

      The relationship between gabapentin exposure and pancreatic cancer and renal cancer is
      studied in NCT01138124, and supplemental analyses for these cancers are performed in the
      current study. The FDA recommended GSK also study the relationship between gabapentin and
      all-cancer sites, as well as cancer at the following specific sites: 1) stomach, 2) anus,
      anal canal, and anorectum, 3) lung and bronchus, 4) bones and joints, 5) breast, 6) penis, 7)
      urinary bladder, and 8) other nervous system.

      The primary objective of this study is to determine whether exposure to gabapentin is
      associated with an increased risk of developing all-cancer, and these specific cancers in the
      United Kingdom (UK) General Practice Research Database (GPRD). Each member of the UK
      population is registered with a General Practice, which centralizes the medical information
      not only from the general practitioners themselves but also from specialist referrals and
      hospital attendances. Over 487 General Practices contribute data to the GPRD.

      The study cohort from which cases and controls are drawn is all subjects in the GPRD
      1993-2008. Gabapentin was approved in the UK in May 1993. Entry into the study cohort begins
      Jan 1, 1993 for all those who are registered in GPRD before that time, and at the time of
      registration if later than Jan 1, 1993. Subjects are excluded from the GPRD cohort if they
      have a cancer diagnosis or a history of cancer prior to the cohort entry date. Patients with
      a first diagnosis of the respective cancer 1995-2008 are risk set matched with up to 10
      controls within the same General Practice for age at cohort entry (within two years), sex,
      and year of entry into the study cohort (within one year). For cases, the index date is the
      date of first diagnosis of the respective cancer. The index date for controls is set as the
      date at which the follow-up time from cohort entry is the same as the case. The index date is
      chosen so as to give the control equal follow-up time to that of the case for ascertainment
      of use of gabapentin. Cases and controls will be required to have at least 2 years of
      follow-up in the study cohort before their index date. Cases must have no history of any
      other cancer diagnosis prior to the index date. Controls are required to be free of cancer
      diagnosis in the database up to the control's index date.

      Data on gabapentin prescriptions are obtained for cases and controls from study cohort entry
      to the index date. Gabapentin exposure will be assessed as ever/never, number of
      prescriptions, cumulative dose, and cumulative duration, with a 2 year lag period
      incorporated to control for protopathic bias (gabapentin prescription for initial pain
      symptoms of undiagnosed cancer) and latency (time between cancer onset and specific GPRD
      cancer diagnosis).

      Crude and adjusted odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals (CI) will be produced from
      conditional logistic regression models, with additional analyses evaluating for
      dose-response. Covariates include indications for gabapentin use and risk factors for each
      cancer.

      more than one of the 22 arms (See &quot;Participant Flow: Overall Study&quot; Table) because of the

    <description>The study cohort from which cases and controls are drawn is all subjects in the United Kingdom (UK) General Practice Research Database (GPRD) 1993-2008. Each member of the UK population is registered with a General Practice, which centralizes the medical information not only from the general practitioners themselves but also from specialist referrals and hospital attendances. Over 487 General Practices contribute data to the GPRD. Entry into the study cohort begins Jan 1, 1993 for all those who are registered in GPRD before that time, and at the time of registration if later than Jan 1, 1993. Subjects are excluded from the GPRD cohort if they have a cancer diagnosis or a history of cancer prior to the cohort entry date.</description>

    <description>The exposure of interest is gabapentin use as defined by prescriptions recorded by the GPRD general practitioner (British National Formulry codes). Data on prescriptions for gabapentin will be extracted for each case and control from entry into the study cohort up to two years prior to the index date (the exposure window). A two year lagged exposure is incorporated to account for latency between cancer onset and GPRD diagnosis, and for protopathic bias (gabapentin prescription for initial pain symptoms of undiagnosed cancer). Gabapentin exposure will be parameterized as follows: (1) Ever versus never exposed; (2) Number of prescriptions; (3) Duration of exposure; and (4) Cumulative dose.</description>

        The study cohort from which cases and controls are drawn is all subjects in the UK GPRD
        1993-2008. Entry into the study cohort begins Jan 1, 1993 for all those who are registered
        in GPRD before that time, and at the time of registration if later than Jan 1, 1993.
        Subjects are excluded from the GPRD cohort if they have a cancer diagnosis or a history of
        cancer prior to the cohort entry date. Follow-up ends Dec 31, 2008, or earlier if the
        subject leaves the GPRD for any reason including death. There are several advantages to the
        GPRD dataset for this study. It is a large dataset with detailed longitudinal prescription
        data, and long term follow-up (mean 7 years) to allow for latency in carcinogenicity. It
        provides good representation of the elderly who are disproportionately affected by cancer,
        and routinely includes data recorded by general practitioners on potential risk factors
        such as smoking, alcohol consumption and body mass index.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  The study cohort from which cases and controls are drawn is all subjects in the UK
             GPRD 1993-2008. Entry into the study cohort begins Jan 1, 1993 for all those who are
             registered in GPRD before that time, and at the time of registration if later than Jan
             1, 1993. Follow-up ends Dec 31, 2008, or earlier if the subject leaves the GPRD for
             any reason including death.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects are excluded from the GPRD cohort if they have a cancer diagnosis or a
             history of cancer prior to the cohort entry date. Cases and controls will be required
             to have at least 2 years of follow-up in the study cohort before their index date (For
             cases, the index date is the date of first diagnosis of the respective cancer. The
             index date for controls is set as the date at which the follow-up time from cohort
             entry is the same as the case.) Cases must have no history of any other cancer
             diagnosis prior to the index date. Controls are required to be free of cancer
             diagnosis in the database up to the control's index date.

          <description>Cancer cases were risk set matched with up to 10 controls for sex, age at GPRD study cohort entry (within two years), calendar year of cohort entry (within one year), and General Practice site. The index date for controls was set as the date at which the follow-up time from cohort entry was the same as the case. The index date was chosen so as to give the control equal follow-up time to that of the case for ascertainment of use of gabapentin.

Gabapentin Exposure Description: With 2 year lag = Gabapentin exposure from cohort entry to 2 years prior to index date (to control for prediagnostic prescribing for pain symptoms possibly related to cancer). Without 2 year lag = Gabapentin exposure from cohort entry to index date. Tertile’s with 2 year lag: Tertile 1 (0.01 - 1.38 months), Tertile 2 (1.39 - 5.56 months), and Tertile 3 (5.57 - 105.82 months). Tertile’s without 2 year lag: Tertile 1 (0.01 - 1.38 months), Tertile 2 (1.39 - 5.72 months), and Tertile 3 (5.73 - 123.70 months).</description>
        <time_frame>The case index date was the date of incident cancer diagnosis ascertained in the GPRD study cohort 1995-2008. The matched control index date was the date at which the follow-up time from his/her cohort entry was the same as that for the case.</time_frame>
        <population>Cases &amp; controls drawn from the GPRD study cohort. Entry into study cohort began January 1, 1993, or at time of GPRD registration if after Jan. 1, 1993. Follow-up ended December 31, 2008, or earlier if respective cancer was diagnosed or if participant left the GPRD for any reason including death. Participants with prior history of cancer excluded.</population>

        <title>Number of All-Cancer Cases and Matched Controls With the Indicated Long Duration of Exposure to Gabapentin</title>
        <description>Incidence of all cancers. Gabapentin Exposure Description: With 2 year lag = Gabapentin exposure from cohort entry to 2 years prior to index date (to control for prediagnostic prescribing for pain symptoms possibly related to cancer). Without 2 year lag = Gabapentin exposure from cohort entry to index date.</description>
        <time_frame>The case index date was the date of incident cancer diagnosis ascertained in the GPRD study cohort 1995-2008. The matched control index date was the date at which the follow-up time from his/her cohort entry was the same as that for the case.</time_frame>

Gabapentin Exposure Description: With 2 year lag = Gabapentin exposure from cohort entry to 2 years prior to index date (to control for prediagnostic prescribing for pain symptoms possibly related to cancer). Without 2 year lag = Gabapentin exposure from cohort entry to index date. Tertile’s with 2 year lag: Tertile 1 (0.1 - 30.0 grams), Tertile 2 (30.1 - 189.0 grams), and Tertile 3 (189.1 - 9600.0 grams). Tertile’s without 2 year lag: Tertile 1 (0.1 - 30.0 grams), Tertile 2 (30.1 - 189.0 grams), and Tertile 3 (189.1 - 11610.0 grams).</description>
        <time_frame>The case index date was the date of incident cancer diagnosis ascertained in the GPRD study cohort 1995-2008. The matched control index date was the date at which the follow-up time from his/her cohort entry was the same as that for the case.</time_frame>

Exposure Description: With 2 year (yr) lag=Gaba. exposure from cohort entry to 2 yr prior to index date (to control for prediagnostic prescribing for pain symptoms possibly related to cancer). Without 2 yr lag=Gaba. exposure from cohort entry to index date. Tertiles (T) with 2 yr lag: T 1 (0.01-1.38 months [mo.]), T 2 (1.3-5.56 mo.), and T 3 (5.57-105.82 mo.). Tertiles without 2 yr lag: T 1 (0.01-1.38 m.), T 2 (1.39-5.72 mo.), and T 3 (5.73-123.70 mo.). Inestimable OR and 95% CI when no gaba.-exposed cancer cases or controls at the exposure level.</description>
        <time_frame>The case index date was the date of incident stomach cancer diagnosis ascertained in the GPRD study cohort 1995-2008. The matched control index date was the date at which the follow-up time from his/her cohort entry was the same as that for the case</time_frame>

          <description>Incident stomach cancer. Gabapentin (Gaba.) Exposure Description: With 2 year (yr) lag=Gabapentin exposure from cohort entry to 2 years prior to index date (to control for prediagnostic prescribing for pain symptoms possibly related to cancer). Without 2 yr lag=Gaba. exposure from cohort entry to index date. Tertiles (T) with 2 yr lag: T 1 (0.1-30.0 grams [g]), T 2 (30.1-189.0 g), and T 3 (189.1-9600.0 g). Tertiles without 2 yr lag: T 1 (0.1-30.0 g), T 2 (30.1-189.0 g), and T 3 (189.1-11610.0 g). Inestimable OR and 95% CI when no gaba.-exposed cancer cases or controls at the exposure level.</description>
          <population>Cases &amp; controls drawn from the GPRD study cohort. Entry into study cohort began January 1, 1993, or at time of GPRD registration if after Jan. 1, 1993. Follow-up ended December 31, 2008, or earlier if respective cancer was diagnosed or if participant left the GPRD for any reason including death. Participants with prior history of cancer excluded.</population>

Without 2 yr lag=Gaba. exposure from cohort entry to index date. Tertiles (T) with 2 yr lag: T 1 (0.01-1.38 months [mo.]), T 2 (1.39-5.56 mo.), and T 3 (5.57 -105.82 mo.). Tertiles without 2 yr lag: T 1 (0.01-1.38 mo.), T 2 (1.39-5.72 mo.), and T 3 (5.73-123.70 mo.). Inestimable OR and 95% CI when no gaba.-exposed cancer cases or controls at the exposure level.</description>
        <time_frame>The case index date was the date of incident anal cancer diagnosis ascertained in the GPRD study cohort 1995-2008. The matched control index date was the date at which the follow-up time from his/her cohort entry was the same as that for the case.</time_frame>

Gabapentin Exposure Description: With 2 year lag = Gabapentin exposure from cohort entry to 2 years prior to index date (to control for prediagnostic prescribing for pain symptoms possibly related to cancer). Without 2 year lag = Gabapentin exposure from cohort entry to index date. Tertile’s with 2 year lag: Tertile 1 (0.01 - 1.38 months), Tertile 2 (1.39 - 5.56 months), and Tertile 3 (5.57 - 105.82 months). Tertile’s without 2 year lag: Tertile 1 (0.01 - 1.38 months), Tertile 2 (1.39 - 5.72 months), and Tertile 3 (5.73 - 123.70 months).</description>
        <time_frame>The case index date was the date of incident lung cancer diagnosis ascertained in the GPRD study cohort 1995-2008. The matched control index date was the date at which the follow-up time from his/her cohort entry was the same as that for the case.</time_frame>

Without 2 year lag = Gabapentin exposure from cohort entry to index date. Tertile’s with 2 year lag: Tertile 1 (0.1 - 30.0 grams), Tertile 2 (30.1 - 189.0 grams), and Tertile 3 (189.1 - 9600.0 grams). Tertile’s without 2 year lag: Tertile 1 (0.1 - 30.0 grams), Tertile 2 (30.1 - 189.0 grams), and Tertile 3 (189.1 - 11610.0 grams).</description>
        <time_frame>The case index date was the date of incident lung cancer diagnosis ascertained in the GPRD study cohort 1995-2008. The matched control index date was the date at which the follow-up time from his/her cohort entry was the same as that for the case.</time_frame>

Without 2 year lag = Gabapentin exposure from cohort entry to index date. Tertile’s with 2 year lag: Tertile 1 (0.01 - 1.38 months), Tertile 2 (1.39 - 5.56 months), and Tertile 3 (5.57 - 105.82 months). Tertile’s without 2 year lag: Tertile 1 (0.01 - 1.38 months), Tertile 2 (1.39 - 5.72 months), and Tertile 3 (5.73 - 123.70 months).</description>
        <time_frame>The case index date was the date of incident breast cancer diagnosis ascertained in the GPRD study cohort 1995-2008. The matched control index date was the date at which the follow-up time from his/her cohort entry was the same as that for the case.</time_frame>
        <population>Cases &amp; controls drawn from the GPRD study cohort. Entry into study cohort began January 1, 1993, or at time of GPRD registration if after Jan. 1, 1993. Follow-up ended December 31, 2008, or earlier if respective cancer was diagnosed or if participant left the GPRD for any reason including death.

Without 2 year lag = Gabapentin prescription from cohort entry to index date.</description>
        <time_frame>The case index date was the date of incident penile cancer diagnosis ascertained in the GPRD study cohort 1995-2008. The matched control index date was the date at which the follow-up time from his/her cohort entry was the same as that for the case.</time_frame>
        <population>Cases &amp; controls drawn from the GPRD study cohort. Entry into study cohort began January 1, 1993, or at time of GPRD registration if after Jan. 1, 1993. Follow-up ended December 31, 2008, or earlier if respective cancer was diagnosed or if participant left the GPRD for any reason including death.

        <description>Incident bladder cancer. Gabapentin Exposure Description: With 2 year lag = Gabapentin exposure from cohort entry to 2 years prior to index date (to control for prediagnostic prescribing for pain symptoms possibly related to cancer). Without 2 year lag = Gabapentin exposure from cohort entry to index date. Tertile’s with 2 year lag: Tertile 1 (0.01 - 1.38 months), Tertile 2 (1.39 - 5.56 months), and Tertile 3 (5.57 - 105.82 months). Tertile’s without 2 year lag: Tertile 1 (0.01 - 1.38 months), Tertile 2 (1.39 - 5.72 months), and Tertile 3 (5.73 - 123.70 months).</description>
        <time_frame>The case index date was the date of incident bladder cancer diagnosis ascertained in the GPRD study cohort 1995-2008. The matched control index date was the date at which the follow-up time from his/her cohort entry was the same as that for the case</time_frame>

Without 2 year lag = Gabapentin exposure from cohort entry to index date. Tertile’s with 2 year lag: Tertile 1 (0.01 - 1.38 months), Tertile 2 (1.39 - 5.56 months), and Tertile 3 (5.57 - 105.82 months). Tertile’s without 2 year lag: Tertile 1 (0.01 - 1.38 months), Tertile 2 (1.39 - 5.72 months), and Tertile 3 (5.73 - 123.70 months).</description>
        <time_frame>The case index date was the date of incident pancreatic cancer diagnosis ascertained in the GPRD study cohort 1995-2008. The matched control index date was the date at which the follow-up time from his/her cohort entry was the same as for the case.</time_frame>

Without 2 year lag = Gabapentin exposure from cohort entry to index date. Tertile’s with 2 year lag: Tertile 1 (0.01 - 1.38 months), Tertile 2 (1.39 - 5.56 months), and Tertile 3 (5.57 - 105.82 months). Tertile’s without 2 year lag: Tertile 1 (0.01 - 1.38 months), Tertile 2 (1.39 - 5.72 months), and Tertile 3 (5.73 - 123.70 months).</description>
        <time_frame>The case index date was the date of incident renal cancer diagnosis ascertained in the GPRD study cohort 1995-2008. The matched control index date was the date at which the follow-up time from his/her cohort entry was the same as that for the case.</time_frame>

Tertile’s with 2 year lag: Tertile 1 (0.01 - 1.38 months), Tertile 2 (1.39 - 5.56 months), and Tertile 3 (5.57 - 105.82 months). Tertile’s without 2 year lag: Tertile 1 (0.01 - 1.38 months), Tertile 2 (1.39 - 5.72 months), and Tertile 3 (5.73 - 123.70 months).</description>
          <population>Cases &amp; controls drawn from the GPRD study cohort. Entry into study cohort began January 1, 1993, or at time of GPRD registration if after Jan. 1, 1993. Follow-up ended December 31, 2008, or earlier if respective cancer was diagnosed or if participant left the GPRD for any reason including death. Participants with prior history of cancer excluded.</population>

        <title>Number of Renal Cancer Cases and Matched Controls With the Indicated Long Duration of Exposure to Gabapentin</title>
        <description>Incident renal cancer. Gabapentin Exposure Description: With 2 year lag = Gabapentin exposure from cohort entry to 2 years prior to index date (to control for prediagnostic prescribing for pain symptoms possibly related to cancer).
