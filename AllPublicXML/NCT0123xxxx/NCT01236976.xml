  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is a multi-centre, assessor-blind, randomised controlled phase III trial in
      patients with with complete or incomplete spinal cord injury between C6 and T12. A total of
      188 participants will be randomised into two groups, the experimental group and the control
      group. The control group participants will receive an upper body strength and fitness
      program, conducted for 2-3 hours, three times per week for 12 weeks, while the experimental
      group participants will receive a comprehensive full body exercise program, conducted for 2-3
      hours, three times per week for 12 weeks.

      The main objective of this study is to determine if the experimental exercise program is more
      effective than the upper body strength and fitness program in promoting neurological
      improvement in participants with spinal cord injury.

      Total study duration is 3.5 years, including a 24 month recruitment period, a 12-week
      treatment period followed by 6 month and 12 month (from baseline) follow up assessments.

      Participants will be assessed by a blinded assessor (the assessor will not know which group
      the participants are in) using standard physiotherapy, neurophysiological, fitness and
      functional tests, psychological and quality of life questionnaires, as well as tests of
      immune function and bone structure.

    <description>Participants in Group A will receive a triad of interventions comprising body weight supported treadmill training (BWSTT), functional electrical stimulation (FES)-assisted cycling, and trunk and upper and lower extremity exercise. These interventions will be provided at the spinal unit.
It is neither feasible nor desirable that every participant receives identical intervention because of the expected differences in impairments and activity limitations that he/she experiences. Project staff will use their clinical judgment to select exercises suitable for each participant and to progress them as appropriate. All exercises selected will be documented in the participant source notes.</description>

    <description>Participants in Group B will receive an upper body strength and fitness program. This program may be provided at the spinal unit, or an appropriately equipped gymnasium as approved by the SCIPA Full-On Project Committee. It will be based on the Burn Rubber Burn (BRB) exercise program already established in Sydney. BRB is a circuit-based exercise program incorporating resistance and cardiovascular training. For this protocol, the circuit will comprise several stations using different pieces of equipment.
The participants will be supervised by a therapist and/or clinical exercise instructor and exercises will be progressed as appropriate to build strength and endurance. Guidelines for the content and delivery of exercises will be clearly outlined in a handbook to ensure standardisation across sites.</description>

    <intervention_name>Therastride Treadmill System</intervention_name>
    <description>This device supports spinal cord injured patients to stand (suspended in a harness by an overhead pulley) on the specially designed treadmill for locomotor training. It has adjustable ergonomic seating for the therapists, a dedicated computer, surge protector, battery backup, custom software and controls, and a closed-loop feedback system. A therapist/assistant is positioned behind the participant to stabilise the pelvis and trunk, and to assist with appropriate weight shifting and hip rotation during the step cycle. Two additional therapists are seated in front of the participant to provide manual assistance for the lower limbs to facilitate knee extension during stance and knee flexion and toe clearance during swing, maintaining appropriate alignment of the limbs. A fourth person controls the treadmill. This system is being used in US universities and rehabilitation facilities throughout North America and is registered with the FDA (Regulation Number 890.5380).</description>

    <intervention_name>FES-assisted cycling</intervention_name>
    <description>This intervention will be provided using a RT300 cycle (Restorative Therapies, Baltimore MD). Surface electrodes will be applied to the quadriceps, gluteal, hamstrings and calf muscles according to a standardized protocol. The pedal cadence will be set to 15-50 revâ€¢min-1. Stimulation intensity will be gradually increased to a maximum of 140 mA with a pulse width of 0.3ms and frequency of 35Hz (Eser et al. 2003; Fornusek &amp; Davis, 2008). Participants will exercise at the maximal power output possible at their level of recovery. Participants will commence with 10 minutes of training and gradually build up to a period of 30 minutes. The frequency, power output at each minute, and training duration will be recorded at each training session.</description>

    <description>This intervention will comprise assisted and/or resisted movements aimed at facilitating and strengthening voluntary muscle activity and improving movement quality. These may be provided in lying (e.g. supine, prone) and in weight-bearing positions (e.g. kneeling, standing). Task-specific practice of functional tasks, involving moving the upper body over and outside the base of support, will also be undertaken. Participants may also be given exercises in motor imagery, imagining movements of their body</description>
