    <textblock>
      Fractures of the acetabulum are considered rare in the general community, but are quite
      common in major metropolitan areas and tertiary care centers. These fractures are some of the
      most complex and challenging injuries to successfully treat in the orthopaedic field.
      Extensile surgical exposures are required to access this unique structure that comprises the
      cup of the hip joint. Large skin incisions, significant soft tissue dissection, and elevation
      of periosteum and muscle from the intact and fractured fragments are often required for
      anatomic reductions of the acetabulum and good outcomes. Thus, there are many sources of
      intra-operative bleeding that can sum up to require strategies aimed at preventing bleeding
      or replacing blood loss.

      Cell-saver and transfusion of allogeneic blood products can replenish blood loss. The use of
      cell-saver is a good solution, but it is quite expensive. Trained perfusionists are required
      and cost over $400 per hour. Disposable products are also required for each patient. While
      blood loss can be great, often not enough blood is captured, processed, and available for
      return transfusion. Allogeneic blood transfusion is often routine. Appropriate blood is often
      on short supply. The cost of processing, testing, and transfusion is also high: minimum of
      $260 per standard unit of packed red blood cells. While risks of disease transmission are
      rare, they exist and can have serious consequences to patients. Transmission can include CMV
      (common), Hepatitis C (1:1,600,000), HIV (1:1,800,000), and bacteria (1:500,000). Transfusion
      reactions are more common and include febrile reactions (1:100), allergic reactions (1:100),
      hemolytic reactions (less common), and transfusion-related acute lung injury (1:5000).

      Decreased operative times, aggressive electrocautery, ligation of identifiable vessels,
      minimal soft tissue dissection or stripping, topical agents such as gel foams, and thrombins
      are possible and available. But still, significant blood losses persist. Over the past
      decade, platelet gel products and fibrin sealants have been developed and provide another
      possible solution. There are some retrospective studies in the arthroplasty literature
      indicating these are good hemostatic agents. There is also some literature from the general,
      oral and maxillofacial, and spine surgical fields indicated these topical agents decrease
      intra-operative blood loss. But there are no large prospective, randomized studies in
      orthopedics, particularly traumatology, supporting the use of surgical hemostats.

      This study protocol will use one surgical hemostat (Vitagel, Stryker). The study is a
      prospective, randomized controlled trial to evaluate this type of topical agent's role as a
      hemostatic agent in certain acetabular fracture types that require a non-extensile, posterior
      approach. Three fellowship-trained traumatologists will be involved: Drs. Milan Sen, Tim
      Achor, Josh Gary, Mark Prasarn, John Munz, and Andrew Burgess. Dr. Ambrose will assist in
      analyzing the data and statistical outcomes.

      Purpose of Project. The purpose of our study is to determine whether surgical hemostats can
      minimize blood loss, need for allogeneic blood transfusions and their associated risks, and
      costs in patients with certain acetabular fractures requiring operative fixation via a
      non-extensile Kocher-Langenbeck surgical approach. Since surgical hemostats and other topical
      agents like platelet gel products have also been linked with improved wound healing, a
      secondary endpoint will be incidence of wound dehiscence and/or infections.

      The investigators primary hypothesis is the topical hemostat will result in lower blood
      losses intraoperatively and fewer units of perioperative blood product transfused.

      Patients will be identified upon admission to Memorial Hermann-TMC, starting January 1, 2010,
      who fulfill the following inclusion criteria:

        1. Acetabular fracture deemed to require open reduction and internal fixation by one of the
           three principle attending surgeons.

        2. Fixation must require a single non-extensile posterior approach (Kocher-Langenbeck)
           Posterior wall, Posterior column, certain simple transverse and transverse associated
           with a posterior wall, T-type, and posterior wall-posterior column fracture types

        3. Ages 18-65

        4. Patient or family must consent to the research protocol

      Potential study candidates will be excluded based on the following criteria

        1. Not meeting the aforementioned inclusion criteria

        2. Unstable hemoglobin levels for three days prior to acetabular surgery (i.e. no other
           bleeding sources)

        3. Revision surgery

        4. Surgery occurring more than two weeks post-injury

        5. History of blood dyscrasias or immunocompromised patients

        6. Patients with medical conditions requiring anticoagulation or INR above 1.5

        7. Obese patients (BMI &gt;35)

        8. Known ongoing infection (local or systemic)

        9. Pregnant women

      Consent Procedure: After admission, potential candidates will be recruited by either a
      resident, physician assistant, or nurse practitioner. The research protocol will be presented
      along with the risks and benefits of both the control and treatment groups. Both consent and
      HIPAA documentation with be signed if the patient is agreeable. Study Description. This will
      be a prospective, randomized, controlled trial lasting one year at a minimum. Once consent is
      obtained, the patient will be randomized by use of the sealed envelope method. The patient
      will not know to which group he/she is assigned. The control group will not receive the
      surgical hemostat and no blood draw will be necessary. The test group will include the use of
      the surgical hemostat. Both groups will receive standard intra- and perioperative care (i.e.
      cell save, blood transfusions as needed). At the time of enrollment, baseline information of
      each patient will be obtained by a questionnaire, including age, sex, BMI, medical
      co-morbidities, history of alcohol, tobacco, or drugs. Randomization should also account for
      and patients will be stratified by pre-operative ASA, ISS, and fracture type.

      A Data collection sheet will be included in the chart. It will be colored and flagged.
      Nursing staff will input the following data:

        1. Pre-operative hemoglobin levels (routine AM labs: generally 12AM-2AM for STICU and SIMU
           patients, 4AM-6AM for floor patients)

        2. Recovery room post-operative hemoglobin levels

        3. Post-operative hemoglobin levels (routine AM labs: generally 12AM-2AM for STICU and SIMU
           patients, 4AM-6AM for floor patients). For cases ending after 5PM, hemoglobin level will
           be taken on a fourth AM to ensure that a full 72 hours is monitored

        4. Post-operative transfusion requirements for 72 hours

      OR nursing staff will record intra-operative data, including:

        1. Intra-operative blood loss as measured by cell saver

        2. Intra-operative transfusion requirements

        3. Intra-operative complications

      Orthopaedic resident or extended provider (N.P. or P.A.) will record any evidence of wound
      complications, including infections requiring antibiotics or surgical debridement, dehiscence
      or necrosis requiring additional treatments (packing or wound vac) and/or surgeries
      throughout the hospital stay.

      Postoperative transfusions triggers will be as follows: Hemoglobin &lt; 7 g/dL. Hemoglobin &lt;10
      g/dL in patients with known cardiovascular comorbidities. Any hemoglobin level in which the
      patient is symptomatic and the physician deems it necessary and in the best interest of the
      patient to transfuse blood. Examples include but are not limited to:

        -  Hypotension and shock.

        -  Chest pain, palpitations, and/or shortness of breath.

        -  Lightheadness or fatigue with physical therapy.

      DVT chemoprophylaxis will be discontinued the morning prior to surgery and resumed 24 hours
      post operatively. Mechanical prophylaxis to be continued throughout as tolerated.

      During surgery, a Vitagel representative will be present for aid the nurses in preparing the
      samples. Autologous blood draw (approximately 10cc) will be performed by the anesthesiologist
      in the operating room. This sample is passed to the nurse in the operating room, and he/she
      will centrifuge the sample. The resulting plasma will be transferred into a sterile syringe
      and delivered to the surgical field. The syringe with autologous fibrinogen and
      platelets(5cc) will be assembled side-by-side with the sterile bovine thrombin and collagen
      syringe (5cc), by either the surgical technician or surgeon. The applicator simultaneously
      mixes the two samples and sprays the surgical hemostat on the desired area. Sterile
      precautions are a maintained throughout, and the blood or plasma will not leave the operating
      room. The surgical hemostat will be applied first to dissected musculature (external rotators
      and abductors) after exposure of the fracture and second to the subcutaneous closure
      superficial to iliotibial band and gluteal fascia.
