    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if a culturally focused psychiatric (CFP)
      consultation service can improve depressive symptoms and increase diagnosis and treatment of
      depression in Asian American and Latino American primary care patients at the Massachusetts
      General Hospital.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study's aim is to determine if a culturally focused mental health consultation will help
      Latino and Asian Americans who are experiencing sadness, stress, or other symptoms of
      depression. Eligible adults must already have a primary care physician at Massachusetts
      General Hospital.

      In this study, patients will be randomly assigned, like the flip of a coin, to receive the
      culturally focused intervention or treatment as usual. Those who receive the intervention
      will have three sessions with study personnel, during which they will generally discuss and
      learn techniques for dealing with their mental health. Those who receive treatment as usual,
      meaning the regular care they receive through their primary care practice, will have two
      sessions with study personnel during which they will generally discuss their mental health.
      All study visits and patient materials are provided in patients' language of choice -
      English, Spanish, Mandarin, Cantonese, or Vietnamese. All patients will be compensated for
      completing study visits.

      About half of the study patients in both arms will also be invited to participate in optional
      qualitative interviews, in which they will be asked questions about their expectations for
      the research study and their ideas for improving culturally sensitive mental health services.
      In addition, a small sample of Asian American patients who did not participate in the study
      but who have PCPs at the sites where the study was conducted will be contacted for a
      qualitative interview. This interview will address reasons why Asian American recruitment for
      the study was so challenging.

    <description>The treatment as usual arm consists of two phone or in-person interviews:
Patients are asked questions about their mental health, their views of mental health, and how they cope with their mental health (including any treatment they might be receiving).
Patients are asked the same questions 6 months after the initial interview.</description>

  <arm_group>
    <arm_group_label>Culturally focused psychiatric consultation</arm_group_label>
    <arm_group_type>Experimental</arm_group_type>
    <description>The consultation is comprised of 3 visits:
1a. Psychiatric diagnostic interview, self-rated questionnaires (in-person consultation).
1b. Intervention focused on learning about depression and how to treat it using culturally relevant resources.
2. Follow-up visit two weeks later to go over patients' questions, homework if applicable, and patients' ability to meet the goals outlined in the first visit (in-person or phone visit).
3. 6-month follow up: 6 months after the initial consultation, patients are asked about mental health symptoms and mental health treatment they might be receiving (phone visit unless patient requests in-person).</description>
