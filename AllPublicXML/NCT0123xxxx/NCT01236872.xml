  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Inorganic nitrate can be converted to nitrite and thence nitric oxide in humans. Nitric oxide
      is normally produced by the inner lining of blood vessels and helps keep blood vessels open
      and therefore blood pressure lower. In subjects with high blood pressure, the inner lining of
      the blood vessels does not function adequately. The investigators wish to investigate whether
      elevating systemic levels of inorganic nitrate (through provision of dietary nitrate-rich
      vegetables) can elevate levels of nitrate/nitrite in hypertensive subjects, and whether this
      has a beneficial effect on blood pressure.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Adult male and females between 18 and 85 years of age, inclusive.

          2. To be eligible, female subjects will be required to state that they are not pregnant,
             and will not become pregnant during the course of the study.

          3. Body mass index (BMI) between 18 and 40 kg/m2

          4. A signed and dated written informed consent prior to admission to the study

          5. The subject is able to understand and comply with protocol requirements, instructions
             and protocol-stated restrictions.

          6. Grade 1 hypertensive SBP 140-159 or DBP 90-99 on no anti-hypertensives, no target
             organ damage (TOD), low cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. History of symptomatic coronary artery disease, stroke, or other known atherosclerotic
             disease.

          2. History of chronic viral hepatitis (including presence of hepatitis B surface antigen
             or hepatitis C antibody), or other chronic hepatic disorders.

          3. History of increased liver function tests (ALT, AST) due to acute or chronic liver
             conditions, 3x above the upper limit of normal or bilirubin 1.5x above the upper limit
             of normal at screening.

          4. Renal impairment with creatinine clearance (eGFR) of &lt;50 ml/min at screening.

          5. Current poorly controlled diabetes mellitus, defined as HbA1c &gt;10% at Screen.

          6. Subjects with LDLc, &gt;7.5 mmol/l. Fasting TG level &gt;6mmol/l.

          7. History of heart failure defined as NYHA class II - IV or those with known severe LV
             dysfunction (EF&lt;30%) regardless of symptomatic status

          8. History of malignancy within the past 5 years, other than non-melanoma skin cancer.

          9. Current life-threatening condition other than vascular disease (e.g., very severe
             chronic airways disease, HIV positive, life-threatening arrhythmias) that may prevent
             a subject from completing the study.

         11. Use of an investigational device or investigational drug within 30 days or 5

             an average weekly intake of &gt; 28 units (or an average daily intake of greater than 3
             units) for males, or an average weekly intake of &gt; 21 units (or an average daily
             intake of greater than 2 units) for females. 1 unit is equivalent to a halfpint
             (284mL) of beer/lager; 25mL measure of spirits or 125mL of wine; or a positive alcohol
             breath test at the screening visit

             medication administration.

         16. Any other subject whom the Investigator deems unsuitable for the study (e.g., due to
             either medical reasons, laboratory abnormalities, expected study medication
             noncompliance, or subject's unwillingness to comply with all study-related study
             procedures).

         17. Subjects with rheumatoid arthritis, connective tissue disorders and other conditions
