    <textblock>
      The primary outcome of this study is to investigate the accuracy of respiration gated laser
      guided CT lung nodule biopsy through a prospective randomized trial using a bellows-based
      breath hold monitoring system. Secondary outcome is the rate of complications using laser
      guided CT biopsy in general and with bellows-based breath hold monitoring system. The study
      has approval from the The Danish National Committee on Biomedical Research Ethics (ref no:
      H-4-2010-fsp 1).

    <description>Bellows-Based breath hold monitoring system:
The bellows-based breath hold system (IBC, Mayo Clinic Medical Devices, USA) contains of 2 elements; one belt which is strapped around the thorax of the patient and a voltage controlled light unit with 8 lights. Belt stretch from respiratory motion is converted into voltage readings and displayed on the light unit giving biofeedback as different lights are activated depending on the dept of the respiration. Patients are instructed to keep respiration constant at a certain dept during the second the guide needle is inserted by controlling their breath with the help of the light unit. The patient is given a brief introduction to the system as to how the lights get turned on and off due to respiration motion before the biopsy is preformed.</description>

      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

        Patients with indeterminate lung nodules referred from the department of pulmonary medicine
        at Gentofte Hospital, Denmark for a CT guided biopsy are considered for inclusion in this
        study. The biopsy was preformed as part of regular clinical work up of the patient at the
        department of Radiology Gentofte Hospital, Denmark. Both men and women were included and no
        age restrictions were applied.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Excluded from biopsy were those with poor pulmonary function test with a forced expired
        volume in the first second (FEV1) &lt; 0.5 L, INR&gt;1.2, blood cloth level under 200* and ECG
        with sign of ischemic heart disease. The trial is planned to begin 1.March 2010 and run for
        2 years ending at 29 February 2012. During this time approx. 400 participants planned for
        biopsy are accepted to be included in the trial.
