  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Malignant gliomas are very aggressive and among the most common of brain tumors. A diagnosis
      carries with it a median survival of approximately 12 months, with 90 - 95% of patients
      surviving less than 2 years. The current standard treatment of surgical resection followed by
      radiation therapy and chemotherapy has not substantially prolonged survival.

      Dendritic cells (DCs) are immune cells that form part of the mammalian immune system. Their
      main function is to process antigen material and present it on the surface to other cells of
      the immune system, thus functioning as antigen-presenting cells.In the present study, DCs
      were used for antigen presentation of glioma antigens to directly induce a cytotoxic T-cell
      response. Cytokine-induced killer (CIK)cells are shown to be a heterogeneous population, and
      the major population expresses both the T cell marker CD3 and the NK cell marker CD56, and is
      termed NKT cells, which has shown significant anti-tumor activity in both clinical trials and
      animal studies.

      Furthermore, CIK cells are able to expand significantly when they are cultured with DCs, and
      the CIK cells activated by DCs stimulation (DCIKs)have a characteristic which cytotoxic
      activity enhanced and show increased anti-tumor activity.

      This study aimed to evaluate the clinical efficacy of DCIK cells treatment combined with DCs
      following tumor resection and radiotherapy in patients with malignant glioma.
