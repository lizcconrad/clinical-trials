  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hyperglycemia is common in critically ill patients and associated with an adverse outcome.
      Thus, glycaemic control is an important issue in critical care. Despite extensive efforts of
      the intensive care unit staff difficulties were experienced in achieving efficient and safe
      glucose control. A fully automated algorithm may help to overcome some of these limitations
      by excluding intuitive interventions and integrating relevant clinical data in the
      decision-making process. Space GlucoseControl (TGC system) is a decision support system which
      helps to achieve safe and reliable blood glucose control in the desired ranges. Information
      on parenteral and enteral nutrition is automatically integrated into the calculations. The
      primary objective of the current study is to investigate the performance and usability of the
      Space TGC system for glucose control over an extended glucose control range (4.4 to 8.3
      mmol/L) in postoperative cardiac surgery patients.
