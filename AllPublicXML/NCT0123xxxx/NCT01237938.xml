    <description>To Assess the feasibility of a randomized trial to achieve diet change and promote longterm adoption of a low glycemic index diet intervention among women at high risk for breast cancer (&gt; 50% of breast area occupied by radiological density)</description>

    <measure>Biomarkers</measure>
    <time_frame>4, 8 &amp; 12 months on Treatment</time_frame>
    <description>To estimate the effect of a low glycemic index diet on breast cancer related biomarkers, including those associated with carbohydrate, growth and steroid hormaone metabolism and mammograhic density. Result from this aim will provide important preliminary data for use in planning a larger clinical trial.</description>
