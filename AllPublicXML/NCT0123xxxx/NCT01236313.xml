      The purpose of this study is to prospectively determine the relationship between the
      dimensions of the aorta (the large artery taking off the heart) and blood pressure during
      cardiac surgery. Measurements of the aorta are obtained by an ultrasound-based imaging
      technique called transesophageal echocardiography (TEE), which is routinely performed during
      cardiac surgery. TEE is an instrument used to monitor the heart and is standard of practice
      at Weill Cornell Medical College.
