      The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the long-term safety and tolerability of
      BIIB041 (fampridine-sustained release (SR)) treatment in Canadian participants with multiple
      sclerosis (MS) who previously participated in the registrational and extension studies
      conducted by Acorda. Those studies include NCT00654927 (MS-F202EXT), NCT00648908 (MS-F203EXT)
      and NCT00649792 (MS-F204EXT).
