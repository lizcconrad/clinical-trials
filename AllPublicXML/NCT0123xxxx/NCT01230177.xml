      This survey is conducted to investigate safety and efficacy under the post marketed drug
      utilization on the patient with rheumatoid arthritis (only for patients with an inadequate
      response to prior conventional therapy) at the time of switching regimen from 10 mg twice a
      week administration to 25 mg once a week administration.

    <description>Adverse events are defined as any unfavorable events, including clinically significant abnormal changes in laboratory test values, which develop in participants after the administration of etanercept regardless of the causal relationship to etanercept. The causal relationship between an adverse event and etanercept was evaluated by the sponsor.</description>

    <measure>Disease Activity Score of 28 Joints (DAS28: 4/Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate [ESR])</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>DAS28-4 (ESR) was calculated from SJC and TJC using 28 joints count, ESR (mm/hour) and PtGA of disease activity (participant rated arthritis activity assessment). Total score range: 0-9.4, higher score=more disease activity. DAS28-4 (ESR) &lt;= 3.2 implied low disease activity and &gt;3.2 to 5.1 implied moderate to high disease activity, and DAS28-4 (ESR) &lt;2.6 = remission.
DAS28-3 (ESR) was calculated from SJC and TJC using 28 joints count, ESR (mm/hour). Total score range: 0-9.4, higher score=more disease activity. DAS28-3 (ESR) &lt;= 3.2 implied low disease activity and &gt;3.2 to 5.1 implied moderate to high disease activity, and DAS28-3 (ESR) &lt;2.6 = remission.</description>

    <measure>Physician's Assessment of Clinical Effect of Etanercept on the Symptoms of Rheumatoid Arthritis and Change in Laboratory Values</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>On the basis of how well the clinical symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis were controlled at baseline, the physician assessed the clinical effect of etanercept in two grades: &quot;effective&quot; or &quot;ineffective&quot;. To assess the clinical efficacy of etanercept, the degrees of the symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis and laboratory test values were compared between at baseline and at the 12th week of the investigation.</description>

        <description>On the basis of how well the clinical symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis were controlled at baseline, the physician assessed the clinical effect of etanercept in two grades: &quot;effective&quot; or &quot;ineffective&quot;. To assess the clinical efficacy of etanercept, the degrees of the symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis and laboratory test values were compared between at baseline and at the 12th week of the investigation.</description>
        <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
        <population>The efficacy analysis population consisted of the participants in whom the change in DAS28 (4/ESR and 3/ESR) was calculated. No descriptive statistic on the change in DAS28 (4/ESR and 3/ESR) was calculated due to a very small number of participants (n = 3).</population>

        <description>DAS28-4 (ESR) was calculated from SJC and TJC using 28 joints count, ESR (mm/hour) and PtGA of disease activity (participant rated arthritis activity assessment). Total score range: 0-9.4, higher score=more disease activity. DAS28-4 (ESR) &lt;= 3.2 implied low disease activity and &gt;3.2 to 5.1 implied moderate to high disease activity, and DAS28-4 (ESR) &lt;2.6 = remission.
DAS28-3 (ESR) was calculated from SJC and TJC using 28 joints count, ESR (mm/hour). Total score range: 0-9.4, higher score=more disease activity. DAS28-3 (ESR) &lt;= 3.2 implied low disease activity and &gt;3.2 to 5.1 implied moderate to high disease activity, and DAS28-3 (ESR) &lt;2.6 = remission.</description>
