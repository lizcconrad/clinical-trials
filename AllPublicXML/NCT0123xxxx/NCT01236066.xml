  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to monitor the incidence rates and duration of hospitalisations for rotavirus
      gastroenteritis (RV GE) and all cause GE, compared to bronchiolitis from 1998 to 2009, in
      children &lt; 5 years of age after the introduction of Rotarix in 2006 by year, both inside and
      outside rotavirus season in Australia. It further aims to compare the two dose regimen of
      Rotarix with the three dose regimen of RotaTeq from 2007 to 2009.

    <description>Existing computerised administrative databases from the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare (AIHW) will be reviewed to retrieve data on all-cause gastroenteritis/ rotavirus enteritis and bronchiolitis hospitalisations of children &lt;5 years in all the states using Rotarix from 1998 to 2009. Data from Australian Childhood Immunisation Register (ACIR) post introduction of rotavirus vaccines in the National Immunisation Program (2007 to 2009) will also be used.</description>
