  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Women Teaching Women (WTW) is proposed by a team of Washington University investigators who
      have focused on HIV prevention efforts among out-of-treatment injecting drug users (IDUs) and
      crack cocaine users, since 1988. Our peer-delivered prevention model was successful in
      reducing cocaine use among men. The investigators believe no differences were found in drug
      and sexual risk behaviors for women because the intervention lacked gender-specificity. Thus,
      the investigators propose to tailor our previous intervention to women's needs to determine
      the shorter and intermediate term effectiveness of a gender-specific model on reducing drug
      use and sexual risks. The urgency for women-focused interventions is highlighted by
      increasing HIV/STD rates among women nationwide. The intervention is designed to bring the
      HIV prevention message to women in a public health environment. The three-arm intervention,
      which targets out-of-treatment drug-using women, will assess the differential impact of a
      woman-centered standard intervention alone, the same standard intervention plus a well-woman
      exam, and those plus the addition of 4 educational sessions. This proposal responds to two
      NIDA PAs: 95-083 (Women's HIV Risk and Protective Behaviors) and 96-018 (Drug Abuse
      Prevention Intervention for Women and Minorities). Our risk reduction, epidemiological and
      technology transfer aims include:

      Risk Reduction Aims:

        1. Recruit out-of-treatment female drug injectors, heroin, crack/cocaine and
           methamphetamine users to into an intervention aimed at reducing high risk sexual and
           drug use behaviors. Street outreach, bars and clubs, shelters, health fairs and daycare
           facilities will be used to reach these vulnerable women at risk.

        2. Administer a modified theory-based, peer-delivered, gender and culture-specific
           intervention that encourages women to reduce their high risk drug and sexual behaviors.
           Women will be randomly assigned to one of three peer-delivered interventions: a modified
           NIDA Cooperative Agreement Standard Intervention (SI), the SI + Well-Woman Exam
           (SI+WWE), or the SI+Well-Woman Exam + 4 Educational Sessions (SI+WWE+4ES). The Standard
           Intervention will be delivered by peers; the Well-Woman Examination will be conducted by
           a nurse practitioner; the four 2 hour educational sessions will be conducted by peer
           facilitators from area drug treatment programs paired with a community mental health or
           health professional.

        3. Assess the effectiveness of the interventions in reducing drug and sexual risk at 4 and
           12 months post-intervention, controlling for baseline characteristics.

        4. Evaluate the relative cost-effectiveness of each intervention.

           Epidemiologic Aim:

        5. Assess: a) incidence of HIV, Hepatitis B and C, syphilis, chlamydia and gonorrhea 12
           months post-intervention; b) change in HIV risk and drug and alcohol use at 4 and 12
           months post-intervention; c) the effect of psychopathology on behavior change at 12
           months post-intervention; d) lifetime history of substance abuse and service utilization
           for mental and physical problems at baseline.

           Technology Transfer Aim:

        6. Disseminate findings to the scientific community, practitioners and community members in
           formats that are appropriate, understandable, and usable in order that the best possible
           women-centered intervention can be developed for reducing HIV risk behaviors. The
           investigators propose to create a WebSite and present findings at local, national and
           international symposia. Manuals describing the interventions will be developed and made
           available to the field.
