  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this project is to investigate the feasibility of using a home-based,
      parent-delivered model for providing neurodevelopmental rehabilitation programmes to infants
      who have had surgery for a complex heart defect.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Neurodevelopmental deficits are a common morbidity among children who receive surgical
      treatment for complex congenital heart defects in infancy. Over 40% of children with complex
      heart defects will have neurodevelopmental deficits that persist throughout childhood even
      after a successful surgical procedure in infancy1. These deficits are typically related to
      basic motor perceptual motor or visual motor skills. Problems integrating what is seen
      (visual perceptions) with body movement (motor skills) makes it difficult for children to
      participate in peer play and limits their ability to succeed in school, thereby having a
      significant impact on the child's quality of life.

      Traditional, therapist-delivered rehabilitation programmes to address these delays in
      neurodevelopment have not previously been attempted. It would be difficult to provide direct
      rehabilitation programmes to these patients given that their defects are rare and few
      patients are located within the same geographical area. Home-based, parent-delivered
      rehabilitation programmes have previously been shown to be effective at improving the motor
      skills of school-age children with complex heart defects5. Since a home-based parent
      delivered model would enable the participation of infants regardless of geographic location,
      the feasibility of using such a model for delivering neurodevelopmental rehabilitation should
      be investigated.

    <description>Participation in the study will require the parent and child to attend two assessment visits in addition to completing a series of parent and infant activities on a daily basis throughout the 10-week intervention period. The parent-led activities will include activities such as walking with the child, stacking blocks, rolling a ball to the child, hiding a toy under a blanket for the child to find, encouraging the child to kick a rattle while the child is lying on his/her back, or crawling or rolling in different directions.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

        Families will be eligible to participate in this study if the child:

          -  Had the arterial switch operation (for transposition of the great arteries) or has had
             a Glenn procedure (for functional single ventricle).

          -  Is medically stable for normal infant activities.

          -  Is between 12 and 24 months of age in January 2010.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Families will be excluded from study participation if:

          -  The child has a recognized syndrome or other disability affecting neurodevelopment.

          -  The child has had a medical procedure in the 3 months preceding the baseline study
             assessment.

          -  The cardiologist responsible for the child's care refuses to allow the child's
             participation.

          -  The child performs substantially above age-appropriate developmental milestones during
             the initial assessment (in which case an intervention is unlikely to have a detectable
             additional benefit).
