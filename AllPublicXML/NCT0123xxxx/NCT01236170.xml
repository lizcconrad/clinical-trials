  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) provides wheelchairs to about 42,000 Veterans with
      SCI and more than 40,000 Veterans with amputated limbs (AL). Despite VA's efforts to remove
      financial and other barriers to the provision of wheelchairs to all Veterans who need them,
      preliminary evidence suggests that disparities exist in the quality of wheelchairs prescribed
      to racial minorities and low income Veterans with SCI or AL. The proposed project will
      provide important information to the VA about the quality and equity of wheelchairs provided
      to Veterans with SCI or AL, and it will identify the patient and provider factors associated
      with wheelchair provision. Because Veterans with SCI and AL are considered special disability
      populations, identifying and understanding these factors is a critical first step to
      developing interventions to increase the quality and equity of wheelchairs provided to all
      disabled Veterans.

      Wheelchairs enable Veterans to participate in home, employment, and social activities that
      might otherwise be inaccessible to them, thereby improving their quality of life (QOL).
      Despite VA's efforts to remove financial and other barriers to the provision of high quality
      wheelchairs to all Veterans, preliminary evidence suggests that disparities exist in the
      quality of wheelchairs prescribed to vulnerable (e.g., minority race/ethnicity, lower
      socioeconomic status) Veterans with Spinal Cord Injury (SCI) or amputated limbs (AL). This
      finding is concerning because patients who receive lower quality wheelchairs may be at risk
      for adverse physical, psychological, economic, and QOL outcomes. Mounting research
      demonstrates that patient psychosocial characteristics (e.g., medical mistrust, perceived
      discrimination, locus of control) and provider factors (e.g., demographics and training) are
      associated with disparities in healthcare processes and outcomes. However, for Veterans with
      SCI or AL, no studies to date have examined (a) what patient and provider factors are
      associated with the prescription of high quality wheelchairs, and (b) how these factors are
      associated with wheelchair quality and patient outcomes. The proposed cross-sectional,
      multi-site study of Veterans with SCI or AL who use a wheelchair as their primary source of
      mobility aims to determine whether: (1) patient demographic (e.g., race, SES) and
      psychosocial characteristics (e.g., medical mistrust, experience of discrimination) and
      provider factors (e.g., years of practice, certification, demographics) are associated with
      wheelchair quality; (2) wheelchair quality is associated with key patient outcomes, including
      satisfaction with medical care, QOL, amount of wheelchair activity, and participation in
      social and work-related activities; (3) patient and provider factors are independently
      associated with key patient outcomes including satisfaction with medical care, QOL, amount of
      wheelchair activity, and participation; and (4) the association of patient and provider
      factors with patient outcomes is explained by differences in wheelchair quality. Veterans
      with SCI or AL, who were prescribed their wheelchairs through the VA, will be recruited from
      the Philadelphia, PA, Cleveland, OH, Richmond, VA, and Bronx, NY VA Medical Centers to
      participate in an interview to assess their demographic characteristics, health information,
      psychosocial characteristics (including, experience of discrimination, perceived racism,
      medical mistrust, self-image, anxiety/depression, health beliefs, health literacy, and
      communication) and health-related outcomes (including wheelchair skills, satisfaction, QOL,
      participation). We will also assess amount of wheelchair activity using data logging devices,
      and determine wheelchair quality by its make and model. Data will also be collected from all
      health care providers involved in wheelchair provision for study participants.

      Provider factors will include demographics (e.g., race/ethnicity, age, gender), and specialty
      (i.e., MD/OT/PT).

      For Occupational and Physical Therapists, we will determine if they are certified by the
      Rehabilitation Engineering and Assistive Technology Society of North America. Years of
      practice since completion of medical training, number of chairs prescribed over the span of
      their career, what role each provider plays in the wheelchair provision process, as well as
      the number of continuing medical education (CME) credits and/or educational credit units
      (ECU) they have obtained in the past 3 years related specifically to wheelchairs, will also
      be assessed. Understanding the associations among the proposed patient characteristics and
      provider factors is an essential step toward developing tailored interventions, aimed at
      patients and providers, to improve the quality and equity of wheelchair service delivery for
      Veterans.

    <description>We will assess QOL with the Veterans RAND 12 Item Health Survey (VR-12)and two additional physical function items designed for patients with SCI. Eight QOL domains are assessed, including physical functioning, vitality, role limitations due to physical problems, role limitations due to emotional problems, bodily pain, general health, social functioning, and mental health. The VR-12 has been used extensively with Veterans in a variety of health domains and has shown to be reliable and valid in ambulatory care populations (Cronbach's alpha= .83-.85). The additional two items were added because previous research demonstrated that existing measures of physical function in the VR12 are not appropriate to patients with SCI and are not able to reveal differences in physical function among SCI patients. We assessed physical QOL and mental QOL, both scales range from 0 (worst possible outcome) to 100 (best possible outcome).</description>

    <measure>Satisfaction With Wheelchair Service Delivery</measure>
    <time_frame>one time use, at baseline</time_frame>
    <description>We assessed Satisfaction with Wheelchair Service Delivery using the Client Satisfaction Questionnaire (CSQ-8). The CSQ-8 is an 8-item, easily administered and scored measure of client satisfaction with services (e.g., &quot;How would you rate the quality of service you have received?&quot;). For the purpose of this study, we asked patients to focus specifically on satisfaction with service at their SCI or AL wheelchair clinic. The scale is unidimensional, yielding a homogenous estimate of general satisfaction with services. It is scored by summing the individual items and produces a score ranging from 8-32, with higher scores indicating greater satisfaction. The CSQ-8 has been extensively used in a variety of healthcare settings, operates similarly across ethnic groups, and demonstrates excellent psychometric properties (Cronbach's alpha = .83-.93).</description>

    <measure>Satisfaction With Prescribed Wheelchair</measure>
    <time_frame>one time use, at baseline</time_frame>
    <description>We assessed Satisfaction with patients' prescribe wheelchair using the Quebec User Evaluation of Satisfaction with assistive Technology ( (QUEST). We used an 8-item subset of the QUEST to assess patients' satisfaction with their wheelchair. QUEST is the first and only standardized satisfaction assessment tool that was designed specifically for assistive technology devices. Its' development was based on major theoretical models of assistive technology. The QUEST has been widely cited and used in clinical and research settings, and demonstrates strong psychometric properties (Cronbach's alpha = .82). The 8 item subset focuses specifically on patients' satisfaction with different aspects of their wheelchair (e.g., &quot;How satisfied are you with the dimensions (size, height, length, width) of your assistive device?&quot;). Responses range from 1(not satisfied at all) to 5(very satisfied). Cronbach's alpha = .80 for the 8-item wheelchair subset. We chose to eliminate the other four items</description>

    <measure>Participation in Society</measure>
    <time_frame>Measured at baseline</time_frame>
    <description>We assessed participation in society with a modified version of the Craig Handicap Assessment and Reporting Technique Short Form (CHART-SF). The CHART was designed to provide a simple measure of involvement in life situations (&quot;In a typical week, how many days do you get out of your house and go somewhere?&quot;) with sub-scales measuring physical independence, cognitive independence, mobility, occupation, social integration and economic self-sufficiency. The CHART-SF produces scores ranging from 0 (severe handicap) to 100 (no handicap) for each of the sub-scales and a total score ranging from 0-600. The CHART-SF is the most widely used participation measure in rehabilitation research. It has been used in various ethnic groups, and has well-established psychometric properties (test-retest reliability = .93; inter-rater reliability = .83). We dichotomized into &quot;Disabled&quot; and &quot;Not Disabled&quot; where disabled are those with a CHART score &lt;100, and not disabled are those with a CHART score &gt;=100</description>

        <title>Quality of Life</title>
        <description>We will assess QOL with the Veterans RAND 12 Item Health Survey (VR-12)and two additional physical function items designed for patients with SCI. Eight QOL domains are assessed, including physical functioning, vitality, role limitations due to physical problems, role limitations due to emotional problems, bodily pain, general health, social functioning, and mental health. The VR-12 has been used extensively with Veterans in a variety of health domains and has shown to be reliable and valid in ambulatory care populations (Cronbach’s alpha= .83-.85). The additional two items were added because previous research demonstrated that existing measures of physical function in the VR12 are not appropriate to patients with SCI and are not able to reveal differences in physical function among SCI patients. We assessed physical QOL and mental QOL, both scales range from 0 (worst possible outcome) to 100 (best possible outcome).</description>

        <title>Satisfaction With Wheelchair Service Delivery</title>
        <description>We assessed Satisfaction with Wheelchair Service Delivery using the Client Satisfaction Questionnaire (CSQ-8). The CSQ-8 is an 8-item, easily administered and scored measure of client satisfaction with services (e.g., “How would you rate the quality of service you have received?”). For the purpose of this study, we asked patients to focus specifically on satisfaction with service at their SCI or AL wheelchair clinic. The scale is unidimensional, yielding a homogenous estimate of general satisfaction with services. It is scored by summing the individual items and produces a score ranging from 8-32, with higher scores indicating greater satisfaction. The CSQ-8 has been extensively used in a variety of healthcare settings, operates similarly across ethnic groups, and demonstrates excellent psychometric properties (Cronbach’s alpha = .83-.93).</description>

        <title>Satisfaction With Prescribed Wheelchair</title>
        <description>We assessed Satisfaction with patients’ prescribe wheelchair using the Quebec User Evaluation of Satisfaction with assistive Technology ( (QUEST). We used an 8-item subset of the QUEST to assess patients’ satisfaction with their wheelchair. QUEST is the first and only standardized satisfaction assessment tool that was designed specifically for assistive technology devices. Its’ development was based on major theoretical models of assistive technology. The QUEST has been widely cited and used in clinical and research settings, and demonstrates strong psychometric properties (Cronbach’s alpha = .82). The 8 item subset focuses specifically on patients’ satisfaction with different aspects of their wheelchair (e.g., “How satisfied are you with the dimensions (size, height, length, width) of your assistive device?”). Responses range from 1(not satisfied at all) to 5(very satisfied). Cronbach’s alpha = .80 for the 8-item wheelchair subset. We chose to eliminate the other four items</description>

        <title>Participation in Society</title>
        <description>We assessed participation in society with a modified version of the Craig Handicap Assessment and Reporting Technique Short Form (CHART-SF). The CHART was designed to provide a simple measure of involvement in life situations (“In a typical week, how many days do you get out of your house and go somewhere?”) with sub-scales measuring physical independence, cognitive independence, mobility, occupation, social integration and economic self-sufficiency. The CHART-SF produces scores ranging from 0 (severe handicap) to 100 (no handicap) for each of the sub-scales and a total score ranging from 0-600. The CHART-SF is the most widely used participation measure in rehabilitation research. It has been used in various ethnic groups, and has well-established psychometric properties (test-retest reliability = .93; inter-rater reliability = .83). We dichotomized into &quot;Disabled&quot; and &quot;Not Disabled&quot; where disabled are those with a CHART score &lt;100, and not disabled are those with a CHART score &gt;=100</description>
