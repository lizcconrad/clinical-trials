  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether CO-1.01 is safe and effective for treating
      metastatic pancreatic cancer that did not respond to gemcitabine.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Pancreatic tumors with low hENT1 expression may show less benefit from gemcitabine compared
      with those with higher expression of this nucleoside transporter. Nonclinical studies
      indicate that CO-1.01, a gemcitabine derivative, is effective independent of such
      transporters. Thus patients with low or no meaningful expression of hENT1 who failed to
      respond to gemcitabine might derive benefit from CO1.01 before needing alternative
      (combination) chemotherapy. Furthermore, the PK profiles of CO-1.01 and gemcitabine are
      dissimilar and this may confer additional clinical benefit on CO1.01.

          1. Gemcitabine-refractory metastatic ductal adenocarcinoma of the pancreas

               -  At least 1 measurable lesion according to RECIST 1.1 criteria

               -  Computerized tomography (CT) scan ≤ 28 days prior to CO-1.01

               -  First-line treatment included at least 3 doses of gemcitabine (as monotherapy or
                  combination therapy) with the last dose administered at least 2 weeks prior to CO
                  1.01

               -  Radiological best response of disease progression after 1st-line treatment (no
