      Identification of the genetic polymorphisms that could be correlated either with a better
      clinical response or with a major predisposition of patients to develop tolerance and/or side
      effects to the treatment with morphine.

      Valuation of the rescue doses necessary to maintain NRS&lt;4 in the first 24 hours post-surgery
      in the two groups of patients, A e B. Group A: homozygous patients for the more frequent
      allele of the polymorphism A118G of OPRM1 gene (about 80%); group B: both homozygous and

    <description>The drug will be administrated by a bolus 45 minutes before the end of the surgery, with the following modalities: bolus with morphine chlorhydrate 0.15 mg/kg ± 20%. Also acetaminophene 1g and ketoprofen 160 mg (ketorolac 30mg) will be administrated during the operation.
At the exit of the operative compartment patients will have an continuous infusion for 48h with morphine chlorhydrate 0,02 mg/kg/h.
Moreover, a rescue dose therapy will be prescribed with ketoprofen 160 mg or ketorolac 30mg (in case of allergy acetaminophene 1g) if NRS&lt;4 maximum x 3 daily.
Postoperative analgesic treatment is lasting 48h for each patient (between starting of the infusion (T0) and the following 48h).</description>
