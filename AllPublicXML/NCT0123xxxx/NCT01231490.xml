  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a methodological study designed to investigate a new model for testing pain agents in
      the treatment of patients with osteoarthritis (OA). This will be a double-blind, randomised,
      placebo controlled three-way cross-over study in patients with OA of the knee.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will include an interim analysis after approximately 50 patients have been
      randomised. Up to 100 patients with painful Osteoarthritis (OA) of the knee may be recruited
      into the study. Eligible subjects will wash out of all treatments for their OA pain for a
      minimum of 7 days apart from protocol rescue medication (paracetamol). Following this,
      subjects will participate in three short term treatment periods with repeated administration
      of Naproxen (500 mg/twice daily) or placebo for 3 days. Between treatment periods subjects
      will receive placebo. Endpoints will include objective assessments of function (time to walk
      and stair climbing) and subjective assessments of pain including current pain, the Western
      Ontario and McMaster Universities Arthritis Index (WOMAC) and Patient Global Impression of
      Change. Throughout the study subjects will be asked to rate their pain periodically. Subjects
      will attend the unit on Day 1 to be dispensed with study medication and to take their first
      dose in the unit. They will then return to the unit on Days 8, 10, 15, 17, 22 and 24 for pain
      assessments, with medication dispensed at each of these visits, excluding Day 24.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. A diagnosis of OA of the knee and suitable for the study as determined by a
             responsible physician, based on a medical evaluation including medical history,
             physical examination, laboratory tests and cardiac monitoring. A subject with a
             clinical abnormality or laboratory parameters outside the reference range for the
             population being studied may be included only if the Investigator and the GSK Medical
             Monitor agree that the finding is unlikely to introduce additional risk factors and
             will not interfere with the study procedures.

          2. Male or female between 50 to 75 years of age inclusive.

          3. A female subject is eligible to participate if she is of non-childbearing potential
             defined as:

                  follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) &gt; 40 MlU/ml and estradiol &lt; 40 pg/ml (&lt;140
                  pmol/L) is confirmatory].

               -  Females with menopausal status ( &gt; 12 months of spontaneous amenorrhea) and
                  receiving hormone replacement therapy (HRT) treatment for more than 3 months.

          4. BMI within the range 15-35 kg/m2 (inclusive).

          5. Capable of giving written informed consent, which includes compliance with the
             requirements and restrictions listed in the consent form.

          6. QTcB or QTcF &lt; 450 msec; or QTc &lt; 480 msec in subjects with Bundle Branch Block.

          7. Diagnosis

               1. Have a radiological and clinical diagnosis of OA based upon Arthritis Research
                  Council (ACR) (Appendix 3) criteria affecting at least one knee of a minimum of 3
                  months in symptom duration prior to screening. An X-ray will be performed at
                  screening if required.

               2. Have symptomatic OA of at least one knee. The symptoms should be significantly
                  worse in one knee than the other if OA affects both knees.

               3. When questioned, confirm they experience moderate pain when climbing stairs.

               4. Be able to walk unaided or with the aid of one stick (2 sticks not allowed)

          8. A minimum of 4 out 10 on the NRS (numerical rating scales) at screening and/ or a
             requirement for the use of an analgesic for the pain in the OA knee for most days
             during the previous three months. In addition, baseline pain must be stable for at
             least 72 hours prior to day 1 based on patient's assessment or day 1 may be delayed.

          9. A maximum of 8 out of 10 on the NRS at screening. Enrollement may be delayed if, in
             the opinion of the investigator, the severity of pain represents an isolated incident.

         10. In good general health with (in the opinion of the investigator) no clinically
             significant and relevant abnormalities of medical history or physical examination and

               1. The subject has a positive pre-study drug/alcohol screen. A minimum list of drugs
                  that will be screened for include amphetamines, barbiturates, cocaine, opiates,
                  cannabinoids and benzodiazepines. However, a positive drug screen will not
                  automatically exclude a subject if there is a valid explanation for the positive
                  result other than drug abuse e.g. poppy seeds.

                  first dosing day.

                  to the first dose of study medication, unless in the opinion of the Investigator
                  and GSK Medical Monitor the medication will not interfere with the study
                  procedures or compromise subject safety. Please also see OA exclusion criteria
                  10.

               8. Subject with a known allergy to or judged by the investigator not to be a
                  suitable candidate for naproxen or paracetamol therapy based on medical history,
                  concomitant medications, and concurrent systemic disease as described in the
                  product labelling

               9. History or presence of gastro-intestinal, hepatic or renal disease or other
