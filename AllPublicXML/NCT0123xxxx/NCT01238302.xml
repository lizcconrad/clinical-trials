  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      -  The purpose of this study is to compare the clinical and anatomical outcomes of rotator
           cuff repair with Platelet-Rich Plasma(PRP) and conventional rotator cuff repair in
           treatment of large to massive rotator cuff tears.

        -  PRP application to arthroscopic rotator cuff repair would accelerate recovery after
           arthroscopic rotator cuff repair in terms of pain relief, functional outcomes, overall
           satisfaction, and enhance structural integrity of repaired tendon.

    <time_frame>postoperative 9months</time_frame>
    <description>To evaluate structural outcomes, magnetic resonance(MR)imaging or computed tomography arthrography were used at minimum postoperative 9months.
The structural integrity was evaluated using Sugaya's method;
type I, sufficient thickness with homogenously low intensity
type II, insufficient thickness partial high intensity
type III, insufficient thickness without discontinuity (thinned cuff)
type IV, presence of minor discontinuity
type V, presence of a major discontinuity
Type I, II, and III were considered as healed, while type IV, and V were considered as retear.</description>

    <description>Under general anesthesia, the patient was placed in the lazy lateral decubitus position on the operating table.
The surgical area was prepared and draped with Betadine.
Small stab incisions were made in the creation of 4-5 portals as needed.
A scope was explored via the arthroscopic portal into the GH joint &amp; subacromial space.
Repair of full thickness rotator cuff tear was done with suture anchors.
The skin was closed with Nylon or medical staples.
Sterile dressing was applied on surgical wound.</description>

After tying sutures of the medial row, PRP gels were applied on the repair site.
The lateral row was secured using suture anchors.
