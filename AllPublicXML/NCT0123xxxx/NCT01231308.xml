    <textblock>
      The study is aimed to compare: Laparoscopic Roux-en-Y-Gastric Bypass (RYGB) + optimal medical
      therapy versus Intensive lifestyle modification and optimal medical therapy in the treatment
      of type 2 diabetes in overweight-to-moderately obese patients (BMI: 28-34kg/m2; the lower BMI
      cut-off will be 26kg/m2 in patients of Asian descent).

      This is a single center, prospective randomized study. The study at the Weill College Medical
      College Diabetes Surgery Center. This study is intended to be a pilot investigation whose
      results can inform clinicians and researchers for future larger or multi-site trials of
      diabetes surgery. This study will also be used for the definition of a &quot;core&quot; protocol for
      independent randomized clinical trials to be carried out at various centers participating in
      a multinational consortium.

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Diagnosed with type 2 diabetes by any of the following:

               -  A fasting plasma glucose &gt; 126 mg/dl confirmed on repeated testing

               -  2 hour plasma glucose &gt; 200mg/dl during a 75 gram oral glucose tolerance test

               -  HbA1c &gt;6.5%

          2. A normal or high C-peptide level (&gt; 0.9 ng/ml) to exclude type 1 diabetes and insulin
             deficient type 2 diabetes

          3. Negative AntiGAD 65 Antibodies

          4. Body mass index (BMI) between 28 and 35 kg/m2 ( &gt; 27.6 kg/m2 and &lt; 34.5 kg/m2 ) that
             reflect a condition of overweight to moderate obesity.

             In consideration of the evidence that the associations between BMI, percentage of body
             fat, and CV risk differ across populations, and that the proportion of Asian people
             with a high risk of type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease is substantial at BMI's
             lower than the existing WHO cut-off point for overweight (= 25 kg/m2) (source: WHO
             Expert consultation. Lancet. 2004 Jan 10;363(9403):157-63), the lower BMI cut-off for
             inclusion in this study will be 26kg/m2 for patients of Asian descent.

          5. No contraindications for surgery or General Anesthesia as determined by a
             multidisciplinary team (surgeon, endocrinologist/internist, cardiologist,
             nutritionist)

          6. . Between 21 and 65 years of age

          7. . Able to provide informed consent

          8. . If a female with reproductive potential, agreement to use a reliable method of birth
             control for 2 years following surgery (Barrier, birth control, patch).

             This precaution is necessary to prevent potential complications of pregnancy due to
             possible nutritional deficiencies in the period of more intense weight loss after
             surgery. On the other hand, this precaution will avoid erratic weight/glucose
             tolerance changes of pregnancy effecting results.

          9. Have valid health insurance

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Diagnosis of diabetes more than 15 years (to exclude pts with significant decline in
             pancreatic function from long-standing diabetes)

          2. Insulin therapy for more than 12 years

          3. HbA1c higher than 10%

          4. Diagnosis of type 1 diabetes

          5. Enrolled in another clinical study which involves an investigational drug

          6. Major psychological disorders

          7. Pregnancy (all female patients will have serum beta hCG) or planned pregnancy within
             two years of entry into the study or unwilling to use reliable contraceptive method

          8. Previous gastric or esophageal surgery

          9. Immunosuppressive drugs including corticosteroids

         10. Coagulopathy (INR &gt; 1.5 or platelets &lt; 50,000/Î¼l)

         11. Anemia (Hb &lt; 10.0 g/dl)

         12. Any contraindication to laparoscopic gastric bypass or medical diabetes therapy

         13. A severe concurrent illness likely to limit life (e.g. cancer) or requiring extensive
             systemic treatment (e.g. ulcerative colitis)

         14. A significant malabsorptive or gastrointestinal disorder (e.g. pancreatic
             insufficiency, Celiac sprue, or Crohn's disease)

         15. Significant proteinuria (&gt; 250 mg/dl)

         16. Severe neuropathy or clinical diagnosis of gastropathy (early satiety, nausea,
             vomiting, constipation alternating with diarrhea)

         17. Myocardial infarction in the previous year, current angina or heart failure
