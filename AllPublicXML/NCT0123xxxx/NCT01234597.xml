      Primary Objective:

      To evaluate the effect of prandial treatment adjustment, based on continuous blood glucose
      monitoring, on glucose control in type 2 diabetes patients who are not controlled by
      treatment with once daily basal insulin or mixed insulin, requiring treatment with basal plus
      regimen

      The study duration for each patient is 24 weeks +/- 1 week broken down as follows:

        -  Run-in phase: 8 weeks

        -  Follow - up Period: 16 weeks

      The maximal possible time window during the study is +/- one week throughout the study.

Treatment phase: the patients are connected to a CGM sensor. Insulin glulisine is administered at initial dosage according to FBG measurements performed by the patient by using a glucometer. Then, adjustment of the dosage is performed by the national coordinator based on the data collected in the past previous days of CGM sensor monitoring.</description>
