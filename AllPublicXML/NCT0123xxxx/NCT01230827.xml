  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of golimumab (CNTO 148) in
      patients who have active juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) and at least 5 joints with
      active arthritis that have poor response to methotrexate.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Approximately 170 juvenile patients will take part in the study worldwide. All patients will
      receive 30mg/m2 (milligrams per meter squared, up to 50 mg per dose) of golimumab
      subcutaneously (injection under the skin) every 4 weeks from Week 0 through Week 12. At Week
      16, patients who have shown at least a 30 percent improvement in their signs and symptoms
      from when they started the study will be randomized to receive either placebo (sham medicine
      injection) or 30 mg/m2 of golimumab injections every 4 weeks from week 16 through week 48. If
      a patient gets markedly worse and is receiving placebo injections, they will be restarted on
      golimumab at the next scheduled visit and will continue on golimumab. Patients can leave the
      study at any time without question. Between the Week 48 analyses timepoint to Week 144, which
      is subsequently amended to Week 248, all patients will receive golimumab 30mg/meter squared,
      unless, by measurements, they have been nearly cured (clinical remission) by being on
      placebo, whereby they will be discontinued from the study. Patients may have a change in
      background treatment after Week 48 based on therapeutic effect. Patients will continue active
      treatment after Week 48 in a long-term extension until Week 144, which is subsequently
      amended to Week 248. All patients will receive their fixed dose of commercial methotrexate
      throughout the study duration. Safety will be monitored up to 152 week, which is subsequently
      amended to 256 weeks including drawing blood and looking at laboratory tests, vital signs
      (eg, blood pressure), and the frequency and type of adverse events (side effects).

    <description>Percentage of participants with American College of Rheumatology (ACR) Ped 30 responders at Week 16 who did not experience a flare of disease between Week 16 and Week 48 calculated as number of participants with response and who did not experience flare divided by number of participants randomized. Flare of disease was defined as the worsening from Week 16 by 30% or more in 3 of the 6 ACR Pediatric (Ped) Core Set Variables with no more than 1 of the 6 ACR Ped Core Set variables improving by more than 30% at the time of the flare. The 6 variables are: physicians global assessment of disease, participants/parent global assessment of overall well-being, number of active joints (defined as either swelling, or in absence of swelling, limited range of motion associated with pain on motion or tenderness), number of joints with limited range of motion, physical function by childhood health assessment questionnaire, and erythrocyte sedimentation rate.</description>

    <description>Percentage of participants with ACR 30 response at Week 48 was calculated as number of participants with ACR 30 response at Week 48 divided by number of participants randomized.

    <description>Clinical remission while on medication for JIA is defined as inactive disease at each visit for a period of 6 months or more while on medication. Inactive disease is indicated by the presence of all of the following: no joints with active arthritis; no fever, rash, serositis, splenomegaly, hepatomegaly, or generalized lymphadenopathy attributable to juvenile idiopathic arthritis; no active uveitis (eye disease), normal erythrocyte sedimentation rate or C-reactive protein; physician global assessment of disease activity indicating no active disease; and duration of morning stiffness less than 15 minutes.</description>

The 6 variables are: physicians global assessment of disease, participants/parent global assessment of overall well-being, number of active joints (defined as either swelling, or in absence of swelling, limited range of motion associated with pain on motion or tenderness), number of joints with limited range of motion, physical function by childhood health assessment questionnaire, and erythrocyte sedimentation rate.</description>
