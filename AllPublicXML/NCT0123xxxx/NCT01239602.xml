      Stem cell theray in old stroke patients is a study to treat stroke patients approved before
      in our hospital. We recruit these patients who received stem cell therapy and completed the
      study. We adopted movement-related cortical potential,and cortico-cortical inhibition to
      assess the stroke patients with or without stem cell therapy. Further analyzing the
      correlation of the motor related cortical potential and cortico-cortical inhibition among
      them. We wanted to find out if there are changes in cortical excitability in subjects with
      chronic stroke after stem cell therapy.
