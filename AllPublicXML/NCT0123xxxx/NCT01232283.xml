  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the effects of an experimental (being tested) study drug called
      apremilast. Apremilast works by lowering some of the chemicals that affect psoriasis and
      therefore improves the symptoms of psoriasis. The purpose of this study is to test apremilast
      and compare its effects to placebo (an inactive substance which contains no medicine but is
      in the same form as the drug). This study will test efficacy (improvement of signs and
      symptoms) and safety of apremilast in patients with moderate to severe psoriasis.

    <measure>Percentage of Participants Who Achieved at Least a 75% Improvement (Response) in the Psoriasis Area Severity Index (PASI-75) at Week 16 From Baseline</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Week 16</time_frame>
    <description>PASI-75 response is the percentage of participants who achieved at least a 75% reduction (improvement) from baseline in PASI score at week 16. The improvement in PASI score was used as a measure of efficacy. The PASI is a measure of psoriatic disease severity taking into account qualitative lesion characteristics (erythema, thickness, and scaling) and degree of skin surface area involvement on defined anatomical regions. PASI scores range from 0 to 72, with higher scores reflecting greater disease severity. Erythema, thickness, and scaling are scored on a scale of 0 (none) to 4 (very severe) on 4 anatomic regions of the body: head, trunk, upper limbs, and lower limbs. Degree of involvement on each of the 4 anatomic regions is scored on a scale of 0 (no involvement) to 6 (90% to 100% involvement). The PASI score was set to missing if any severity score or degree of involvement is missing.</description>

    <measure>Percentage of Participants Who Achieved a Static Physician Global Assessment (sPGA) Score of Clear (0) or Almost Clear (1) With at Least 2 Points Reduction From Baseline</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Week 16</time_frame>
    <description>The sPGA was a 5-point scale ranging from 0 (clear), 1 (almost clear), 2 (mild), 3 (moderate), to 4 (severe), incorporating an assessment of the severity of the three primary signs of the disease: erythema, scaling and plaque elevation. When making the assessment of overall severity, the Investigator must have factored in areas that have already been cleared (ie, have scores of 0) and not just evaluate remaining lesions for severity, ie, the severity of each sign was averaged across all areas of involvement, including cleared lesions. In the event of different severities across disease signs, the sign that is the predominant feature of the disease should be used to help determine the sPGA score.</description>

    <measure>Percent Change From Baseline in the Affected Body Surface Area (BSA) at Week 16</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 16</time_frame>
    <description>BSA was a measurement of involved skin. The overall BSA affected by psoriasis was estimated based on the palm area of the participant's hand (entire palmar surface or &quot;handprint&quot; including the fingers), which equates to approximately 1% of total body surface area.
BSA percent change from baseline (Visit 2 Week 0) was determined at each visit of the study, which is calculated as 100*(visit BSA - baseline BSA) / baseline BSA (%).</description>

    <measure>Percent Change From Baseline in the Psoriasis Area Severity Index (PASI) Score at Week 16</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 16</time_frame>
    <description>Psoriasis Area Severity Index (PASI) scores range from 0 to 72, with higher scores reflecting greater disease severity. Erythema, thickness, and scaling are scored on a scale of 0 (none) to 4 (very severe) on 4 anatomic regions of the body: head, trunk, upper limbs, and lower limbs. Degree of involvement on each of the 4 anatomic regions is scored on a scale of 0 (no involvement) to 6 (90% to 100% involvement). The total qualitative score (sum of erythema, thickness, and scaling scores) is multiplied by the degree of involvement for each anatomic region and then multiplied by a constant. These values for each anatomic region are summed to yield the PASI score. The PASI score was set to missing if any severity score or degree of involvement is missing.</description>

    <measure>Percentage of Participants Who Achieved a 50% Improvement (Response) in the PASI Score (PASI-50) at Week 16 From Baseline</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 16</time_frame>
    <description>PASI-50 response is the percentage of participants who achieved at least a 50% reduction (improvement) from baseline in PASI score at Week 16. The improvement in PASI score was used as a measure of efficacy. The PASI is a measure of psoriatic disease severity taking into account qualitative lesion characteristics (erythema, thickness, and scaling) and degree of skin surface area involvement on defined anatomical regions. PASI scores range from 0 to 72, with higher scores reflecting greater disease severity. Erythema, thickness, and scaling are scored on a scale of 0 (none) to 4 (very severe) on 4 anatomic regions of the body: head, trunk, upper limbs, and lower limbs. Degree of involvement on each of the 4 anatomic regions is scored on a scale of 0 (no involvement) to 6 (90% to 100% involvement). The PASI score was set to missing if any severity score or degree of involvement is missing.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Pruritus Visual Analog Scale (VAS) Score at Week 16</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 16</time_frame>
    <description>The Pruritus Visual Analog Scores (VAS) were used to measure the amount of itching and discomfort a participant experiences. Participant's Assessment of Pruritus (Itch) asked: On average, how much itch have you had because of your condition in the past week? All VAS values range from 0 to 100. Higher scores correspond to more severe symptom or disease. Change from baseline was calculated for the VAS scale, where change = visit value − baseline value.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) Total Score at Week 16</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 16</time_frame>
    <description>DLQI is a simple, compact, and practical questionnaire for use in a dermatology clinical setting to assess limitations related to the impact of skin disease. The instrument contains ten items dealing with the participant's skin. With the exception of Item Number 7, the participant responds on a four-point scale, ranging from &quot;Very Much&quot; (score 3) to &quot;Not at All&quot; or &quot;Not relevant&quot; (score 0). Item Number 7 is a multi-part item, the first part of which ascertains whether the participant's skin prevented them from working or studying (Yes or No, scores 3 or 0 respectively), and if &quot;No,&quot; then the subject is asked how much of a problem the skin has been at work or study over the past week, with response alternatives being &quot;A lot,&quot; &quot;A little,&quot; or &quot;Not at all&quot; (scores 2, 1, or 0 respectively). The DLQI total score was derived by summing all item scores, which has a possible range of 0 to 30, with 30 corresponding to the worst quality of life, and 0 corresponding to the best.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in the Mental Component Summary (MSC) Score of the Medical Outcome Study Short Form 36-item (SF-36) Health Survey Version 2.0 at Week 16</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Week 16</time_frame>
    <description>The SF-36 was a 36-item general health instrument and consists of 8 scales: physical function (PF), role limitations-physical (RP), vitality (VT), general health perceptions (GH), bodily pain (BP), social function (SF), role limitations-emotional (RE), and mental health (MH). Scale scores range from 0 to 100, with higher scores indicating better health. Two overall summary scores were obtained − a Physical Component Summary score (PCS) and a Mental Component Summary score (MCS).
Scores from the 8 scales, PCS and MCS were transformed to the norm-based scores using weights from U.S. general population, with 50 as the average and 10 as the standard deviation, higher scores indicating better health. For norm based scores, change from baseline were calculated for the 8 scales and the two summary scales, where change = visit value − baseline value.</description>

    <measure>Percentage of Participants Who Achieved Both a 75% Improvement (Response) in the PASI and sPGA Score of Clear (0) or Almost Clear (1) With at Least 2 Points Reduction at Week 16 From Baseline</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Week 16</time_frame>
    <description>PASI-75 response is the percentage of participants who achieved at least a 75% reduction (improvement) from baseline in PASI score at Week 16. The improvement in PASI score was used as a measure of efficacy. See Outcome measure #1 for further description.
sPGA is a 5-point scale ranging from 0 (clear), 1 (almost clear), 2 (mild), 3 (moderate), to 4 (severe), incorporating an assessment of the severity of the three primary signs of the disease: erythema, scaling and plaque elevation. See Outcome Measure #2 for further description.</description>

    <measure>Number of Participants With Treatment Emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs) in the Placebo Controlled Phase</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Week 16</time_frame>
    <description>An AE was any noxious, unintended, or untoward medical occurrence, that may appear or worsen in a participant during the course of study. It may be a new intercurrent illness, a worsening concomitant illness, an injury, or any concomitant impairment of the participant's health, including laboratory test values regardless of etiology. Any worsening (ie, any clinically significant adverse change in the frequency or intensity of a preexisting condition) was considered an AE. A serious AE (SAE) is any untoward adverse event that is fatal, life-threatening, results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity, requires or prolongs existing in-patient hospitalization, is a congenital anomaly/birth defect, or is a condition that may jeopardize the patient or may require intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above. An AE is a treatment emergent AE if the AE start date is on or after the date of the first dose of study drug and no later than 28 days after the last dose.</description>

    <measure>Number of Participants With Psoriasis Flare or Rebound in the Placebo Controlled Phase</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 0 to Week 16</time_frame>
    <description>Psoriasis flare was defined as a sudden intensification of psoriasis requiring medical intervention, or a diagnosis of new generalized erythrodermic, inflammatory, or pustular psoriasis. Rebound is defined as a severe and sudden worsening of disease that occurs after treatment has been discontinued. Note categories below. [1] Psoriasis adverse events (ie, preferred term as Guttate psoriasis, Psoriasis, Pustular psoriasis) started on or after the first dose date and on or before the last dose date within the phase. [2] Psoriasis adverse events (ie, preferred term as Guttate psoriasis, Psoriasis, Pustular psoriasis, Rebound psoriasis) started after the last dose date for participants who discontinued within the phase.

        <title>Percentage of Participants Who Achieved at Least a 75% Improvement (Response) in the Psoriasis Area Severity Index (PASI-75) at Week 16 From Baseline</title>
        <description>PASI-75 response is the percentage of participants who achieved at least a 75% reduction (improvement) from baseline in PASI score at week 16. The improvement in PASI score was used as a measure of efficacy. The PASI is a measure of psoriatic disease severity taking into account qualitative lesion characteristics (erythema, thickness, and scaling) and degree of skin surface area involvement on defined anatomical regions. PASI scores range from 0 to 72, with higher scores reflecting greater disease severity. Erythema, thickness, and scaling are scored on a scale of 0 (none) to 4 (very severe) on 4 anatomic regions of the body: head, trunk, upper limbs, and lower limbs. Degree of involvement on each of the 4 anatomic regions is scored on a scale of 0 (no involvement) to 6 (90% to 100% involvement). The PASI score was set to missing if any severity score or degree of involvement is missing.</description>

        <description>The sPGA was a 5-point scale ranging from 0 (clear), 1 (almost clear), 2 (mild), 3 (moderate), to 4 (severe), incorporating an assessment of the severity of the three primary signs of the disease: erythema, scaling and plaque elevation. When making the assessment of overall severity, the Investigator must have factored in areas that have already been cleared (ie, have scores of 0) and not just evaluate remaining lesions for severity, ie, the severity of each sign was averaged across all areas of involvement, including cleared lesions. In the event of different severities across disease signs, the sign that is the predominant feature of the disease should be used to help determine the sPGA score.</description>

        <title>Percent Change From Baseline in the Affected Body Surface Area (BSA) at Week 16</title>
        <description>BSA was a measurement of involved skin. The overall BSA affected by psoriasis was estimated based on the palm area of the participant’s hand (entire palmar surface or “handprint” including the fingers), which equates to approximately 1% of total body surface area.
BSA percent change from baseline (Visit 2 Week 0) was determined at each visit of the study, which is calculated as 100*(visit BSA – baseline BSA) / baseline BSA (%).</description>

        <title>Percent Change From Baseline in the Psoriasis Area Severity Index (PASI) Score at Week 16</title>
        <description>Psoriasis Area Severity Index (PASI) scores range from 0 to 72, with higher scores reflecting greater disease severity. Erythema, thickness, and scaling are scored on a scale of 0 (none) to 4 (very severe) on 4 anatomic regions of the body: head, trunk, upper limbs, and lower limbs. Degree of involvement on each of the 4 anatomic regions is scored on a scale of 0 (no involvement) to 6 (90% to 100% involvement). The total qualitative score (sum of erythema, thickness, and scaling scores) is multiplied by the degree of involvement for each anatomic region and then multiplied by a constant. These values for each anatomic region are summed to yield the PASI score. The PASI score was set to missing if any severity score or degree of involvement is missing.</description>

        <description>PASI-50 response is the percentage of participants who achieved at least a 50% reduction (improvement) from baseline in PASI score at Week 16. The improvement in PASI score was used as a measure of efficacy. The PASI is a measure of psoriatic disease severity taking into account qualitative lesion characteristics (erythema, thickness, and scaling) and degree of skin surface area involvement on defined anatomical regions. PASI scores range from 0 to 72, with higher scores reflecting greater disease severity. Erythema, thickness, and scaling are scored on a scale of 0 (none) to 4 (very severe) on 4 anatomic regions of the body: head, trunk, upper limbs, and lower limbs. Degree of involvement on each of the 4 anatomic regions is scored on a scale of 0 (no involvement) to 6 (90% to 100% involvement).

        <title>Change From Baseline in Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) Total Score at Week 16</title>
        <description>DLQI is a simple, compact, and practical questionnaire for use in a dermatology clinical setting to assess limitations related to the impact of skin disease. The instrument contains ten items dealing with the participant’s skin. With the exception of Item Number 7, the participant responds on a four-point scale, ranging from “Very Much” (score 3) to “Not at All” or “Not relevant” (score 0). Item Number 7 is a multi-part item, the first part of which ascertains whether the participant’s skin prevented them from working or studying (Yes or No, scores 3 or 0 respectively), and if “No,” then the subject is asked how much of a problem the skin has been at work or study over the past week, with response alternatives being “A lot,” “A little,” or “Not at all” (scores 2, 1, or 0 respectively). The DLQI total score was derived by summing all item scores, which has a possible range of 0 to 30, with 30 corresponding to the worst quality of life, and 0 corresponding to the best.</description>

        <description>The SF-36 was a 36-item general health instrument and consists of 8 scales: physical function (PF), role limitations–physical (RP), vitality (VT), general health perceptions (GH), bodily pain (BP), social function (SF), role limitations–emotional (RE), and mental health (MH). Scale scores range from 0 to 100, with higher scores indicating better health. Two overall summary scores were obtained − a Physical Component Summary score (PCS) and a Mental Component Summary score (MCS).
Scores from the 8 scales, PCS and MCS were transformed to the norm-based scores using weights from U.S. general population, with 50 as the average and 10 as the standard deviation, higher scores indicating better health. For norm based scores, change from baseline were calculated for the 8 scales and the two summary scales, where change = visit value − baseline value.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants With Treatment Emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs) in the Placebo Controlled Phase</title>
        <description>An AE was any noxious, unintended, or untoward medical occurrence, that may appear or worsen in a participant during the course of study. It may be a new intercurrent illness, a worsening concomitant illness, an injury, or any concomitant impairment of the participant's health, including laboratory test values regardless of etiology. Any worsening (ie, any clinically significant adverse change in the frequency or intensity of a preexisting condition) was considered an AE. A serious AE (SAE) is any untoward adverse event that is fatal, life-threatening, results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity, requires or prolongs existing in-patient hospitalization, is a congenital anomaly/birth defect, or is a condition that may jeopardize the patient or may require intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above. An AE is a treatment emergent AE if the AE start date is on or after the date of the first dose of study drug and no later than 28 days after the last dose.</description>

          <title>Number of Participants With Psoriasis Flare or Rebound in the Apremilast-Exposure Period</title>
          <description>Psoriasis flare was defined as a sudden intensification of psoriasis requiring medical intervention, or a diagnosis of new generalized erythrodermic, inflammatory, or pustular psoriasis. Rebound is defined as a severe and sudden worsening of disease that occurs after treatment has been discontinued. Note categories below. [1] Psoriasis adverse events (ie, preferred term as Guttate psoriasis, Psoriasis, Pustular psoriasis) started on or after the first dose date and on or before the last dose date within the phase. [2] Psoriasis adverse events (ie, preferred term as Guttate psoriasis, Psoriasis, Pustular psoriasis, Rebound psoriasis) started after the last dose date for participants who discontinued within the phase. [3] PASI &gt;= 125% of baseline score at any visit after the last dose date for participants who discontinued within the phase and were not included in [1] and/or [2].</description>
