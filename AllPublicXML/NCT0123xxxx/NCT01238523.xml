  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Tibial shaft fracture is one of the most common fractures in children and adolescents. It
      encompasses approximately 15 % of all long-bone fractures and is third behind only fractures
      of the femur and both bones of the forearm. (2). Although most authorities agree that closed
      tibial shaft fractures are best treated by immobilization in a long-leg cast, there is no
      clear consensus as to when to allow weight bearing on the injured extremity. While most
      recent articles have recommended long-leg casts with the knee bent in flexion of 30-60
      degrees to preclude weight-bearing(1,2,3,4), other authors have recommended much less
      flexion, 0-5 degrees, to encourage early weight bearing.(5).

      The purpose of this randomized controlled prospective study is to determine if the position
      of immobilization of the knee influences the rate of healing, delayed union, and nonunion As
      well, we will assess if the type of immobilization affects the function of the patient during
      the period of treatment using the Activities Scale for Kids - Performance (ASK-P) child
      self-report musculoskeletal outcome measure . A minimum of 36 patients in each group for a
      total of 72 patients between 4 and 14 years of age (open physis) with closed fractures of the
      tibia, with or without fracture of the fibula, will be included in the study

    <description>The Activities Scale for Kids (ASK) is a 30 item child self-report musculoskeletal outcome measure that focuses on the child's physical disability, and is scored with a summary score with no sub-scales. The performance format ASK-P will be used in this study. The scoring system is from 0-100 with 100 being the best possible score.</description>
