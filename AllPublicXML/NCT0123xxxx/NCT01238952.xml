  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective is to determine the maximum tolerated dose/recommended phase II dose of
      the combination regimen of NK012 and carboplatin in patients with advanced solid tumors.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      NK012 will be administered as a 30 minute IV infusion, followed by a 30 minute carboplatin IV
      infusion. Both drugs will be administered once every 28 days. Treatment is expected to
      continue for 6 cycles, unless disease progression or the development of unacceptable toxicity
      requires discontinuation of the drug. At the discretion of the investigator, patients who
      show signs of benefit may continue beyond 6 cycles.

      Once a MTD/RD has been determined, a dose expansion cohort of patients with metastatic triple
      negative breast cancer will be treated at the determined MTD.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Histologically or cytologically confirmed diagnosis of advanced solid tumor for which
             no efficacious therapy exists, or for which a camptothecin-based regimen would be
             appropriate.

          2. For the dose expansion at the MTD/RD only:

               1. Patients must have triple-negative breast cancer with locally advanced disease
                  for which there is no surgical option, or stage IV disease. Triple-negative
                  breast cancer is defined as HER2-negative, ER-negative, and PR-negative as
                  follows:

                  For HER2- negative (must meet one of the following 3):

                  ( i) FISH negative (ratio &lt;2.2); or ( ii) IHC 0 or 1+; or (iii) IHC 2+ or 3+ and
                  FISH negative (ratio &lt;2.2) For ER negative and PR negative: ≤ 10% tumor staining
                  by IHC

               2. No less than one and no more than two prior chemotherapy regimens for advanced or
                  metastatic breast cancer.

               3. Patients must have measurable disease by RECIST (version 1.1).

          3. Patients must have recovered from all acute adverse effects of prior therapies,
             excluding alopecia.

          4. For patients enrolled in the dose escalation phase, no more than 4 prior cytotoxic
             regimens in the metastatic setting.

          5. Prior irradiation to no more than 25% of the bone marrow.

          6. ECOG performance status of 0 or 1.

          7. Life expectancy of at least 12 weeks.

          8. Patients are at least 18 years of age.

          9. Adequate bone marrow function defined as ANC ≥ 1500/mm^3 and platelet count ≥
             100,000/mm^3.

         10. AST and ALT ≤ 3.0 x ULN (5X ULN if documented liver metastases) and total bilirubin ≤
             1.5 x ULN.

         11. Serum creatinine &lt; 1.5 x ULN, or creatinine clearance &gt; 60 mL/min by Cockcroft-Gault
             formula* for patients with serum creatinine &gt; 1.5x ULN.

             * Cockcroft-Gault formula for creatinine clearance (CrCl): Males: CrCl (ml/min) = (140
             - age) x wt (kg) / (serum creatinine x 72) Females: Multiply the above result by 0.85

         12. Able to understand and show willingness to sign a written informed consent document.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Prior chemotherapy, radiation therapy, or investigational therapy within 4 weeks
             (exception: 6 weeks for nitrosoureas or mitomycin C); or prior non-cytotoxic therapy
             within 5 drug half-lives (or 4 weeks, which ever is shorter); or monoclonal antibodies
             within 4 weeks prior to the first dose of study treatment.

          2. Concurrent use of another investigational agent.

          3. History of brain metastases or spinal cord compression, unless irradiated or treated a

             potential. Patients may not breast feed infants while on this study.

             definitions, history of myocardial infarction within 6 months of study entry,
             uncontrolled dysrhythmias or poorly controlled angina.

          7. History of serious ventricular arrhythmia (VT or VF, ≥ 3 beats in a row), QTc ≥ 450
             msec for men and 470 msec for women, or LVEF ≤ 40% by MUGA or ECHO.
