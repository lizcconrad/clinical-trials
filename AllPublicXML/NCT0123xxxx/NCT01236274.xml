  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A number of studies have suggested an association between the use of antipsychotic agents and
      cardiovascular mortality. However, the relationship between cardiac events and the use of
      antipsychotic drugs is not clear. Patients experiencing psychoses and in need for
      antipsychotic agents may be at a higher risk of cardiac events regardless of any effect of
      antipsychotic medication. Two studies have specifically investigated the association between
      the use of antipsychotics and the risk of cardiac events using Myocardial Infarction (MI) as
      an outcome measure, reporting no association and a positive association respectively. This
      difference in results may be explained by the use of different measures as well as study
      designs in both studies and because of different limitations with regard to controlling for
      lifestyle and medical risk factors. This study aims to assess the relationship between the
      risk of MI and recent exposure to antipsychotic agents by using the self-controlled case
      series method with which we are able to control for fixed confounders. The results of the
      self-controlled case series method will be compared to the results of a case-control study
      using the same data to compare the estimates of both methods.

      This study is part of the CALIBER (Cardiovascular disease research using linked bespoke
      studies and electronic records) programme funded over 5 years from the NIHR and Wellcome
      Trust. The central theme of the CALIBER research is linkage of the Myocardial Ischaemia
      National Audit Project (MINAP) with primary care (GPRD) and other resources. The overarching
      aim of CALIBER is to better understand the aetiology and prognosis of specific coronary
      phenotypes across a range of causal domains, particularly where electronic records provide a
      contribution beyond traditional studies. CALIBER has received both Ethics approval (ref
      09/H0810/16) and ECC approval (ref ECC 2-06(b)/2009 CALIBER dataset).

      The use of antipsychotics is associated with a rise in cardiovascular events. Previous
      studies investigating the effect of antipsychotic agents on the risk of Myocardial Infarction
      (MI) led to conflicting results with reports of either no association or a positive
      association. As patient populations for whom antipsychotic agents are indicated differ
      considerably from healthy comparison populations, confounding by indication could be
      substantial. Whilst confounding can be accounted for if known and measured, residual
      confounding remains a potential problem. This study aims to assess the relationship between
      the risk of MI and recent exposure to antipsychotic agents by using the self-controlled case
      series method with which we are able to control for fixed confounders. The results of the
      self-controlled case series method will be compared to the results of a case-control study
      using the same data to explore the role of confounding by indication.

        The study population is comprised of patients registered at those GPRD practices that
        agreed to linkage with the MINAP database, and whose practices are &quot;up to standard&quot;
        according to the GPRD criteria.

        Self-controlled Case Series:

        Patients who experienced an MI and received an antipsychotic agent during up to standard
        (UTS) follow-up in the GPRD, will be included and will act as their own control.

        Case- control Study:

        All cases of first recorded occurrence of an MI, identified by the recording of a Read code
        in the GPRD within the UTS period until December 2009 will be identified. Five controls for
        each case will be selected matched by age, gender, General Practitioner and registration in
        the GPRD on the date of MI of the case.
