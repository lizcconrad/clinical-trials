  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Recent scientific evidence suggests that the main defence cell of the body (neutrophil)
      behaves in a different manner in patients with gum diseaseÍ¾ namely how they interact with
      bacteria and their role in defence systems of the body. This study proposes to examine these
      responses in periodontitis patients and healthy controls.

      The proposed study will include patients undergoing periodontal (gum) treatment who will be
      matched to periodontally healthy controls. Blood, gingival crevicular (gum) fluid and
      clinical measures will be collected both pre- and post-therapy to measure differences in cell
      behaviour both before, and following routine therapy.

      Blood samples will be used to isolate peripheral blood neutrophils prior to analysis of their
      responses to different bacterial stimuli including oxygen radical, cytokine and extracellular
      trap release. Gingival Crevicular Fluid samples will be used to measure different biochemical
      markers that result from the production of Neutrophil Extracellular Traps (NETs). Routine
      clinical measures will be taken both pre- and post-therapy as a measure of treatment
      response.

      Patient volunteers undergoing treatment will be asked to donate a total of four small samples
      of tissue from the gums whilst they are already anaesthetised for routine treatment. These
      will be approximately the size of a needle head (2mm2mm) and used to examine NET formation
      within the tissues and related processes. This will provide novel in-vivo data regarding this
      recently discovered method of neutrophil defence in innate immunity.

      This proposal represents a novel study aimed at improving our current understanding of why
      inflammatory periodontitis develops in some patients but not others, as well as providing
      pointers to causal/noncausal relationships between periodontitis and important systemic
      conditions such as diabetes and rheumatoid arthritis.

      Ultimately, novel treatment approaches and primary prevention (for periodontitis) or
      secondary prevention (for systemic disease) strategies may emerge.

        The study population will comprise 20 competent adult volunteers (&gt;18 years old) recruited
        from patients attending for clinical examination following referral for a specialist
        opinion for periodontal disease, and will be recruited on the basis of clinical need. In
        addition, 20 periodontally-healthy controls will be recruited from staff or students of the
        School of Dentistry and Biomaterials and Birmingham Dental Hospital.
