  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Preparations that bind to nutritional fat and inhibit its absorption could be decisively
      meaningful for the regulation of bodyweight or obesity. Further, it is known that soluble
      fibres gel and swell in the stomach and thereby induce a feeling of satiety or fullness after
      eating. Such effects are supposed to facilitate adherence to energy-restricted diets. The
      medical device to be investigated contains a patented formula of fibre complex having a high
      ability to bind to dietary fat.

      Therefore, the rationale for this study is to confirm that Litramineʼs proven fat binding
      capacity to increase fat excretion and modulate the feeling of satiety will translate into
      measurable reduction in body weight. A double blind, randomized, placebocontrolled design has
      been chosen to assess the efficacy and safety of Litramine in overweight and obese subjects
      on a energy-restricted diet.
