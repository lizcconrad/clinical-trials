  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This clinical trial studies computer-guided glucose management systems in treating patients
      with hyperglycemia who have undergone blood and bone marrow transplant. A computer-guided
      glucose management system may help manage glucose levels in patients who have undergone blood
      or bone marrow transplant.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To examine the ability of computer-guided glucose management system (CGGMS) algorithms to
      control glucose within or close to current University of Washington Medical Center (UWMC)
      intensive care unit (ICU) targets (100 to 140 mg/dl) in non-critically ill bone marrow
      transplant (BMT) adult (age &gt;= 18 years) patients.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive blood glucose management with intravenous (IV) insulin using Glucommander.
