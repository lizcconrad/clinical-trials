  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Biologic samples are necessary for development and validation of laboratory procedures (e.g.
      novel biological and analytical assays, explant tissue models, validation of specimen
      collection and transport) to support future infectious disease clinical studies. In this
      research study, the investigators will collect blood samples, vaginal swabs, cervical swabs,
      mucus/vaginal discharge, cervicovaginal lavages, vaginal and cervical biopsies, as necessary,
      to use in the development of laboratory processes. The investigators will obtain the
      sample(s) from healthy HIV negative women. Samples will be collected and sent to Magee-Womens
      Research Institute as laboratory specimens are needed.

             vaginal symptoms (with the exception of vaginal dryness) on the day of genital sample
             collection.

          6. Willing and able to provide written informed consent.

          7. Willing to provide contact information for receipt of laboratory results, as
             applicable.

          4. Free from participant reports and clinician observed abnormal vaginal discharge or
             other current vaginal symptoms on the day of genital sample collection.

          5. Willing and able to provide written informed consent.

          6. Willing to provide contact information for receipt of laboratory results, as
             applicable.

          7. Participant meets requirements of specific laboratory study needs (e.g. birth control
             method and length of use)

        Exclusion Criteria:
