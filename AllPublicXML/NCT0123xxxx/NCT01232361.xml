      The main purpose of this study is to find out how stimulant medications (methylphenidate or
      amphetamine/ dextroamphetamine) for the treatment of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder
      (ADHD)are processed in HIV-1 infected and HIV-uninfected children and adolescents.

      P1080 is a pilot population pharmacokinetic study of HIV-1 infected and uninfected children
      and adolescents who are taking methylphenidate or amphetamine/ dextroamphetamine for the
      treatment of ADHD. Prescribing various psychiatric medications in combination with
      antiretroviral regimens is a standard clinical practice occurring without adequate evidence
      regarding benefits and risks. The goals of this study are to determine plasma concentrations
      of psychiatric and antiretroviral medications in children and adolescents. Psychiatric
      medication dose requirement and exposure in HIV-1 infected subjects will be compared to that
      seen in uninfected children and adolescents, and antiretroviral exposure will be compared to
      published studies in children and adolescents.

             uninterrupted psychiatric and antiretroviral medication delivery.

          -  Parent/primary caregiver, subjects &gt;18 years or emancipated minors must be able and
             willing to provide signed informed consent. Assent of the minor subject should be
             obtained where required per site procedures and IRB recommendations.

          -  Female subjects of reproductive potential (having reached menses, or not having
             reached menopause or not having undergone hysterectomy, bilateral oophorectomy, or
             tubal ligation) who engage in sexual activity that could lead to pregnancy must agree
             to avoid pregnancy during the entire trial and to consistently and appropriately use
             at least two of the following contraception methods: condoms, diaphragm or cervical
             cap with spermicide, IUD, hormonal-based contraception. A list of acceptable methods

                  reached menarche or women who have not been post-menopausal for at least 24
                  consecutive months (e.g. who have had menses within the preceding 24 months), or
                  have not undergone a sterilization procedure (hysterectomy, bilateral
                  oophorectomy or salpingotomy). If the female subject is not of reproductive

                  one obtained at age ≥1 month and one at ≥4 months, or two negative HIV-1 antibody
                  tests from separate specimens obtained at age ≥6 months. Per current CDC
                  guidelines, uninfected subjects ≥13 years will be screened for HIV-1. A
                  documented negative HIV-1 antibody screening test or negative HIV-1 RNA or DNA
                  PCR within the past year will be accepted to fulfill this criterion.

             uninterrupted psychiatric medication delivery.

          -  Parent/primary caregiver, subjects &gt;18 years or emancipated minors must be able and
             willing to provide signed informed consent. Assent of the minor subject should be
             obtained where required per site procedures and IRB recommendations.

          -  Female subjects of child bearing potential (having reached menses, or not having
             reached menopause or not having undergone hysterectomy, bilateral oophorectomy, or
             tubal ligation) who engage in sexual activity that could lead to pregnancy must agree

               -  Note: &quot;Female subjects of child bearing potential&quot; is defined as girls who have
                  reached menarche or women who have not been post-menopausal for at least 24
                  consecutive months (e.g. who have had menses within the preceding 24 months), or
                  have not undergone a sterilization procedure (hysterectomy, bilateral
                  oophorectomy or salpingotomy). If the female subject is not of child bearing
