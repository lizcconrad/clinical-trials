    <textblock>
      This is a single center, 3 arms, prospective randomized controlled open study to determine
      the impact of luteal phase support on pregnancy rates in ovarian stimulation and IUI cycles
      with recombinant FSH in patients with unexplained infertility and mild male factor.

      Patients will be randomized into 3 groups:

        1. Luteal support with progesterone only (they will received vaginal P gel (Crinone 8%
           vaginal gel; Serono, Israel)

        2. Luteal support with estrogen + progesterone [(Crinone 8% vaginal gel; Serono, Israel)
           and Estrofem 4mg].

        3. No luteal support

      Study design:

      single center, 3 arms, prospective randomized controlled open study

      Objective:

      to determine the impact of luteal phase support on pregnancy rates in ovarian stimulation and
      IUI cycles with recombinant FSH in patients with unexplained infertility and mild male
      factor.

      Methods:

      All patients in all study groups will undergo a single insemination procedure and then will
      be randomized into 3 groups:

        1. Luteal support with progesterone only (they will received vaginal P gel (Crinone 8%
           vaginal gel; Serono, Israel)

        2. Luteal support with estrogen + progesterone [(Crinone 8% vaginal gel; Serono, Israel)
           and Estrofem 4mg].

        3. No luteal support

      Luteal support will begin after insemination and will be continued through the 12th week of
      gestation if the patient conceived. A pregnancy test will be performed 2 weeks after
      insemination (Serum hCG) an intrauterine pregnancy will be confirmed using a transvaginal
      ultrasound 2 weeks after a positive pregnancy test. If no pregnancy will be achieved patients
      will undergo 3 treatment cycles preferably in the same treatment group.
