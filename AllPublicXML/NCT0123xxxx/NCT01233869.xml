    <textblock>
      This purpose of this study is to determine if bosutinib reduces the rate of kidney
      enlargement in subjects with autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) entering
      the study with a total kidney volume greater than or equal to 750 cc and eGFR greater than or
      equal to 60 mL/min/1.73m2.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline (CFB) in Total Kidney Volume (TKV) at Month 25</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Month 25 (end of Initial Treatment Period Visit [ITPV])</time_frame>
    <description>TKV was measured by centrally evaluated Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in Estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate (eGFR) at Months 12, 24, 25 and Early Termination</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Month 12, Month 24, Month 25 (end of ITPV), and early termination</time_frame>
    <description>eGFR was centrally evaluated. Glomerular filtration rate (GFR) is an index of kidney function that describes the flow of filtered fluid through the kidney. The Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration (CKD-EPI) equation was used to calculate eGFR. Month 25 is the end of the ITPV.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Time to First Occurrence or Worsening of Hypertension</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline up to Month 25 (end of ITPV)</time_frame>
    <description>The time to first occurrence or worsening of hypertension was observed (defined as the need for increased dose of or need for additional anti-hypertensive medication). The numbers presented correspond to the very first occurrence or worsening of hypertension in that treatment group.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Time to First Occurrence or Worsening of Back and/or Flank Pain</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline up to Month 25 (end of ITPV)</time_frame>
    <description>The time to first occurrence or worsening of back and/or flank pain was observed (defined as initial onset of polycystic kidney disease [PKD]-related chronic back and/or flank pain; initiation of pain medication treatment for PKD-related chronic back and/or flank pain; addition of a pain medicine for treatment of PKD-related chronic back and/or flank pain; increase in dose of pain medication for treatment of PKD-related chronic back and/or flank pain). The numbers presented correspond to the very first occurrence or worsening of back and/or flank pain in that treatment group.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Time to First Occurrence of Gross Hematuria</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline up to Month 25 (end of ITPV)</time_frame>

  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Time to First Occurrence of Proteinuria</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline up to Month 25 (end of ITPV)</time_frame>
    <description>Proteinuria is the presence of an excess of serum proteins in the urine, which may be an early sign of kidney disease. The numbers presented correspond to the very first occurrence of proteinuria in that treatment group.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Time to First Occurrence of End-Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) Requiring Dialysis &gt;=56 Days</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline up to Month 25 (end of ITPV)</time_frame>
    <description>ESRD is when the kidneys permanently fail to work at a level needed for daily life. No participants developed ESRD during the treatment period, therefore the analysis of the onset of ESRD requiring ≥56 days of dialysis was not performed.</description>

    <time_frame>Day 15, Months 6, 12, 18, 24, and 25 (end of ITPV)</time_frame>
    <description>A BUN test can reveal how well the kidneys are working by measuring the amount of urea nitrogen in the blood. A high BUN level (&gt;1.3 times the upper limit of normal) may suggest that the kidneys are not working properly. Month 25 is the end of the ITPV.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants With High Serum Creatinine (SCr) Levels</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 15, Months 6, 12, 18, 24, and 25 (end of ITPV)</time_frame>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in Kidney Disease Quality of Life (KDQoL)-36 Scale Scores at Month 25</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and end of ITPV (Month 25)</time_frame>
    <description>The KDQoL-36 is a 36-item questionnaire on kidney disease-specific measure of patient-reported quality of life with 5 subscales: physical and mental functioning (items 1-12); burden of kidney disease subscale (items 13-16); symptoms and problems (items 17-28); effects of kidney disease on daily life subscale (items 29-36). The raw scores are transformed linearly to a range of 0 to 100, with higher scores indicating better quality of life.</description>

          <description>The time to first occurrence or worsening of back and/or flank pain was observed (defined as initial onset of polycystic kidney disease [PKD]-related chronic back and/or flank pain; initiation of pain medication treatment for PKD-related chronic back and/or flank pain; addition of a pain medicine for treatment of PKD-related chronic back and/or flank pain; increase in dose of pain medication for treatment of PKD-related chronic back and/or flank pain). The numbers presented correspond to the very first occurrence or worsening of back and/or flank pain in that treatment group.</description>
