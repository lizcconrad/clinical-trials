  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      With the aging of the Canadian population, older workers are accounting for more and more of
      the working-age population. Despite recent interest in cognitive training, there are
      currently no validated programs that specifically target individuals in the work force. The
      investigators will conduct a small-scale randomized controlled trial to test the
      effectiveness of the previously developed Memory at Work program. The investigators will
      recruit 60 individuals and randomly assign them to the active intervention or a control
      intervention. The investigators will examine outcomes related to knowledge, behavioral
      change, self-efficacy, objective memory, and workplace productivity. The investigators expect
      larger improvements on these measures in the active relative to the control group.

      This is a pre-test/post-test randomized controlled trial. Participants who meet eligibility
      criteria will undergo baseline testing that involves completing questionnaires and objective
      cognitive tests. Participants will then be randomly assigned (by coin toss) to the
      intervention or control group. After participating in their respective workshops, both groups
      will undergo immediate post-testing and 1-month follow-up post testing. After the final
      assessment, the control group will be given the opportunity to participate in the
      intervention workshop. No further testing of this group will occur, as there will no longer
      be a comparable control group.

    <description>The Memory at Work program is a 4-hour classroom-based workshop that is led by a professional trainer. The format of the program is experiential, with a heavy focus on discussion, self-discovery, and hands-on use of trained skills. Specific memory compensation techniques are trained. Training consists of an explanation of each technique (i.e., how and when to use it, the science behind the technique) and ample opportunities for hands-on use of the strategies.</description>

    <description>The control workshop consists of a 4-hour program that will train techniques for successfully completing Sudoku, word, and logic puzzles. Like the experimental intervention, the control workshop will be engaging and challenging, and will involve a combination of individual and group activities.</description>
