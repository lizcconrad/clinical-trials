  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the potential effectiveness of a psychosocial
      intervention based on the principles of motivational interviewing. The novel intervention
      will assist living donor candidates to think through any remaining concerns or questions that
      they may have about living donation. If the intervention is effective, it may help to prevent
      post-donation problems related to psychological and health outcomes.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The protection of living donors' well-being and the prevention of any negative consequences
      of donation are among the foremost priorities in transplantation. Some donors experience poor
      psychosocial outcomes after donation, including psychological distress, poor perceived
      physical well-being, and strained family relationships. No preventive interventions have been
      mounted or tested for their ability to avert poor psychosocial outcomes in living donors. The
      present study will provide an initial test of a new intervention for this purpose. The new
      intervention utilizes motivational interviewing (MI) to address remaining concerns that
      individuals may have about proceeding with living donation. Study participants will be
      randomly assigned to either (a) participate in the MI intervention (during which they will be
      asked to answer a series of questions to help them better delineate their reasons for and
      against proceeding with living organ donation), (b) participate in a comparison intervention
      designed to inform them about healthy lifestyle habits, or (c) not receive any intervention.
      We plan to recruit a maximum of 150 adults who are considering whether to serve as living
      kidney or liver donors. We hypothesize that participants receiving the MI intervention will
      have superior outcomes (less psychological distress, fewer physical health complaints, better
      interpersonal relationships within their family, better overall quality of life)after
      donation.
