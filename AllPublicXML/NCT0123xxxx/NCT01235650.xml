  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a retrospective chart review of patients undergoing spinal fusion surgery to see the
      prevalence of hyperventilation.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Retrospective review of the operative schedules to identify patients who have undergone
      spinal fusion with placement of an arterial cannula for intermittent arterial blood gas
      analysis. The intraoperative records will be retrospectively reviewed. The following
      demographic data will be recorded: age, weight, gender, and co-morbid medical conditions.
      Ventilatory parameters at the time of ABG analysis will include (respiratory rate and tidal
      volume). ABG data will be collected.
