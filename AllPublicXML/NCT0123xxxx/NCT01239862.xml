      The aim of this study was to analyze the safety, pulmonary function, and quality of life data
      of patients with silicosis treated with intrabronchial instillation of bone marrow derived
      mononuclear cells (BMDMC, 2x107) through bronchoscopy.

      This study will perfume the safety (Phase I) study of 10 patients with silicosis treated with
      intrabronchial instillation of autologous bone marrow derived mononuclear cells (BMDMC,
      2x107) through bronchoscopy. The inclusion criteria is: age between 18-50, chronic and
      accelerated silicosis, characterized with a fibrotic increase in the last two years, FEV1
      &lt;60% and &gt; 40%, FVC &gt; 60% and SaO2 &gt;90%, while the exclusion criteria were: smoking, active
      tuberculosis or other infections, cancer, auto-immune disorders, hematological, hepatic or
      cardiac diseases, and pregnancy. All patients will be subjected to clinical examination,
      answered questionnaires of quality of life (SGRQ and SF36) and dyspnea score (Borg),
      performed high resolution CT of thorax, pulmonary function tests with DLCO and 6-minute walk
      test and lung perfusion scintigraphy before and 7, 30, 60, 180 and 360 days after treatment.

      For each patient, 2×107 cells will be labeled with 99mTc. Briefly, 500 μl of sterile SnCl2
      solution is added to the cells and the mixture is incubated at room temperature for 10 min.
      Forty-five mCi of 99mTc is then added and incubation continued for another 10 min. After
      centrifugation (500×g for 5 min), the supernatant is removed and the cells are washed in
      saline solution. The pellet was also resuspended in saline solution. Viability of the labeled
      cells was assessed by the trypan blue exclusion test, and was estimated to be greater than
      93% in all cases. Labeling efficiency (%) was calculated by the activity in the pellet
      divided by the sum of the radioactivity in the pellet plus supernatant and was estimated to
      be greater than 90% in all cases. Whole body and planar scans will be performed 2 and 24h
      after instillation. Perfusion scintigraphy will be performed before and 30, 60, 120 and 180
      days after BMDMC therapy. For regional analysis the right and left lungs will be divided into
      three zones: base, midzone, and apex.

    <description>We conducted a prospective, non-randomized, single-center longitudinal study in five patients. Inclusion criteria were age 18−50 years, chronic and accelerated silicosis, forced expiratory volume in 1s &lt;60% and &gt;40%, forced vital capacity ≥60% and arterial oxygen saturation &gt;90%. BMDMCs were administered through bronchoscopy (2×107 cells) into both lungs. Physical examination, laboratory evaluations, quality of life questionnaires, thoracic computed tomography scans, lung function tests, and perfusion scintigraphy were performed before the beginning of treatment and up to 360 days after BMDMC (Bone Marrow Derived Mononuclear Cells) therapy. Additionally, whole-body and planar scans were evaluated 2 and 24 h after instillation.</description>
