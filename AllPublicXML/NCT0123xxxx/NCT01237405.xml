      The purpose of this study is to evaluate 99mTc - EC20 imaging (FolateScan), a Nuclear
      Medicine imaging technology that enables localization of activated macrophages in the joints
      of participants with knee osteoarthritis (OA). Twenty five participants with symptomatic
      unilateral or bilateral knee OA will undergo a one-time evaluation of the knee as follows:
      knee radiography, FolateScan of the knees and whole body, musculoskeletal exam,
      questionnaires, sampling of blood, urine and synovial fluid for analysis of inflammatory
      markers. Data analysis will be cross-sectional and include a comparison of the location and
      intensity of EC20 uptake with the following: radiographic knee OA severity, clinical measures
      of disease severity, cytokine expression, and synovial fluid cell count.

    <description>Unilateral or bilateral knee osteoarthritis on radiograph associated with knee pain on most days of any one-month in the last year in at least one knee.
Study participants underwent a one-time evaluation by FolateScan which entailed a single intravenous injection of 99mTc-EC20 (total volume of 1.0 to 2.0 ml administered over a period of 30 seconds with radioactive dose between 20 and 25 mCi).</description>

A total of three imaging scans were acquired: an early phase (at ~1 minute) SPECT/CT of both knees; a late phase (at ~60 minutes) SPECT/CT image of both knees; and a late phase (at ~80 minutes) planar image of the whole body was performed (anterior-posterior, and postero-anterior).</description>
