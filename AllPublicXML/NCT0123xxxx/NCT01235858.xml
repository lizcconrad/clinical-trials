  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is an increasing trend in the incidence of infection related to epidural anesthesia.
      This could be related to methods of aseptic technique as adopted by the anesthesiologist
      during the performance of the procedure.

      The purpose of this study is to compare two methods of aseptic technique for labor epidural
      insertion; a &quot;conventional&quot; method without wearing a sterile gown (free from living germs or
      microorganisms) versus strict aseptic method with wearing of sterile gowns.

      It is our belief that there will be an increased contamination of epidural equipment and
      colonization of epidural catheter, secondary to bacterial fallout from the operators' bare
      hands in the group not wearing the sterile gowns.

    <textblock>
      At the present time there is no accepted standard for aseptic technique during insertion of
      an epidural catheter on the labor floor and what is considered to be essential is
      controversial. Recognizing this, the American Society of Regional Anesthesia (ASRA), the
      leading authority on regional anesthesia, established a task force to examine and establish
      guidelines for aseptic practice. Their findings highlighted the lack of good quality studies
      to support specific recommendations. This is especially true in regards to the use of sterile
      gowns during the performance of the procedure.
