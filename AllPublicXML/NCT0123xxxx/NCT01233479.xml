      RATIONALE: Studying samples of blood in the laboratory from patients receiving radiation
      therapy and chemotherapy may help doctors learn more about the effects of this treatment on
      cells. It may also help doctors understand how well patients respond to treatment.

      PURPOSE: This research study is studying biomarkers in blood samples from young patients with
      newly diagnosed brain tumors undergoing standard radiation therapy and chemotherapy.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Evaluate the fraction of peripherally circulating T-regulatory cells (T_regs) in
           pediatric patients with newly diagnosed medulloblastoma and compare it to the levels
           found in a control group of patients undergoing craniectomy for Chiari malformation.

        -  Evaluate the longitudinal effects of standard radiotherapy and chemotherapy regimens on
           the overall population of lymphocytes as well as the fraction of T_reg cells in patients
           with medulloblastoma.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the baseline fraction of T_reg cells in those with non-medulloblastoma
           posterior fossa tumors compared to levels found in patients undergoing decompression for
           Chiari malformation.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients with Chiari malformation and patients with posterior fossa tumor undergo standard
      surgery. Patients with posterior fossa tumor also receive standard radiotherapy and
      chemotherapy.

      Blood samples are collected at baseline and periodically to measure the level of circulating
      T-regulatory cells.
