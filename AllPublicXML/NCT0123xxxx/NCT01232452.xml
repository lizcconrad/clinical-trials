    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this study is to evaluate the hypothesis that cixutumumab given in
      combination with cisplatin and pemetrexed is superior to cisplatin and pemetrexed as
      first-line therapy for patients with advanced nonsquamous non-small cell lung carcinoma
      (NSCLC).
