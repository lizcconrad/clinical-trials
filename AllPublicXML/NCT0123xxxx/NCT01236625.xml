      Official title:

      LAPAD - A prospective study on the effect of adhesiolysis during elective laparotomy or
      laparoscopy on per- and postoperative complication, quality of life and socioeconomic costs

      Background:

      With improved surgical technology and ageing of the population the number of reoperations in
      the abdomen dramatically increases. The risk for a repeat laparotomy or laparoscopy is a high
      as 30% in the first ten years after a laparotomy. In over 95% of reoperations adhesiolysis is
      required to gain access to the abdominal cavity and operation area. Adhesiolysis
      significantly increases the risk for inadvertent organ damage, such as enterotomies, leading
      to higher morbidity, mortality and socioeconomic costs.

      Purpose:

      To define the impact of adhesiolysis on per- and postoperative complications, quality of life
      and socioeconomic costs.

      Design:

      Prospective observational study.

      Primary outcomes:

        -  adhesiolysis time

        -  inadvertent enterotomy

        -  seromuscular injury

        -  miscellaneous organ damage

        -  Serious adverse events of operation (anastomotic leakage, delayed diagnosed perforation,
           wound infection, abdominal infection, haemorrhage, pneumonia, urinary tract infection,
           abscess, fistula, sepsis, death)

      Secondary outcomes:

        -  Hospital stay

        -  Intensive care admission

        -  Reinterventions

        -  In-hospital costs

        -  Parenteral feeding

        -  Short term readmissions (30 days)

        -  Quality of life (Gastro- intestinal tract complaints, Short Form- 36(SF-36), DASI (Duke
           Activity Score Index(DASI) )
