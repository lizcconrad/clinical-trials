  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      CRP and PCT are not valid parameters of early infection in particularly postoperative
      patients. (Sanders et al., A&amp;A, June 2006, Vol.102; Katja et al., Shock, February 2001, Vol
      15.2) Better detection systems for SIRS and sepsis are urgently required.

      ICIS速 (Sysmex intensive care infection score) and ICPS速 (Sysmex intensive care prognostic
      score) are two new score-systems depending on detectable cellular response of the innate
      immune system in human peripheral blood.

      The purpose of this observational study is to determine if these scores are superior in early
      differentiation between non-infectious SIRS and infectious SIRS (sepsis) in postoperative
      patients. Furthermore, the applicability of the scores for triggering start and ending of
      anti-infective therapy will be examined.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>The primary objective of this study performed according to an observational post-ad-hoc design is to show that the two Sysmex infection scores provide a better performance than CRP &amp; PCT for infection processes thus providing an efficient alternative.</measure>
    <time_frame>a period of 60 days</time_frame>
    <description>Approximately 200 patients will be enrolled in the study. They are followed up until the end of ICU stay or, for a maximum of 60 days. Usually in clinical routine, patients suspected to have an infection process, receive once per day a &quot;full infectiology profile&quot;. It consists of CRP, PCT and the Sysmex infection profiles (ICIS/ICPS).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The second objective is to investigate whether ICIS速 and ICPS速 could assist in faster antiinfective regim decisions than CRP &amp; PCT.</measure>
