      The scientific approach behind this study is to develop novel anti-cancer therapeutic vaccine
      to induce a robust cellular immune response mediated via both CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphocytes
      populations and can be be applicable to the majority of the target population.

    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Determine the safety and initial feasibility of intradermal or subcutaneous administration of the ImMucin peptide combined with hGM-CSF for maximal stimulation of T cell response.
The patients will receive six or twelve biweekly injections of Imucin (3 or 6 months). Post Treatment visit will be performed 4 weeks after administration of last vaccination. FU telephone calls will be made up to 6 months following the last vaccination in order to assess the status of the disease.</description>

    <description>Six biweekly Intradermal or subcutaneous injections of 100 micrograms ImMucin
After six injections, if response will not be observed, or if response will not be sufficient, Immucin dose will be escalated to 250 micrograms for six additional injections.
In addition, each immunization, hGM-CSF with a total dose of 250 microgram will be injected.</description>

    <criteria>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. All* patients must have a histological or cytological diagnosis of metastatic disease
             or hematological malignancies expressing the MUC1. Patients must have metastatic
             disease, and have failed at least one regimen of standard based chemotherapy for
             metastatic disease as indicated in the following table. Patients must have disease
             considered to be incurable by surgical or radiological intervention.

          2. Patients must be &gt; 18 years of age, consenting to participate in the study.

          3. Patients must have at least one site of measurable tumor or measurable tumor marker.

          4. Radiological and other relevant imaging studies, such as CT scans, must be performed
             within 4 weeks of the first treatment as a baseline to document extent of disease.

          5. Patients should be at least 4 weeks beyond any major surgery or chemoradiotherapy and
             have recovered from drug induced toxicity.

          6. Patients must have a performance status of 70% or greater on the Karnofsky scale (ECOG
             0-2) and a minimal life expectancy of 12 months.

          7. Patients must sign an informed consent, and be mentally responsible.

               -  In Multiple Myeloma, MUC1 expression will be tested after confirming that all
                  inclusion/exclusion criteria are met and within the screening period.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients not fulfilling the above criteria.

          2. Patients with a significant concurrent medical complication that in the judgment of
             the Principal Investigator could affect the patient's ability to tolerate or complete
             this study.

          3. Patients receiving any immunosuppressive treatment that could negate development of an
             effective immune response to the vaccine. (First vaccination should be at least 30
             days from end of immunosuppressive treatment)

          4. Subjects with prior irradiation to a field that includes more than 25% of their lymph
             nodes and bone marrow likely to be immunosuppressed will be excluded. However,
             patients who had standard pelvic field radiation as adjuvant therapy for rectal cancer
             are not excluded.

          5. Pregnant and breast feeding women will be excluded. Premenopausal women who are not
             practicing or willing to practice adequate birth control methods for a period of 3
             months after treatment will be excluded.

          6. Patients with brain metastasis.

          7. Patients with active infection.

          8. Patients with HIV HBSAg and HCV positive.
