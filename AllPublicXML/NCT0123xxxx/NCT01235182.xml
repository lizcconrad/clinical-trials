    <textblock>
      Acute heart failure is one of the main causes of acute respiratory distres in prehospital
      emergency setting. The early and correct diagnosis is important because the misdiagnosis can
      result in deleterious consequeance to patients. Rapid bedside tests (like NT-proBNP) and
      point-of-care lung ultrasound could be useful methods in field. This study confirmed that the
      combination of ultrasound sign in combination with rapid NT-proBNP test has a hibh diagnostic
      accuracy in differentiating between cardiac and pulmonray causes of acute dyspnea in the
      field and the tretament possibilities in clinical obscure cases are mainly improved.

        All patients with acute dyspnea in the time o the investigation in the field-prehospital
        settingInclusion criterion for the study was shortness of breath as the primary complaint
        (defined as either the sudden onset of dyspnea without history of chronic dyspnea or an
        increase in the severity of chronic dyspnea). Exclusion criteria were age &lt;18 years,
        history of renal insufficiency, trauma, severe coronary ischemia (unless patient's
        predominant presentation was dyspnea), and other causes of dyspnea: pneumonia, pulmonary
        embolism, carcinoma, pneumothorax, pleural effusion, intoxications (drugs), anaphylactic
        reactions, upper airway obstruction, bronchial stenosis, and gastroesophageal reflux
        disorder, according to the history, clinical status, and additional laboratory tests
        available in prehospital setting (D-dimer, troponin, C-reactive protein)
