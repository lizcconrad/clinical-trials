      Arrhythmia is a common disease that may be caused by various cardiovascular diseases.
      According to statistics, 500,000 people die of severe arrhythmia every year in China, In the
      United States, approximately 540,000 patients die each year.This study will evaluate the
      effectiveness safety of sulcardine sulfate tablets in the patients with premature ventricular
      contractions (and non-sustained VT).

      Arrhythmia is a common disease that may be caused by various cardiovascular diseases. The
      incident rate of various types of arrhythmias may be as high as 86-100% in patients who
      experience acute myocardial infarction within 10 days. Serious arrhythmias can endanger lives
      instantly. According to statistics, 500,000 people die of severe arrhythmia every year in
      China, which constitutes approximately 50% of the death rate for cardiovascular diseases. In
      the United States, among 1,500,000 myocardial infarction patients, approximately 540,000
      patients die each year, which is mainly caused by ventricular fibrillation (VF) and sudden
      cardiac death (SCD).

      Initially at least 24 subjects who meet the inclusion criteria and do not meet the exclusion
      criteria will be enrolled into either of two dose levels under a 3:1 randomization
      (active:placebo) take sulcardine sulfate tablets.Dose levels may be dropped, an intermediate
      dose level added as needed to deemed appropriate following review of safety and tolerability
      data at the prior dose level(200mg,400mg). A safety review committee will review data from
      all enrolled subjects at the simultaneous completion of Dosing Cohort 1 and 2 prior to
      advancement to the final dose level (800mg BID).
