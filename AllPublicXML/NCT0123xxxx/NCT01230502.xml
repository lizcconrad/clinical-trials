  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To determine whether long-term maintenance therapy with a single drug (Myfortic) applied
      using advanced immunologic monitoring tools in selected patients can lead to superior native
      kidney function at 2 years without resulting in increased acute rejection episodes or
      deterioration of liver allograft function.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The hypothesis to be tested is that donor-microchimerism in specific cell populations
      promotes the development of donor-specific regulation which in turn allows for long-term
      maintenance therapy with a single drug (Myfortic) in selected patients leading to superior
      long-term outcomes. Subjects will be enrolled post-transplantation and will be liver
      transplant recipients who meet the eligibility and exclusion criteria. We will use
      post-transplant monitoring for donor-specific immunologic regulation (DSR+/ DSA negative) to
      direct the withdrawal of patients to Myfortic monotherapy. Donor microchimerism, DSR, DSA
      development will be performed on samples obtained every six months from patients on study.
      The ultimate objective of the study is to use immunologic monitoring to develop a rational
      approach to achieving individualized immunosuppression for liver transplant patients.

        <title>Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) Estimation of Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR)</title>
        <description>This outcome measure is used to determine if the reduction of calcineurin inhibitor immunosuppression leads to improved native kidney function. Native kidney function is assessed using the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) estimation of glomerular filtration rate (GFR) from serum or plasma creatinine samples at the reported time points.
Reference intervals include:
Healthy 18 years and up: 60-120 mL/min/1.73 sqm Chronic kidney disease: GFR &lt; 60 mL/min/1.73 sqm Kidney failure: GFR &lt; 15 mL/min/1.73 sqm</description>

These subjects will be maintained on standard of care immunosuppression consisting of tacrolimus and mycophenolate sodium (MPS) with no reduction in tacrolimus dose during the 24 months of study enrollment.
