      ejaculation.

    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, open-label (patients and Investigators will know the name of the drug
      that they are receiving) study to evaluate the long-term safety and efficacy of dapoxetine
      therapy in adult men with premature (rapid) ejaculation (PE) who participated in 1 of 2
      previous studies of dapoxetine ( ALZA Protocol C-2002-012 or C-2002-013). The length of the
      study will be up to 9 months. During the study, patients will be monitored for safety by
      review of adverse events and findings from routine laboratory tests, vital signs
      measurements, electrocardiograms (ECGs), and physical examinations. Oral tablets of
      dapoxetine (30 mg or 60 mg) will be self-administered by patients once daily, as needed, for
      up to 9 months. No more than 1 dose within a 24-hour period should be taken. If the 60 mg
      dose of dapoxetine is not well tolerated, the dose may be decreased to 30 mg dapoxetine for
      the remainder of the study. Patients who do not tolerate the 30 mg dose of dapoxetine should
      be discontinued from the study.
