  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Nimotuzumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody against epidermal growth factor receptor
      (EGFR). Clinical trials are ongoing globally to evaluate Nimotuzumab in different
      indications. Nimotuzumab has been approved to treat squamous cell carcinoma of head and neck
      (SCCHN), glioma and nasopharyngeal carcinoma in different countries. The clinical phase I
      study of the combination of Nimotuzumab administered concurrently with chemo-irradiation in
      patients with local advanced esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (LAFSCC) has shown the safety
      and the potential efficacy of Nimotuzumab. The concurrent trial is a clinical phase II trial
      designed to assess the efficacy of the combination of Nimotuzumab administered concurrently
      with chemo-radiotherapy in patients with LAFSCC, and to further investigate its side-effect
      and toxicity.
