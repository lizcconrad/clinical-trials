  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Despite widespread efforts to improve the treatment of obesity, only limited progress has
      been made. Calorie restriction (CR) has consistently been shown to produce weight loss, as
      well as delay the onset of age-related diseases, in numerous species. Most overweight
      individuals, however, are unable to sustain CR induced weight losses, possibly due to
      internal feedback systems that signal the body to increase food intake or decrease energy
      expenditure in response to weight loss. Novel treatment approaches are thus urgently needed
      that can assist overweight individuals in adhering to a CR regimen over the long-term.

      Botanicals represent an important and underexplored source of potential new therapies that
      may facilitate CR. In particular, one promising botanical that may reduce food intake and
      body weight by affecting neuroendocrine pathways related to satiety is Garcinia Cambogia
      (Garcinia Cambogia Desr.)-derived (-)-hydroxycitric acid. This compound has been found to
      facilitate weight loss in a number of studies. To date, few studies have directly tested the
      effect that this botanical on food intake in humans, its mechanism of action, or its effect
      on oxidative stress levels; thus rigorous scientific studies on this compounds need to be
      conducted. A double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover study will be conducted to explore
      the role that two different doses of this botanical compound have on food intake, satiety,
      weight loss, and oxidative stress levels. It is hypothesized that compared to placebo, both
      doses of Garcinia Cambogia (hydroxycitric acid) will reduce food intake, increase satiety,
      decrease weight, and reduce oxidative stress levels.

             the study

          7. Volunteers will also be ineligible if they have significant medical conditions (e.g.,

               -  psychiatric or behavioral problems (e.g., eating disorders or a history of drug
                  and alcohol abuse)

               -  concomitant medications (e.g., steroids)

          8. Volunteers will be screened out if they are unwilling or unable to adhere to different
             supplement regimens over an eight month period.
