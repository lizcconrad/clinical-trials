      This study is looking for healthy controls and patients with Parkinson's (PD) to perform an
      MR scan.

        1. The neurochemical profile of the SN of patients with PD as measured by high field MRS
           will differ from that of healthy controls, in that glutathione will be lower due to
           oxidative stress, lactate will be higher due to mitochondrial dysfunction, the gliosis
           markers myo-inositol and glutamine will be higher due to inflammation (glial activation)
           and N-acetylaspartate and glutamate will be lower due to neuronal loss/damage.

        2. There will be a relationship between neurochemical changes and disease severity.
