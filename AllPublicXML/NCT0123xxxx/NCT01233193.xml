    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to test if a Pharmacist Intervention Program with home blood
      pressure monitoring (HBPM) improves or controls pharmacological adherence and blood pressure
      levels in hypertensive patients under pharmacological treatment, compared to those who
      receive usual care in a community pharmacy setting.
