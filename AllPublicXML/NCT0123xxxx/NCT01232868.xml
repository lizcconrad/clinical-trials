    <textblock>
      Vaccination is the most effective way of preventing infectious diseases. Despite the success
      of vaccines in general, vaccines induce diminished antibody responses and lower protection in
      the elderly in particular. This could be explained by a defect in the early responses of an
      ageing immune system. A better understanding of the basic immunological mechanisms that
      mediate vaccine efficacy is incomplete. Such information is critical and could greatly
      decrease both the cost and the time to new vaccine development particularly for the geriatric
      population.

      In this trial, the investigators will study the immunologic differences of an FDA approved
      licensed influenza vaccine between a younger and an older group. Twenty two healthy
      volunteers between the age of 25-40 and forty four healthy volunteers above the age of 65
      will be enrolled in the study. Each participant in the study will be given one flu shot.
      Blood work will be obtained prior to vaccination, one day, three days, seven days, fourteen
      days, as well as one month and six months after vaccination. Throughout the duration of the
      study, the participants will be monitored for safety.

      RATIONALE:Trivalent Influenza vaccine (TIV) is known to induce diminished functional antibody
      responses and lower protection in the elderly. Here we hypothesize that this is due to
      intrinsic defects in innate responses which translates into suboptimal Hemagglutination
      Inhibition Assay (HAI) titers. Therefore, early innate signatures of vaccination should
      correlate with, and predict the immunogenicity of TIV in the young and elderly.

      STUDY DESIGN: Single center, open label study in which adult healthy volunteers with no
      contraindications to immunization will be vaccinated with TIV. Blood samples will be
      collected on Days D0 (at enrollment) and D1, D3, D7, D14, D30, D180 post vaccination to study
      innate and/or adaptive immunity markers. Even though influenza vaccination is considered
      safe, volunteers will be asked to report any local or systemic adverse events (AEs) from Day
      0 (vaccination) to Day 7 in memory aids. Reactogenicity events will also be evaluated by
      injection site examination on visits at D0, D1, D3 and D7. Volunteers will be also asked to
      report local and systemic AEs developing the day of a blood draw.

      Additionally, only AEs considered related (unlikely, possibly, probably or definitely
      related) will be collected and reported in this study from Day 0 (vaccination) to Day 180.
      After Day 30 only related SAEs will be collected and reported.

    <description>The number of subjects with a change in innate immunity signatures correlating with the level of antibodies was recorded. The innate immune signatures were assessed by Fluorescence Activated Cell Sorting (FACS)/Luminex assays. The levels of antibodies to the influenza virus prior to TIV (trivalent influenza vaccine) administration and on Day 180 after receiving TIV was assessed and the number of subjects who exhibited an increase in the antibodies and, therefore, a change in their innate immune signatures, was recorded.</description>

The innate immune signatures were assessed by Fluorescence Activated Cell Sorting (FACS)/Luminex assays. The levels of antibodies to the influenza virus prior to TIV (trivalent influenza vaccine) administration and on Day 180 after receiving TIV was assessed and the number of subjects who exhibited an increase in the antibodies and, therefore, a change in their innate immune signatures, was recorded.</description>
