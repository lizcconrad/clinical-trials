    <textblock>
      The investigators hypothesize that inflammation in carotid plaque is predictive of the extent
      of ischemic lesion burden on the brain and will add to risk stratification for individuals
      with carotid disease.

      Objectives:

        1. To investigate the relationship of carotid inflammation, as measured by FDG positron
           emission tomography (PET) to standardized uptake value in atherosclerotic plaque, with
           the number of covert brain infarcts.

        2. To investigate the relationship of FDG PET standardized uptake value with the relative
           volume of white matter hyperintensity.

        3. To correlate vascular inflammation in the entire aorta and aortoiliac vessels to carotid
           inflammation and cerebral infarcts and white matter disease.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Age 60 or greater at time of enrollment

          -  Written informed consent from patient or legal representative

          -  Diagnosis of stroke or TIA made by a stroke specialist within 90 days and fulfilling
             the following criteria:

          -  A TIA must involve a focal speech/language, motor or visual deficit (transient
             monocular blindness, amaurosis fugax) referable to the distribution of a carotid
             artery and lasting less than 24 hours.

          -  A stroke consisting of deficits as noted above with duration greater than 24 hours
             and/or confirmed on cerebral imaging. Post event Modified Rankin Score of 2 or less.

          -  Stroke meets the Trial of ORG 10172 in Acute Stroke Treatment (TOAST) criteria for
             large artery atherosclerosis

          -  Carotid Doppler, CTA or MRA confirming the presence of bilateral atherosclerotic
             disease resulting in carotid stenosis of any degree. Stenosis will be measured
             following the method used in NASCET for CTA and MRA. Carotid Doppler measurements will
             follow the criteria defined by the Society for Ultrasound consensus conference.

          -  12 lead ECG or Holter monitor confirming the absence of atrial fibrillation.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  TIA or stroke in the vertebrobasilar system

          -  Index event was primary hemorrhage

          -  History of intermittent atrial fibrillation

          -  Cardiac source of embolus suspected as cause of index event (artificial valve,
             segmental or global LV dysfunction, congenital cardiac defect)

          -  Diagnosis of vasculitis, dissection, or non-atherosclerotic carotid disease
             (Ehlers-Danlos, Marfans)

          -  Sinovenous thrombosis, endocarditis or hypercoagulable state

          -  Pacemaker, ICD or other contraindications to MRI

          -  Diminished Kidney Function

          -  Contraindication to radiation exposure (eg: pregnancy)

          -  Severe Claustrophobia
