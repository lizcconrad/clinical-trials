    <textblock>
      The objectives of this study are to examine how the consumption of treatment oils (including
      canola oil, DHA enriched canola-oil, high oleic acid canola oil, flax oil, and safflower oil)
      influence endothelial function, inflammation, oxidation, body composition, and plasma
      lipoprotein characterization.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The consequence of total fat consumption on circulating plasma lipids and the incidence of
      cardiovascular disease has long been a central theme in nutrition research. Less well known
      is the influence of specific fatty acids on vascular endothelial function and the oxidative
      and inflammatory responses characteristic of atherogenesis. Omega 3 ( ω-3) fatty acids,
      including plant derived alpha-linolenic acid (18:3n-3, ALA) and marine derived
      eicosapentaenoic (20:5n-3, EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (22:6n-3, DHA) have been shown to
      effectively modulate multiple cardiovascular risk factors in epidemiological, animal model
      and human clinical investigations. ALA is most commonly consumed as a major component of
      dietary canola and flaxseed oils and has a recommended intake of 1.1 and 1.6 g/d for women
      and men, respectively. EPA and DHA are consumed as fatty fish or fish oil and algae
      supplements with current recommended intakes of 500 mg/d (combined EPA and DHA).

      ALA is thought to improve cardiovascular health by modulating circulating lipid
      concentrations, altering membrane structure and function by enhancing the total ω-3 fatty
      acid content of cell membrane phospholipids, and reducing inflammatory reactions by blocking
      the formation of arachidonic acid derived eicosanoids. However, there are extensive knowledge
      gaps in our understanding of the molecular mechanisms and clinical efficacy of ω-3 fatty
      acids in human health and disease prevention. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to
      further examine these relationships.

      Feeding protocol and study treatments:

      The study will proceed as a double blind, randomized cross-over controlled feeding study.
      Each treatment phase will be 30 days in duration, separated by 4-week washout periods.
      Subjects will consume a fixed composition of a precisely controlled basal, weight-maintaining
      diet (35% energy from fat, 50% carbohydrate, and 15% protein) supplemented with 60g/d of the
      following treatment oils: 1) canola oil; 2) DHA enriched canola-oil; 3) high oleic acid
      canola oil; 4) flax/corn oil (40:60); or 5) safflower/corn oil (75:25). Study diets will be
      prepared in a metabolic kitchen facility at each clinical site. Three isocaloric meals will
      be prepared each day for every subject. A 7-day rotating menu cycle will be used. Subjects
      will consume at least 1 of 3 daily meals under supervision. The other meals will be prepared
      and packed for every subject to be taken out. The study control and intervention oils will be
      delivered in milkshakes provided twice daily. Subjects will be instructed to consume only the
      prepared meals and limit their intake of alcohol to 2 drinks/week and caffeinated calorie
      free beverages to 40oz (5 drinks) per day. Diets will be planned for every subject according
      to his/her energy requirements and will be nutritionally adequate.

    <time_frame>End of diet period 1 (week 4)</time_frame>
    <description>Study subjects will undergo endothelial health assessment by EndoPAT analysis. The EndoPat procedure will occur while the subject is lying down in a relaxed state. Throughout the study, the inflation pressure of the EndoPAT device will be electronically set to 10mm Hg below diastolic BP. Testing begins with 10 min of rest. Following rest, baseline pulse amplitude is measured from each fingertip for 5 min. Next, arterial flow is interrupted for 5 min by a cuff placed on the forearm at an occlusion pressure of 250 mmHg. Following occlusion release, pulse amplitude recording continues for 5 min.</description>

    <description>To assess regional changes in body fat deposition, subjects will undergo a dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) scan at baseline (beginning of study) and end of each intervention period. Waist circumference measurements also will be taken at this time to track how much fat is lost from the abdominal area of the body.</description>

    <time_frame>Week 4, 12, 20, 28 and 36 - End of each diet period</time_frame>
    <description>On the 29th day of each diet phase you will be asked to consume three tablespoons of tagged water (known as deuterium). The movement of these tagged materials will allow us to assess the quantity of long chain fatty acids (EPA and DHA) that your body is producing in response to your diet. All of the above tagged materials are non-radioactive, non-toxic, and do not pose any health risk to you. Another fasting blood sample will be obtained when you return the next morning.</description>
