  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The number of adults with congenitally malformed hearts is increasing. According to a
      prospective population-based cohort study from Sweden (1992-2001) the prevalence of
      cardiovascular defects was 9.1 per 1,000 births, which is comparable to other presented
      prevalence data in the world.On the basis of 9 million inhabitants, Sweden should have
      approximately 82000 born with CHD and approximately 20000 will, in adult age, need regular
      follow up in cardiac care. This is a result of the greater improvements within paediatric
      heart surgery and there is an increasing demand for continuous follow up in the healthcare
      system.[2] Guidelines from the European Society of Cardiology and the Canadian Cardiovascular
      Society recommend follow-up oriented towards both medical and psychosocial problems.

      Earlier studies have shown that adults with CHD have poor knowledge about their heart
      disease.The results are difficult to summarise because of the use of different instruments,
      methods and sample sizes. Most of the adults with CHD did not know their clinical diagnosis
      or what endocarditis was. However, we do not know if everyone in these studies was
      recommended endocarditis prophylactics or their definition of poor knowledge.

      At present different programmes for adults with CHD are established in hospital outpatient
      clinics. These studies describe the established programmes. They also address the needs for
      development of care e.g. a multicenter approach, transitions from paediatric to adult health
      care, delivery care in Europe, programmes for pregnancy, how to provide clinical strategies,
      health care resource utilization or outpatient nursing clinic for adults with CHD. But there
      is a lack of knowledge regarding how education and psychosocial support should be given to
      adults with congenitally malformed hearts and what effects that can be achieved. The aim is
      to evaluate the effects of a nurse-led intervention consisting of education by a
      computer-based educational programme and psychosocial support to adults with congenitally
      malformed hearts.

      Sample: 114 adults with congenitally malformed hearts as ventricular septal defect, atrial
      septal defect, coarctation of the aortae, tetralogy of Fallot, complete transposition of the
      great arteries, congenitally corrected transposition of the great arteries, single ventricle,
      Ebstein anomaly, coarctation of the aortae, Eisenmenger syndrome and aortic valve stenosis.

      Method and Measures: Randomised, controlled study where. the iIntervention-group will receive
      medical consultation, nurse consultation with psychosocial support, verbal and computer-based
      education. A care-plan with individual goals will be developed for each individual. Follow up
      of the care plan will be conducted after 1 month. The Control-group will receive: standard
      care with medical consultation.

      Data will be collected at baseline and after 3 and 12 months. Instruments

        -  Knowledge instrument developed in Belgium , translated, further developed, tested in
           study 3. Now further reliability and validity tests in this study 4.

        -  Health related quality of life, Short Form 36 (SF-36). SF-36 has good validity and
           reliability and is adjust to Swedish circumstances • Anxiety and depression, Hospital
           Anxiety and Depression Scale, (HADS)
