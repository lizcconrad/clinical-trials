    <textblock>
      The iCARE study, a clustered-randomized controlled trial, is evaluating an adherence
      promotion intervention for adolescents that Cystic Fibrosis (CF) care teams will implement.
      Half the centers will receive the Comprehensive Adherence Program (CAP) for 2 years. CAP
      consists of training in the CF My Way program (a validated problem-solving adherence
      promotion intervention). The other half of the centers will receive CAP in year 2 of the
      study. Participants are patients age 11-20 years old who are diagnosed with CF and have been
      prescribed at least one of the following medications for at least 6 months prior to signing
      the informed consent: azithromycin, hypertonic saline, Pulmozyme速, TOBI速, or inhaled
      compounded tobramycin. Rate of refilling prescriptions is the primary outcome with lung
      function decline rates, exacerbation rates, and patient reported measures including health
      related quality of life and CF knowledge and skills, as secondary outcomes.

      A central goal of this study is to test the effectiveness of the comprehensive adherence
      program (CAP), described above, versus standard care (SC) for adolescents and young adults
      seen in outpatient CF clinics.

    <description>The comprehensive adherence program emphasizes the patient's active, collaborative role in identifying adherence barriers and solving them to improve adherence to prescribed treatment regimens. Problem-solving sessions will be used to address barriers to adherence that are identified by the adolescent. The intervention also includes provision of a written, Prescribed Treatment Plan, assessment and remediation of gaps in Knowledge of Disease Management, and evaluation and re-instruction/re-training of skills needed to perform daily treatments.</description>
