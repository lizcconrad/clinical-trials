    <textblock>
      This study will recruit a total of 150 evaluable subjects (30 cognitively normal volunteers,
      and 60 MCI(Mild cognitive impairment), and 60 AD(Alzheimer's disease), respectively) Each
      evaluable subject involved in this study must fulfill all the inclusion and exclusion
      criteria according the subject grouping.

      Safety measurement will be evaluated by medical history, vital signs, physical examinations,
      laboratory examinations and collecting of adverse events.

      This study is expected to be completed in a period of 3 years.

      The primary objective of this protocol is to address the feasibility of clinical utilization
      of [18F]AV-45 in various neurodegenerative diseases. Specifically, we will expand the
      database of [18F]AV-45 PET imaging in Alzheimer's disease and MCI patients to refine the
      definition of a positive scan in patient with AD and MCI as compared to healthy control.
      Secondary, we will expand the safety database of [18F]AV-45 PET imaging. In addition, the
      image characteristics and prevalence of Aß positivity will be evaluated in different subsets
      of MCI and AD patients.

    <description>To expand the safety database of [18F]AV-45 PET imaging Safety variables include adverse event count, lab parameters, vital signs, and ECG. Comparison will be generally made to baseline, as appropriate.
To understand prevalence of Aß positivity in patients with MCI and AD. Images will be visually examined by a trained radiologist or nuclear medicine physician who is blinded to the subject diagnosis and will be reported as either Aβ positive (AD-like) or Aβ negative (not AD-like). The prevalence of Aß positivity in patients with MCI and AD will be recorded for comparison.</description>
