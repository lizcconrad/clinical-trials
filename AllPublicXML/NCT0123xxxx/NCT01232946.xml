      27 Type 2 diabetic subjects (HbA1c 7.5 - 9.5%) currently treated with diet and exercise alone
      or with oral antidiabetic agents will be randomly assigned to one of three treatment groups:
      insulin detemir, liraglutide, or liraglutide plus detemir (9 subjects per group), on a
      background of metformin 2000 mg per day. After 3 months' treatment, PET measurements of
      myocardial fuel selection will take place, under fasting conditions in the morning following
      that day's treatment injection(s).

      The investigators will test the hypothesis that effects of liraglutide plus insulin detemir
      on myocardial fuel selection will be greater than the effects of either agent alone. 27 Type
      2 diabetic subjects (HbA1c 7.5 - 9.5%) currently treated with diet and exercise alone or with
      oral antidiabetic agents will be randomly assigned to one of three treatment groups: insulin
      detemir, liraglutide, or liraglutide plus detemir (9 subjects per group). All subjects will
      undergo an initial standardization of background treatment to metformin 2000 mg per day,
      followed by randomized assignment to 3 months' treatment with liraglutide 1.8 mg/day (once
      daily each morning, tapering up according to label instructions) and/or detemir (administered
      twice daily, initially at 10 units per day then titrated to achieve fasting morning glucose
      readings below 130 mg/dL). PET measurements of myocardial fuel selection will take place at
      the end of this treatment period, under fasting conditions in the morning following that
      day's treatment injection(s).
