  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In the setting of single stent strategy for treatment of bifurcation, we investigate to
      compare simple strategy as &quot;provisional final kissing balloon technique(fKBT)&quot; to complex one
      as &quot;routine FKBT&quot;, focusing on actual myocardial ischemia assessed by scintigraphy in 7-month
      and to examine optimal endpoint of side branch ostium.

      Final kissing balloon technique (FKBT) is effective and accepted technique for the treatment
      of bifurcation. However, in complex lesion or anatomy, much procedure-time and contrast media
      are needed to accomplish this technique. Recent FFR study for jailed side branch (SB)
      demonstrated that angiographic severe stenosis at SB ostium includes &quot;pseudo-stenosis&quot; and
      stent-deployment jailing SB without FKBT has comparable impact on clinical outcome with FKBT
      strategy. Considering simple technique for bifurcation, we sought to investigate to compare
      &quot;provisional FKBT&quot; with &quot;routine FKBT&quot;, focusing on actual myocardial ischemia assessed by
      scintigraphy in 7 month and to examine optimal endpoint of SB ostium.
