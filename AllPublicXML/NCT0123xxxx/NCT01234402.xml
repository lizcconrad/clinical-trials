  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      An open-label, multicenter, randomized, Phase 2 trial in which patients with unresectable,
      locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer who have been previously treated with
      anthracycline and taxane therapy receive ramucirumab DP or IMC-18F1 administered on an
      every-21-day cycle (in combination with oral capecitabine therapy; capecitabine is
      administered twice a day on Days 1-14 of each cycle). Approximately 150 patients will be
      randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to either ramucirumab DP or IMC-18F1 in combination with
      capecitabine (Arm A and Arm B, respectively) or capecitabine monotherapy (Arm C).
      Randomization will be stratified by triple-negative receptor status (estrogen
      receptor-negative, progesterone receptor-negative, and human epidermal growth factor
      receptor-2 [HER2/neu]-negative) (yes/no) and receipt of prior antiangiogenic therapy.

      Treatment with the study medication(s) will continue until disease progression, the
      development of unacceptable toxicity, noncompliance or withdrawal of consent by the patient,
      or investigator decision. Capecitabine dose reductions in the setting of significant
      myelosuppression, hand-and-foot syndrome, or diarrhea will be required.
