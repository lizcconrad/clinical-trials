  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the malaria vaccine program of the MVI/GSK partnership is to develop an
      efficacious malaria vaccine that is deliverable through the existing system, the Expanded
      Program on Immunization (EPI) of WHO. This study has been designed to:

        -  Investigate the safety and immunogenicity of 7 infant immunization schedules of the
           experimental malaria vaccine integrated with an EPI regimen.

        -  Investigate how to maximize the antibody response to the experimental malaria vaccine.

          -  Acute or chronic illness determined by clinical or physical examination and laboratory
             screening tests including, but not limited to:

               -  Any confirmed or suspected immunosuppressive or immunodeficient condition, based
                  on medical history and physical examination.

               -  A family history of congenital or hereditary immunodeficiency.

               -  Major congenital defects.

               -  History of any neurological disorders or seizures.

          -  Laboratory screening tests out of normal ranges/limits defined per protocol.

          -  Previous vaccination with diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis (whole-cell or acellular),
             Hemophilus influenzae type b, hepatitis B, BCG tuberculosis, measles or oral polio
             vaccines.

          -  Planned administration/administration of a licensed vaccine (i.e. a vaccine that is
             approved by one of the following authorities: FDA or EU member state or WHO [with
             respect to prequalification]) not foreseen by the study protocol within 7 days of the
             first dose of study vaccine.

          -  Administration of immunoglobulins, blood transfusions or other blood products since
             birth to the first dose of study vaccine or planned administration during the study
             period.

          -  Use of a drug or vaccine that is not approved for that indication (by one of the
             following authorities: FDA or EU member state or WHO [with respect to
             prequalification]) other than the study vaccine starting at birth or planned use
             during the study period.

          -  Chronic administration (defined as more than 14 days) of immunosuppressants or other
             immune-modifying drugs since birth.

          -  Simultaneous participation in any other clinical trial.

          -  Same-sex twins (to avoid misidentification).

          -  Maternal death.

          -  History of allergic reactions (significant IgE-mediated events) or anaphylaxis to
             previous immunizations.

          -  History of allergic disease or reactions likely to be exacerbated by any component of
             the vaccine.

          -  Children will not be enrolled if any maternal, obstetrical or neonatal event that has
             occurred might, in the judgment of the investigator, result in increased
             neonatal/infant morbidity

          -  Any other findings that the investigator feels would increase the risk of having an
             adverse outcome from participation in the trial.

        <title>Number of Subjects Reported With Haematological Abnormalities, for the Haemoglobin (HAE) Parameter</title>
        <description>This outcome measure concerns haematological abnormalities, for the haemoglobin (HAE) parameter. Subjects’ levels were assessed as either normal, Grade (G) 1, G 2, G 3, G 4 or Missing. Normal HAE level was defined as HAE &gt; 13.0 and 10.5 grams per deciliter (g/dL) for subjects aged 1 to 21 and 22 to 35 days respectively. Grades were defined as follows: 1) In subjects aged 1 to 21 days: G1 = HAE as 12.0 to 13.0 g/dL, G2 = HAE as 10.0 to 11.9 g/dL, G3 = HAE as 9.0 to 9.9 g/dL, G4 = HAE &lt; 9.0 g/dL; 2) In subjects aged 22 to 35 days: G1 = HAE as 9.5 to 10.5 g/dL, G2 = HAE as 8.0 to 9.4 g/dL, G3 = HAE as 7.0 to 7.9 g/dL, G4 = HAE &lt; 7.0 g/dL; 3) In subjects aged 36 to 56 days: G1 = HAE as 8.5 to 9.4 g/dL, G2 = HAE as 7.0 to 8.4 g/dL, G3 = HAE as 6.0 to 6.9 g/dL, G4 = HAE &lt; 6.0 g/dL; 4) In subjects aged ≥ 57 days: G1 = HAE as 10.0 to 10.9 g/dL, G2 = HAE as 9.0 to 9.9 g/dL, G3 = HAE as 7.0 to 8.9 g/dL, G4 = HAE &lt; 7.0 g/dL.</description>

          <title>Number of Subjects Reported With Haematological Abnormalities, for the Haemoglobin (HAE) Parameter</title>
          <description>This outcome measure concerns haematological abnormalities, for the haemoglobin (HAE) parameter. Subjects’ levels were assessed as either normal, Grade (G) 1, G 2, G 3, G 4 or Missing. Normal HAE level was defined as HAE &gt; 13.0 and 10.5 grams per deciliter (g/dL) for subjects aged 1 to 21 and 22 to 35 days respectively. Grades were defined as follows: 1) In subjects aged 1 to 21 days: G1 = HAE as 12.0 to 13.0 g/dL, G2 = HAE as 10.0 to 11.9 g/dL, G3 = HAE as 9.0 to 9.9 g/dL, G4 = HAE &lt; 9.0 g/dL; 2) In subjects aged 22 to 35 days: G1 = HAE as 9.5 to 10.5 g/dL, G2 = HAE as 8.0 to 9.4 g/dL, G3 = HAE as 7.0 to 7.9 g/dL, G4 = HAE &lt; 7.0 g/dL; 3) In subjects aged 36 to 56 days: G1 = HAE as 8.5 to 9.4 g/dL, G2 = HAE as 7.0 to 8.4 g/dL, G3 = HAE as 6.0 to 6.9 g/dL, G4 = HAE &lt; 6.0 g/dL; 4) In subjects aged ≥ 57 days: G1 = HAE as 10.0 to 10.9 g/dL, G2 = HAE as 9.0 to 9.9 g/dL, G3 = HAE as 7.0 to 8.9 g/dL, G4 = HAE &lt; 7.0 g/dL.</description>

            <description>Subjects in this group received one dose of Engerix-B (HBV) ≤ 7 days of age. In addition, all subjects received a 3-doses course of Tritanrix HepB/Hib (DTPwHepB/Hib), administered at 6, 10 and 14 weeks of age, one dose of Bacille Calmette Guerin tuberculosis vaccine (BCG), administered when below ≤ 7 days of age, 4 doses of Polio Sabin (OPV), administered when ≤ 7 days of age and at 6, 10 and 14 weeks of age, and one dose of Rouvax (Measles), administered at 9 months of age. The HBV vaccine was administered intramuscularly (IM) in the left antero-lateral thigh. The DTPwHepB/Hib and Measles vaccines were administered IM in the right antero-lateral thigh and the OPV vaccine orally. The BCG vaccine was administered via intradermal route in the shoulder.</description>

          <title>Number of Subjects Reported With Haematological Abnormalities, for the White Blood Cells (WBC) Parameter</title>
          <description>This outcome measure concerns haematological abnormalities, for the white blood cells (WBC) parameter. Subjects’ levels were assessed as either normal, Grade 1, Grade 2, Grade 3, Grade 4 or Missing. Normal WBC level was defined as &gt; 2.5 x 10 exp 9 WBC per liter (Billions WBC/L). Grade 1 WBC level was defined as 2.0 to 2.5 Billions WBC/L. Grade 2 WBC level was defined as 1.5 to 1.999 Billions WBC/L. Grade 3 WBC level was defined as 1.0 to 1.499 Billions WBC/L. Grade 4 WBC level was defined as &lt; 1.0 Billions WBC/L.</description>
          <population>Analysis was done on the Total Vaccinated cohort, which included all subjects who were randomized and received a dose of BCG tuberculosis vaccine. Analyses on this cohort were performed per treatment assignment. This analysis was done solely on subjects for whom data were available.</population>
