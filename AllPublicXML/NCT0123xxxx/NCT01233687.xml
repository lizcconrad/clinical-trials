  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase I/II study of erlotinib and AMG 102 in previously treated subjects with
      advanced NSCLC. Subjects will be enrolled with recurrent or progressive advanced stage NSCLC
      that has been treated with at least one and a maximum of two prior chemotherapy regimens. The
      Phase I part of the study will enroll 8-16 subjects with the Phase II part enrolling 21-45
      subjects.

      The Phase I part of the study is designed to determine how safest the combination of AMG 102
      and erlotinib is and the recommended dose for the Phase II part. The Phase II part is to
      determine whether the combination of AMG102 and erlotinib works enough to warrant further
      interest in this combination.

    <textblock>
      While modest improvements have been made in survival and quality of life in patients with
      advanced NSCLC there is a need to explore new agents and combinations with novel mechanisms
      of action in an effort to improve clinical outcomes in this patient population. The HGF/c-MET
      pathway inhibition is a promising novel target in NSCLC. Preclinical evidence support the
      combined targeting of EGFR and HGF/c-MET pathways in NSCLC as a strategy that may result in
      enhanced antitumor activity. Inhibition of both HGF/c-Met and EGFR pathways can be
      accomplished by utilizing the combination of AMG 102 and erlotinib in patients with advanced
      NSCLC. Therefore, we propose a safety and efficacy, phase I/II clinical trial of the
      combination in patients with previously treated, advanced NSCLC.

      <textblock>
        Patients must have baseline evaluations performed prior to the first dose of study drug and
        must meet all inclusion and exclusion criteria. Results of all baseline evaluations, which
        assure that all inclusion and exclusion criteria have been satisfied, must be reviewed by a
        Physician Investigator prior to enrollment of that patient. In addition, the patient must
        be thoroughly informed about all aspects of the study, including the study visit schedule
        and required evaluations and all regulatory requirements for informed consent. The written
        informed consent must be obtained from the patient prior to enrollment. The following
        criteria apply to all patients enrolled onto the study unless otherwise specified.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with recurrent or progressive advanced stage Non-small cell lung cancer
             (NSCLC,no SCLC component) who have been treated with at least one and a maximum of two
             prior chemotherapy regimens for advanced NSCLC. Chemotherapy as part of initial
             potentially curative therapy (given as part of adjuvant or concomitant
             chemoradiotherapy) that was completed &lt;1 year counts as 1 prior regimen. Prior
             erlotinib, other epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) TKIs or monoclonal antibodies
             targeting EGFR are not allowed.

        NOTE: Chemotherapy as part of initial potentially curative therapy (given as part of
        adjuvant or concomitant chemoradiotherapy) that was completed one or more years prior to
        screening for this study does not count as a prior regimen.

        If the tumor is refractory (progressed) after a prior chemotherapy regimen, then that
        regimen would count. If a prior chemotherapy regimen has been changed due to other reasons
        than disease progression (e.g. poor tolerance, allergic reaction), then it would not count
        as a separate prior regimen. A chemotherapy drug added for &quot;maintenance&quot; following disease
        stabilization or response to a chemotherapy regimen (in the absence of prior disease
        progression) does not count as a separate prior regimen.

        NOTE: Pathology reports documenting the diagnosis of NSCLC are required to be reviewed by
        the screening physician investigator.

          -  Measurable disease (RECIST version 1.1) (for phase II part only).

          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance Status of ≤ 2 and life
             expectancy of ≥ 3 months.

        excluded.

          -  Age ≥ 18 years old and ability to provide written informed consent obtained prior to
             participation in the study and any related procedures being performed.

          -  Patients must meet the following laboratory criteria (within 14 days prior to study
             registration):

        oHematology: Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥ 1500/mm³ Platelets ≥ 100,000/mm³ Hemoglobin
        ≥ 9 g/dL International normalized ratio (INR) ≤ 1.5 or prothrombin time (PT)/partial
        thromboplastin time (PTT) within normal limits (WNL) of the institution oBiochemistry:
        Total Bilirubin within normal institutional limits. AST/SGOT and ALT/SGPT ≤ 2.5 x upper
        limit of normal (ULN), except if there is known hepatic metastasis, wherein transaminases
        may be ≤ 5 x institutional ULN.

        Creatinine clearance 45 ml/min or higher calculated using the Cockcroft-Gault formula.
        Multiply the number by 0.85 if the patient is female.

          -  Patients must have fully recovered from the effects of any prior surgery, chemotherapy
             or radiation therapy. In the case of residual effects, these must be clinically
             stable, grade 1 or less in severity and do not meet other protocol exclusion criteria.
             A minimum time period of 3 weeks should elapse between the completion of radiation
             therapy for recurrent/metastatic disease and enrollment in the study. A minimum of 4
             weeks should elapse between the completion of chemotherapy or any experimental therapy
             and enrollment in the study. A minimum of 4 weeks should elapse between prior major
             surgery (such as open biopsy or significant traumatic injury) and enrollment in the
             study. A minimum of 2 weeks should elapse between prior minor surgical procedures
             (such as chemotherapy infusion port placement or core visceral organ biopsy) and
             enrollment in the study.

          -  If patient has history of brain metastases, brain lesions should have been treated
             with surgery and/or radiation and be stable on repeat imaging and patients should be
             neurologically stable on a stable or tapering dose of corticosteroids.

          -  No history of prior malignancy, with the exception of curatively treated squamous cell
             or basal carcinoma of the skin or in situ cervical cancer, unless there is a 3-year
             disease-free interval.

          -  Women of childbearing potential (WOCBP) must have a negative serum or urine pregnancy
             test within 7 days of the first administration of study treatment and must be willing
             to use two methods of contraception one of them being a barrier method or abstain from
             sexual activity during the study and for 6 months after last study drug
             administration. Sexually active males and their female partners must agree to use two
             methods of accepted and effective method of contraception (hormonal or barrier
             methods, abstinence) prior to study entry and for the duration of the study.

          -  All patients must have given signed, informed consent prior to registration on study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with known positivity for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) or hepatitis C;
             baseline testing for HIV and hepatitis C is not required. This is due to the unknown
             effects of AMG102.

          -  Patients with any significant history of non-compliance to medical regimens or with
             inability to grant a reliable informed consent.

          -  A major surgical procedure or significant traumatic injury within 28 days of beginning
             treatment, or anticipation of the need for major surgery during the course of the
             study per inclusion criterion 3.1. In addition, if a patient has not yet recovered
             from prior minor surgery (such as central venous access device or fine needle
             aspiration biopsy).

          -  Thrombosis or vascular ischemic events within the last twelve months, such as deep
             venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, transient ischemic attack, cerebral infarction,
             or myocardial infarction

          -  Concurrent or prior (within 7 days of enrollment) anticoagulation therapy, except for
             the use of low dose coumarin-type anticoagulants or low molecular weight heparin for
