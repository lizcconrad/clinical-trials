  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      MicroRNAs (MiRNAs) regulate the translation of RNAs and are implicated in cell proliferation
      and renewal both under physiologically normal as well as in malignant conditions.
      Dysregulation of specific miRNAs may be associated with either gaining oncogenic or loosing
      tumor suppressing functions. MiRNA dysregulation has been implicated in breast cancer
      tumorigenic (stem cell) and non-tumorigenic development. Therefore, miRNA profiling of
      treatment na√Øve and treatment-exposed breast tumors and sequential samples of blood/serum
      will allow for identification of miRNA markers of prognosis and as indicators and potential
      targets for personalized therapies. In this proposal, specimens from patients treated in the
      clinical breast cancer program on already existing protocols (IRB 05091 and 05015) will be
      characterized by Dr. Rossi's laboratory and collaborators, and the information gained will be
      applied to develop specific therapies.

      Current neoadjuvant or adjuvant treatment strategies do not allow for rationale incorporation
      of such agents. One needs tools to predict both de novo and acquired resistance to
      therapeutic agents. This is a difficult task, due to the compound nature of escape routes:
      tumor exposure is usually to a combination of therapeutic agents and the mechanisms of
      resistance are broad: intrinsic resistance due to existing mutations, or regulatory - miRNA,
      other epigenetic - alterations, polymorphisms, tumor cell adaptation via new mutations and
      activation of alternative pathways, lack of optimal pharmacokinetics/genomics, activation of
      efflux mechanisms, accelerated repair mechanisms are involved.

      Similarly, not all patients who are candidates for primary surgical intervention to be
      followed by post-operative adjuvant therapy benefit from such systemic treatments. The
      mechanisms of resistance be it de novo in surviving stem cell/tumorigenic components, or
      acquired by cells left behind &quot;dormant&quot; after the surgical intervention, are not well
      delineated.

      Breast tumors subjected to neoadjuvant chemotherapy allow for baseline and treatment-effected
      sampling. Characterization of core biopsy specimens of primary tumors procured prior to
      exposure to neoadjuvant therapy from different varieties of breast cancer subtypes, and of
      subsequent mid-treatment and intraoperative (procured during definitive surgery following
      completion of neoadjuvant therapy) samples should help to assess the predictive value of the
      pre-treatment and post-treatment miRNA expression profile for complete and near complete
      response, as a surrogate marker for survival. Similarly, patterns of de novo and acquired
      resistance may emerge when assessment of pre- and post treatment miRNA expression profiles
      are analyzed in a supervised manner of classification using pathological response as
      classifier. Samples obtained from patients with primary surgical removal of their tumors
      before any systemic treatment exposure on the other hand, will allow for determining markers
      of prognosis, and predictors for response to therapeutic targeting agents.
