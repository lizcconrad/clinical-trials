  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to understand which therapies will suppress effector cells and
      promote regulatory T cells and To test whether patients with a better response to therapy and
      longer psoriasis-free periods develop a higher numerical ratio of regulatory to effectors
      T-cells and/or regulatory cells more able to suppress the effectors.

      This is an observational study for the effect of different treatment options of psorisis on
      regulatory T-cells. Patients in whom a decision to treat with one of the following therapies
      (Dovobet, neotigason, narrow-band UVB and anti TNF alpha therapy) and agreed to take part in
      the study will be selected. Allocation of different treatments to patients is not part of the
      study. We will enroll 40 patients with moderate to severe psoriasis in the age range from 18
      to 70. patients must be treatment-free for at least 2 weeks for topical application and 4
      weeks for systemic treatment of psoriasis. females of child bearing potential must be on
      reliable contraception. Children below 18 years, patients above 70 years, pregnant and
      lactating patients and immunosuppressed patients are excluded from this study. Blood and
      tissue samples will be taken before and after treatment. We will also invite 10 patients who
      are receiving ellipse excisions of naevi, and who known not to have psoriasis, to provide
      control samples of distal skin beyond the margins required to demonstrate complete removal
      and control donation of blood.

    <measure>Clincal-immunological correlation of treatment outcome in psoriasis patients</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Primary outcome measures will be the first correlations of treatment outcome in psoriasis patients assessed by PASI score and PGA, with changes in the balance between Treg and effector T cells. This will test whether changes to this balance should be a major target for future therapies. In the short term, the results will also determine whether the balance provides a useful predictive biomarker for response to treatment. It is anticipated that the results will be disseminated through publications in high impact journals and presentation at relevant scientific and clinical meetings</description>
