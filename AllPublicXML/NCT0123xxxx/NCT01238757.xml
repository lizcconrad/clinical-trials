      The purpose of this study is

        -  to document the prevalence and type of asynchronies incidence during non-invasive
           mechanical ventilation in pediatric patients breathing under pressure support.

        -  to observe the impact of adjusting the expiratory trigger setting on asynchronies during
           pressure support

        -  and compare these incidences with asynchronies measured in pediatric patient breathing
           under NAVA system (Neurally Adjusted Ventilatory Assist).

      Two sessions will be recorded, one in PSV, one with NAVA, delivered in a random order after
      being sure the infant is calm and comfortable, according to his parents and/or the nurse in
      charge.

      Criteria for initiating non-invasive ventilation will follow the usual practice guidelines of
      the unit.

      Ventilation parameters in Non-invasive-Pressure Support will be adjusted by the clinician in
      charge of the patient, as usual based on clinical observation. Investigators will not
      interfere with ventilator settings. Ventilation will be applied via an endotracheal tube,
      uncuffed for the majority (if infant &lt; 5 years), according to commonly applied guidelines in
      this unit.

      One 15 minutes session will be recorded, after being sure the infant is calm and comfortable
      according to the parents and/or the nurse in charge. Then the clinician in charge of the
      patient will modify the ETS, first decreasing it of 15% (absolute value)below the initial set
      value, and will be recorded the following 5 minutes after stabilization and secondly
      increasing it of 15% (absolute value)above the initial set value, and will be recorded the
      following 5 minutes after stabilization.

      NAVA will be set to deliver initially the same peak pressure (comparable level of assist)
      than during the initial PS period. Same PEEP will be delivered in both modes. This is
      possible with a pre-visualization window, allowing adjustments before switching to the NAVA
      mode. Nava non-invasive-ventilation will be recorded during 20 minutes.

      The 2 sessions, Pressure support and Nava, will be recorded consecutively.

    <description>Asynchronies during mechanical ventilation are the following: Auto triggering, double triggering, late cycling, premature cycling and ineffective effort.
all ventilatory parameters are recorded under non-invasive-Pressure support (3 phases: 3 levels of expiratory trigger setting, initial, +15% and -15%, 15 min, 5 min and 5 min respectively) and NAVA (1 phase, 20 min).
Asynchronies will be determined by measuring each ventilatory cycle of all recordings.</description>

    <description>Neurally Adjusted ventilatory Assist is a ventilation mode where the ventilator is piloted by the electrical activity of the diaphragm. Ventilation is triggered and cycled off by the electrical activity of the diaphragm, the pressure delivered being proportional to this activity.
The proportion named gain is chosen to obtain under NAVA the same peak pressure than during Presure Support</description>
