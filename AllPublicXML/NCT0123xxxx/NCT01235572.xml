    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well early discharge and outpatient care works in patients
      with myelodysplastic syndrome or acute myeloid leukemia previously treated with intensive
      chemotherapy. Gathering information about patients with myelodysplastic syndrome or acute
      myeloid leukemia who are discharged after finishing chemotherapy, or who stay in the hospital
      until blood counts return to normal, may help doctors learn more about the safety of allowing
      patients to leave the hospital early, the patient's quality of life, use of medical services,
      and the cost of these services associated with such a policy.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Estimate the early death rate in patients discharged after completion of intensive
      induction or salvage chemotherapy.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Compare the costs incurred by patients discharged early after induction or salvage
      chemotherapy with similar patients who are discharged only after their blood counts recover.

      II. Compare resource utilization (transfusions, etc.) in patients discharged early after
      induction or salvage chemotherapy with similar patients who are discharged only after blood
      count recovery.

      III. Compare the quality of life in patients discharged early after induction or salvage
      chemotherapy with similar patients who are discharged only after their blood counts recover.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients are discharged within 72 hours after completion of chemotherapy and undergo standard
      outpatient care by a registered nurse (RN), physician assistant (PA), or resident/fellow at a
      local facility or the study center approximately 3 times per week, as clinically indicated
      for up to 45 days.

      After completion of study, patients are followed up for 1 month.
