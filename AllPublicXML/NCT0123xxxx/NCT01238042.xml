  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patient's with High Grade Dysplasia, Carcinoma in situ or Early Adenocarcinoma in Barrett's
      Esophagus are injected with HPPH and one day later are endoscopically treated with light from
      a laser.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patient must have biopsy proven high-grade (severe)dysplasia, carcinoma-in-situ or
             early stage adenocarcinoma

          -  Patient may have received prior therapy; e.g.Nd-YAG laser, radiation therapy or
             chemotherapy. At least one-month must have elapsed between prior treatments and PDT

          -  Tumors (HGD/CIS or early adenocarcinoma) can be primary or recurrent, Stage 0 or I N0M
             (any)

          -  Patients must have no contraindication to endoscopy

          -  Male or female patients must be 18 years old or older. Female patients must not be
             pregnant and must be practicing a medically acceptable form of birth control or be
             sterile or post-menopausal. A Pregnancy test is required and must be negative.

          -  Patients must sign an Informed Consent according to FDA guidelines and be acceptable
             to the RPCI IRB

          -  Patients must have a Karnofsky status 50 or above.

          -  Patients with early invasive adenocarcinoma will be included only if they are
             considered poor surgical risks, have failed or refused XRT/chemo, or refused surgery.

          -  If the patients has had cancer other than non-melanoma skin cancer, their treating
             physician must deem them disease-free.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with tumors of grade greater than T-1.

          -  Porphyria or hypersensitivity to porphyrin or porphyrin-like compounds

          -  WBC&lt;4000; platelet count&lt;100,000; prothrombin times 1.5 times above upper normal
             limit.

          -  Patients with impaired renal and/or hepatic function (total serum bilirubin &gt; 3.0
             mg/d, serum creatinine&gt;3 mg%, alkaline phosphatase (hepatic) or SGOT&gt; 3 times the
             upper normal limit.

          -  Patients on concurrent chemotherapy or radiation therapy will be excluded as well as
             those having received prior treatment for the esophageal cancer within 4 weeks of
             enrollment.
