  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this project is to identify the microorganisms present in the endometrial samples
      obtained from women with or without evidence of endometritis using a combination of culture
      methods, rRNA sequencing and whole genomic sequencing. The overarching aim of these studies
      is to identify the etiology of endometritis. The investigators will define the role of
      fastidious anaerobic microorganisms in the etiology of PID, and assess whether antibiotic
      treatment regimens used for the treatment of PID have activity against the novel organisms
      linked with pelvic infections.
