      The following study is designed in order to effectively collaborate and coordinate
      information amongst colleagues to advance knowledge on information related to older drivers.
      Candrive is dedicated to improving the safety and quality of life of older drivers. The major
      objective is to develop a valid, easy to use in office screening tool that will help
      clinicians identify older drivers who need further assessment of their driving. Over the
      course of the study, the goal will be to provide enough data to establish findings relating
      to knowledge generation, translation of research into action, training and sustainability. It
      is our hope that the research process will translate to help increase the knowledge of public
      policy makers, clinicians and the general public. A 5 year study will create an opportunity
      to document the natural course of an older adult's driving patterns up until driving
      cessation. This will not only provide data for road safety but also help understand the
      psychosocial factors leading to driving cessation. The data relating to psychosocial factors
      may also lead the way in establishing ways of extending the safe driving period for older
      adults.

      The investigators hypothesize that the knowledge derived from this interdisciplinary research
      will be used by transportation policy makers, clinicians, and general public to improve
      safety and quality of life for older drivers.

      Driving a motor vehicle has become an everyday necessity in modern Canadian culture. The
      privilege of maintaining a valid driver's license promotes an independent lifestyle (Voelker,
      1999). Since driving is a demanding task that requires a high level of mental and physical
      skills, it is critical that those who obtain a valid driver's license are medically fit to
      operate a motor vehicle. Adverse health conditions make driving difficult based on the high
      cognitive and physical demand (Man-Son-Hing, 2007, Marshall, 2008). The loss of driving
      privileges due to chronic health conditions can have a negative effect on an individual's
      quality of life. These individuals require greater community support and suffer from low
      self-esteem (Fonda, 2001, Ragland, 2004, Ansley et al., 2004). As much as it is desirable to
      promote independence, the safety implications of driving require careful consideration.

      In Canada, persons over the age of 65 represent the fastest growing segment of the
      population. This age group is predicted to make up 24 % of the total population by the year
      2030 (CMA Journal, 1994, Stats Can, 2005). As a result, the number of older persons holding a
      driver's license has increased in both percentage and absolute terms (Ont Road Safety, 2004,
      Transport Can, 2001, Ragland, 2004, Ansley et al., 2004). Therefore, it is not surprising
      that those over 70 years of age have the highest crash rates per mile driven (Brorsson, 1989,
      Stutts &amp; Wilkins, 2003, Gresset &amp; Meyer, 1994, Cotrell &amp; Wild, 1999, Rizzo et al., 2001,
      Meddinger-Rapport, 2002, Ansley et al., 2004).

      Candrive is an interdisciplinary health research program dedicated to improving the safety of
      older drivers in Canada. The members of Candrive believe that establishing a comprehensive
      approach to aging driver issues will reduce the morbidity and mortality associated with motor
      vehicle crashes and allow older Canadian drivers to maintain their independence and healthy
      lifestyles.

      A major focus of the Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR) Team Grant is to conduct
      the Common Cohort study, a study in which 1000 drivers age 70 or older will be recruited and
      followed for 5 years. The Common Cohort study involves 7 sites (Victoria, Winnipeg, Thunder
      Bay, Hamilton, Toronto, Ottawa, and Montreal) in 4 provinces. Participants in the Common
      Cohort study will undergo comprehensive annual assessments as well as having their driving
      patterns monitored for 5 years. One of the major objectives of the Common Cohort study will
      be the development of a valid, easy-to-use in-office screening tool that will help clinicians
      identify older drivers who may need further assessment of their driving ability.

      The vision of Candrive is to use a national interdisciplinary research approach to improve
      the safety and health-related quality-of-life of older drivers. Collaboration with key
      stakeholders throughout the process ensures that research products will translate into public
      policy and clinical practice.

        The cohort will be established in 7 cities in 4 provinces, including Ontario (Ottawa,
        Thunder Bay, Toronto, Hamilton), Quebec (Montreal), Manitoba (Winnipeg) and British
        Columbia (Victoria). Participants will be recruited through the media - newspapers
        (community and city), radio, public presentations and newsletters to senior associations.
        We have established collaboration with two senior organizations; Canada's Association for
        the Fifty-plus (CARP) and the Federal Superannuates National Association (FSNA). These
        senior organizations will be targeted through mail out letters and presentations at annual
        meetings. Additionally, recruitment posters will be displayed at local community centres,
        fitness centres, doctor's offices, hospitals and other clinic waiting rooms.
