  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The project aims to examine the efficacy of a 12-week intake of alginate based ready to drink
      supplement on development in body weight and body composition, and risk markers for type-2
      diabetes and cardiovascular disease in obese subjects.

      The study consists of a parallel RCT with 96 overweight/obese subjects enrolled into two
      treatment arms: placebo or active for 12 weeks. They will undergo examination at time points
      0 and 12 weeks where a DXA scan will be performed to assess body composition and a fasting
      blood sample will be taken. At time points 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 and 12 weeks their weight and
      waist circumference and number of test products not consumed will be recorded. In addition
      all subjects receive dietary counselling during the 12 weeks.
