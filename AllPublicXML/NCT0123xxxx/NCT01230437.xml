  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The airways of the lung are lined by specialised cells called airway epithelial cells. As
      well as being at the interface between the lungs and the air we breathe; airway epithelial
      cell (AEC) function is altered in people with respiratory diseases such as asthma. AEC
      secrete many mediators that contribute to asthma symptoms and these also contribute to
      asthmatic inflammation in the lungs. The study of such cells is difficult because of their
      location deep in the lungs. Nasal airway epithelial cells provide a useful and easily
      accessible model of model of lower airway cells. This study will examine whether the asthma
      medication Singulair (montelukast) can inhibit the inflammatory secretions of nasal AEC of
      asthmatic patents who also have allergic rhinitis compared with patients who have asthma
      alone. We will also examine if montelukast has differential modulating effects in these two
      patient groups.

      Hypothesis

      The inflammatory secretory profile of nasal airway epithelial cells (NEC) cultured from
      asthmatics with concomitant allergic rhinitis (AR) will differ from that of NEC from patients
      with asthma alone. Treatment (in vitro and in vivo) with montelukast may have differential
      modulating effects in these two patient groups.

      For the primary objective of this proposal we will use nasal AEC from asthmatics with or
      without concomitant AR as to ascertain differences in pro-inflammatory cytokine and chemokine
      production between these two groups and determine whether in vitro treatment with montelukast
      has a differential modulating effect on NEC secretion. In the secondary pilot study any
      modulating effects by montelukast on AEC secretion in vitro will be correlated with any in
      vivo response to montelukast withdrawal. This sub study will provide pilot data indicating
      whether in vivo response to montelukast can be predicted from in vitro effects on NEC.

    <description>Nasal AEC will be cultured from 20 patients with asthma and 20 patients with asthma and concomitant allergic rhinitis.
Unstimulated, TNFÎ± (a surrogate for viral infection, a well known trigger of exacerbations) or allergen stimulated secretion of IL-6, IL-10, INFgamma TGFbeta, GM-CSF, eotaxin 1 &amp; 2, RANTES and IL-8 by NEC will be measured. The in vitro inhibitory effects of a concentration range (10-6M to 10-10M) of montelukast will be assessed.</description>

    <measure>Effect of 1-week montelukast withdrawal on clinical scores and pro-inflammatory cytokine output by nasal epithelial cells</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The secondary outcome of the study will be to examine the effect of withdrawal montelukast for 1-week on clinical scores and pro-inflammatory cytokine/ chemokine secretion by cultured NEC in montelukast-responsive patients with asthma (20 subjects) and asthma/AR (20 subjects).
The clinical scores and NEC secretory responses in these patients following montelukast withdrawal will be compared with the responses generated in the primary study i.e., while taking montelukast.</description>

        For the primary study the investigators will identify 40 patients (aged 10-60) with with
        stable physician confirmed mild/moderate asthma (Steps 1-4 of BTS/SIGN guidelines [3]) with
        &lt;10 pack-year smoking histories. Twenty of the subjects will have asthma and concomitant
        allergic rhinitis (asthma/AR) and 20 will have asthma alone.
