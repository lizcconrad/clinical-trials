  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Panobinostat may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for
      cell growth. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as fluorouracil and leucovorin calcium, work in
      different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping
      them from dividing. Giving panobinostat together with fluorouracil and leucovorin calcium may
      kill more tumor cells. PURPOSE: This phase I trial is studying the side effects and the best
      dose of giving panobinostat, fluorouracil, and leucovorin calcium together in treating
      patients with stage IV colorectal cancer who did not respond to previous fluorouracil-based
      chemotherapy.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the safety and feasibility of combining LBH589 with infusional 5-FU
      chemotherapy in the treatment of Stage IV colorectal cancer patients who have progressed on
      standard 5-FU regimens.

      II. To determine the efficacy of LBH589 alone to produce consistent decreases in tumor
      thymidylate synthase (TS) expression.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the time to tumor progression, progression free and overall survival of
      patients with advanced or metastatic colorectal cancer treated with LBH589 combined with
      infusional 5-FU.

      II. To determine if TS repression by LBH589 predicts response to the combination of LBH589
      and infusional 5-FU in patients who have already progressed on standard regimens containing
      5-FU.

      III. To obtain preliminary data on gene expression levels of TS, DPD and TP as well as
      germline polymorphisms of TS being associated with clinical outcome and toxicity.

      IV. To obtain preliminary data on acetylation on peripheral blood mononuclear cells to
      establish biological activity in these patients at time of biopsies.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive oral panobinostat 3 times a week. Patients also receive leucovorin
      calcium IV over 2 hours on days 1 and 15 followed by fluorouracil IV continuously over 46
      hours on days 1-2 and 15-16. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity. After completion of study treatment, patients are
      followed up every 3 months.
