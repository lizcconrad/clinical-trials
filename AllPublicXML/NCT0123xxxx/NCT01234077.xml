  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Research study that will test a portable device (CPC M1) that records: body movement; heart
      activity (ECG; snoring; and body position during sleep. The Food and Drug Administration
      (FDA) has not approved this device for use except in a research setting.

      The purposes of this study are to: a) determine if the ECG data collected using the CPC M1
      device is at least as good as the ECG data collected during a diagnostic, in-lab
      polysomnogram (PSG) (or sleep study) and b) determine if in-home monitoring with the device
      will provide similar results compared to an in-lab PSG.
