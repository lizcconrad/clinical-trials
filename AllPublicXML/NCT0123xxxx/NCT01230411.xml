  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a pilot trial to collect data on the use of intravenous ibuprofen (IVIb) in the
      treatment of an acute migraine attack. Data will be collected on the efficacy of IVIb in
      subjects who are treated with study medication between 2 and 72 hours from time of onset of
      headache.

      Periodic safety and efficacy assessments will be performed prior to and after study drug
      administration.

      Null hypothesis: There is no difference in the proportion of subjects in the 2 treatment
      groups (active treatment and placebo) who have pain relief at 2 hours after the completion of
      the double-blind treatment infusion. Pain relief is defined as a reduction in headache pain
      level from severe or moderate decreased to mild or headache-free, respectively.
