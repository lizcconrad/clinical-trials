    <textblock>
      This is an observational survey to assess the factors that influence adherence to Betaferon
      therapy in multiple sclerosis patients using elements of the BetaPlus support program,
      including the nurse support and auto-injectors. The patients were evaluated under normal
      clinical practice and were asked to fill out the quality of life FAMS questionnaire, Coping
      processes (WCQ) and depression questionnaire CES-D.
