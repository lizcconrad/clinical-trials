  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:

      - Cancer development is associated with problems in immune system functions, which prevent
      the body from attacking and destroying the abnormal cells that lead to tumor growth. Research
      has suggested that certain white blood cells, known as Th1 and Th2 T cells, are affected in
      individuals with some kinds of cancer -- when the proportion of Th2 cells is greater than Th1
      cells, the immune system s ability to fight off the growth of malignant tumors is weakened.
      Researchers are interested in determining if an infusion of specially modified Th1 cells, in
      addition to stem cell transplant, is a safe and effective treatment for individuals with
      forms of multiple myeloma that might not respond well to standard treatments alone.

      Objectives:

      - To determine the safety and effectiveness of the infusion of modified Th1 white blood
      cells, in conjunction with standard treatment, as a treatment for individuals who have been
      diagnosed with high-risk forms of multiple myeloma.

      Eligibility:

      - Individuals age 18 to 75 who have been newly diagnosed with high-risk multiple myeloma and
      who have received no or minimal treatment (4 months or less) yet..

      Design:

        -  Participants will be screened with a medical history, physical examination, blood and
           urine tests, and imaging studies. Some participants may also have a bone marrow or other
           type biopsy to evaluate the state of their disease.

        -  White blood cells will be collected from the participants through an apheresis
           procedure, which will collect and separate the white blood cells and return the rest of
           the blood to the participant.

        -  The collected cells will be grown and expanded under special conditions in the
           laboratory and stored frozen until participants receive all the standard of care
           treatment for multiple myeloma, including a stem cell transplant.

        -  Participants will receive an infusion of the modified Th1 cells a few weeks after the
           transplant, and will remain in the hospital for a few days after receiving the cells to
           monitor the possible immediate effects of the treatment.

        -  Participants will have regular follow-up visits to study the long-term effects of the
           modified Th1 cell infusion....

      Background:

        -  Autologous Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation (AHCT), which represents the standard of
           care for newly diagnosed Multiple Myeloma (MM), is not curative therapy. New approaches
           to prevent relapse after AHCT and to treat relapse are needed.

        -  In murine models, we used ex vivo culture to generate rapamycin-resistant, Th1/Tc1
           polarized T cells (Th1/Tc1.Rapa cells) that were both rapamycin-resistant and
           apoptosis-resistant with an increased in vivo survival and in vivo function.

        -  Because Th1 /Tc1 polarized lymphocytes are pivotal in anti-tumor effects, we hypothesize
           that adoptive transfer of Th1/Tc1Rapa cells will be of benefit to MM patients.

      Objectives:

      Primary

      Dose escalation study

      Evaluate the feasibility and toxicity of an infusion of autologous, ex vivo
      rapamycin-generated, anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 co-stimulated, Th1/Tc1 lymphocytes (Th1.rapa
      cells) in subjects diagnosed with high-risk multiple myeloma following AHCT.

      MM Relapse Prevention and Treatment Cohorts

        -  For Cohort A, in newly diagnosed MM patients who have received AHCT, evaluate the safety
           of a defined regimen of Th1/Tc1.Rapa cell therapy and determine progression-free
           survival.

        -  For Cohort B, in relapsed MM, determine the PR/CR rate of Th1/Tc1.Rapa cell therapy.

      Eligibility:

        -  For CohortA relapse prevention, patients with MM (normal- or high-risk) who are
           receiving induction therapy and subsequent AHCT.

        -  For Cohort B relapse therapy, patients with MM who have measurable disease after at
           least 2 prior treatment regimens.

      Design:

        -  For Cohort A, patients will receive two infusions of autologous Th1/Tc1.Rapa cells (at
           one and two months post-AHCT; each infusion preceded by a 7-day course of immune
           modulating chemotherapy [pentostatin plus low-dose cyclophosphamide; PC regimen].

        -  For Cohort B relapse therapy, patients will up to four infusions of Th1/Tc1.Rapa cells,
           with each infusion preceded by either a 7-day or 14-day PC regimen.

               2. presence of an abnormal serum free light chain (FLC) ratio on the serum FLC
                  assay.

        Criteria for Cohort B (multiply relapsed multiple myeloma):

          -  Must have measurable MM, as defined by: serum M-protein greater than or euqal to 1
             g/dL, urine M-protein greater than or equal to 200 mg/24 hours, involved serum free
             light chain (FLC) level greater than or equal to 10 mg/dL, biopsy proven plasmacytoma,
             or more than 30% bone marrow plasma cells.

          -  Must have received at least 2 different treatment regimens for MM.

        Other eligibility criteria (applies to both Cohort A and Cohort B, unless specified):

          -  Age greater than or equal to 18 years and less than or equal to 75 years. In subjects
             between 65 and 75 years of age, physiologic age and co-morbidity will be thoroughly
             evaluated before enrolling. Specifically, any history of cardio-vascular pathology or
             symptoms, not clearly fitting the exclusion criteria will prompt an evaluation by a
             Clinical Center Cardiologist and eligibility will be considered on a case-by-case
             basis.

          -  For Cohort A only, high-dose chemotherapy and AHCT must be planned; with amendment K,
             post-transplant maintenance therapy will not be permitted.

          -  Karnofsky performance status of 70% or greater. Lower KPS down to 50% may be

             to enrollment, Class III or IV heart failure according to NYHY, uncontrolled angina,
             severe uncontrolled ventricular arrhythmias, or electrocardiographic evidence of acute
             ischemia or active conduction system abnormalities.

          -  Patients with a history of coronary artery bypass grafting or angioplasty will receive
             a cardiology evaluation and be considered on a case-by-case basis.
