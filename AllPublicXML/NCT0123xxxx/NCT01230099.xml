  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Increasing use of intensive care therapies by an aging population has created a new medical
      syndrome - &quot;chronic critical illness&quot; - encompassing multi-system derangements, recurrent
      complications, and protracted/permanent dependence on mechanical ventilation and other
      life-supports. Numbering &gt;100,000 at any point in time, the chronically critically ill are a
      growing population of older adults and a serious national health problem. Annual expenditures
      for these patients are estimated at $24 billion, mostly for patients ≥ 65 years old. Yet
      6-month mortality rates exceed those for most malignancies, impairments are severe among
      survivors, and return to the community is rare. Descriptive research has identified domains
      of information that are important for decision-making by patients/families about continuation
      of treatment in the chronic phase of critical illness, but has also revealed that decisions
      are often made without this information or patient goals of care as a context. In acute
      critical illness, scheduled, structured meetings and printed informational aids are effective
      for Intensive Care Unit (ICU) families, but no study has tested an intervention to inform and
      support decision-making about chronic critical illness. This study is a randomized,
      controlled, multi-center clinical trial of such an intervention. Specific Aims are: (1) To
      evaluate the impact on family- and patient-focused outcomes of a proactive program of
      protocolized, interdisciplinary, informational support meetings led by a palliative care
      physician, plus a printed informational aid, for families of chronically critically ill
      patients; and (2) To evaluate the impact of this intervention on utilization of critical care
      resources for the chronically critically ill. We hypothesize that as compared to usual care
      plus the printed aid, this intervention will effectively inform decision-making, improve
      family well-being, promote discussion of preferences for patient goals of care, and optimize
      critical care resource utilization, without increasing patient mortality.
