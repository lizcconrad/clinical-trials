  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Current knowledge suggests that, to be successful, oral feeding in preterm babies should be
      initiated as soon as possible, often at an age where immature respiration still requires
      ventilatory support in the form of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP). While some
      neonatologist teams claim great success with initiation of oral feeding in immature babies
      with CPAP, others strictly wait for CPAP to be no longer necessary before any attempt at oral
      feeding. Such controversy is fuelled by ignorance of the effects of CPAP on nutritive sucking
      and swallowing, including their coordination with breathing, and the fear to induce
      deleterious problems such as pulmonary aspiration of milk and/or respiratory failure. Ensuing
      delay in becoming proficient with oral feeding unduly prolongs hospital stays of preterm
      babies.

      The aim of this study is to evaluate the effects of nasal CPAP on oral feeding in human
      neonates. More specifically, CPAP effects on nutritive sucking and swallowing, including on
      breathing-swallowing coordination, will be carefully assessed. The investigators hypothesize
      that nasal CPAP will lead to no or minimal alterations of breathing-nutritive swallowing
      coordination and will not induce deleterious cardiorespiratory events.

      Accordingly, each neonate will be evaluated during 2 bottle feedings spaced of 24 h, one with
      nasal CPAP 5 cm H2O and the other without any CPAP. Sucking and swallowing activity,
      respiration, heart rate and oxygenation will be continuously recorded before, during and
      after bottle-feeding.

      By filling a gap in knowledge, results from the study will hopefully help neonatologists
      afraid of doing more harm than good when initiating bottle-feeding in preterm babies under
      CPAP to join the many teams for whom it is no more a problem.
