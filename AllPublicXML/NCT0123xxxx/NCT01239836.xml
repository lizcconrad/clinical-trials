  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Urinary incontinence is a common and bothersome condition that remains frequently untreated
      among senior women. The aim of this trial is to compare the effectiveness of two
      community-based continence promotion interventions aimed at improving rates of self-care
      and/or professional health-care seeking in older women with urinary incontinence. The main
      hypothesis posits that participation in a constructivist interactive workshop combined with
      use of an evidence-based self-management tool will yield rates of improvement in incontinence
      frequency and reduce the cost of pad use by 20% compared to either intervention alone, which
      individually are expected to yield minimal effect sizes of at least 0.3 compared to a sham
      intervention.

      The research design is a 2x2 factorial open-label cluster randomised controlled trial. The
      cluster (unit of randomization) is at the level of each local community senior's group, from
      whence participants will be recruited. Incontinent community-dwelling older women aged 60
      years and older who have not sought care for their urinary symptoms in the last two years,
      but who experience incontinence at least twice weekly will be recruited through local
      community organizations. Eligible participants from each local community centre will be
      randomly assigned as a group to one of four interventions. The first intervention is
      participation in an interactive constructivist continence workshop. The second intervention
      involves receipt of an evidence-based self-management tool for incontinence. The third group
      will receive both interventions. The fourth group will act as the control group: they will
      simply be asked about their urinary symptoms and given a general talk on women's health. At
      the end of the study, the control group will be offered the self-management tool.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Women who have received treatment for their urinary incontinence within the past two
             years from a health care provider with expertise in urinary incontinence management
             (i.e. nurse practitioners/physicians/surgeons who have a clinical practice that
             focuses on treating urinary incontinence).

          -  Women started on medications for urinary incontinence (i.e. antimuscarinic medication)
             within the 6 months prior to enrolment.

          -  Women with a history of a neurological condition (e.g. Multiple Sclerosis and spinal
             cord injury) because they require further investigation. Women identified to have
             these historical findings will be advised to speak to their physician immediately
             about their incontinence and the possible need for investigation.

          -  Women who do not consent to participate.
