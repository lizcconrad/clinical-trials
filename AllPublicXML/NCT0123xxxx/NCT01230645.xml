    <textblock>
      RV568 is being developed for the treatment of diseases such as asthma, COPD and allergic
      rhinitis (e.g. hayfever). The main aim of this study is to investigate whether RV568 is
      effective in reducing the inflammation caused by viral infections such as RSV (respiratory
      syncytial virus).
