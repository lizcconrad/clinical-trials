      Primary Objectives:

      Study Part 1: Determine the selected dose of AVE1642 administered every 3 weeks based on
      pharmacokinetic (PK) (Clearance of AVE1642), pharmacodynamic (PD) (insulin-like growth factor
      1 [IGF-1] serum level) parameters, and eventual dose limiting toxicities (DLTs) in patients
      with recurrent, refractory multiple myeloma (MM).

      Study Part 2: Assess the safety of the combination of the selected dose of AVE1642 with the
      recommended dose of Velcade®.

      Secondary Objectives :

      Study Part 1:

        -  To assess the safety profile: type, incidence and intensity of drug related adverse
           events (AEs)

        -  To assess the biological activity of AVE1642 (saturation of the receptors and
           down-regulation) on malignant plasma cells and on peripheral blood mononuclear cells
           (PBMC) and granulocytes

        -  To assess the biological activity of AVE1642 on the signalization pathway of the IGF-1
           system (phosphorylated akt [pAkt], phosphorylated erk [pErk]) on malignant plasma cells
           when technically possible

        -  To define PK profile of AVE1642, and its PD effects on serum IGF 1, GF 2 and IGFBP-3

        -  To assess clinical efficacy (complete response [CR], partial response [PR], minimal
           response [MR] and stabilization) based on the European group for Blood and Marrow
           Transplantation (EBMT) criteria, when possible

        -  To assess potential immunogenicity by detection of human antihumanized antibodies (HAHA)
           anti-AVE1642

      Study Part 2:

        -  To detect any PK or PD interaction between AVE1642 and Velcade®

        -  To assess clinical efficacy (CR, PR, MR, no change [NC]) according to EBMT criteria when
           appropriate

        -  To assess biological activity of AVE1642 in combination with Velcade® on malignant
           plasma cells collected from bone marrow aspirates: saturation and down-regulation of the
           insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor (IGF-1R) and activity on the signalization pathway
           of the IGF-1 system (pAkt, pErk) when feasible

        -  To detect immunogenicity reaction (HAHA)

        -  To characterize PK and PD profile of a low dose (0.5 mg/kg) of AVE1642 expected to be
           non biologically active
