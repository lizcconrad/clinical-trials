        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Men and women with a confirmed diagnosis of leukemia unresponsive to curative therapy

          2. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0 to 2

          3. Total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 X upper limit of normal (ULN); aspartate transaminase (AST/SGOT)
             and alanine transaminase (ALT/SGPT) ≤ 3 X ULN; serum creatinine ≤ 2 X ULN

          4. Normal cardiac function with left ventricular ejection fraction ≥ 50% at screening

          5. No clinically significant abnormalities on screening electrocardiogram (ie, QTc
             interval must be &lt; 470 msec for women and &lt; 450 msec for men and no history of
             torsades de pointes)

          6. No reproductive potential or willing to use 2 methods of contraception during the
             study and for 30 days after the last dose

          7. Able to understand the purpose and risks of the study and provide informed consent and
             authorization to use protected health information

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. A life-threatening illness, medical condition or organ system dysfunction which, in
             the investigator's opinion, could compromise the subject's safety, interfere with the
             absorption or metabolism of oral SGI-1776, or put the study outcomes at undue risk

          2. Significant cardiovascular disease

          3. Malabsorption syndrome

          4. Symptomatic central nervous system metastases or lesions for which treatment is
             required

          5. Received prior radiation therapy within 4 weeks of first dose

          6. Grade ≥ 2 toxicity (other than alopecia) continuing from prior anticancer therapy
             including radiation

          7. Treatment with any investigational drug within 3 weeks of the first dose

          8. Use of systemic corticosteroids (other than for premedications or intermittent doses
             such as those used for allergic reactions and control of asthma) or myelosuppressive
             chemotherapy within 2 weeks of the first dose treatment with nitrosoureas or mitomycin
             C within 3 weeks of the first dose of SGI 1776

          9. Uncontrolled active systemic infections
