  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this trial is to investigate the efficacy and safety of different doses and
      dose administrations of FP187 compared to a placebo treatment in patients with moderate to
      severe plaque psoriasis.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The trial tests two different dose levels and two different daily dosing schedules (twice
      daily (BID) and three times daily (TID))over 20 weeks of treatment. Key is effect as measured
      by achievement of a 75% reduction in PASI after 20 weeks and safety monitored by adverse
      events and safety lab.

      There are 3 active arms:

        1. FP-187 at a daily dose of 750mg divided in three doses (250mg TID)

        2. FP-187 at a daily dose of 750mg divided in two doses (375mg BID)

        3. FP-187 at a daily dose of 500mg divided in two doses (250mg BID)

      and 1 placebo arm.

      An additional open (flexible dosing) treatment arm has been amended to the trial
