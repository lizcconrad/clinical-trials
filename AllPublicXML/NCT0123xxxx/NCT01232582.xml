  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic pain affects an estimated 50 to 65 million individuals in the US, and its incidence
      and prevalence is steadily on the rise in correspondence with the increasing longevity of the
      population. Spinal pain, encompassing lower back, thoracic and neck pain, is a very common
      type of chronic pain that can greatly reduce quality of life. Facet joint pain is most often
      associated with facet arthropathy or degenerative arthritis of the joint. This condition
      develops due to progressive wear and tear caused by the small but repetitive strain of the
      joints throughout a lifetime. Strain and inflammation can induce fluid distention of the
      joints which in turn can result in compression of the nerve roots of the joint - the origin
      of the chronic pain.

      Current treatments for facet arthropathy and pain include oral medications, intra-articular
      injections of anesthetic or steroid medications, energy ablation (e.g. radiofrequency
      ablation) for denervation, and in some severe cases facet rhizotomy (surgical severing of the
      nerves).

      The ExAblate magnetic resonance guided focused ultrasound system enables noninvasive focal
      ablation of tissue. Results from feasibility studies, including those from the FDA approved
      feasibility study (IDE # G050177) have shown the palliative effect of the ExAblate for
      patients with bone metastases. It is reasonable to assume that this palliative effect of
      MRgFUS could also translate to the alleviation of facet pain if focused ultrasound beams are
      directed to the facet joints. The highly-target focal ablation could also diminish the risk
      of complications that are often associated with other less selective denervation techniques.

      The objective of this trial is to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the ExAblate
      system and the treatment of pain resulting from facet joint osteoarthritis.

      This is a prospective, non-randomized, single-arm, phase I study to evaluate the safety and
      effectiveness of using ExAblate MRgFUS in the treatment of pain resulting from facet joint
      osteoarthritis.

      Patients with chronic LBP associated with one or more lumbar zygapophysial joints that meet
      all eligibility requirements and have given their written informed consent will be enrolled
      to the study.

      All patients will be treated and followed for 12-months post treatment. A total of 50
      patients will be enrolled at up to two clinical sites.

      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate incidence and severity of adverse events
      associated with the ExAblate MRgFUS system used for the treatment of pain resulting from
      facet joint osteoarthritis
