  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Contemporary treatment of inguinal hernia is generally based on surgical methods with the use
      of synthetic meshes. The implanted meshes however have some disadvantages: they increase the
      risk of infection, tend to sustain inflammation process, can generate chronic pain and
      fertility disorders, can move from the initial implantation site, increase costs of treatment
      etc. The research to find any new hernioplasty without the use of meshes is still going on.

      Desarda in 2002 year published his own results over hernia treatment with the use of external
      oblique aponeurosis. These results were comparable with the effects of Lichtenstein
      technique.

      The initial assessment done in our own department revealed good clinical results after hernia
      treatment with Desarda's method.

      To make appropriate and objective clinical assessment of the Desarda's technique for primary
      inguinal hernia treatment the randomized multicentre double blinded clinical trial (RCT) was
      projected and conducted. Finally, 105 patients were included in the Desarda group and 103 in
      the Lichtenstein group. Personal clinical follow up was made up to 3 years after operation.

      Generally no statistically significant differences were found between these groups. The only
      difference was higher rate of seroma after Lichtenstein technique and different pain
      perception in both groups. To the summary it is clear that Desarda technique is quite
      attractive and good proposition for operative hernia treatment without mesh. The RCT was done
      with the use of SharePoint Portal Server (Microsoft) which seems to be appropriate for
      clinical trials.
