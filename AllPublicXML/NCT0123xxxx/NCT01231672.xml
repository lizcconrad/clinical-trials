  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A prognostic score was proposed by the investigative team to predict death at 1 month. This
      score is based on certain biological markers, scored under emergency conditions in the first
      24 hours of routine clinical practice management for septic shock.

      The main objective of this multicenter study is to validate the performance of the score in
      terms of area under the ROC curve and negative predictive value.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There are two secondary objectives:

        -  Validate a prognostic score for death at the end of the first week from initial data.

        -  Validate a predictive score of disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) in patients
           with septic shock by comparing with the Gold Standard of the International Society on
           Thrombosis and Haemostasis (overt-DIC in the first 5 days after inclusion).

      As for the main objective, these scores are based on biological markers scored under
      emergency situations within the first 24 hours of routine clinical practice management for
      septic shock.

      The objectives and endpoints stated correspond to the protocol directly submitted to ethics
      authorities prior to the first inclusion and can be verified by contacting the Committee for
      the Protection of Persons Sud Mediterranée III (mail: CPP SUD-MEDITERRANEE III, UFR MEDECINE

    <description>The biological parameters measured at the time of admission to the intensive care unit and that make up the prognostic score for death at 1 month will be collected. The event &quot;death within 1 month&quot; will be analyzed. For patients discharged from service before the end of the first month, the clinician will still be informed concerning possible death.
The studied biological parameters correspond to routine coagulation and hematological parameters for patients in septic shock, according to SFAR (Société Française d'Anesthésie et de Réanimation) recommendations and the SRLF (Société de Réanimation de Langue Française) Consensus (2002).</description>

The event &quot;death within 1 week&quot; will be analyzed. For patients discharged from the department before the end of the first week, the clinician will still be informed of possible death. For the prognostic score at 1 week, a single biological parameter is used: fibrinogen. Age and SAPSII are also included in the score.</description>
