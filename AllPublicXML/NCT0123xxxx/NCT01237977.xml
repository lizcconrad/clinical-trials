  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test the hypothesis that the efficacy and safety of
      Meditoxin® are not inferior to Botox®'s in the treatment of glabellar lines.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The allocated subject is injected Investigational Product(Meditoxin® or Botox®) 20U in middle
      of the forehead. The efficacy and safety are evaluated for 16weeks through 4 follow up
      visits.

             test results at baseline visit (0 week) prior to the first injection.)

          -  Patients with the history of facial nerve paralysis or the symptoms of eyelid ptosis

          -  Patients with skin disorders or infection at the injection site

          -  Patients with the history of treatment of glabellar part(including forehead) like face
             lifting and permanent implant or with scars which may affect the treatment results

          -  Patients whose glabellar lines cannot be satisfactorily improved with physical method
             since the lines are not flattened even using hands

          -  Patients who have a plan to receive facial cosmetic procedures including dermal
             filler, photorejuvenation, chemical peeling and dermabrasion during the study period

          -  Patients who are unable to communicate or follow the instructions

          -  Patients who are not eligible for this study based on the judgment of an investigator
