      Cinobufacini has the effects of anticancer, improving the liver function, elevation of
      immunity and little side effects, and is important and significant for the patients with
      hepatitis, liver cirrhosis and hepatomas.

      Compared with transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) , the clinical effect of cinobufacini is
