      First, the investigators examined the functional relevance of serotonin transporter
      polymorphisms by quantifying the activity of serotonin transporter in blood platelets of
      genotyped healthy volunteers and patients with major depression.

      Second, the investigators studied response to SSRIs in relation to 5-HTTLPR genotype and also
      to the functional expression of 5-HTT in platelets.

      The purpose of this study is

        1. to determine whether serotonin transporter genotypic or functional differences between
           depressive patients and normal controls were existed.

        2. to determine the relationship between serotonin transporter polymorphisms and serotonin
           transporter functional expression.

        3. to determine whether genomic or functional differences between drug responders and
           nonresponders predict the response of antidepressant

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Eligible patients were enrolled in the clinical trials program of hte Samsung Medical
             Center Geropsychiatry and Affective Disorder Clinics(Seoul, Korea). They received a
             semistructured diagnostic interview, the Samsung Psychiatric Evaluation Schedule. The
             affective disorder section of the Samsung Psychiatric Evaluation Schedule uses the
             Korean version of the structured clinical interview for the diagnostic and statistical
             manual of mental disorders, Fourth edition.

          -  interview with one more patient's family member for objective diagnosis and final
             diagnosis decision by agreements of two more psychiatric physicians

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  received psychotropic medication within 2 weeks of the study or fluoxetine within 4
             weeks

          -  potential study participants for pregnancy, significant medical conditions, abnormal
             laboratory baseline values, unstable psychiatric features(eg.suicidal), history of
             alcohol of drug dependence, seizures, head trauma with loss of consciousness,
             neurological illness, or concomitant Axis I psychiatric disorder.
