  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In case of free flap failure, time is of utmost importance as salvage rates have been
      reported to be inversely related to the time interval between the onset of ischemia and its
      clinical recognition. Consecutively, monitoring of free flaps remains of major importance.
      Currently, combined Laser-Doppler and Spectrophotometry is available to determine
      microcirculation of free flaps in reconstructive surgery as a scientific method of reliable
      assessment of flap perfusion. The investigators thought to analyze the correlation of free
      flap skin temperature and free frap microcirculation as an accurate tool of postoperative
      flap monitoring.
