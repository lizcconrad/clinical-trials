      The purpose of the study is to assess the diagnostic performance of fully automated motion
      corrected (MC) first pass myocardial perfusion MRI, compared to the original non-corrected
      first pass myocardial perfusion images in a cohort of patients with suspected ischemic heart
      disease, using coronary angiography as the reference standard. It is expected that this
      improved comprehensive protocol for cardiac MRI be accurate at detecting significant coronary
      artery disease and may obviate the need for other more expensive and invasive diagnostic
      tests currently used.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Coronary heart disease is the leading cause of death and disability in the US, accounting for
      about one-third of all deaths in subjects over age 35.

      With the development of newer Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) techniques, such as faster
      pulse sequences and parallel imaging, cardiac MRI has become a routine tool for the
      evaluation and detection of myocardial ischemic disease. First pass myocardial perfusion
      (FPMP) using MRI is increasingly being used to assess ischemic heart disease. MRI offers the
      advantages of spatial resolution sufficient to differentiate between subendocardial and
      subepicardial perfusion; shorter examination time and also lack of ionizing radiation. Left
      ventricle cine gradient echo imaging can be used to assess regional ventricular function.
      Left ventricular myocardial viability can also be easily assessed at the same time in order
      to determine the amount of viable left ventricular myocardium and the percentage of
      irreversibly scarred myocardium by delayed enhanced images. Viability imaging is usually
      added to the perfusion protocol to increase specificity by allowing detection of fixed
      perfusion defects, which represent scar. The ultimate cardiac MRI protocol would be to
      combine both of these imaging strategies with a reliable and accurate coronary Magnetic
      Resonance Angiography(MRA) technique, such that obstructive coronary artery disease could be
      evaluated comprehensively at the same time. If all of these techniques can be combined
      together in a single study, it may be feasible to finally achieve a &quot;one stop shop&quot; for
      cardiac Magnetic Resonance Imaging.

    <description>The purpose of the study is to assess the incremental value of diagnostic performance using a fully-automated, motion-corrected (MC) first pass myocardial perfusion image acquisition protocol compared to images obtained under a non-corrected, breath-hold, shallow-breathing first pass myocardial perfusion image acquisition protocol in patients with suspected ischemic heart disease. The MR images resulting from two different image acquisition techniques, including Non-Corrected Breath-Hold Shallow-Breathing and Motion-Corrected, were assessed independently by two radiologists (average of 7 years of experience in reading cardiac MRI) using the American Heart Association modified 16 segment model and were evaluated using a four point Likert scale (1 = poor, 2 = fair, 3 = good, and 4 = excellent) for image quality</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Under an Institutional Committee on Human Research board approved protocol 80 patients with
        a suspected myocardial ischemic disease recruited from the cardiac cath laboratory will be
        recruited in this prospective study. Volunteers will be recruited for the purpose of
        protocol development and will not be included in analysis. All subjects will be screened
        for glomerular filtration rate (GFR) within 24 hours before the exam. All patients must

        <title>Magnetic Resonance Image Quality Rating</title>
        <description>The purpose of the study is to assess the incremental value of diagnostic performance using a fully-automated, motion-corrected (MC) first pass myocardial perfusion image acquisition protocol compared to images obtained under a non-corrected, breath-hold, shallow-breathing first pass myocardial perfusion image acquisition protocol in patients with suspected ischemic heart disease. The MR images resulting from two different image acquisition techniques, including Non-Corrected Breath-Hold Shallow-Breathing and Motion-Corrected, were assessed independently by two radiologists (average of 7 years of experience in reading cardiac MRI) using the American Heart Association modified 16 segment model and were evaluated using a four point Likert scale (1 = poor, 2 = fair, 3 = good, and 4 = excellent) for image quality</description>
