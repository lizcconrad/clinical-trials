    <textblock>
      Whole body diffusion-weighted imaging is a functional magnetic resonance imaging technique
      that characterizes tissue by probing changes in water diffusion secondary to differences in
      the tissue microstructure. These changes in water diffusion result in differences in signal
      intensity on diffusion-weighted-images that are quantified with the apparent diffusion
      coefficient (ADC). In malignant lesions, the extravascular extracellular space (EES) will be
      diminished, due to the increased number of cells. This will restrict water diffusion,
      identified by increased signal intensity (SI) on native DWI images and low ADC. Several
      studies indicate the value of DWI for differentiation of benign and malignant lymph nodes,
      detection of tumor recurrence and for ADC-based prediction of treatment outcome in various
      solid tumours (Koh DM et al, Am J Roentgenol 2007).

      Patients with a new diagnosis of Hodgkin or Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma (only diffuse large B-cell
      lymphoma, follicular lymphoma, mantle cell lymphoma and PTLD) will be included in the study.
      These patients will receive a WB-DWI scan before treatment, once or twice during treatment
      (depending on the type of lymphoma) and after the completion of the treatment. The MRI scan
      will be performed on a 3 Tesla-MRI system without contrast administration and without
      exposing the patient to radiation.

      Whole body diffusion-weighted images will be prospectively interpreted by two experienced
      radiologists, blinded to all clinical and imaging data. Findings will be correlated to
      FDG-18F-2-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose fluorodeoxyglucose , biopsies performed in clinical
      routine (bone marrow always - soft tissue lesions if indicated) and imaging follow-up.

      The purpose of this study is:

        -  to evaluate Whole body diffusion-weighted imaging for staging of lymphoma

        -  to evaluate Whole body diffusion-weighted imaging as an early predictive biomarker for
           treatment outcome

        -  to evaluate Whole body diffusion-weighted imaging for differentiating residual tumor
           from post therapy changes
