      BACKGROUND: Brain ischemia and injury are commonly contributed to perioperative morbidity and
      mortality after cardiac surgery. Remote ischemic preconditioning (RIPC) is a phenomenon
      whereby brief periods of ischemia followed by reperfusion in one organ provide systemic
      protection from prolonged ischemia. To investigate whether remote preconditioning protects
      the brain injury in patients undergoing elective cardiac surgery, a randomized trial will be
      performed in current study.

      DESIGNING 150 patients will be randomize assigned to cardiac surgery with RIPC or without
      RIPC (control). Remote ischemic preconditioning consist of three 5-min cycles of right upper
      limb ischaemia, induced by an automated cuff-inflator placed on the upper arm and inflated to
      200 mm Hg, with an intervening 5 min of reperfusion during which the cuff is deflated.
      Cerebral injury was assessed by S-100b, NSE, and neurological function scores in different
      time points.

      EXPECTED RESULTS RIPC will reduce the incidence of cerebral injury in cardiac surgery.

      CONCLUSIONS:

      In patients undergoing elective cardiac surgery, RIPC reduces the incidence of postoperative
      cerebral injury.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients diagnosed with acquired heart valve diseases scheduled for valve replacement
             or CABG

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Were unable to give informed consent

          -  Patients who presented with other systemic diseases such as hepatic,renal, and
             pulmonary diseases, or have had a heart operation before, were excluded.

          -  Additionally, patients taking antidiabetic sulfonylurea or glibenclamide were excluded
             because these agents have been shown to abrogate the cardioprotection elicited by
             ischemic preconditioning.
