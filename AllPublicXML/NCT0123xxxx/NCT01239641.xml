    <textblock>
      Uterine fibroids (leiomyomas) are common in reproductive aged women. Patients are seeking new
      ways to treat symptomatic uterine fibroids that allow them to avoid surgery. High intensity
      focused ultrasound therapy (HIFU) is a novel non-invasive method for uterine fibroid.
      Preliminary clinical studies proved HIFU ablation is a safe and effective technology.
      However, it is not clear whether HIFU has superiority over traditional surgery on
      satisfaction and adverse impact.The study is to confirm these questions.
