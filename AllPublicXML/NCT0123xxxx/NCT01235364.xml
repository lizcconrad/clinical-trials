    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess pain in women randomised to digital or speculum
      placement of a Foley catheter. Pain during cervical ripening with the Foley catheter is also
      to be evaluated as well as maternal satisfaction with induction of labour.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The most common method described for placing the Foley catheter is under direct visualisation
      of the cervix during a sterile speculum examination. Another method is to place the catheter
      during a digital cervical examination.

      Maternal discomfort/pain during speculum placement of the catheter has been evaluated in a
      few studies whereas studies that compare the digital method with the speculum method of
      placement are lacking.

      The visual analogue scale is used to subjectively assess pain. With a skin conductance
      algesimeter an objective assessment of pain is possible.
