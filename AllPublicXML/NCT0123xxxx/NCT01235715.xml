    <textblock>
      Application of &quot;Evicel&quot; hemostatic matrix during operation for unilateral total knee
      replacement surgery (TKA) will result in decreased bleeding and postoperative drain output, a
      reduction in transfusion requirements, and less reduction of hemoglobin.

    <description>Evicel is a fibrin sealant used for hemostasis when control of bleeding by ligature or other conventional procedures is ineffective or impractical. It has been shown to stop bleeding in 2 minutes or less. Evicel is a combination of a biologic activated component containing human fibrinogen and topical thrombin that functions on wet, actively bleeding tissue. It is a bioresorbable and biocompatible agent.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

        - Diagnosis of degenerative joint disease of the knee in patients medically suitable to
        undergo unilateral total knee arthroplasty

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Known allergies to human blood products.

          -  History of bleeding disorders.

          -  Patients with previous arthrotomy, however, with exception of medial or lateral
             menisectomy.

          -  Patients taking Lovenox, Plavix, Aggrenox or erythropoetin. (coumadin is acceptable)

          -  Additionally, any patient with an intra-operative complication (i.e bone fracture,
             vascular injury) or post-operative complication that would affect bleeding tendency
             will be excluded although data will be recorded for later analysis. Also, any patient
             who has a complication with the suction drain (eg inadvertently being pulled out,
             suction failing) will have the remaining data points recorded and drain measurements
             will be excluded from analysis.

          <title>Visual Analog Pain Scale (During Activity) at 6 Weeks</title>
          <description>The visual analog pain scale is a patient-reported measure of pain on a 10-point scale with 0 being no pain and 10 being worst possible pain. Drawings of faces indicate the level of pain associated with different points on the scale. For the measure of pain during, the patient indicates their level of pain while doing activities of daily living such as walking and moving from sitting to standing.</description>
