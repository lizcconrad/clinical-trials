  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators propose to evaluate the effects of avocado consumption (by incorporating 1
      unit of fruit per day into a healthy diet) on multiple cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk
      factors. The investigators will compare chronic consumption of a moderate fat blood
      cholesterol-lowering diet incorporating one avocado per day versus a blood
      cholesterol-lowering Lower-Fat diet on established CVD risk factors including lipids and
      lipoproteins, and blood pressure (BP). The investigators also will evaluate the effects of an
      avocado diet on several emerging CVD risk factors. To elucidate the specific benefits of
      avocado and its accompanying bioactives on the aforementioned risk factors, the investigators
      will compare the avocado diet with a diet that has the same macronutrient profile (but
      without the avocado).

    <textblock>
      A randomized, 3-period cross-over, controlled feeding study was designed to compare the
      effects of a moderate fat blood cholesterol-lowering diet that provides one avocado per day
      (total fat = 34% total energy, MUFA=18%, SFA &lt;7%) to an Average American diet (AAD),
      Lower-Fat diet (total fat = 24% total energy, SFA &lt;7%), and Moderate Fat diet (with
      equivalent fatty acid profile to the avocado diet) without avocado. The study population
      consists of 40 overweight (BMI25-35 kg/m2) men and women with moderately elevated LDL-C,
      between the25-90th percentiles from NHANES. The investigators hypothesize that a moderate fat
      heart-healthy diet, including 1 avocado per day will reduce CVD risk factors including
      lipids, lipoproteins, apolipoproteins, lipoprotein particle size, markers of oxidative stress
      and inflammation, blood pressure and reverse cholesterol transport compared to an AAD,
      Lower-Fat diet, and moderate fat diet without avocado.
