    <textblock>
      Reactive thrombocytosis (RT) in pediatric patients is common, but usually without symptoms.
      The incidence of RT is different depending on age. Mostly, we reasoned that RT is a
      phenomenon, nevertheless the diagnostic value of RT is little known. Therefore, the aim of
      this study was to determine the association of RT and clinical or laboratory characteristics
      in pediatric diseases.

        The investigators will enroll all pediatric hospitalized patients with platelet counts more
        than (500x109/l) at complete blood counts examination.The association of reactive
        thrombocytosis and clinical manifestation will be analyzed.
