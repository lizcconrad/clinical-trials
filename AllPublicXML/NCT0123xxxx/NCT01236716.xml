    <textblock>
      This trial is to study the efficacy of nab-PC vs. GC and evaluate toxicity of nab-PC in
      advanced squamous cell cancer of lung. The correlation between the efficacy of nab-PC and
      some biomarkers is also to be evaluated.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Albumin-bound paclitaxel(nab-P) utilizes the albumin binding proteins,such as
      (gp60)/caveolin-1 (CAV1) and SPARC(secreted protein acidic and rich in cysteine), achieving
      high intratumoral paclitaxel accumulation. It is reported that CAV1 is overexpressed in
      squamous cell cancer(SQC), so it is possible that nab-PC is more highly active than GC in SQC
      of lung.

             normal without liver metastasis, ALT and AST &lt; 5 x upper limit of normal with liver
             metastasis. Serum creatinine &lt; 1.5 x upper limit of normal.

          -  Urine pregnancy test is negative for woman.

          -  Estimated life expectancy is at least 3 months.

          -  Any physical examination finding, or clinical laboratory finding giving reasonable
             suspicion of a disease or condition that contraindicates the use of any study
             medication or render the subject at high risk from treatment.

          -  Central nervous system (CNS) tumor or metastatic tumor.

          -  Serious mental disorder.
