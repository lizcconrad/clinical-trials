      The purpose of this study is to assess if the GlideScope video laryngoscope is superior to
      the Macintosh direct laryngoscope for definitive airway management in acutely-injured
      patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      On admission to the emergency department following traumatic injury, many patients require
      placement of an artificial airway to support their breathing, provide oxygen and protect
      their airway. This procedure is accomplished through a number of different techniques and few
      studies have compared these techniques in order to establish the best method. We will compare
      an older technique using a metal handle and blade that allows for direct visualization of the
      vocal cords (direct laryngoscopy) to a newer technique that employs a fiberoptic bundle
      imbedded in a handle that allows indirect visualization of the vocal cords during placement
      of the artificial airway. The newer technique has the theoretical advantage of being more
      useful in patients with abnormal airways which are frequently encountered in trauma patients.
      Since both techniques are currently employed routinely in our institution, we will randomize
      all trauma admission to have an initial attempt with one of the two techniques in order to
      perform a randomized, unblinded trial.
