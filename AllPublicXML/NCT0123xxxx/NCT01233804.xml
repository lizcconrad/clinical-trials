  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare methods for consenting (opting in vs opting out) on
      influenza vaccine uptake rate in pregnant women. This study is designed to learn about the
      impact of influenza vaccination in pregnant women. This study will help gather knowledge
      about influenza vaccine side effects (if given) and whether the vaccine reduces the number of
      respiratory infection in mothers and their infants.

      Pregnant women who present for routine prenatal care when influenza vaccine is available
      would be eligible. Enrolled women would be randomized to either the Opting in (obtaining
      written consent to administer the vaccine) or Opting out (signing only to refuse the vaccine)
      study group (Part 1). Vaccine uptake rate and reason for refusal will be captured for
      enrollees. At the end of this clinic visit, enrollees will be asked if they are interested in
      participating in Part 2 and 3 of the study. If yes, consent will be obtained. Part 2 of the
      study, a random sample of 50 women will be called 2 days after enrollment to determine 1)
      vaccine side effects 2) recall of information provided in consent and 3) to confirm next
      followup visit with Obstetrician. During Part 3, at 6 weeks post EDD (estimated due date),
      data about episodes of respiratory illness in the mothers and their infants occuring between
      the time when influenza vaccine was offered (Part 1) and 6 weeks post-EDD will be abstracted
      using a standard form. Data will be collected retrospectively by research nurses.

    <description>Currently, pregnant women have to sign a consent stating that they want the influenza vaccine (at the clinics where the study is being conducted). Therefore, this group is the same as usual care. However, women will then be asked if they would like to take part in parts 2 and 3 of the study.</description>

    <description>Usual care is for pregnant women to sign a consent to get the influenza vaccine. The intervention is to offer a group of women the option to sign only when they refuse the influenza vaccine.</description>
