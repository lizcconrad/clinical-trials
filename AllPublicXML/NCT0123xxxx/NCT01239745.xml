  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This non-interventional study will be conducted in several Eastern European countries to
      assess the safety, tolerability and efficacy of Aromasin® when it is administered in
      real-word setting in postmenopausal women with invasive estrogen receptor positive early
      breast cancer , who are disease-free after completion of 2 to 3 years of tamoxifen and
      continue the treatment with Aromasin® until completion of 5 years of adjuvant hormonal
      therapy, to understand how Aromasin® is used in routine clinical practice, to assess
      adherence to prescribed Aromasin® treatment and to understand reasons for its early
      discontinuation.

      The study prematurely discontinued on October 11, 2011 due to slow enrollment. It should be
      noted that safety concerns have not been seen in this study and have not factored into this
      decision.

    <description>Counts of participants who had treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs), defined as newly occurring or worsening after first dose. Relatedness (to study drug) was assessed by the investigator (Yes/No). Participants with multiple occurrences of an AE within a category were counted once within the category.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline until death (up to Month 36)</time_frame>
    <description>Time in months from the start of study treatment to date of death due to any cause. OS was calculated as (the death date minus the date of first dose of study medication plus 1) divided by 30.4. Death was determined from adverse event data (where outcome was death) or from follow-up contact data (where the participant current status was death).</description>
