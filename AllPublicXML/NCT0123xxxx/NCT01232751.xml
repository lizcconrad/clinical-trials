  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Alleged benefits experienced by the consumption of soy in Asian countries have been
      attributed to the isoflavone content of soy products. Amongst other benefits, isoflavones are
      believed to relieve menopausal symptoms and are therefore often consumed in supplement form
      in Western countries. These supplements contain relatively high amounts of isoflavones, and
      the question is if these concentrations still exert beneficial effects or whether negative
      effects become dominant. Therefore, the investigators will study the effect of intake of one
      dose of isoflavones, as compared to placebo, for eight weeks on gene-expression in Peripheral
      Blood Mononuclear Cells (PBMCs) in post-menopausal, equol-producing women.

      Primary Objective: to determine the effect of intake of one dose of isoflavones, as compared
      to placebo, for eight weeks on gene-expression in Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells (PBMCs)
      in post-menopausal, equol-producing women.

      Secondary Objectives: to determine the association between isoflavone plasma levels and
      gene-expression in PBMCs; to determine the variation of isoflavone plasma levels between
      subjects after intake of isoflavones for four and eight weeks; to explore whether PBMC
      gene-expression markers identified after 8 weeks isoflavone intervention are already present
      after 4 weeks intervention; to explore whether the severity of previous menopausal complaints
      is related to the effect of isoflavones on PBMC gene-expression; and to explore the
      association between isoflavone levels in plasma and spot urine.

      Study design: Double-blind placebo controlled crossover intervention study

      Study population: Thirty-six healthy females, 45-70 years, post-menopausal and
      equol-producing

      Intervention: Two intervention periods of eight weeks with a isoflavone supplement or a
      placebo and a washout period of 8 weeks in between.

      Main study parameters/endpoints: The main study parameter is gene-expression in PBMCs
      measured by micro-arrays.

    <description>levels of the isoflavones genistein, dihydrogenistein, daidzein, dihydrodaidzein, equol and glycitein will be measured with High performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Following the intention to treat analysis, these concentration markers will be determined in order to correlate the gene-expression measured with quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (QPCR) with the isoflavone plasma levels, and to stratify for the plasma levels in per protocol analysis.</description>
