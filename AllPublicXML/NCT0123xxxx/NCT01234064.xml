      This is a pilot substudy to the PeriOperative ISchemic Evaluation-2 Trial (POISE-2), to
      assess the feasibility of adding graduated compression stockings (GCS) to POISE-2 as an
      intervention.

      Objective: To determine if thigh-level graduated compression stockings (below-knee graduated
      compression stockings may be used if thigh level graduated compression stockings are not
      feasible, such as after knee surgery), started before surgery and worn until discharge and
      for a minimum of 10 days (whichever is longer), reduce symptomatic venous thromboembolism
      (proximal deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism) in the 30 days after surgery.

    <description>The primary outcome to assess efficacy will be a comparison of the proportion of patients who have objectively confirmed symptomatic major venous thromboembolism (defined as proximal deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism) within 30 days of randomization (includes episodes that are diagnosed in response to symptoms reported at the 30 day assessment).</description>

    <description>Secondary outcomes to assess efficacy will include patients who, within 30 days, have any symptomatic venous thromboembolism (defined as deep vein thrombosis [including that which is confined to the calf veins] or pulmonary embolism) within 30 days of randomization.</description>

    <description>Harm from graduated compression stockings will be assessed as proportion of patients who develop: 1) a new or worsening skin rash that required new, or an increase of, topical or systemic treatment; 2) blistering (defined as at least one blister &gt;1cm in length); 3) pressure sores (minimum of non-blanchable erythema of intact skin); and 4) leg or foot ischaemia (defined as new symptoms (cold, painful, numbness) or new signs (pulseless, cold, absent skin perfusion on release of pressure, absent sensation) that are attributed to ischaemia by a physician.</description>

    <criteria>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Randomized to PeriOperative ISchemic Evaluation-2 Trial (POISE-2 Trial)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Unable to wear a graduated compression stockings on a leg that has been operated on
             (e.g., below knee skin grafting)

          -  Leg has not been operated on and graduated compression stockings cannot be worn on
             either leg (e.g. bilateral leg amputations or skin ulceration, allergy to material in
             the graduated compression stockings)

          -  Graduated compression stockings cannot be fitted because the patient's legs are too
             big, or too small (not compatible with manufacturer's recommendations)

          -  The responsible physician/nurse judges that graduated compression stockings are
             contraindicated because of: i) decreased circulation in the legs as evidenced by very
             pale, cyanotic, or gangrenous conditions; or ii) risk of stocking-induced skin
             necrosis due to an established sensory neuropathy with numbness to touch.
