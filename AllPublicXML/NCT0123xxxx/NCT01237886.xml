  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Knowing when to liberate patients from mechanical ventilation (i.e. removal of breathing or
      endotracheal tube or extubation) is critically important, as both prolonged ventilation and
      failed extubation are both associated with harm and risk of death. Our objective is to
      improve the safety of extubation by harnessing hidden information contained in the patterns
      of variation of heart and respiratory rate measured over intervals-in-time. Currently, to
      assess a patient's ability to be extubated, a spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) is routinely
      performed, where the level of ventilator support is reduced, and their response is observed
      in order to help predict if they will tolerate extubation (i.e. complete removal of
      ventilator support). Given that health is associated with a high degree of variation of
      physiologic parameters (e.g. heart and respiratory rate), and illness &amp; stress are associated
      with a loss of variability, the investigators aim to uncover the loss of variation as a
      measure of stress during SBT's. The investigators hypothesize that maintaining stable heart
      rate and respiratory rate variability (HRV and RRV) throughout the SBT will predict
      subsequent successful extubation, and conversely, a reduction in either HRV or RRV manifest
      during a SBT predicts extubation failure. A pilot study has demonstrated feasibility, and
      compelling preliminary results. A website, centralized data storage and analysis, and a
      trans-disciplinary team of scientists are in place to definitively test this novel
      technology. Determination of when to extubate critically ill patients remains a high-stakes
      clinical challenge; and improved prediction of extubation failure has potential to save lives
      and reduce costs in critically ill patients.
