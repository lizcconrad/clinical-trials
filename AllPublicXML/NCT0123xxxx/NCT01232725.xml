  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Breastfeeding is an important health-promoting behavior. Human milk is the ideal diet for all
      infants, optimizes intellect, and provides protection against infectious and atopic diseases
      in childhood as well as decreasing risks for obesity, hypertension and other chronic
      diseases. Infants with the highest risk of life-long disability, very low birthweight (VLBW)
      preterm infants, are breastfed at some of the lowest rates in the US. Maternal milk is not
      always available, and pasteurized donor human milk is an alternative that requires
      investigation. Whether donor milk conveys health and developmental advantages similar to
      those bestowed by maternal milk is unknown. By determining the effects of donor milk on
      health and developmental outcomes when compared to preterm infant formula, the investigators
      seek to optimize outcomes in this fragile population. The hypothesis of our donor milk
      research is that a donor human milk diet in non-maternal milk fed VLBW infants is associated
      with better neurodevelopmental outcome scores at 18-22 months adjusted age than a preterm
      infant formula diet.
