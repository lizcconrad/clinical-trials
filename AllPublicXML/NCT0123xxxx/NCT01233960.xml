  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To provide open-label re-treatment with PROCHYMAL to subjects enrolled in companion Protocol
      603 to evaluate the safety in subjects with active Crohn's disease who are resistant to
      standard Crohn's disease therapies.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Subjects will receive infusions of PROCHYMAL on Day 42, Day 84, and Day 126 after initial
      infusion of PROCHYMAL in Protocol 603. Each infusion will contain 200 million cells. As
      subjects will be required to be in Protocol 603 during the entire duration of their
      participation in Protocol 611, all concomitant medication and safety information will be
      monitored by Protocol 603 and the combination of data from the two protocols
