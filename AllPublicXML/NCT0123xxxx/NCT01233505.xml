  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase I trial is studying the side effects and the best dose of veliparib when given
      together with capecitabine and oxaliplatin in treating patients with advanced solid tumors.
      Veliparib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell
      growth. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as capecitabine and oxaliplatin, work in different
      ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from
      dividing. Giving veliparib together with capecitabine and oxaliplatin may kill more tumor
      cells.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the dose limiting toxicities (DLTs) and the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of
      ABT-888 (veliparib) in combination with oxaliplatin and capecitabine in advanced solid
      tumors.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the pharmacokinetics of ABT-888, oxaliplatin, and capecitabine when
      administered concomitantly.

      II. To evaluate the safety and tolerability of the ABT-888 in combination with capecitabine
      and oxaliplatin.

      III. To assess for evidence of anti-tumor activity with this combination, per tumor
      measurements using RECIST criteria, in these patients.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the inhibition of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) in peripheral blood
      mononuclear cells secondary to treatment with ABT-888.

      II. To determine the pharmacokinetics of ABT-888 in combination with oxaliplatin and
      capecitabine and the relation to treatment side effects.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of veliparib.

      Patients receive veliparib orally (PO) twice daily and capecitabine PO twice daily on 1-7 and
      15-21, and oxaliplatin intravenously (IV) over 2 hours on days 1 and 15. Courses repeat every
      28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients undergo blood and urine sample collection at baseline and periodically during study
      for pharmacokinetic and poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibition studies.

      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed up for 30 days.
