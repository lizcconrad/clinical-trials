      The purpose of this study is to determine the appropriate dose of AEZS-108 to treat patients
      with a tumor of the urinary system.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      AEZS-108 is an investigational drug, combining luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH),
      an hormone and doxorubicin (a drug approved to treat different types of cancer).

      Some tumors, such as those found in the urinary system (also called urothelial carcinomas),
      have LHRH hormone receptors to which the LHRH hormone part of AEZS-108 is attracted.

      AEZS-108 is expected to work by accumulating mostly on the surface of cancer cells that have
      LHRH hormone receptors and by delivering doxorubicin more directly into the cells to kill
      them. This would allow the use doxorubicin at lower doses and thus would cause less toxicity.

      In the first part of the study, the appropriate dose of AEZS-108 will be determined based on
      its side effects. The best dose will be the highest one without severe side effects.

      In the second part of the study, this best dose of AEZS-108 will be given to determine its
      efficacy to stop the tumor from progressing.

    <intervention_model_description>Phase 1 : conventional 3+3 design. Phase 2: Simon's two-stage design will be utilized. In Stage I, 22 patients will be treated with the dose determined in Phase I. The study will be terminated for futility if no more than 2 patients out of the 22 patients in Stage I are responders. If 3 or more responders are observed, an additional 18 patients will be enrolled. If at least 8 out of the 40 patients are responders, the treatment will be considered worthy of further development.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>Determination of maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and recommended parenteral administration dosing for AEZS-108 in 4 sequential cohorts of patients (3-6 patients/cohort).
Patients will be enrolled in cohorts of 3 at a specified AEZS-108 dose beginning with 160mg/m^2. Enrollment will be suspended until all members of a cohort have been observed for dose limiting toxicities (DLT) for a period of 3 weeks (1 cycle of AEZS-108) from initial treatment with AEZS-108. Dose escalation will proceed within each cohort according to a specific scheme where DLT is defined.</description>
