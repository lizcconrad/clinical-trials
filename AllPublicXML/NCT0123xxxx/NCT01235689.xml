  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study was to demonstrate that tight control of disease
      activity, using stringent criteria based on Crohn's disease activity Index (CDAI), biomarkers
      (high sensitivity C-reactive protein [hs-CRP] and fecal calprotectin), and corticosteroid
      use, improves the rate of mucosal healing 48 weeks after randomization compared with
      management using less stringent criteria based only on CDAI and corticosteroid use.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study included a 1- to 3-week screening period, up to 8 weeks of prednisone run-in
      treatment, a 48-week post-randomization treatment period, and a 70 day follow-up phone call
      or clinic visit, for a total duration of up to 69 weeks.

      Participants who met entry criteria were enrolled and initiated an oral prednisone regimen at
      Baseline (Week 0). At the first key visit, participants were randomized into 1 of 2 groups
      (Tight Control group or Clinically Driven group), with stratification according to screening
      smoking status, weight, and disease duration.

      The first key visit was the randomization visit; subsequent key visits occurred every 12
      weeks following the first key visit. Randomization normally took place 9 weeks after
      Baseline. However, participants who fulfilled the early randomization criteria may have been
      randomized as early as the Baseline (Week 0) visit. Therapeutic option changes, if
      appropriate, occurred at key visits based on results from previous success criteria visits.

    <measure>Percentage of Participants With Mucosal Healing and No Deep Ulcerations</measure>
    <time_frame>48 weeks after Randomization</time_frame>
    <description>Percentage of participants with mucosal healing (defined as Crohn's disease endoscopy Index of severity [CDEIS] &lt; 4) and no deep ulcerations on ileocolonoscopy (defined as the absence of all deep ulcerations in all segments explored in CDEIS) at 48 weeks after randomization (48 weeks after the 1st Key visit). The ileocolonoscopies were evaluated by the site.
CDEIS is an index for determining the severity of Crohn's disease. The CDEIS considers deep ulcerations, superficial ulcerations, ulcerated and non-ulcerated surface, and the presence of ulcerated/non-ulcerated stenosis evaluated in 5 pre-defined segments of the colon (ileum, ascending colon, transverse colon, descending colon and sigmoid loop, and rectum). The score ranges from 0 to 44 where higher scores indicate more severe endoscopic activity.

    <description>The Crohn's Disease Activity Index (CDAI) is a research tool used to quantify the symptoms of patients with Crohn's disease. Participants were asked to record the frequency of stools, abdominal pain and general well-being on a daily basis. In addition to the diary data, the investigator assessed the following for the calculation of CDAI: presence of complications (arthritis/arthralgia, iritis/uveitis, erythema nodosum/pyoderma gangrenosum/aphthous stomatitis, anal fissure/fistula/abscess, other fistula, and fever), the use of antidiarrheal medicines, presence of an abdominal mass, hematocrit, and body weight. The CDAI is the sum of the products of each item multiplied by a weighting factor and generally ranges from 0 up to 600, where remission of Crohn's disease is defined as CDAI &lt; 150, and severe disease is defined as CDAI &gt; 450.

    <description>Participants with normal thiopurine methyltransferase (TPMT) enzyme activity could receive oral azathioprine 2.5 mg/kg/day. In participants with intermediate TPMT enzyme activity azathioprine was initiated at a dose of 1.25 mg/kg/day. The dose of azathioprine was adjusted according to abnormalities of white blood cell (WBC) count, platelet count, liver function tests (LFTs; i.e. alanine transaminase [ALT], aspartate transaminase [AST], alkaline phosphatase), lipase, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), and serum creatinine.</description>

    <participant_flow>
      <recruitment_details>This study was conducted at 59 sites in Canada, European Union, Israel, Japan, Russia, South Africa, Switzerland, Turkey, and the Ukraine.
The study included a screening period, up to 8 weeks of prednisone run-in treatment, a 48-week post-randomization treatment period, and a 70 day follow-up phone call or clinic visit.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>A total of 252 participants were enrolled and received study treatment, of whom
165 entered the prednisone run-in
157 randomized (45 prior to Week 9, 112 at Week 9)
8 discontinued prior to randomization.
87 randomized at Baseline.
Randomization was stratified by smoking status, weight, and disease duration.</pre_assignment_details>

          <title>Clinically Driven Management</title>
          <description>Participants randomized to receive management of disease activity using criteria based on Crohn's Disease Activity Index (CDAI) and corticosteroid use.
Participants received customized therapy that could include prednisone, adalimumab, and azathioprine.
Participants who randomized at Week 9 meeting success criteria started with no therapy; participants who randomized prior to Week 9 or who randomized at Week 9 but did not meet the success criteria began treatment with adalimumab.
Therapy was escalated according to pre-specified failure criteria using less stringent criteria:
At Key Visit 1 the criteria for management of disease activity were a CDAI decrease ≥ 70 (CR-70) compared to Baseline or CDAI &lt; 200 at 1 week prior to the visit. At Key Visits 3, 4, and 5 (every 12 weeks after Key visit 1), the criteria for a change in treatment were a CDAI decrease of ≥ 100 (CR-100) compared to Baseline or CDAI &lt; 200, and absence of prednisone during the preceding week.</description>

          <description>Participants randomized to receive management of disease activity using criteria based on Crohn's Disease Activity Index (CDAI), high sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), fecal calprotectin, and corticosteroid use.
Participants received customized therapy that could include prednisone, adalimumab, and azathioprine. Participants who randomized at Week 9 meeting success criteria started with no therapy; participants who randomized prior to Week 9 or who randomized at Week 9 but did not meet the success criteria began treatment with adalimumab.
Therapy was escalated according to pre-specified tight control criteria: At Key Visit 1 the success criteria were CDAI &lt; 150, hs-CRP, &lt; 5 mg/L, fecal calprotectin &lt; 250 μg/g, and absence of prednisone use. At Key Visits 3, 4, and 5 (every 12 weeks after Key visit 1), the criteria were CDAI &lt; 150, hs-CRP &lt; 5 mg/L, fecal calprotectin &lt; 250 μg/g, and absence of prednisone during the preceding week.</description>

The CDEIS considers deep ulcerations, superficial ulcerations, ulcerated and non-ulcerated surface, and the presence of ulcerated/non-ulcerated stenosis evaluated in 5 pre-defined segments of the colon (ileum, ascending colon, transverse colon, descending colon and sigmoid loop, and rectum). The score ranges from 0 to 44 where higher scores indicate more severe endoscopic activity.</description>

          <title>Crohn's Disease Activity Index (CDAI)</title>
          <description>CDAI is a tool used to quantify the symptoms of patients with Crohn's disease. Participants were asked to record the frequency of stools, abdominal pain and general well-being on a daily basis. In addition to the diary data, the investigator assessed the following for the calculation of CDAI: presence of complications, the use of antidiarrheal medicines, presence of an abdominal mass, hematocrit, and body weight. The CDAI is the sum of the products of each item multiplied by a weighting factor and generally ranges from 0 up to 600, where higher scores indicate more severe disease.</description>

CDEIS is an index for determining the severity of Crohn's disease. The CDEIS considers deep ulcerations, superficial ulcerations, ulcerated and non-ulcerated surface, and the presence of ulcerated/non-ulcerated stenosis evaluated in 5 pre-defined segments of the colon. The range of the score is from 0 to 44 where higher scores indicate more severe endoscopic activity.

        <title>Change From Baseline in CDEIS at 48 Weeks After Randomization</title>
        <description>CDEIS is an index for determining the severity of Crohn's disease. The CDEIS considers deep ulcerations, superficial ulcerations, ulcerated and non-ulcerated surface, and the presence of ulcerated/non-ulcerated stenosis evaluated in 5 pre-defined segments of the colon (ileum, ascending colon, transverse colon, descending colon and sigmoid loop, and rectum). The score ranges from 0 to 44 where higher scores indicate more severe endoscopic activity. A negative change from Baseline indicates improvement.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in CDAI Over Time</title>
        <description>The Crohn’s Disease Activity Index (CDAI) is a research tool used to quantify the symptoms of patients with Crohn's disease. Participants were asked to record the frequency of stools, abdominal pain and general well-being on a daily basis. In addition to the diary data, the investigator assessed the following for the calculation of CDAI: presence of complications (arthritis/arthralgia, iritis/uveitis, erythema nodosum/pyoderma gangrenosum/aphthous stomatitis, anal fissure/fistula/abscess, other fistula, and fever), the use of antidiarrheal medicines, presence of an abdominal mass, hematocrit, and body weight. The CDAI is the sum of the products of each item multiplied by a weighting factor and generally ranges from 0 up to 600, where remission of Crohn's disease is defined as CDAI &lt; 150, and severe disease is defined as CDAI &gt; 450. A negative change from Baseline indicates improvement.</description>

        <title>Change in Crohn's Disease Behavior According to Montreal Classification</title>
        <description>Participants' Crohn's Disease was classified according to the Montreal Classification which classifies CD according to its predominant phenotypic elements (age at diagnosis, location, and disease behavior) based on the results of clinical examination and endoscopy.
Disease behavior was classified according to the following:
B1 = non-stricturing, non-penetrating; B2 = structuring; B3 = penetrating; P = perianal disease modifier.
The change in Montreal Classification is presented in three categories: no change, deterioration, and improvement. Deterioration was defined as an increase in behavior index between 1 and 3, or development of perianal disease. Participants with missing data at Week 48 were classified as deterioration.</description>

        <description>The WPAI:CD questionnaire was used to assess impairments in both paid work and unpaid work due to symptoms of Crohn's Disease. The self-administered questionnaire consisted of 6 questions.
Work time missed was defined as the percentage of time absent from work due to Crohn’s disease in the past week.
Impairment while working is the participant’s assessment of the degree to which Crohn’s disease affected productivity while working in the past 7 days.
Total work productivity impairment takes into account both hours missed due to Crohn’s disease symptoms and the patient's assessment of the degree to which Crohn’s disease affected their productivity while working.
Total activity impairment is the percent impairment of non-work related activities due to Crohn’s disease.
WPAI outcomes are expressed as impairment percentages, with higher numbers indicating greater impairment and less productivity. A negative change from Baseline indicates improvement.</description>

        <description>The Medical Outcome Study Short Form 36-Item Health Survey (SF-36), Version 2 is a self-administered instrument that measures the impact of disease on overall quality of life and consists of 36 questions in eight domains (physical function, pain, general and mental health, vitality, social function, physical and emotional health).
The physical component summary (PCS) score summarizes the subscales physical functioning, role-physical, bodily pain, and general health. The mental component summary (MCS) score summarizes the subscales vitality, social functioning, role-emotional, and mental health. Each score ranges from 0 to 100 where higher scores indicate a better quality of life. A positive change from Baseline score indicates an improvement.</description>
