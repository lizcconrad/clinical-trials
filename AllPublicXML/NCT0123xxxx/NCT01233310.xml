      Study Hypothesis:

      It is estimated that by re-programming some of the PillCam COLON2 system parameters it can
      serve as tool for visualizing both small bowel and colon. As such, the system may be utilized
      in CD patients for monitoring mucosal healing.

      Primary objectives:

      To evaluate two different video output methods in the visualization of the SB and colon in CD
      patients

      Secondary objectives:

        -  Evaluate the level of agreement between PillCam system and ileocolonoscopy on the
           assessment of CD findings.

        -  Evaluate the effectiveness of PillCam regimen in CD patients

      Inclusion criteria

        -  Patient is 18 years of age and above

           endoscopical, histopathological and/or radiological parameters

        -  Patients' CDAI &gt;150.

        -  Patient is clinically indicated to undergo ileocolonoscopy for assessment of Crohn's
           disease

           investigator, e.g. CT enterography, performed within the 3 months prior to enrollment

        -  Patient suffers from hypertension and is taking one or more of the following medications
           used for control of hypertension: diuretics, ACE inhibitors, Angiotensin II blockers

        -  Chronic use of laxatives

        -  Patient has a cardiac pacemakers or other implanted electro medical devices.

           during the study period, or are of child-bearing potential and do not practice medically
           acceptable methods of contraception.

        -  Patient is expected to undergo MRI examination within 7 days after ingestion of the
           capsule.

        -  Patient has had prior abdominal surgery of the gastrointestinal tract other than
           uncomplicated procedures that would be unlikely to lead to bowel obstruction based on
           the clinical judgment of the investigator.

        -  Patient has any condition, which precludes compliance with study and/or device
           instructions.

        -  Patient suffers from life threatening conditions

        -  Patient is currently participating in another clinical study

        -  Patient has known slow gastric emptying time

        -  Patient is allergic or contraindicated to any of the study medications

      Study design: Multi-center, prospective study Number of subjects: Up to 30 study duration: up
      to 18 months Subject population: Subjects with moderate to severe Crohn's disease
      demonstrating colon involvement who are indicated to undergo standard ileocolonoscopy as part
      of their disease management

      Study Design:

        1. Each patient will undergo PillCam, procedure followed by conventional ileocolonoscopy
           procedure with intubation of the terminal ileum

        2. During the ileocolonoscopy procedure, the colonoscopist will document his findings
           according to the parameters defined in the SES-CD score and the overall assessment in
           the following segments:

             1. Rectum

             2. Left colon (including sigmoid)

             3. Transverse colon

             4. Right colon

             5. Terminal ileum

        3. Cleansing level for the ileocolonoscopy procedure will be assessed at each site

        4. From each capsule endoscopy procedure two RAPID video versions will be generated and
           segmented into segments

        5. A committee composed of the study investigators will review all the RAPID video segments
           and document their findings according to the parameters defined in the SES-CD, Lewis and
           CECDAI scoring systems and an overall assessment

        6. The parameters for each segment per each of the two RAPID movies will be compared and
           the preferable video setup will be chosen

        7. Final RAPID and colonoscopy movies will be de-identified in regards to patient and site
           identity

        8. The preferable full RAPID version will be reviewed by investigators which will document
           their findings according to the parameters defined in the SES-CD scoring system and
           overall assessment

        9. cleansing level for the capsule procedure will be assess

      The above evaluations per each subject will be within 24 from end of rocedure.
