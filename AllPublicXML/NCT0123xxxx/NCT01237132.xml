    <textblock>
      The current treatment guidelines of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) of the American and
      European Associations for the Study of Liver Disease are based on the
      Barcelona-Clinic-Liver-Cancer classification (BCLC), which does not recommend surgery in
      patients with large, multinodular and macrovascular invasive disease. The aim of this study
      was to investigate the role of hepatic resection in a large retrospective multicentric cohort
      of patients resected for HCC regardless of the BCLC indications.
