  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Public Health Agency of Canada estimates that over 3.5 million Canadians live with
      chronic respiratory diseases, such as COPD (chronic bronchitis and emphysema), asthma, sleep
      apnea, and lung cancer. Nova Scotia has been reported to have one of the highest rates of
      chronic lung disease among Canadian provinces, likely a reflection of both the age of the
      population and high rates of exposures to occupational dusts and smoking. Pulmonary
      rehabilitation is a multidisciplinary intervention, involving exercise and education for
      patients with chronic lung disease. Pulmonary rehabilitation has been demonstrated to improve
      patient symptoms, exercise capacity, and quality of life while reducing health resource
      utilization. Many studies have shown that the benefits of pulmonary rehabilitation tend to
      diminish over time after program completion. The best interventions to maintain the benefits
      of pulmonary rehabilitation remain unclear.

      The purpose of this study is to validate incorporation of an exercise DVD into a maintenance
      program after pulmonary rehabilitation. 100 subjects will be recruited over 2-years from
      pulmonary rehabilitation programs at Capital Health, with 50 individuals randomized to usual
      care following PR and 50 individuals randomized to usual care plus the exercise DVD. Study
      subjects will be evaluated at time of enrolment in pulmonary rehabilitation, at completion of
      pulmonary rehabilitation and 6-months post- pulmonary rehabilitation. Study outcome measures
      will include exercise capacity, exercise compliance, health-related quality of life,
      confidence with performing exercise, and satisfaction with the exercise DVD. The primary
      outcome measure will be a change in functional exercise capacity as determined by the
      distance walked in 6-minutes, a commonly used and validated assessment tool for patients with
      chronic lung disease.
