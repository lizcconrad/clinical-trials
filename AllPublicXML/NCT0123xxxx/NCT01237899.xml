    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the safety and tolerability of LY2623091 after
      multiple oral dosing in healthy men and women of non-childbearing potential. Two cohorts of
      16 subjects will participate in 2 dosing periods. Treatment assignment will be double-blind
      for LY2623091 and placebo(negative control), and open label for eplerenone(positive control).

                  surgical sterilization (hysterectomy, bilateral oophorectomy or tubal ligation)
                  or menopause. They should be a minimum of 12 months without a menstrual period.
                  Peri-menopausal women who are 6 months without a menstrual period.

          -  Have clinical laboratory test results within the normal reference range for the
             population or study site, or test results with acceptable deviations that are judged
             by the Investigator not to be clinically significant.

          -  Have venous access sufficient to allow blood sampling per the protocol.

          -  Have serum potassium levels within the normal range.

          -  Are nonsmokers or smokers of less than or equal to 10 cigarettes per day.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Are currently enrolled in, or have discontinued, within 60 days inclusive, a clinical
             trial involving an investigational drug, device or an off-label use of an approved
             drug, or are concurrently enrolled in any other type of medical research judged to be
             scientifically or medically incompatible with this study. Subjects who meet any of
             these criteria may be enrolled in this study but they cannot be dosed until at least
             60 days following the last day of the previous investigational trial.

             medical problem that would preclude study participation.

          -  Have an abnormality in the 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG), which increases the risks
             associated with participation in the study.

          -  Are unwilling or unable to comply with the use of an electronic data capture system.
