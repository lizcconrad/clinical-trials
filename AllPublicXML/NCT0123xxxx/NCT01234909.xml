  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Atopic dermatitis is a chronic skin disease with pruritus as one of its main features.
      Because of the symptomatic nature of their condition, pediatric patients with atopic
      dermatitis may preferentially seek care in the subspecialty dermatology clinic while falling
      behind in visits to their primary care provider. This cross-sectional study in patients
      attending the Dermatology Clinic at Children's Hospital of Wisconsin will screen for common
      conditions associated with atopic dermatitis and subsequently treat or refer patients for
      appropriate care. The investigators hypothesize that Milwaukee County pediatric patients with
      atopic dermatitis will have a high prevalence of asthma needing treatment, missed
      immunizations requiring catch-up, and vitamin D deficiency necessitating replacement therapy.
