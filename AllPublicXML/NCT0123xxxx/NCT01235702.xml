      A 12-week treatment/control trial was implemented to assess the effects of a multi component
      lifestyle program on improvements in body mass index, weight, perceived stress and blood
      pressure in African American men and women who were at increased risk for cardiovascular
      disease. It was hypothesized that treatment group would experience significant improvements
      when compared to the control group.
