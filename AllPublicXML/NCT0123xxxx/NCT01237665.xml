      This is a prospective open label single-arm, single-institution phase II clinical trial to
      test the efficacy of neoadjuvant treatment with IXO (Irinotecan, Capecitabine [Xeloda],
      Oxaliplatin) followed by chemoradiotherapy and resection in patients with resectable
      non-metastatic primary rectal cancer of stage cT3-T4 N0-N2.
