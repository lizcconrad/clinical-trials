  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the probable benefit of CryoValve SG Aortic Human
      Heart Valve used in pediatric patients as an aortic valve replacement.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The CryoValve SG aortic human heart valve is recovered from deceased human donors, treated
      with the SynerGraft® (SG) process,which is designed to reduce the donor cells present on the
      graft. The valve is then cryopreserved for storage until use. Removing cells from the heart
      valve has been shown to reduce a component of the immune response after implant compared to a
      standard allograft valve. However, it is not known how this affects the long-term durability
      of the valve.
