    <textblock>
      Copsac has discovered that asthmatic exacerbations are as closely linked to bacterial as to
      viral infection. The current study will examine whether treatment of asthmatic exacerbations
      with macrolide antibiotics - in the abscence of clear clinical bacterial infection which
      would in any case precipitate antibiotic treatment - has an effect on either the particular
      episode, or subsequently. Macrolide antibiotics are chosen for ease of administration
      ensuring high compliance, antibiotic appropriacy, and anti-inflammatory properties.
