      RATIONALE: Dasatinib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes
      needed for cell growth. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as gemcitabine hydrochloride, work
      in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by
      stopping them from dividing. It is not yet known whether giving dasatinib together with
      gemcitabine hydrochloride is more effective than gemcitabine hydrochloride alone in treating
      pancreatic cancer. PURPOSE: This randomized phase II trial is studying how well giving
      dasatinib together with gemcitabine hydrochloride works compared to giving gemcitabine
      hydrochloride alone in treating patients with pancreatic cancer previously treated with
      surgery.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To compare disease-free survival at 18 months between
      dasatinib-gemcitabine combination therapy and single-agent gemcitabine. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:
      I. To evaluate effects on disease-free survival of the dasatinib-gemcitabine combination
      therapy compared with gemcitabine alone for adjuvant treatment of resected pancreatic
      adenocarcinoma. II. To evaluate effects on overall survival of dasatinib-gemcitabine
      combination therapy compared with gemcitabine alone for adjuvant treatment of resected
      pancreatic adenocarcinoma. III. To evaluate tolerability and safety of the two arms. IV. To
      identify potential biological correlates associated with clinical benefit to
      dasatinib-gemcitabine combination therapy compared with gemcitabine alone. OUTLINE: Patients
      are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms. ARM I: Patients receive gemcitabine hydrochloride IV
      on days 1, 8, and 15. Treatment repeats every 28 days for 6 courses in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity. ARM II: Patients receive gemcitabine hydrochloride IV
      on days 1, 8, and 15 and oral dasatinib once daily on days 1-28. Treatment repeats every 28
      days for 6 courses* in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. NOTE: *
      Courses with dasatinib repeat every 28 days for 1 year in the absence of disease progression
      or unacceptable toxicity. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every
      3 months for 2 years.
