      Currently, dorsal hand rejuvenation is an upcoming issue as patients seek plastic surgeons to
      address this highly visible area, although no specific statistics concerning the number of
      patients undergoing dorsal hand rejuvenation have been published yet. The solitary use of
      fillers, fat, sclerotherapy, skin excision, resurfacing and combinations of the above
      mentioned therapies have been reported in the literature, but still there is a lack of
      scientific literature about functional microcirculation of the dorsum of the hand.

      Furthermore, there is a lack of scientific data about functional microcirculation of the
      plantar foot in healthy subjects compared to patients suffering from Diabetes mellitus or
      peripheral arterial occlusive disease. Consequently, the aim of this study is the evaluation
      of the functional microcirculation of hands and feet in healthy subjects as well as patients
      suffering from the above mentioned diseases.
