  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators are studying a medical condition known as Raynaud's Phenomenon (RP). RP is
      a painful condition in which cold surroundings or stressful events trigger pain, a cold
      sensation, and in severe cases, sores and ulcers on one's fingers. The investigators think
      that RP results from problems with some of the components of the blood vessels, surrounding
      nerves, and some of the circulating messengers in the bloodstream. Although there are many
      different medicines that are currently used to treat RP, the investigators have not yet found
      a cure for severe cases of this condition. Furthermore, the investigators have found few
      medicines that show consistent healing of the ulcers that may be associated with RP. Some of
      the treatments include medicines that are used to treat high blood pressure known as calcium
      channel blockers. Medications that thin the blood (anticoagulants) such as aspirin have also
      been used to treat RP.

      In this study, the investigators will investigate a new treatment for RP known as Botulinum
      toxin A. Botulinum toxin is a chemical that is temporarily toxic to nerves, but has been
      approved by the government for the treatment of several other conditions including but not
      limited to: excessive sweating, neck pain associated with a condition known as cervical
      dystonia, uncontrollable forcible closure of the eyelids known as blepharospasm, and a
      condition known as strabismus in which the eyes are not in alignment with one another.

      This study will aim to greatly improve the quality of life and pain associated with RP.
      Previous studies also support the chance that Botulinum toxin will help to heal some of the
      ulcers associated with RP. Although there is no current standard of care, many of the
      patients in the study will have already failed or are unable to tolerate commonly used
      treatments such as lifestyle modifications, calcium channel blockers, nitroglycerin, and
      anticoagulants. If the patient chooses to participate in the study, he/she will be randomly
      assigned to receive an injection with Botulinum toxin in either the left or right hand. The
      other hand will be injected with saline solution. Neither the patient nor the physician or
      research personnel seen in follow-up will know which hand is injected with Botulinum toxin.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:Adult (&gt;18 years) patients with severe RP of any etiology will be
        invited to participate. Inclusion criteria include a) history of digital infarcts or
        ulcerations, b) unresponsive to standard therapies, or c) impending potential for digital
        amputation. Patients on other standard therapies such as antiplatelet agents, vasodilators,
        and calcium channel blockers will be included. -

        Exclusion Criteria:Pregnancy, mild disease, patients with myasthenia gravis, botulinum
        toxin allergy, and phobia of needles are exclusion criteria. Women of childbearing age will
        need to demonstrate a negative urine pregnancy test. Myasthenia gravis is excluded because
        underlying generalized weakness can be exacerbated, and local weakness at injection sites
        can occur more than otherwise expected.
