  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a quasi-experimental evaluation of psychoeducational course focusing on mindfulness
      and lifestyle changes for depression and anxiety; clients in active treatment group are
      compared to those in a treatment-as-usual wait-list control group. The primary hypothesis is
      that the psychoeducational course will result in lower levels of depression and anxiety as
      compared to the wait-listed treatment-as-usual comparison group.

      This study evaluates a psychoeducational intervention: Teaching mindfulness and lifestyle
      interventions to adult clients who self-report problems with depression and/or anxiety. The
      course is eight weeks long. Clients are assigned to either (1) receive the course (COU
      condition) from October- December 2010 or (2) placed on a waiting list and receive
      treatment-as-usual (TAU condition). Those in the TAU group will be offered the course in
      January 2011.

      Random assignment to COU or TAU conditions will be attempted although this may be relaxed due
      to institutional constraints.

      Participants are assessed on the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) and Beck Anxiety Inventory
      (BAI) at the beginning of the course, on the last day of the course, at 1-month post-course,
      at 4-months post-course, and at 12-months post-course.

      Participants in the COU condition will be compared to those in TAU condition at the beginning
      of the course, on the last day of the course, and at 1-month post-course. Further evaluations
      (4 and 12 months post-course) will be pre-post evaluations without a comparison group.

    <description>Depression will be assessed by comparing BDI scores on day one with BDI scores at twelve weeks (four weeks after conclusion of the psychoeducational course).
The primary study hypothesis is that the psychoeducational course group will have a greater reduction in BDI scores when compared to the treatment-as-usual wait-listed comparison group.</description>
