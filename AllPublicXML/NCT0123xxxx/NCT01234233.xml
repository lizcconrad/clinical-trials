  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators want to evaluate the effect of prewarming on the rate of postoperative
      hypothermia and shivering and to compare sublingual versus tympanic temperature assessment
      during the perioperative period in patients.

      Patients will be randomly assigned to 4 groups with different duration of prewarming. Body
      temperature will be recorded regularly by sublingual and tympanic (by thermocouple)
      measurement. Incidence of hypothermia (temp. &lt; 36°C) and shivering will be assessed
      postoperatively.

    <textblock>
      Inadvertent perioperative hypothermia causes many serious complications. Therefore,
      prevention from, detection and therapy of hypothermia is essential. The appropriate methods
      of temperature assessment are still under debate as well as the effect and necessary duration
      of active prewarming of patients to avoid postoperative hypothermia and shivering.

      The aim of our study is to evaluate the effect of prewarming on the rate of postoperative
      hypothermia and shivering and to compare sublingual versus tympanic temperature assessment
      during the perioperative period in patients undergoing elective minor surgery.

      The investigators plan to include patients scheduled for routine minor surgery of
      approximately 1h duration. Patients will be randomly assigned to 4 groups with different
      duration of active prewarming. Body temperature will be recorded regularly by sublingual and
      tympanic (by thermocouple) measurement. Incidence of hypothermia (temp. &lt; 36°C) and shivering
      will be assessed postoperatively.

    <description>After surgery patients will be admitted to PACU. Body temperature will be evaluted here to study the number of hypothermic patients depended from duration of preoperative warming.Time frame for assessment of data: 5 min after postoperative arrival at PACU (one single measurement, duration: 30 sec).Afterwards patients will be observed for about 2h.</description>

    <time_frame>preoperatively (once) at arrival at PACU</time_frame>
    <description>Sublingual and tympanic body temperature will be assessed simultaneously once at patients' preoperative arrival at PACU and compared to each other with analysis of correlation. This means that one sublingual and one tympanic temperature value will be measured to be compared to each other.Time frame for assessment of data: one single measurement immediately (1 min) after patients' arrival at PACU. Afterwards: observation of patients for about 2h.</description>

    <description>Sublingual and tympanic body temperature will be assessed simultaneously (once) 30 min after start of surgery and compared to each other with analysis of correlation. This means that one sublingual and one tympanic temperature value will be measured to be compared to each other.Time frame for data assessment: 1 min after 30 min after start of surgery.Afterwards patients will be observed for about 3h.</description>
