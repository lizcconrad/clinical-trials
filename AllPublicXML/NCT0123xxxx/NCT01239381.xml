  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) is a technique that is used to deliver radiation,
      to sites in the body. All participants in this study will be treated with SBRT using proton
      beam radiation. Proton beam radiation uses tiny particles to deliver radiation to tumors. The
      purpose of this research study is to determine if SBRT with protons will prevent tumor growth
      and reduce the treatment side effects for liver metastases.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      -  Participants receiving SBRT with protons, will receive radiation treatment as an
           outpatient at the Francis H. Burr Proton Therapy Center at Massachusetts General
           Hospital.

        -  Not everyone who participates in this study will be receiving the same dose of
           radiation. The dose received will be determined by the size and location of the
           tumor(s).

        -  Participants will receive 2-3 SBRT treatments per week for two weeks.

        -  During radiation therapy visits the following tests/procedures will be performed: vital
           signs, physical examination, routine blood tests, research blood tests, and radiation
           planning.

        -  Follow-up assessments will be performed once at 9 weeks after study treatment, then at 6
           months, 12 months, 18 months and 24 months after treatment.

    <description>The percentage of participants with local control at primary tumor site at one year. Local is evaluated using Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST). Local control is defined as achieving either Complete response (CR), Partial Response (PR), or Stable Disease (SD).
(CR): Disappearance of entire lesion, with no additional evidence of disease.
(PR): At least a 30% decrease in the (sum of) the longest diameter (LD) of the primary lesion, taken as reference the baseline sum LD.
(SD): Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for PD, taking as reference the smallest sum LD since the treatment started.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Biopsy-proven cancer diagnosis of a solid tumor with 1-4 liver metastases. There is no
             upper size limit. Liver metastases may be diagnosed by imaging alone, no liver biopsy
             is required. Extrahepatic disease is allowed if it have been stable for 3 months prior
             to study entry, the dominant disease burden is intrahepatic and the patient is
             referred for definitive radiation therapy to the disease in the liver

        <title>Local Control Rate</title>
        <description>The percentage of participants with local control at primary tumor site at one year. Local is evaluated using Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST). Local control is defined as achieving either Complete response (CR), Partial Response (PR), or Stable Disease (SD).
(CR): Disappearance of entire lesion, with no additional evidence of disease.
(PR): At least a 30% decrease in the (sum of) the longest diameter (LD) of the primary lesion, taken as reference the baseline sum LD.
(SD): Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for PD, taking as reference the smallest sum LD since the treatment started.</description>
