      The aim of the study was to compare the success rate of monocanalicular intubation versus
      bicanalicular silicone intubation in congenital nasolacrimal duct obstruction in children
      aged between 10 and 36 months.

    <textblock>
      In a prospective, nonrandomized comparative study, the monocanalicular intubations (MCI; n=35
      eyes) through the inferior canaliculus or bicanalicular intubations (BCI; n=35 eyes) were
      performed under general anaeshesia in children between 10 and 36 months of age suffering from
      congenital nasolacrimal duct obstruction (CNLDO). The tubes were removed 3-4 months after the
      tube placement. Thereafter, the children were followed up for 6 months after the removal of
      tubes. The therapeutic success was defined as the fluorescein dye disappearance test grade
      0-1 corresponding with a complete resolution of previous symptoms. The partial success was
      defined as improvement with some residual symptoms.

      The complete and partial improvement was achieved in 31/35(88.57%) in group I with BCI and in
      34/35 (97.14%) in group II with MCI, respectively, and it was not significantly higher
      (p=0,584).

      Complications occurred in both groups. Dislodgement of the tube and premature removal was
      observed in four cases in group I (BCI), the loss of the tube was observed twice in group II
      with MCI.. Canalicular slitting was observed in 5 eyes in the group with BCI. Granuloma
      pyogenicum observed in 2 cases with MCI revealed in a few weeks after the tube removal.
      Corneal erosion in the inferior medial quadrant was observed in 1 eye with MCI and revealed
      in a few days after the local treatment without tube removal.

      Conclusions: Both MCI and the BCI are effective methods how to treat CNLDO. The advantage of
      the MCI shows the lower incidence of the canalicular slit and easy placement.
