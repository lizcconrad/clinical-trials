  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Breast Cancer is the most common cancer amongst Canadian women. Studies report that breast
      cancer patients are the most likely to use complementary medicine within the oncologic
      population. Yoga has become especially popular with this group as it promises to improve the
      mind, body and soul holistically. The investigators yoga program specifically focuses on
      rebuilding physical strength, increasing flexibility and reducing the pain and stress
      associated with the post-operative period. This study will examine how yoga can help improve
      the overall quality of life and its effects on the physical well-being of women with breast
      cancer. With positive statistical results, the investigators hope to implement yoga as part
      of their rehabilitation services at the Cedars Breast Clinic.

      Proposed Intervention:

      1-hour hatha yoga classes, once a week for a 12-week period. One class will be offered in
      French, another in English. The class will begin with approximately 10 minutes of pranayama
      (breathing exercises) and meditation, followed by 30 minutes of yoga poses and ending with 10
      minutes of sivasana (rest period.) The first couple of classes in the 12 week series will
      begin with restorative postures and will gradually progress to more gentle exercises. If
      health permits, the last couple of classes will involve some strengthening poses. A small
      portion of the class will work with the physical body in general and there will be a specific
      emphasis on the physical difficulties faced by most breast cancer patients, i.e. neck, chest,
      shoulders arms and hands.
