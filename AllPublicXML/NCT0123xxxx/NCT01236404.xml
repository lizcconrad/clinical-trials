    <textblock>
      Primary objective:

      To evaluate the safety and tolerability of single and multiple ascending doses of PB1023
      administered as a subcutaneous (SC) injection in adult subjects with T2DM.

      Secondary objectives:

        1. To characterize the pharmacokinetic profile of PB1023 after single and multiple
           ascending doses of PB1023.

        2. To assess the pharmacodynamic response of various single and multiple doses of PB1023
           (daily fasting plasma glucose, and serial glucose, c-peptide and insulin levels in
           response to a liquid Mixed Meal Tolerance Test (MMTT).

    <description>To characterize the PK profile of PB1023 after single and multiple ascending doses of PB1023. The following parameters will be evaluated: t1/2, AUC(inf), AUC(0-t), Tmax, Cmax, Elimination Rate Constant, Clearance and Distribution.</description>
