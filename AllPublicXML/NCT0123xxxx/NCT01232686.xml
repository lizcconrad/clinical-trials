      The study investigates whether shared online access to epidemiological data for general
      practitioners, disease prevention officers, emergency care services and microbiology
      laboratories changes clinical practice with regard to testing, diagnosing and treatment of
      communicable diseases. The main hypothesis is that &quot;online access for general practitioner to
      epidemiological data about communicable diseases changes clinical practice for testing,
      diagnosing and treatment of communicable diseases&quot;.

      We will collect data from general practitioners (GP) offices by installing local data
      extraction solutions. Each installation will build a local anonymous database of GP
      consultations extracted from the local electronic patient record (EPR) system. These
      anonymous data records will be used to produce local disease statistics before they are
      exported to a centralized server available in the Norwegian Health network. The centralized
      server will produce daily reports about the epidemiological situation in the patient
      population. We will combine the syndromic data from the GP offices with data from the
      microbiology laboratories on the hospitals that covers the study areas. The epidemiological
      data will be made available to the intervention areas in the study through web based and
      customized client applications.

      By using data extracted from the GP offices EPR databases and the microbiology laboratories
      we will investigate the study hypothesis.

    <time_frame>Measured at the end of the data collection period, approx. 1.5 year. (December 2012)</time_frame>
    <description>General practitioners (GP) have three possible decisions in a consultation with a patient; 1) treat on suspicion, 2) take a sample, 3) wait and see whether the patient recovers or get worse, or 4) a combination of 1 and 2.
In situations with decision 3 (wait and see) the patient may return to a consultation later on.
The hypothesis is that online access to epidemiological data from the local patient population will enable GPs to make the right decision more often based on knowledge about the epidemiological situation in the patient population.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Earlier detection of local disease outbreaks</measure>
    <time_frame>Measured at the end of the data collection period, approx. 1.5 year. (December 2012)</time_frame>
    <description>Syndromic surveillance enables earlier detection of local disease outbreaks compared to traditional laboratory based surveillance. We will record the time of disease outbreak detection in both intervention and control areas and compare.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Lower number of infected during disease outbreaks</measure>
    <time_frame>Measured at the end of the data collection period, approx. 1.5 year. (December 2012)</time_frame>
    <description>We will compare the number of infected in the intervention and control areas. The hypothesis is that the intervention areas will have fewer infected compared to the control areas.</description>

    <measure>Impact on health service costs</measure>
    <time_frame>Measured at the end of the data collection period, approx. 1.5 year. (December 2012)</time_frame>
    <description>We will measure the cost related to communicable diseases in the control and intervention areas. Our prediction is that it will change.</description>
