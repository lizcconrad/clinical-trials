  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effects of the amino acid supplement
      N-Acetylcysteine versus placebo on working memory and other cognitive functions in persons
      with a diagnosis of schizophrenia.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Working memory impairment in Schizophrenia is produced by deficiencies of feedback inhibition
      of glutamate release, due to low cysteine-glutamate antiporter activity. Because of this
      mechanism, we are interested in whether acute administration of N-Acetylcysteine will improve
      performance of patients with schizophrenia on a battery of cognitive tasks utilized to test
      working memory and other cognitive domains, versus placebo. This pilot study will utilize a
      randomized, double blind, placebo controlled, crossover design.

    <measure>BACS Composite RAW Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>The Brief Assessment of Cognition in Schizophrenia (BACS) is an instrument that assesses the aspects of cognition found to be most impaired and most strongly correlated with outcome in patients with schizophrenia.
The BACS composite raw score the total of the raw scores for the 6 subtests of the BACS (Verbal memory, token motor, digit sequencing, verbal fluency, symbol coding and executive functioning). The range, so we could be from 0-435. A high score total score is more favorable and indicates a higher level of cognition.
The BACS requires less than 35 min to complete in patients with schizophrenia, yields a high completion rate in these patients, and has high reliability. The BACS was found to be as sensitive to cognitive impairment in patients with schizophrenia as a standard battery of tests that required over 2 h to administer. It is the raw sum of the test items and higher scores are favorable.</description>

    <description>Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS) utilized before and after treatment. BPRS total score is a total of the 18 item scores with a range of 18-126. It is used to measure schizophrenia symptoms and to assess change in them over time. There are 18 symptom sub scores. Each symptom is rated 1-7 (not present to extremely severe) and then all items are summed for the total score. Higher scores indicate more severe symptoms.
The BPRS is the gold-standard overall measure of schizophrenia symptoms which will be utilized to demonstrate that the intervention does not cause worsening of the illness symptoms apart from the usual fluctuations of the natural course.</description>

        <title>BACS Composite RAW Score</title>
        <description>The Brief Assessment of Cognition in Schizophrenia (BACS) is an instrument that assesses the aspects of cognition found to be most impaired and most strongly correlated with outcome in patients with schizophrenia.
The BACS composite raw score the total of the raw scores for the 6 subtests of the BACS (Verbal memory, token motor, digit sequencing, verbal fluency, symbol coding and executive functioning). The range, so we could be from 0-435. A high score total score is more favorable and indicates a higher level of cognition.
The BACS requires less than 35 min to complete in patients with schizophrenia, yields a high completion rate in these patients, and has high reliability. The BACS was found to be as sensitive to cognitive impairment in patients with schizophrenia as a standard battery of tests that required over 2 h to administer. It is the raw sum of the test items and higher scores are favorable.</description>

          <title>BACS Composite RAW Score</title>
          <description>The Brief Assessment of Cognition in Schizophrenia (BACS) is an instrument that assesses the aspects of cognition found to be most impaired and most strongly correlated with outcome in patients with schizophrenia.
The BACS composite raw score the total of the raw scores for the 6 subtests of the BACS (Verbal memory, token motor, digit sequencing, verbal fluency, symbol coding and executive functioning). The range, so we could be from 0-435. A high score total score is more favorable and indicates a higher level of cognition.
The BACS requires less than 35 min to complete in patients with schizophrenia, yields a high completion rate in these patients, and has high reliability. The BACS was found to be as sensitive to cognitive impairment in patients with schizophrenia as a standard battery of tests that required over 2 h to administer. It is the raw sum of the test items and higher scores are favorable.</description>

Participants receive one point for each correct answer for a range of 0-24. Higher scores are better.</description>

        <title>BACS Composite RAW Score</title>
        <description>The Brief Assessment of Cognition in Schizophrenia (BACS) is an instrument that assesses the aspects of cognition found to be most impaired and most strongly correlated with outcome in patients with schizophrenia.
The BACS composite raw score the total of the raw scores for the 6 subtests of the BACS (Verbal memory, token motor, digit sequencing, verbal fluency, symbol coding and executive functioning). The range, so we could be from 0-435. A high score total score is more favorable and indicates a higher level of cognition.
The BACS requires less than 35 min to complete in patients with schizophrenia, yields a high completion rate in these patients, and has high reliability. The BACS was found to be as sensitive to cognitive impairment in patients with schizophrenia as a standard battery of tests that required over 2 h to administer. It is the raw sum of the test items and higher scores are favorable.</description>

The respondent views the stimulus page for 10 seconds and is asked to draw as many of the figures as possible in their correct location on a page in the response booklet. A Delayed Recall Trial is administered after a 25-minute delay. Scoring is based on accuracy of the figure as well as its location on the page. A range of 0-12 per trial is possible(0-36 total). Higher scores are better.</description>

        <title>BACS Composite RAW Score</title>
        <description>The Brief Assessment of Cognition in Schizophrenia (BACS) is an instrument that assesses the aspects of cognition found to be most impaired and most strongly correlated with outcome in patients with schizophrenia.
The BACS composite raw score the total of the raw scores for the 6 subtests of the BACS (Verbal memory, token motor, digit sequencing, verbal fluency, symbol coding and executive functioning). The range, so we could be from 0-435. A high score total score is more favorable and indicates a higher level of cognition.
The BACS requires less than 35 min to complete in patients with schizophrenia, yields a high completion rate in these patients, and has high reliability. The BACS was found to be as sensitive to cognitive impairment in patients with schizophrenia as a standard battery of tests that required over 2 h to administer. It is the raw sum of the test items and higher scores are favorable.</description>

A Delayed Recall Trial is administered after a 25-minute delay. Scoring is based on accuracy of the figure as well as its location on the page. A range of 0-12 per trial is possible(0-36 total). Higher scores are better.</description>

        <description>Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS) utilized before and after treatment. BPRS total score is a total of the 18 item scores with a range of 18-126. It is used to measure schizophrenia symptoms and to assess change in them over time. There are 18 symptom sub scores. Each symptom is rated 1-7 (not present to extremely severe) and then all items are summed for the total score. Higher scores indicate more severe symptoms.
The BPRS is the gold-standard overall measure of schizophrenia symptoms which will be utilized to demonstrate that the intervention does not cause worsening of the illness symptoms apart from the usual fluctuations of the natural course.</description>
