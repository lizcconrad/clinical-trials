  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This Phase Ib pilot RCT will examine the safety, feasibility, and acceptability of a
      multi-component intervention to address traumatic stress symptoms among HIV-positive,
      methamphetamine-using men who have sex with men (MSM). Following a baseline assessment, 56
      participants will be randomized to receive either: 1) a 7-session intervention to address
      traumatic stress related to living with HIV/AIDS; or 2) a 7-session, attention-control
      condition. Follow-up assessments will be administered at 1 and 3 months post-randomization.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In the multi-component intervention protocol, participants will complete expressive writing
      exercises where they will be asked to write about difficult life experiences. Following
      expressive writing, participants will receive stress management skills training to assist
      them with managing any acute increases in distress that arise from the writing experience.
      Participants in the attention-control condition will write about neutral topics and complete
      psychological measures. The overarching goals of this Phase Ib RCT will be to: 1) examine the
      feasibility and acceptability of the intervention and attention-control; and 2) determine
      whether intervention participants report reductions in traumatic stress symptoms over the 3
      months following randomization. Findings from this Phase Ib trial will inform our efforts to
      implement a more definitive RCT of this intervention with HIV-positive, methamphetamine-using
      MSM.

    <measure>Psychological reactivity to expressive writing</measure>
    <time_frame>1-month follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will complete measures of subjective distress and craving of stimulants (i.e., methamphetamine, cocaine, and crack) before and after each expressive writing exercise to provide an index of habituation. Habituation is defined as a 50% reduction in the psychological reactivity to the expressive writing experience using these self-report measures.</description>
