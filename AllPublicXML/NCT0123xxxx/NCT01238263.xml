      Recently, IgE-type autoantibodies against self proteins have been detected in the serum of
      the atopic dermatitis patients. The role of this IgE autoantibodies involved in the
      pathogenesis of atopic dermatitis is not known, yet. But, there may be a correlation between
      the severity of the disease and the serum levels of this autoantibodies. The autologous serum
      skin testing is applied to both atopic dermatitis patients and healthy control and the
      results are estimated in this study.The investigators detected 70% positive autologous serum
      skin testing in atopic dermatitis patients and test positivity was higher in patients with
      atopy history, moderately severe disease calculated by SCORAD index and high serum IgE
      levels.
