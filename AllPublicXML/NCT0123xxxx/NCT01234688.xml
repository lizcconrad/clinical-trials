  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators raised the hypothesis that exercise training would be associated with
      improvement in exercise tolerance and VO2 kinetics in hemodialysis patients.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      End-stage renal disease (ESRD) is associated with several hemodynamic and peripheral muscle
      abnormalities which could slow the kinetics of O2 uptake(VO2)and diminished tolerance to
      incremental exercise. Although previous studies have shown that aerobic training is able to
      accelerate VO2 kinetics in several disease populations, little is known if these positive
      findings are also applicable to hemodialysis patients.

        Brazil. No patient had been involved in any kind of exercise training in the preceding 6
        months
