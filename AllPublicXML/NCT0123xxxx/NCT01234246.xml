      In this project the main focus is on assessing sexual functioning and the quality of sexual
      life after the treatment of colorectal cancer in patients and their partners.

      Patients and their partners complete questionnaires concerning sexual functioning, quality of
      life, body image, fatigue, anxiety, depressive symptoms, personality factors, and demographic
      factors. Questionnaires are completed before surgical treatment, 6 weeks, 3 months, 6 months,
      and 12 months after diagnosis.

      The results of this prospective study will give insight in 1) the incidence of sexual
      problems and the extent patients with colorectal cancer and their partners are bothered by
      these problems across time, 2) the effect of different treatment modalities on sexual
      functioning, 3) the relation between sexual problems and quality of life, 4) the determinants
      of sexual problems and the quality of sexual life adopting the biopsychosocial approach of
      patients with colorectal cancer who have been treated with surgery, radiation and/or
      chemotherapy, and more specifically to the role of personality and patient factors and sexual
      functioning/the quality of sexual life.
