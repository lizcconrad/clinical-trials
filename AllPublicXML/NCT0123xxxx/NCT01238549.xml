  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The field of spinal cord injury (SCI) rehabilitation medicine lacks a reliable, patient
      reported, health-related quality of life measurement tool. The National Institute of Health
      has provided funding to develop a SCI-specific, quality of life (QOL) survey tool in
      non-Veterans with SCI called the SCI-QOL. This quality of life survey asks questions
      regarding physical/medical, emotional, and social health as it relates to individuals with
      spinal cord injury.

      The purpose of this study is to include a Veteran population in the making of the quality of
      life survey. Each participant will be asked to complete a packet of quality of life
      questions. Participants will be given the opportunity to take the survey a second time,
      either 7-14 days or 5-7 months after the first survey. Taking the survey twice will allow the
      research team to test the reliability of the survey. Comparing the SCI-QOL with other legacy
      measures will allow the investigators to test the validity of the survey.

      Additionally, the investigators will be testing the SCI-QOL between Veterans and non-Veterans
      with SCI to determine if there are differences in their self-reported quality of life.

      This study will be recruiting participants at the James J. Peters Veterans Affairs Medical
      Center (VAMC) in Bronx, New York and the James A. Haley Veterans Affairs (VA) Hospital in
      Tampa, Florida. The James J. Peters VAMC will be recruiting 125 participants and the James A.
      Haley VAH will be recruiting 275.
