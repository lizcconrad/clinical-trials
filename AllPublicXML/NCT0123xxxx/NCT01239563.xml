  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if anti-thymocyte globulin (Thymoglobuline)
      administration in the kidney transplant recipient is able to reduce the amount of damage that
      kidneys transplanted from deceased donors sustains on reperfusion.

    <textblock>
      The increasing disparity between organ availability and the number of patients on waiting
      list for a transplant has led to different strategies to improve half life of all
      transplants. One such method is to reduce the amount of damage the organ sustains during the
      period of preservation and reperfusion in the recipient. Thymoglobulin, an anti-lymphocyte
      antibody has been shown to have the ability to reduce this damage in experimental studies.
      This study aims to ascertain the role of Thymoglobulin in kidney transplants from donors
      after cardiac death, the type of kidney transplants at highest risk of sustaining injury
      during preservation. The study will involve comparison with conventional immunosuppressant
      therapy, comparison between Thymoglobulin administered in different doses, and observation of
      the patterns of blood cell repopulation (lymphocytes mainly) in the first year following
      kidney transplantation.
