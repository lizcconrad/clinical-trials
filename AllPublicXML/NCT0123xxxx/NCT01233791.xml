      The purpose of this study is to determine whether vaginal diazepam suppositories are an
      effective treatment of high tone pelvic floor dysfunction.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      High tone pelvic floor dysfunction is a common cause of pelvic pain in females. It is thought
      to be initiated by a sentinel event such as trauma, surgery, or vaginal delivery1. Currently,
      treatment options include warm baths, stretching, physical therapy with myofascial therapy or
      biofeedback, or pharmacologic therapy with oral amitriptyline or tiazadine2. Physical therapy
      can be effective. However, it usually involves frequent visits to a specialized physical
      therapist to undergo intravaginal treatments consisting of myofascial release, massage, or
      biofeedback. We would like to find a treatment option for patients that would be effective
      without the invasive and time consuming nature of physical therapy. It is known that diazepam
      is a valid treatment option for disorders involving spasticity including spastic cerebral
      palsy5 and tetanus. A literature search on diazepam and high tone pelvic floor dysfunction
      revealed one paper. This study has an intrinsic flaw as it is a retrospective chart review,
      and the results are confounded by concurrent physical therapy. They were, however, able to
      find that patients treated with diazepam suppositories showed a significant improvement in
      pelvic floor tone. They also assessed pain and sexual function, but these did not reach
      statistical significance.
