  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This multi-center parallel study is designed to study the efficacy and safety of fixed doses
      of methylphenidate extended release (ER)capsules of three dose levels compared with a placebo
      group in pediatric patients with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) who are
      between 6 and 18 years old.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a parallel, randomized, double-blind, multi-center, placebo-controlled, forced dose,
      phase 3 study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of Biphentin methylphenidate hydrochloride
      extended release capsules in the treatment of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD)
      in pediatric and adolescent patients aged 6 up to 18 years.

      The study will have four phases: (1) Screening and washout; (2) Double-blind fixed dose study
      involving test drug at 10, 15, 20 or 40 mg/day or placebo for 1 week; (3) Open-label phase
      that includes dose optimization with doses starting at 10 mg, and allowed up to 60 mg; and
      (4) 30-day safety follow-up. Eight (8) visits may be required. The open-label period
      following the one double-blind fixed dose week provides additional opportunity for subjects
      to receive treatment with Biphentin. Extra unscheduled dose optimization visits are allowed
      as needed for additional dose titration visits during the open-label period.

      Various safety and tolerability, and quality of life assessments will be conducted.

      Biphentin is designed to be a single daily dose alternative to separate doses of immediate
      release methylphenidate by providing a biphasic plasma profile. It achieves a first Cmax more
      similar to immediate release methylphenidate. It also comes in eight (8), that allow better
      individualized dosing.
