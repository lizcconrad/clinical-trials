  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of using the L300 Plus as a
      neuroprosthesis device for walking in patients following an UMN injury or disease. The
      clinical study is proposed to determine the anticipated adverse event rate and treatment
      outcomes at the conclusion of the study.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, one-center, single group, repeated measures, non inferiority study.
      Forty-five (45) subjects suffering from foot drop and thigh muscles weakness due to upper
      motor neuron injury or disease will be evaluated for this study. Each subject will be in the
      study for six weeks. Clinical benefits will be measured through an assessment of the gait
      performance. In particular it will test the hypothesis that the NESS L300 Plus System which
      involves foot drop correction with thigh muscles activation, may achieve walking enhancements
      not inferior to those gained from using a system that only corrects foot drop (i.e. NESS
      L300).

             to manual muscle testing

          -  Foot drop - toe drag during walking

          -  Sufficient response to electrical stimulation (visible muscle contractions in a seated
             or prone position of each designated muscle separately)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects with a demand-type cardiac pacemaker, defibrillator or any electrical or
             metallic implant

          -  Cancerous lesion of lower limb, present or suspected

          -  Medical condition that prevents participation or would likely lead to inability to

          -  Change in bone-joint structures of the lower limb, such as contractures or
             deformations; fracture or dislocation, which would be adversely affected by motion
             from the stimulation

          -  Pregnancy
