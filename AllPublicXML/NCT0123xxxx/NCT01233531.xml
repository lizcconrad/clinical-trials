      Cash transfers to young women for staying in school and its effect on acquiring HIV
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The overall purpose of this study is to determine whether providing cash transfers to young
      women and their household, conditional on school attendance, reduces young women's risk of
      acquiring Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV). The overall goal of the Conditional Cash
      Transfer (CCT) intervention is to reduce structural barriers to education with the goal of
      increasing school attendance of young women, thereby decreasing their HIV risk.

    <description>In the intervention, young women and their households will be randomized in 1:1 ratio to receive monthly cash transfer payments, conditional on the young woman attending school, or to the control arm. Young women will be recruited at the beginning of grades 8 through 11 in the first year of the study.</description>
