      Overall aim of this work is to evaluate new methods of resuscitation that can be applied by
      front-line responders on the battlefield, in civilian life, or which can be used during
      initial resuscitation in the first fixed facility to which the injured patient is brought.

    <textblock>
      Shock is a leading cause of death among American forces in battle, with many trauma victims
      dying of early hemorrhagic shock or from late septic shock.1 Shock is defined as circulatory
      collapse, when the arterial blood pressure is too low to maintain an adequate supply of blood
      to the body's vital organs and tissues. Specifically, hemorrhagic shock results when blood
      vessels are physically damaged while septic shock results when microbes or microbial products
      enter the blood stream. Despite advances in medical science, including the development of
      improved antibiotics, treatments for hemorrhagic and septic shock have changed little in the
      past 30-40 years. A wounded soldier bleeding on the battlefield, or a trauma victim in the
      United States, is treated today largely as he or she would have been treated in 1970.

      The overall aim of this work is to evaluate new methods of resuscitation that can be applied
      by front-line responders on the battlefield (medical corpsmen, combat medics), in civilian
      life (Emergency Medical System), or which can be used during initial resuscitation in the
      first fixed facility to which the injured patient is brought. This might be a Fire Support
      Specialist (FIST) team in a combat theater or a trauma center in the civilian health care
      system.

    <description>Biological response as characterized by selected cytokines, specifically tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα), interleukin one (IL-1β), and interleukin six (IL-6). These are measured using ELISA. Baseline values are expected to be either unobtainable, or in any case less than 50 picograms/ml. If there is a significant inflammatory response, values at 24 hours should be more than 100 picograms/ml for TNFα, IL-1β, and IL-6. Our hypothesis is that there will be a difference between study and control group patients of at least 50 picograms/ml in the levels of these cytokines at 24 hours. Cytokine response is quite variable, and the percentage of outliers (with no cytokine response) in either group may be as high as 50%. .</description>
