    <description>Arm 1: (weekly, 28-day cycle): Approximately eighty subjects will orally self-administer eniluracil approximately 13 hr (range of 11-16 hr) before receiving 5 FU and leucovorin.

The regimen is taken once per week for three consecutive weeks followed by one-week off-treatment.</description>
