      1. Goals

             -  The primary goal of this phase II trial is to:

           evaluate the response rate of combination chemotherapy with docetaxel and oxaliplatin in
           patients with locally advanced or metastatic BTC as first-line therapy

           Secondary goals are to:evaluate the treatment-related toxicities of this combination,
           investigate progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) in this population

        2. Design

      The proposed clinical trial is an open label, non-comparative, multicenter phase II trial
      according to the two stage testing design by Simon.22

    <description>1. Treatment Schedule
1.1. Docetaxel schedule Docetaxel 35 mg/m2 is administered on day 1 and day 8 by intravenously in 100 mL of 5% dextrose solution over 30 minutes. Dexamethasone 8mg is intravenously administered before 30 minutes, and then orally 4mg every 12 hours over 48 hours. In the event of a hypersensitivity reaction, dimethidine maleate, epinephrine, and intravenous fluids will be required.
1.2. Oxaliplatin schedule Oxaliplatin 100 mg/m2 is given on day 1 by intravenous infusion in 500 mL of 5% dextrose solution over 120 minutes. Therapy will be repeated every 21 days.</description>
