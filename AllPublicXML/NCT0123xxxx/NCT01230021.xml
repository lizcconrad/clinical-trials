  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This trial is conducted in Europe and United States of America (USA). The aim of this
      clinical trial is to investigate the pharmacokinetics (at which rate the substance is
      distributed and eliminated from the body) and the safety profile of catridecacog (recombinant
      factor XIII (rFXIII)) in children with congenital FXIII A-subunit deficiency. Young children
      (1 to less than 6 years old) with congenital FXIII deficiency are evaluated.

    <measure>Total Plasma Clearance (CL)</measure>
    <time_frame>From day 0 to day 30</time_frame>
    <description>The total plasma clearance is a measure of the elimination of a drug from the body. Drugs are excreted primarily by the kidneys into the urine. Clearance is calculated as 'CL=Dose / AUC0-30 days').</description>

    <description>Volume of distribution at steady state (Vss) is the theoretical volume that the total amount of administered drug would have to occupy (if it were uniformly distributed), to provide the same concentration as it is in blood plasma at steady state. Steady state is achieved when all variables are constant in spite of ongoing processes.</description>

    <measure>Clot Solubility Test (Evaluated as Normal/Abnormal)</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 0 and day 30</time_frame>
    <description>Blood samples for clot solubility drawn at each visit (1 hour before and after dose administration). A clot solubility assay was used to screen for FXIII deficiency. The assay is based on the ability of urea to dissolve fibrin clots that have not undergone FXIII-induced stabilization. Normal blood clots generally remain stable for 24 hours or more, while clots in which fibrin molecules have not been cross-linked are soluble within minutes. The outcome of the test is normal (FXIII present; a clot is observed in the test tube) or abnormal (FXIII absent or very low level; no clot in test tube).</description>

          <title>Volume of Distribution at Steady State (Vss)</title>
          <description>Volume of distribution at steady state (Vss) is the theoretical volume that the total amount of administered drug would have to occupy (if it were uniformly distributed), to provide the same concentration as it is in blood plasma at steady state. Steady state is achieved when all variables are constant in spite of ongoing processes.</description>

        <description>Blood samples for clot solubility drawn at each visit (1 hour before and after dose administration). A clot solubility assay was used to screen for FXIII deficiency. The assay is based on the ability of urea to dissolve fibrin clots that have not undergone FXIII-induced stabilization. Normal blood clots generally remain stable for 24 hours or more, while clots in which fibrin molecules have not been cross-linked are soluble within minutes. The outcome of the test is normal (FXIII present; a clot is observed in the test tube) or abnormal (FXIII absent or very low level; no clot in test tube).</description>
