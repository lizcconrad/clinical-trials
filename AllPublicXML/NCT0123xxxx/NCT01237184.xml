    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this study is to

        1. determine whether dental implant engaging both the alveolar crest cortical bone and
           sinus floor using vertical stopper drill and self-threading concept (bi-cortical
           fixation) increases initial implant stability compared to the short implants engaging
           only alveolar crest cortical bone (uni-cortical fixation) and/or ones engaging both
           crest and sinus floor but with green stick fracture (indirect sinus lift technique),

        2. study whether different surgical techniques, residual bone height, bone density, and
           length and width of the implants used affect initial implant stability in posterior
           maxilla. In addition, this study will continue to

        3. compare secondary implant stability of implants fixed bi-cortically, uni-cortically and
           with indirect sinus lift technique at 2nd stage surgery/6 month healing and 1 year
           follow-up from the restoration and

        4. measure amount of endo-sinus bone formation from the 1- year follow up CT (computer
           tomogram) scan and evaluate safety and potential post-operative complications of
           bi-cortical fixation and indirect sinus lift technique reported throughout the follow up
           periods.

      The clinical trial will evaluate initial implant stability as a primary outcome measured by
      resonance frequency analysis (RFA) employing dental implants surgically placed in posterior
      maxillary bone by engaging alveolar crest and the sinus floor using vertical stopper drill
      and self-threading concept (bi-cortical fixation), engaging only the alveolar crest
      (uni-cortical fixation), and engaging alveolar crest and the sinus floor using indirect sinus
      lift technique (indirect sinus lift technique). The surgical procedures compared in this
      experiment include 3 groups:

        -  Group 1 (15 implants) Short implants placed in proximity of the sinus without sinus
           floor involvement (unicortical fixation)

        -  Group 2 (15 implants) Implants placed using indirect sinus lift technique (indirect
           sinus lift technique)

        -  Group 3 (15 implants) Bi-cortically fixed implants intentionally engaging sinus floor
           beyond up to 1-2mm without graft but using stopper drill and self-threading concept
           (bi-cortical fixation)
