  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study was designed to confirm that the surgeon is able to perform accurate liver surface
      registration including standard liver features used as landmarks during a scheduled
      laparoscopic liver procedure. The hypothesis is that there will be no clinically relevant
      difference between the error measurements obtained during the laparoscopic procedures in this
      study when compared with those obtained during previous open liver registration studies.

      The surface of the liver will be manually swabbed with the study tracked laparoscopic probe
      with landmarks noted during data collection. After registration of the liver is obtained, the
      registration points obtained during this procedure will be evaluated by the surgeon by moving
      the tracked laparoscopic probe over the liver surface and evaluating the location of the
      tracked laparoscopic probe displayed on the guidance system three dimensional (3D) image. The
      surgeon will accept or reject the registration accuracy.

      The Pathfinder System used during this study is used for data collection purposes only and is
      not used during the surgical procedure as an image guided system.

      Preoperative computed tomography (CT) scans, obtained as standard of care, will be used to
      generate the image guided liver system 3D liver surface images used during the study.

      During the laparoscopic procedure, the Pathfinder device will be inserted through the
      standard laparoscopic ports (5mm or 10mm) being used for the staging procedure.

      A total study population will include 20 subjects that complete the laparoscopic procedure
      scheduled.
