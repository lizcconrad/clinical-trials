  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a research study to determine if giving acetaminophen intravenously in hte operating
      room will decrease the number of patients who require additional pain medicine, such as
      morphine, after surgery in the recovery room.

      Primary Specific Aim: To determine if adding an intraoperative dose of intravenous
      acetaminphen to usual and customary analgesics during ambulatory surgery impacts the
      proportion of patients remaining opioid-free in the post-anesthesia recovery room.

      Hypothesis: Adding an intraoperative dose of intravenous acetaminophen to usual and customary
      analgesics during ambulatory surgery increases the proportion of patients remaining
      opioid-free in the post-anesthesia recovery room.

      Secondary Specific Aim: To determine if adding an intraoperative dose of intravenous
      acetaminophen to usual and customary analgesics during amublatory surgery impacts the
      required doses of additional perioperative analgesics.

      Hypothesis: Adding an intraoperative dose of intravenous acetaminophen to usual and customary
      analgesics during ambulatory surgery decreases the required doses of additional analgesics in
      both the operating room and post-anesthesia recovery room.
