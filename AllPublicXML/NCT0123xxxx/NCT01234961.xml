      This project evaluates the outcomes of a work rehabilitation program, Redesigning Daily
      Occupations (ReDO), for women with stress-related disorders. The ReDO intervention focuses on
      how people compose their everyday lives. The basic idea is that re-structuring of an
      individual's lifestyle and pattern of daily occupations will lead to a healthier balance
      between the occupations of everyday life, and that this balance will promote wellness and
      increased work capacity. The program is group based and comprises 16 weeks.

      The aim is to evaluate ReDO for women with stress-related disorders. The project, which
      covers the time period from entering the program to a 12-month follow-up, is a
      quasi-experimental study. 42 women who entered the program and fitted the selection criteria
      were included. A matched comparison group was selected among those clients at the Social
      Insurance Office who get &quot;care-as-usual&quot; (CAU). Both groups are followed prospectively and
      are compared regarding return to work, sick leave, and different aspects of health and
      well-being. The hypothesis is that the ReDO group will improve more than the CAU group in all
      these respects.

      This project is about developing and evaluating a novel work rehabilitation program,
      Redesigning Daily Occupations (ReDO), for women with stress-related disorders. It is a
      co-operation project between Lund University, the Social Insurance Office, and the health
      care services of the County of Halland. The ReDO intervention focuses on how people compose
      their everyday lives. Supporting people in how to change and modify their patterns of daily
      occupations is a new intervention method for people with stress-related disorders, but it has
      been shown to be effective in improving quality of life and self-rated health in other target
      groups. The basic idea is that re-structuring of an individual's lifestyle and pattern of
      daily occupations will lead to a healthier balance between the occupations of everyday life,
      and that this balance will promote wellness and increased work capacity. The program is group
      based and comprises 16 weeks, with sessions 2 x 2 hours per week, followed by 3-4 booster
      sessions.

      The aim of the research project is to evaluate the outcomes of ReDO for women with
      stress-related disorders. The hypothesis is that the ReDO group will improve more than a
      comparison group receiving &quot;care-as-usual&quot; (CAU) regarding return to work, sick leave, and
      different aspects of health and well-being. group in all these respects.

      The project is a quasi-experimental study. It covers the time period from entering the
      program to a 12-month follow-up. According to initial plans, the first 50 women who entered
      the ReDO program and fitted the selection criteria would be included. A power analysis
      indicated that 40 individuals in each group were needed to detect a medium effect size (of
      0.6) with 80% power at p&lt;.05. Forty-two women were actually recruited to the ReDO
      intervention. A matched comparison group was selected among those clients at the Social
      Insurance Office who get (CAU). The match was made on specific diagnosis, age, family
      situation (civil status and number of children), type of occupation and duration of sick
      leave. Thus, in all 84 women take part in the project. The data consist of registry
      information from the Social Insurance Office (SIO) and questionnaires targeting
      socio-demographics, perceived stress, and different aspects of health and well-being.

    <description>The ReDO is a 16-week group-based programme, comprising three phases. Phase I covers five weeks and has a special focus on occupational self-analysis, while Phase II, also comprising five weeks, is concentrated around goal setting and strategies for accomplishing desired changes in the patterns of everyday activities. During these ten weeks the group meets twice a week and each session lasts for 2Â½ hrs. Phase III consists of work placement for six weeks, if possible in relation to the woman's ordinary work but otherwise at another relevant work place. During Phase III the group meets three times (weeks two, four and six) in order to monitor the group placement. The groups are led by two licensed occupational therapists specifically trained for the ReDO programme.</description>
