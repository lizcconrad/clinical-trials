    <textblock>
      Remodulin (Treprostenil sodium) is synthetic prostacyclin analog available as a solution for
      administration in the intravenous route. It is approved for treatment of class I - pulmonary
      hypertension functional capacity stage III-IV. A key factor for the success of pulmonary
      hypertension therapy is maintaining near constant blood level of a given medications along
      the day. A sudden decrease in the blood levels might lead to rebound phenomenon; abrupt
      increase in the pulmonary artery pressure which might lead to acute right ventricular failure
      and even to sudden death. As some PHT patients suffer are on hemo-dialysis therapy due to
      end-stage renal disease there is a need to document the variation of the blood level along
      the dialysis cycle.

      After giving informed consent 10 ml of blood will be drawn from the study population at the
      following occasions.

        -  Baseline measurement immediately before starting HD therapy.

        -  During the hemo-dialysis therapy - every one hour.

        -  After the end of the hemo-dialysis therapy - every one hour (a total of four
           measurements) to record recovery of Treprostenil blood levels.

        The study population includes patients with PAH who receive chronic (more than 3 months)
        Treprostenil treatment administered intravenously as a single agent therapy who maintain
        chronic hemo-dialysis therapy. Patients must be in stable condition for at least one month.
        Patients other than class I PAH will be not included in this study.
