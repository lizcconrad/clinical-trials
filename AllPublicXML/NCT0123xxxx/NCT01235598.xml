    <measure>Change in Synovitis Measured by Outcome Measures in Rheumatoid Arthritis Clinical Trials (OMERACT) Rheumatoid Arthritis Magnetic Resonance Image Scoring System (RAMRIS) Score at Week 16 Compared to Baseline for Certolizumab Pegol Arm</measure>
    <time_frame>From Baseline to Week 16</time_frame>
    <description>Rheumatoid Arthritis Magnetic Resonance Image Scoring System (RAMRIS):
Synovitis is defined as an area in the synovial compartment that shows above normal postgadolinium enhancement of a thickness greater than the width of the normal synovium. T1-weighted images were acquired before and after the administration of intravenous contrast agent containing gadolinium. Intravenous contrast was required to demonstrate enhancing synovitis. Synovitis was scored 0 to 3 in 3 wrist regions and in each of the second through fifth metacarpophalangeal (MCP) joints. A score of 0 is normal, with no enhancement or enhancement up to the thickness of normal synovium, while scores of 1 to 3 (mild, moderate, severe) refer to increments of one-third of the presumed maximum volume of enhancing tissue in the synovial compartment. Total synovitis score ranges from a minimum of 0 to a maximum of 21. A negative value in synovitis change from Baseline score indicates an improvement.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline to Week 16 in the Dynamic Magnetic Resonance Image (MRI) Parameter, Initiation Rate of Enhancement (IRE)</measure>
    <time_frame>From Baseline to Week 16</time_frame>
    <description>Contrast enhancement can be quantified in terms of the dynamic MRI parameters initial rate of enhancement (IRE), maximum enhancement (ME), and number of voxels (Nvox) with Plateau and Washout pattern. These parameters are extracted by examining individual signal intensity versus time curves derived from defined regions of interest.
Nvox indicates the number of voxels showing enhancement patterns. It is representative of the size or volume of enhancement and representative of underlying inflammation. The higher the value, the higher the volume .
ME and IRE values quantify the intensity of signal within the enhancing voxels. The absolute values and changes from Baseline in the MRI parameters of IRE, ME, and Nvox of the selected hand and wrist were estimated at Weeks 1, 2, 4, 8, and 16.
The values presented are for Proximal Interphalangeal (PIP) and Metacarpophalangeal (MCP) joints combined. A negative value in IRE change from Baseline score indicates an improvement.</description>

    <time_frame>From Baseline to Week 16</time_frame>
    <description>The Health Assessment Questionnaire-Disability Index (HAQ-DI) is a subject reported questionnaire that provides an assessment of the impact of the disease and its treatment on physical function. The HAQ-DI assesses the degree of difficulty experienced in 8 domains of daily living activities using 20 questions. The domains are dressing and grooming, arising, eating, walking, hygiene, reach, grip, and common daily activities, and each domain (activity) consists of 2 or 3 items. For each question the level of difficulty is scored from 0 to 3 where 0 = no difficulty, 1 = some difficulty, 2 = much difficulty and 3 = unable to do. A total score is computed from the item scores using the scoring rules provided by the author (Fries, 1980). The total score ranges from 0 to 3 with lower scores meaning lower disability. A negative value in HAQ-DI change from Baseline indicates an improvement.</description>

    <description>Rheumatoid Arthritis Magnetic Resonance Image Scoring System (RAMRIS):
Synovitis is defined as an area in the synovial compartment that shows above normal postgadolinium enhancement of a thickness greater than the width of the normal synovium. T1-weighted images were acquired before and after the administration of intravenous contrast agent containing gadolinium. Intravenous contrast was required to demonstrate enhancing synovitis. Synovitis was scored 0 to 3 in 3 wrist regions (the distal radioulnar; the radiocarpal joint; the intercarpal and carpometacarpal joints) and in each of the second through fifth metacarpophalangeal (MCP) joints. A score of 0 is normal, with no enhancement or enhancement up to the thickness of normal synovium, while scores of 1 to 3 (mild, moderate, severe) refer to increments of one-third of the presumed maximum volume of enhancing tissue in the synovial compartment.
A negative value in synovitis change from Baseline score indicates an improvement.</description>

A score of 0 is normal, with no enhancement or enhancement up to the thickness of normal synovium, while scores of 1 to 3 (mild, moderate, severe) refer to increments of one-third of the presumed maximum volume of enhancing tissue in the synovial compartment.
A negative value in synovitis change from Baseline score indicates an improvement.</description>

        <title>Change in Synovitis Measured by Outcome Measures in Rheumatoid Arthritis Clinical Trials (OMERACT) Rheumatoid Arthritis Magnetic Resonance Image Scoring System (RAMRIS) Score at Week 16 Compared to Baseline for Certolizumab Pegol Arm</title>
        <description>Rheumatoid Arthritis Magnetic Resonance Image Scoring System (RAMRIS):
Synovitis is defined as an area in the synovial compartment that shows above normal postgadolinium enhancement of a thickness greater than the width of the normal synovium. T1-weighted images were acquired before and after the administration of intravenous contrast agent containing gadolinium. Intravenous contrast was required to demonstrate enhancing synovitis. Synovitis was scored 0 to 3 in 3 wrist regions and in each of the second through fifth metacarpophalangeal (MCP) joints. A score of 0 is normal, with no enhancement or enhancement up to the thickness of normal synovium, while scores of 1 to 3 (mild, moderate, severe) refer to increments of one-third of the presumed maximum volume of enhancing tissue in the synovial compartment. Total synovitis score ranges from a minimum of 0 to a maximum of 21. A negative value in synovitis change from Baseline score indicates an improvement.</description>

        <title>Change in Synovitis Measured by Outcome Measures in Rheumatoid Arthritis Clinical Trials (OMERACT) Rheumatoid Arthritis Magnetic Resonance Image Scoring System (RAMRIS) Score at Week 1 Compared to Baseline for Certolizumab Pegol Arm</title>
        <description>Rheumatoid Arthritis Magnetic Resonance Image Scoring System (RAMRIS):
Synovitis is defined as an area in the synovial compartment that shows above normal postgadolinium enhancement of a thickness greater than the width of the normal synovium. T1-weighted images were acquired before and after the administration of intravenous contrast agent containing gadolinium. Intravenous contrast was required to demonstrate enhancing synovitis. Synovitis was scored 0 to 3 in 3 wrist regions and in each of the second through fifth metacarpophalangeal (MCP) joints. A score of 0 is normal, with no enhancement or enhancement up to the thickness of normal synovium, while scores of 1 to 3 (mild, moderate, severe) refer to increments of one-third of the presumed maximum volume of enhancing tissue in the synovial compartment. Total synovitis score ranges from a minimum of 0 to a maximum of 21. A negative value in synovitis change from Baseline score indicates an improvement.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline to Week 16 in the Dynamic Magnetic Resonance Image (MRI) Parameter, Initiation Rate of Enhancement (IRE)</title>
        <description>Contrast enhancement can be quantified in terms of the dynamic MRI parameters initial rate of enhancement (IRE), maximum enhancement (ME), and number of voxels (Nvox) with Plateau and Washout pattern. These parameters are extracted by examining individual signal intensity versus time curves derived from defined regions of interest.
Nvox indicates the number of voxels showing enhancement patterns. It is representative of the size or volume of enhancement and representative of underlying inflammation. The higher the value, the higher the volume .
ME and IRE values quantify the intensity of signal within the enhancing voxels. The absolute values and changes from Baseline in the MRI parameters of IRE, ME, and Nvox of the selected hand and wrist were estimated at Weeks 1, 2, 4, 8, and 16.
The values presented are for Proximal Interphalangeal (PIP) and Metacarpophalangeal (MCP) joints combined. A negative value in IRE change from Baseline score indicates an improvement.</description>

        <description>DAS28[CRP] is a composite index and is calculated using the Tender Joint Count (TJC), Swollen Joint Count (SJC) C-reactive protein (CRP in mg/l), and the Patient's Global Assessment of Disease Activity - Visual Analog Scale (VAS in mm) using the following formula: 0.56 x √(TJC) + 0.28 x √(SJC) + 0.36 x lognat (CRP+1) + 0.014 x Global Assessment of Arthritis + 0.96 where 28 joints are examined and a lower score indicates less disease activity. A DAS(28) score of higher than 5.1 is indicative of high disease activity whereas a DAS score below 3.2 indicates low disease activity. A patient is considered to be in remission if they have a DAS28 lower than 2.6. A negative value in DAS28[CRP] change from Baseline indicates an improvement from Baseline.</description>

        <title>Percentage of Subjects Achieving Disease Activity Score 28 (DAS28 (CRP)) Remission Status (DAS28 (CRP) &lt; 2.6) at Week 16</title>
        <description>DAS28[CRP] is a composite index and is calculated using the Tender Joint Count (TJC), Swollen Joint Count (SJC) C-reactive protein (CRP in mg/l), and the Patient's Global Assessment of Disease Activity - Visual Analog Scale (VAS in mm) using the following formula: 0.56 x √(TJC) + 0.28 x √(SJC) + 0.36 x lognat (CRP+1) + 0.014 x Global Assessment of Arthritis + 0.96 where 28 joints are examined and a lower score indicates less disease activity. A DAS(28) score of higher than 5.1 is indicative of high disease activity whereas a DAS score below 3.2 indicates low disease activity. A patient is considered to be in remission if they have a DAS28 lower than 2.6.</description>

        <description>The Health Assessment Questionnaire-Disability Index (HAQ-DI) is a subject reported questionnaire that provides an assessment of the impact of the disease and its treatment on physical function. The HAQ-DI assesses the degree of difficulty experienced in 8 domains of daily living activities using 20 questions. The domains are dressing and grooming, arising, eating, walking, hygiene, reach, grip, and common daily activities, and each domain (activity) consists of 2 or 3 items. For each question the level of difficulty is scored from 0 to 3 where 0 = no difficulty, 1 = some difficulty, 2 = much difficulty and 3 = unable to do. A total score is computed from the item scores using the scoring rules provided by the author (Fries, 1980). The total score ranges from 0 to 3 with lower scores meaning lower disability. A negative value in HAQ-DI change from Baseline indicates an improvement.</description>

        <title>Correlation of Change in Synovitis From Baseline as Measured by Magnetic Resonance Image (MRI) With European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) Response at Week 16</title>
        <description>EULAR (European League Against Rheumatism) response: EULAR response is based upon current Disease Activity Score 28 (DAS28) level and corresponding change from Baseline in DAS28.
Good EULAR response is defined as: DAS28 C-Reactive Protein (CRP) ≤ 3.2 and decrease from Baseline by &gt; 1.2; moderate response is defined as achievement of one of the following:
DAS28(CRP) ≤ 3.2 and decrease from Baseline &gt; 0.6 and ≤ 1.2
DAS28(CRP) &gt; 3.2 and ≤ 5.1 and decrease from Baseline &gt; 0.6

          <title>Correlation of Change in Synovitis From Baseline as Measured by Magnetic Resonance Image (MRI) With Disease Activity Score-28 (DAS28 (CRP)) Response at Week 16</title>
          <description>The DAS28(CRP) was calculated using the tender joint count (TJC) and swollen joint count (SJC), C-Reactive Protein (CRP in mg/L) and the Patient's Global Assessment of Disease Activity - Visual Analog Scale (PtGADA-VAS in mm).
A positive correlation coefficient indicates that reductions in synovitis from Baseline to Week 16 are associated with reductions in DAS28(CRP) at Week 16.</description>

        <description>Radiographic assessment of bone mineral density in one hand and wrist were conducted by Digital X Ray (DXR) using a standardized imaging methodology. The hand and wrist to be assessed by DXR were the same as for the Magnetic Resonance Images (MRIs). The same hand and wrist were used for all x rays. The evaluation of all DXRs was performed centrally.

        <title>Change From Baseline for the Outcome Measures in Rheumatoid Arthritis Clinical Trials (OMERACT) Rheumatoid Arthritis Magnetic Resonance Image Scoring System (RAMRIS) Synovitis Score at Week 1 Placebo (PBO) Versus Certolizumab Pegol (CZP)</title>
        <description>Rheumatoid Arthritis Magnetic Resonance Image Scoring System (RAMRIS):
Synovitis is defined as an area in the synovial compartment that shows above normal postgadolinium enhancement of a thickness greater than the width of the normal synovium. T1-weighted images were acquired before and after the administration of intravenous contrast agent containing gadolinium. Intravenous contrast was required to demonstrate enhancing synovitis. Synovitis was scored 0 to 3 in 3 wrist regions (the distal radioulnar; the radiocarpal joint; the intercarpal and carpometacarpal joints) and in each of the second through fifth metacarpophalangeal (MCP) joints. A score of 0 is normal, with no enhancement or enhancement up to the thickness of normal synovium, while scores of 1 to 3 (mild, moderate, severe) refer to increments of one-third of the presumed maximum volume of enhancing tissue in the synovial compartment.
A negative value in synovitis change from Baseline score indicates an improvement.</description>
