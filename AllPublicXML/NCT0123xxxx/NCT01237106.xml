    <textblock>
      This pilot study will be a prospective investigation to study the efficacy and safety of
      In-Vitro Maturation (IVM) for women with Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome (PCOS). There will be 10
      subjects total in this Study. There will be no blinding to treatment.

      In-Vitro Maturation will provide a viable, safe option for women with PCOS attempting
      pregnancy through the use of Assisted Reproductive Technology (ART).

        Inclusion Criteria

          1. 10 women between the ages of 18-34 inclusive at time of signing Informed Consent Form.

          4. A day 3 FSH level of &lt;8 IU/mL

          5. In good general health off of current medications which may confound response to study
             medications.

          6. Desire to seek pregnancy actively during the study period by IVF-ICSI.

          7. A normal uterine cavity must have been confirmed by either hydrosonogram or
             hysteroscopy within two years of entering the study.

          8. Male partner able to provide adequate semen sample by ejaculation (no TESE)

        Exclusion Criteria

          2. Patients with uncorrected thyroid disease (defined as TSH &lt; 0.2 mIU/ML or &gt;5.5
             mIU/mL). A normal level within the last year is adequate for entry.

          5. Patients with significant anemia (Hemoglobin &lt; 10 mg/dL).

          6. Patients enrolled simultaneously into other investigative studies that would interfere
             with this research study.

          7. have any contraindications to using birth control pills (oral contraceptives) as
             determined by the attending physician (e.g. history of thromboembolism or
             estrogen-dependent malignancy, such as breast cancer, etc.) -
