      The investigators sought to assess whether plasma myeloperoxidase (MPO) levels differ among
      patients with stable and unstable CAD patients and control subjects, and correlate with
      inflammatory and clinical risk factors such as ox-LDL, NO,leptin, adiponectin, sPLA2,
      Lp-PLA2, homocysteine and 3-nitrotyrosine in the patients.

      Elevation of the leukocyte enzyme myeloperoxidase (MPO) in stable coronary artery disease
      (CAD) patients in contrast to unstable CAD patients is controversial and its relationship
      with some inflammatory and noninflammatory markers such as oxidized LDL (ox-LDL) and nitric
      oxide (NO) in the CAD patients has not been evaluated yet. Evaluation of these relationships
      is the aim of the study.Also the relationships between MPO and some other inflammatory
      biomarker such as leptin, adiponectin, sPLA2, Lp-PLA2, homocysteine and 3-nitrotyrosine are
      examined. This study includes 50 stable CAD, 50 unstable CAD patients and 50 controls. Plasma
      MPO, ox-LDL, leptin, adiponectin, sPLA2 levels are determined using enzyme
      immunoassay.Homocysteine and 3-nitrotyrosine are measured using HPLC-fluorescence method.
      Plasma total NO and other risk factors such as lipid profile, hypertension, smoking, diabetes
      mellitus and familial history of CAD are also determined in the patients. Results are
      statistically analysed and the association between all markers are assessed.
