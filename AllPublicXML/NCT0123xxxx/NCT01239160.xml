  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The treatment of lymphedema has been a major focus of attention for physicians and scientists
      for several decades. At this time, no successful techniques have been developed to prevent
      lymphedema, and therefore, a great deal of emphasis is placed on treatment modalities that
      can lessen the severity and impede the progression of this debilitating condition.

      The treatment on offer usually consists of a maintenance phase using compression garments and
      an intensive treatment phase, which includes the use of skin care, compression bandaging,
      exercise and manual lymphatic drainage (MLD). The intensive phase is usually described as
      complex decongestive therapy (CDT). This is time consuming and requires high resource usage.
      Pneumatic compression devices (PCD) offer and alternative to MLD and can be used by the
      patient. There are a number of devices on the market that are categorized into 1. without
      calibrated gradient compression 2. With calibrated gradient compression.

      This trial will compare two PCDs, a simple device without calibrated compression, and an
      advanced device with calibrated compression, in the reduction of swelling and maintenance of
      reduced limb volume in 262 patients with lower limb lymphoedema. The primary end point will
      be limb volume reduction over 12 weeks of treatment, with secondary outcome after 24 weeks.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Multicentre, prospective, single (assessor) blind randomised study. The primary
      objective of the study is to assess volume reduction in the treatment of lymphoedematous legs
      with an advanced PCD compared to a simple PCD in patients with lower limb lymphoedema. The
      main outcome is the percentage volume reduction of the affected limb at end of treatment
      compared to baseline.

      Secondary objectives of the study are Assessment of safety Quality of life Health economic
      parameters

      In total 262 patients with leg lymphoedema will be enrolled into the study. Patients eligible
      for the study are those who suffer from late stage II and stage III according to the
      International Society of Lymphology lymphoedema staging. Lymphoedematous legs can be of
      primary or secondary origin and uni or bilaterally affected. Medical history will be taken at
      baseline.

      Patients will be taught how to use the device they have been randomised to. Visits will then
      take place at weeks 1,4,8,12 and 24 weeks. The device will be used for up to 60 minutes each
      day on the trial limb. At each visit sequential circumferences of the affected and unaffected
      limbs will be measured with a tape measure.

      All adverse events will be documented. At beginning and end of study quality of life
      questionnaires and health economic information will be completed by the patients.

      At the Derby site assessment of tissue quality will be made using ultrasound and moisture
      meter to assess tissue fluid.
