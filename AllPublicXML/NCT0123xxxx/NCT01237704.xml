  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In Hong Kong, every 30 and 12.9 in 100,000 males and females respectively has nasopharyngeal
      carcinoma (NPC). With early detection and advances in medical care, the number of NPC
      survivors post radiotherapy is rapidly growing in Hong Kong. One of the most distressing
      consequences post radiotherapy for NPC patients is swallowing disorder, or dysphagia.
      Dysphagia in NPC patients almost certainly cause frequent chest infection, dehydration,
      malnutrition and limitations to concurrent treatment such as oral medication. Given the
      existing large costs NPC patients incur to the healthcare system, dysphagia only serves to
      further inflate the soaring costs.

      In an attempt to reduce dysphagia related costs to the healthcare system, swallowing
      rehabilitation is offered to NPC patients. Currently, two major swallowing rehabilitation
      approaches are commonly adopted. The first is traditional rehabilitation, which involves
      patients performing various oropharyngeal exercises aimed at improving swallowing physiology.
      The other swallowing rehabilitation approach is transcutaneous electrical stimulation, which
      entails using small amount of electric current to increase muscle strength while patients are
      engaged in swallowing activities. These two methods are proven as effective in patients with
      stroke and head and neck carcinoma patients. Neither of these methods, nevertheless, yields
      any efficacy studies in treating NPC patients. Yet, clinicians continue to use either one or
      both rehabilitation methods as swallowing rehabilitation.

      This study aims to address the gap in efficacy studies on swallowing rehabilitation for NPC
      patients post radiotherapy. The research results should provide justification for
      rehabilitation time, clinicians' efforts, costs involved and resources used in rehabilitating
      the swallowing difficulties of the NPC patients.

    <measure>Penetration-Aspiration Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 1 year after rehabilitation program</time_frame>
    <description>Each subject will undergo Fiberoptic Endoscopic Evaluation of Swallowing (FEES) to identify penetration and aspiration risks of each consistency. Subjects will be assessed on five different consistencies: thin fluids, honey-thick fluids, pureed diet, soft diet and biscuits. Therefore, five penetration-aspiration scores will be generated for each assessment.
Scores will be obtained at baseline, post rehabilitation, six months after baseline and one year after baseline for comparison.</description>

    <measure>Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy - Nasopharyngeal (FACT-NP)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 1 year after rehabilitation program</time_frame>
    <description>The validated FACT-NP is a Chinese QOL questionnaire that evaluates the rehabilitation outcomes specifically for NPC patients. Among the sixteen NPC sub-scale items, seven are specific to dysphagia. The total score and dysphagia specific scores will be analysed.
Scores will be obtained at baseline, post rehabilitation, six months after baseline and one year after baseline for comparison.</description>

    <measure>Self-rated Swallowing Score</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 1 year after rehabilitation program</time_frame>
    <description>A questionnaire based on patient's perception of existing feeding difficulties. Scores will be obtained at baseline, post rehabilitation, six months after baseline and one year after baseline for comparison.</description>

    <measure>Voice Handicap Index - 30</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 1 year after rehabilitation program</time_frame>
    <description>This self-assessment scale consists of 30 items that measures the voice-related quality-of-life over three domains: functional, physical, and emotional. Scores will be obtained at baseline, post rehabilitation, six months after baseline and one year after baseline for comparison.</description>

    <measure>Oral Assessment Guide</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 1 year after rehabilitation program</time_frame>
    <description>This 24 point tool comprise of eight categories: swallow, voice, lips, saliva, tongue, gingival, teeth and mucous membrane. Each category is rated by a scale of 1 (normal), 2 (some abnormality) and 3 (severely abnormal). Scores can be obtained at baseline, post rehabilitation, six months after baseline and one year after baseline for comparison.</description>

    <measure>Perceptual Evaluation of Voice</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 1 year after rehabilitation program</time_frame>
    <description>Four vocal parameters, overall severity, roughness, breathiness and strain, will be rated on a 10-point equal-appearing interval scale by the attending speech therapists. Scores will be obtained at all 4 assessment time point for comparison.</description>
