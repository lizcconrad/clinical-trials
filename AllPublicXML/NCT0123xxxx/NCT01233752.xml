  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Identification of the genetic polymorphisms that could be correlated either with a better
      clinical response or with a major predisposition of patients to develop tolerance and/or side
      effects to the treatment with morphine.

      Valuation of the medium morphine dose (mg/kg/die) necessary to maintain NRS&lt;4 in the first 24
      hours post-surgery in the two groups of patients, A e B. Group A: homozygous patients for the
      more frequent allele of the polymorphism A118G of OPRM1 gene (about 80%); group B: both
      homozygous and heterozygous patients for the less frequent allele (about 20%).

      In order to avoid the bias related to alterations in metabolism, patients with Cmax and AUC
      of morphine (and metabolites M6G and M3G) &gt;2 standard deviation higher than expected
      population curve (&quot;outliers&quot;) will be excluded for the primary purpose.

    <description>The drug will be administrated by a bolus 45 minutes before the end of the surgery, with the following modalities: bolus with morphine chlorhydrate 0.15 mg/kg ± 20%. Also acetaminophene 1g and ketoprofen 160 mg (ketorolac 30mg) will be administrated during the operation.
At the exit of the operative compartment patients will have an electronic pump (PCA) for 48h with morphine chlorhydrate to be used in boluses by 1 mg with a lock out of 5 mins, max dose 20 mg in 4 hours.
Moreover, ketoprofen will be prescribed 160 mg x 2 per day (ketorolac 30mg x 2) (in case of allergy acetaminophene 1g x 3 daily).
Postoperative analgesic treatment is lasting 48h for each patient (between starting of the PCA infusion (T0) and the following 48h).</description>
