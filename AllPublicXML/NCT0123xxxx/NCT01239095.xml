  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Colorectal cancer is the third most common form of cancer found in the United States. To date
      surgical resection provides the best chance for cure. Unfortunately, despite &quot;curative&quot;
      surgery, tumor recurrences develop in 30-40% of patients from either unforeseen residual
      metastases or from viable tumor cells shed into the circulation before or at the time of
      surgery. There is evidence from both humans and mice suggesting that tumor growth is
      stimulated after surgery for a period of time.

      This study calls for the administration of a green tea extract and a milk thistle extract,
      two orally ingested supplements, during the week immediately before and weeks after your
      surgery. It is not the current standard of care to give anti-cancer drugs during the
      perioperative period. The basic idea behind this study is that it should be beneficial to
      inhibit cancer growth in the days leading up to and following surgery. Why is this the case?

      It makes sense to limit or inhibit tumor growth before surgery with drugs provided it can be
      done safely and does not interfere with the surgery. It is also logical to give anti-cancer
      drugs after surgery because, unfortunately, about 35 percent of colorectal cancer patients,
      after resection, have hidden tumor cells that remain in the body. There is also strong human
      evidence that tumor growth is stimulated during the first month after tumor resection as a
      result of the surgical injuries and the healing process. Therefore, there is good reason to
      give anti-cancer drugs as soon as possible after surgery in order to offset some of surgery's
      negative effects.

      Although both supplements have been given safely to a wide variety of patients with a number
      of different medical problems, the two supplements together have never been given to cancer
      patients during the weeks just before and following surgery. We hypothesize that the
      administration of these two supplements together will be safe in the period surrounding
      colorectal cancer surgery.

    <textblock>
      Green tea extract and Silibinin (from the milk thistle plant) have both been shown in
      experimental studies to have anti-cancer effects as well as limited toxicity.
      Epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) is the major active catechin in green tea; it has been
      shown to prevent and limit tumor growth in murine models1-3. Silymarin, which is extracted
      from the seeds of the milk thistle plant, is used clinically as a hepatoprotective agent in
      Europe4. Its major active component, Silibinin, is well-tolerated and largely free of adverse
      effects5-6. In recent studies, Silibinin has been shown to inhibit the growth of a number of
      cancers in mouse models, including lung7, bladder8, liver9, prostate10, and colon11-12.
      Silibinin and EGCG have similar anti-neoplastic mechanisms including: 1) cell cycle arrest
      via upregulation of P21 and P27 and downregulation of CDK, 2) induction of apoptosis via
      Caspase-3 activation and cleavage of poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP), and 3) suppression
      of angiogenesis and metastasis via inhibition of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)
      and matrix metalloproteinase (MMP-9)
