    <textblock>
      RV568 is being developed for the treatment of diseases such as asthma, COPD and allergic
      rhinitis (e.g. hayfever). The main aim of this study is to investigate whether RV568
      ameliorates the nasal symptoms to low doses of grass pollen in healthy subjects with seasonal
      allergic rhinitis.
