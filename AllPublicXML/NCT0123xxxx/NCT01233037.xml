  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a non-randomized feasibility study of endothelial function, exercise capacity, and
      outcome following pre-left ventricular assist device (LVAD)therapy and cardiac transplant.

      The study period will be 5 years, with 20 patients to be enrolled. The investigators
      anticipate that 15 patients will survive to complete the one year follow up period.(the
      published survival rate of LVAD is 75% in one year). 10 patients are anticipated to undergo
      cardiac transplant within 3 years of initial enrollment and they are followed until their 2nd
      annual post transplant invasive evaluation.

      Markers of endothelial function will be studied to permit comparison with selected clinical
      outcomes. The hypothesis is that the endothelial functions will be altered after implantation
      of LVAD then before its implantation, both acutely and chronically, and this may affect the
      exercise capacity, quality of life and occurrence of cardiac allograft vasculopathy post
      cardiac transplantation.

      This is a non-randomized, feasibility study of endothelial function, exercise capacity, and
      outcome following pre-LVAD patients through LVAD therapy and cardiac transplantation.

      The study period will be 5 years. It is anticipated that 20 patients will be enrolled and 15
      will survive (published survival estimate following LVAD is approximately 75% at one year) to
      complete the one-year follow-up period. 10 patients are anticipated to undergo heart
      transplant within 3 years of initial enrollment and they will be followed until their 2nd
      annual post-transplant invasive evaluation.

      Some of the blood collected at each visit will stored by the investigator for up to 5 years.
      Samples will be kept in our laboratory for up to 5 years as plasma, after which they will be
      destroyed. Samples will be identified only by a code number, only the principal investigator
      and his research staff will have access to the code. The results of the future tests will not
      be communicated to subjects in this study.

      The samples are stored in the form of plasma from Peripheral blood for additional markers of
      endothelial function (Soluble thrombomodulin, IL-6, etc.)
