  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will further evaluate the ACAM-CDIFF™ vaccine in a population of middle-aged to
      elderly individuals at risk of exposure to Clostridium difficile because of impending
      hospitalization or residence in a care facility.

      Primary Objectives:

        -  To describe the safety profile of subjects in each of the study groups.

        -  To describe the immune responses elicited by toxoid A and toxoid B of subjects in each
           of the study groups.

      Observational Objective:

        -  To describe the occurrence of first-time Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) episodes.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Participants will receive 3 doses of either one of 4 different formulations of ACAM-CDIFF™
      vaccine or placebo, on one of 3 different schedules. The trial will have 2 stages. Stage I
      will test 4 different formulations of ACAM-CDIFF™ vaccine. Stage II will explore different
      vaccination schedules using one of these formulations.

      Participants will be followed up for safety and immunogenicity; stool samples will also be
      provided in case of diarrhea.
