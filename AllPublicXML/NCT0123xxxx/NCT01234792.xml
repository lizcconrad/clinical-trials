      Single-dose nicotine pharmacokinetics with three oral nicotine replacement products.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study is a single-dose, randomized, crossover study with 24 subjects (all subjects will
      receive all treatments). The investigational products will be 6 mg, 4 mg and 2 mg Nicotine
      medicated gum given as single doses at separate treatment visits. Periods without NRT,
      lasting for at least 36 hours, will separate treatment visits. Blood for pharmacokinetic
      analyses will be drawn before, and at 2.5, 5, 7.5, 10, 15, 20, 30, 45, and 60 minutes as well
      as after 1.5, 2, 4, 6, and 8 hours after start of product administration. Subjects will also
      be monitored to capture any adverse events that may occur. The trial is blind in the sense
      that treatment labels will not be revealed to subjects and trial personnel. Also the
      bioanalysts, pharmacokineticists and monitor will be unaware of treatment labels.
