         14. Current use, or intended use during the study of cyclosporine.

         15. Recent history (past 12 months) of illicit drug use or excessive ethanol use.
             Excessive ethanol use will be defined as &gt;14 drinks per week (1 drink = 12 oz beer, 5
             oz wine, or 1.5 oz hard liquor).

         16. Exposure to any investigational agent within 30 days prior to Visit 1, and prior to
