      Subjects will be randomized in four treatment sequences of twenty subjects each. Subjects in
      each treatment sequence will participate in a total of four treatment periods (A, B, C, and
      D) separated by washout periods of at least 7 days from completion of the prior period (Day
      8) through clinical check-in (Day -1) of the next study period.

      For Period 1, subjects will be admitted to the clinical research unit on Day -2. For each
      subsequent study period, subjects will be admitted to the clinical research unit on Day -1.
      Subjects will be discharged from the unit after completing procedures on Day 8 of each
      period. Subjects will receive a follow-up telephone call 7-10 days after their last clinic
      day (Period 4\Early Discontinuation [ED]).
