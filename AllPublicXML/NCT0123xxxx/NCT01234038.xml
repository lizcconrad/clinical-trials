               2. The patient has recovered from any acute effects of the radiotherapy

               3. Radiotherapy was completed at least 4 weeks prior to Screening

          -  Part 1: Have at least non-measurable evaluable disease (e.g., lesions which are
             smaller than the minimum size required for measurability; other non-measurable lesions
             such as bone metastases, malignant pleural effusion)

          -  Part 2: Have measurable disease, defined as at least 1 lesion that can be accurately
             measured in at least 1 dimension

          -  Performance status of 0 or 1 on the ECOG Performance Status Scale

          -  Have an estimated life expectancy of at least 12 weeks

          -  Adequate organ function within 14 days prior to first study dose (ISIS EIF4E Rx or
             carboplatin/paclitaxel, whichever occurs first) as defined by:

               1. Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) &gt;/= 1.5 x 109/L

               3. Hemoglobin &gt;/=9 g/dL (&gt;/= 5.6 mmol/L). Patients may receive packed RBC
                  transfusion to achieve this level at the discretion of the investigator.

               4. Total bilirubin &lt; 1.5 x upper limit of normal (ULN) unless elevated secondary to
                  conditions such as Gilbert's Disease

               5. Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) &lt; 3 x ULN (&lt; 5 x ULN in the presence of hepatic
                  metastases)

               6. Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) &lt; 3 x ULN (&lt; 5 x ULN in the presence of hepatic
                  metastases)

               7. Alkaline phosphatase &lt; 3.0 x ULN

               8. Calculated creatinine clearance &gt;/= 60 mL/min per Cockcroft and Gault formula

          -  Satisfy one of the following:

               1. Females: non-pregnant and non-lactating; surgically sterile, post-menopausal, or
                  patient or partner compliant with a reliable contraceptive regimen, as determined
                  by Investigator, for 4 weeks prior to Screening. Patients of reproductive
                  potential must test negative for pregnancy at Screen and must agree to use a
                  reliable method of birth control during the study and for the 10 weeks following
                  the last dose of ISIS EIF4E Rx.

               2. Males: surgically sterile or patient or partner must agree to use a reliable
                  contraceptive method, as determined by the Investigator during the study and for
                  the 10 weeks following the last dose of ISIS EIF4E Rx.

          -  For Part 1: have discontinued all prior chemotherapies, biological therapies, and
             other investigational therapies for cancer for at least 4 weeks (6 weeks for
             mitomycin-C or nitrosoureas) prior to study treatment and recovered from the acute
             effects of therapy.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Part 1: More than 2 prior chemotherapy or biological therapy regimens (approved or
             experimental) for NSCLC, not counting adjuvant and neoadjuvant treatment. A regimen is
             defined as two or more consecutive cycles of treatment.

          -  Part 2: Any prior chemotherapy or biological therapy (approved or experimental) for
             NSCLC including adjuvant and neoadjuvant treatments

          -  Treatment with another investigational drug, biological agent, or device within 4
             weeks (6 weeks for biological agents) before Screening or 5 half-lives of study agent,
             whichever is longer

          -  Patients with treated or untreated parenchymal brain metastases or leptomeningeal
             disease. Brain imaging is required for symptomatic patients to rule out brain
             metastases, but is not required in asymptomatic patients.

          -  Patients with known pericardial effusion

          -  Have active infection or serious concomitant systemic disorder (for example, heart
             failure) incompatible with the study (at the discretion of the Investigator)

          -  Presence or history of malignancy other than NSCLC, carcinoma in situ of the cervix,
             or non-melanoma skin cancer. In the case of other malignancies, patients may be
             considered for participation if the prior malignancies were diagnosed and definitively
             treated at least five years previously with no subsequent evidence of recurrence.

          -  Presence of an underlying disease state associated with active bleeding

          -  Ongoing therapy with oral or parenteral anticoagulants (e.g., heparin,
             warfarin/coumadin). Low-dose anticoagulants for maintenance of catheter patency and
             low dose aspirin (≤ 325 mg/day) and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents are not
             exclusionary.

          -  Concurrent treatment with other anticancer drugs

          -  Pre-existing peripheral neuropathy &gt;/=Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events
             Version 4.0 (CTCAE) Grade 2

          -  Known history of HIV, HCV, or chronic HBV infection

          -  Previous treatment with a therapeutic antisense oligonucleotide or siRNA

          -  Planned concomitant participation in another clinical trial of an experimental agent,
             vaccine, or device

          -  Have any other medical conditions that in the opinion of the Investigator, would make
             the patient unsuitable for enrollment, or could interfere with the patient
             participating in or completing the study
