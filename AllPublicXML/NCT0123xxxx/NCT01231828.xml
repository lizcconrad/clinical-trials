      The project will improve scientific knowledge regarding a recent law applying potentially to
      every french driver. It will give for the first time an indication on the impact of alerting
      treatments on driving risks. It will reinforce the links between different research
      environments (sleep physiopathology, clinical research, cognitive neurosciences, drivers
      supervision, virtual reality, pharmacology) among the &quot;RÃ©seau Eveil Sommeil Attention et
      Transports&quot; (RESAT) network.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Excessive daytime sleepiness is responsible of 20% of traffic accidents and 2/3 of truck
      accidents on French Freeways. Since the publication of a new law (2005 december 28th -
      Official Journal) regulating fitness to drive, the Maintenance of Wakefulness Test (MWT) is
      now mandatory to evaluate driving skills of patients suffering of excessive daytime
      sleepiness. The MWT has shown a good predictability of driving handicap on simulators in
      patients suffering from obstructive sleep apnea syndrome. Nevertheless no study has proven
      yet the predictability of the MWT regarding real and simulated driving in patients suffering
      from hepatic encephalopathy. Furthermore, even if therapeutic drugs significantly improve MWT
      scores there is no data available concerning the impact of these drugs on fitness to drive.
      Lactulose, a treatment of hepatic encephalopathy, has not been tested as a counter measure to
      driving impairment. This lack of knowledge is a major handicap to evaluate driving skills of
      treated patients suffering from excessive daytime sleepiness. The main objective of our
      project is to test the predictive value of the MWT on real and simulated driving performances
      in untreated and treated sleepy patients suffering from hepatic encephalopathy.
