  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate risk of cancer incidence and mortality associated
      with the use of REGRANEX (becaplermin) in patients with diabetes who are members of a U.S.
      Veterans Health Administration.

      This is an observational study of patients with diabetes who are eligible for care through
      the national Department of Veterans Affairs Health Care System (VA), representing the largest
      sample of older adults in an integrated health care system in the U.S. with comprehensive
      electronic medical records and linkable health survey data. REGRANEX (becaplermin) is topical
      medication used to treat lower extremity diabetic neuropathic ulcers. VA patients with
      diabetic foot ulcers who have no prior history of cancer who have received treatment with
      becaplermin will be compared to a group of similar patients who have not received treatment
      with becaplermin. Becaplermin users (from the time of initial dispensing of becaplermin) and
      becaplermin nonusers will be followed forward in time for up to 8 years to identify new
      cancers and cancer related deaths, with confirmation of cases through registries and medical
      chart review. This is an observational study; no investigational drug will be administered.
