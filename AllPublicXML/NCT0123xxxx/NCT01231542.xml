      This study will be a phase I, open label, two arm, fixed sequence crossover study to
      investigate the effect of rifampin and rifabutin on the steady state pharmacokinetics (PK) of
      GSK1349572 and the safety and tolerability of GSK1349572 and rifamycin co-administration.
      Subjects enrolled in Arm 1 will receive GSK1349572 50 mg once daily for 7 days, GSK1348572 50
      mg twice daily for 7 days, and GSK1349572 50 mg twice daily in combination with rifampin 600
      mg once daily for 14 days. Subjects in Arm 2 will receive GSK1349572 50 mg once daily for 7
      days and GSK1349572 50 mg once daily in combination with rifabutin 300 mg once daily for 14
      days. Serial PK sampling will be completed following the last dose of each treatment. Safety
      and tolerability will be assessed throughout the study through assessment of adverse events
      (AEs), and clinical laboratory tests.

      This study will be conducted at one center in the US with healthy adult male and female
      subjects.

             should be excluded.
