    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects who the investigator believes can and will comply with the requirements of
             the protocol.

          -  Written informed consent obtained from the subject.

          -  Male and female adults, 18-49 years of age at the time of the first vaccination.

          -  Satisfactory baseline medical assessment by history and physical examination.

          -  Safety laboratory test results within the parameters specified in the protocol.

          -  Access to a consistent means of telephone contact

          -  Female subjects of non-childbearing potential may be enrolled in the study. Female
             subjects of childbearing potential may be enrolled in the study, if the subject: has
             practiced adequate contraception for 30 days prior to vaccination, and has a negative
             urine pregnancy test on the day of first vaccination, and has agreed to continue
             adequate contraception during the entire treatment period and for 2 months after
             completion of the vaccination series.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Medical history of physician-confirmed infection with an H5N1 virus.

          -  Increased risk of occupational exposure to H5N1 influenza viruses.

          -  Previous vaccination at any time with an H5N1 vaccine, or with an oil-in water
             adjuvanted influenza vaccine.

          -  Planned administration of an adjuvanted influenza vaccine or an H5N1 pandemic vaccine
             during the entire study period.

          -  Use of any investigational or non-registered product other than the study vaccine(s)
             within 30 days preceding the first dose of study vaccine, or planned use during the
             study period.

          -  Presence of significant acute or chronic, uncontrolled medical or psychiatric illness.

          -  Presence of neurological or psychiatric diagnoses which, although stable, are deemed
             by the investigator to render the potential subject unable/unlikely to provide
             accurate safety reports.

          -  Evidence of current substance abuse, including alcohol, by medical history.

          -  Presence of a temperature &gt;= 38.0ºC (≥100.4ºF), or acute symptoms greater than &quot;mild&quot;
             severity on the scheduled date of first dose.

          -  Diagnosed with cancer, or treatment for cancer, within 3 years. Persons with a history

             medical history and physical examination.

          -  Receipt of systemic glucocorticoids within 1 month prior to study enrollment, or any
             other cytotoxic or immunosuppressive drug within 6 months of study enrollment.

          -  Receipt of any immunoglobulins and/or any blood products within 3 months of study
             enrollment or planned administration of any of these products during the study period.

             heparin. Persons receiving individual doses of low molecular weight heparin, outside
             of 24 hours prior to dosing, are eligible. Persons receiving prophylactic antiplatelet
             medications.

          -  An acute evolving neurological disorder or history of Guillain-Barré syndrome.

          -  Administration of an inactivated seasonal influenza vaccine within 14 days before the
             first study vaccine dose, or of any other vaccine(s) not foreseen by the study
             protocol within 30 days before the first study vaccine dose. The administration of
             live attenuated trivalent seasonal influenza virus vaccine (LAIV) is allowed.

          -  Planned administration of any vaccine(s) not foreseen by the study protocol through
             completion of the Day 42 visit. The administration of LAIV is allowed.

          -  Any known or suspected allergy to any constituent of influenza vaccines or to latex,
             or history of severe reaction to a previous influenza vaccination.

          -  Known pregnancy or a positive urine beta-human chorionic gonadotropin (β-hCG) test
