  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Skin aging is a multifactorial process involving the 3 layers of the skin: Epidermis, dermis
      and hypodermis.

      Radio-frequency (RF) devices have been used for many years for a variety of surgical
      applications. The energy delivery systems of these established monopolar devices used a
      'conductive coupling' delivery system in which energy is concentrated at the periphery of the
      electrode.

      Venus Concept has developed the Venus Freeze (MP)2 V2 system for wrinkles, rhytides and
      temporary cellulite and circumference reduction treatments. While treating wrinkles rhytides
      and cellulite, the treatments creates enough thermal effect to induce collagen remodeling
      with no ablative thermal damage in the epidermis or dermis.
