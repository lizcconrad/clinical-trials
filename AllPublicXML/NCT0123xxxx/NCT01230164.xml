  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      An aberrometer measures visual aberrations by mapping how light rays travel through the eye
      and by providing maps using colored gradients to represent the magnitude of refractive errors
      of the eye.

      The purpose of this study is to compare 4 different aberrometers -Wavescan (Visx Technology),
      Zywave (Bausch &amp; Lomb), Ladarwave aberrometer (Alcon Inc.) and Allegro Analyzer (Alcon Inc).
      In particular, the investigators propose to focus on the ability of these devices to display
      the higher order visual aberrations and to compare the quality of outputs from these 4
      devices in normal healthy subjects.
