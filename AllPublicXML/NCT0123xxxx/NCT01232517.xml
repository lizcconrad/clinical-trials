      The purpose of this research study is to gather information about the NeuroVision System
      (which is FDA cleared for this indication) during the placement of pedicle screws.
      NeuroVision is a machine that monitors nerve activity during surgery and will alert the
      surgeon if there are any nerve-related issues during screw placement. The use of nerve
      monitoring is standard of care at most centers during spine surgery. The standard monitoring
      for screws placed is performed after the screw is placed, to ensure it is well positioned in
      the bone (if it is not, the screw may be removed and/or repositioned). The NeuroVision System
      has a novel feature called &quot;Dynamic Screw Test&quot; that allows for that monitoring to be
      performed as the screw is placed, rather than after the fact. This study is being done to
      determine if this real-time monitoring of screw placement provides beneficial additional
      information to the operating surgeon to prevent misplacement of screws before it happens.
