  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The PIVOT trial aims to determine whether a strategy of switching to PI monotherapy is
      non-inferior to continuing triple-therapy, in terms of the proportion of patients who
      maintain all the drug treatment options that were available to them at baseline after at
      least 3 years of follow-up, and to compare clinical events, safety, toxicity and health
      economic parameters between the two strategies.

    <time_frame>Week 96</time_frame>
    <description>In a sub-set of participants (n=73):-
Compare prevalence of detectable VL and magnitude of viral replication in genital secretions in patients taking PI monotherapy and triple therapy; to test if PI monotherapy is non-inferior to triple therapy.
Compare drug levels in genital secretions and plasma.
Describe the profile of drug resistance (if any) in patients with detectable VL in genital secretions and to compare this with any previous or subsequent resistance profile in plasma.

Estimate the proportion of patients who have detectable HIV viral load in CSF after 48 weeks on PI monotherapy, and to refute the hypothesis that this proportion is greater than 20%.
Assess whether CSF markers of CNS immune activation, inflammation and neuronal degeneration are elevated after 48 weeks on PI monotherapy.
Assess whether CSF HIV viral load and markers of immune activation, inflammation and neuronal degeneration are elevated in patients with symptomatic CNS disease.

          1. Known major protease resistance mutation(s) documented on prior resistance testing if
             performed (prior resistance testing is not mandatory for trial participation).

          2. Previous change in ART drug regimen for reasons of unsatisfactory virological response
             (patients who have changed regimen for prevention or management of toxicity or to
             improve regimen convenience are permitted to enter the trial).

          3. Previous allergic reaction to a PI.

          4. Patient currently using or likely to require use of concomitant medication with known
             interaction with PIs.

          5. Patient requiring treatment with radiotherapy, cytotoxic chemotherapy, or is
             anticipated to need these during the trial period.

          6. Treatment for acute opportunistic infection within 3 months prior to trial screening.

          7. Pregnant or trying to become pregnant at the time of trial entry.

          8. History of active substance abuse or psychiatric illness that, in the opinion of the
             investigator, would preclude compliance with the protocol, dosing schedule or
             assessments.

          9. History of HIV encephalopathy with current deficit &gt;1 in any domain of the
             Neuropsychiatric AIDS Rating Scale (see Appendix 7).

             disease risk of &gt;30%, or risk of &gt;20% if the patient has diabetes or a family history
             of premature ischaemic heart disease or stroke.

         11. History of insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus.

         12. Patient currently receiving interferon therapy for Hepatitis C virus infection or
             planning to start treatment for Hepatitis C at the time of trial entry.

         13. Co-infection with hepatitis B, defined as Hepatitis BsAg positive at screening or at
             any time since HIV diagnosis, unless the patient has had a documented Hepatitis B DNA
             measurement of less than 1000 copies/ml taken whilst off Hepatitis B active drugs.

         14. Any other active clinically significant condition, or findings during screening
             medical history or examination, or abnormality on screening laboratory blood tests
             that would, in the opinion of the investigator, compromise the patient's safety or
             outcome in the trial.

         15. Fasting plasma glucose &gt;7.0mmol/L at trial screening.
