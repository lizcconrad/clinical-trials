  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Anxiety about needles is a concern commonly expressed by diabetics when beginning insulin
      therapy. A shorter, thinner pen needle that delivers insulin with the safety and efficacy
      profile of longer pen needles may appeal to many diabetic patients as the shorter needle may
      be perceived as less intimidating and more comfortable. While pen needles of 4 to 8 mm in
      length are generally used for insulin injection in patients considered thin or normal weight,
      longer (12.7 mm) needles are still often prescribed for overweight or obese patients with
      diabetes. Since skin thickness is nearly constant across a range of body mass index (BMI), a
      clear rationale exists for the use of shorter needles in obese patients. (Gibney et al., CMRO
      2010)

      The primary purpose of this study is to evaluate whether the BD Ultra-Fine™ Nano 4mm x 32
      Gauge(G) pen needle manufactured by Becton, Dickinson and Company (BD) provides equivalent
      glucose control (as measured by hemoglobin A1c levels) as the BD Ultra-Fine™ 8mm x 31G and
      the BD Ultra-Fine™ 12.7mm x 29G pen needles in obese subjects with diabetes.

      Each subject's participation is expected to last a total of 7 months and includes a screening
      visit, a three-week wash-in period (one week with each of the three different size pen
      needles) followed by two consecutive 12 week study periods. The purpose of the three week
      wash-in period is to minimize the number of dropouts during the following study periods by
      ensuring that subjects have experience using each of the three study needles and find them
      generally acceptable for use during the study.

      Only subjects who complete the wash-in period and confirm their agreement to continue
      participating will be randomized into one of the two study arms. Subjects will be randomly
      assigned to use the BD Ultra-Fine™ 4mm pen needle and either the BD Ultra-Fine™ 8mm pen
      needle or the BD Ultra-Fine™ 12.7mm pen needle. The randomization will also specify which of
      the two study pen needles to be used first. Half of the study subjects will use the BD
      Ultra-Fine™ 4mm and BD Ultra-Fine™ 8mm pen needles (4mm/8mm arm) and the other half will use
      the BD Ultra-Fine™ 4mm and the BD Ultra-Fine™ 12.7mm pen needles (4mm/12.7mm arm). At the end
      of the first 12 week study period subjects will switch to the other assigned pen needle for
      the second and final study period.

      Glycemic control (based on HbA1c concentrations) will be assessed at baseline and at the end
      of each 12 week study period.

    <measure>Glycemic Control as Measured by HbA1c (4 mm vs. 8 mm)</measure>
    <time_frame>Over each 12 week study period</time_frame>
    <description>Subjects' glycemic control was assessed by comparing hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) levels measured at the end of each 12 week Study Period (e.g., at Visit 5 or Visit 7) to the HbA1c measured at the start of that Study Period, i.e. the baseline (Visit 3) for Period 1 and the Period 1/2 crossover (Visit 5) for Period 2.
Analysis included only subjects with HbA1C values at baseline (Visit 3) and at the end of Study Period 1 (Visit 5) and end of Period 2 (Visit 7).</description>

    <measure>Glycemic Control as Measured by HbA1c, in High Dose Insulin (at Least One Dose of ≥ 40 Units) Users</measure>
    <time_frame>Subjects were randomly assigned to use the BD Ultra-Fine™ 4mm pen needle for one - 12 week study period and either the BD Ultra-Fine™ 8mm pen needle or the BD Ultra-Fine™ 12.7mm pen needle for one - 12 week study period.</time_frame>
    <description>Glycemic control was assessed as by difference between the subjects' HbA1c (%) at baseline (randomization, Visit 3) and at the end of each 12 week study period,in the same manner as for the primary outcome measures. The 95% confidence interval for the mean difference in HbA1c values between the 4mm PN and the longer PN will be estimated based on general linear models adjusting for baseline HbA1c.</description>

    <measure>Injection Pain Scores (4 mm vs. 8 mm)</measure>
    <time_frame>At the end of Study Period 2</time_frame>
    <description>At the end of second study period, subjects were asked to rate the level of pain experienced with study period 2 needle compared to the pen needle used in study period 1, using a 150 mm Visual Analog Scale (VAS). The VAS is a measure of the pain perceived with the needle they are using at that point in the study relative to the needle they used in Period 1. The VAS is anchored at the center (0mm) with &quot;as painful&quot; and at each extreme with &quot;much less painful (-75mm) and &quot;much more painful (+75mm); therefore a pain rating &lt; 0 indicates that the Period 2 needle was perceived as less painful than the Period 1 needle.</description>

    <description>At the end of second study period, subjects were asked to rate the level of pain experienced with study period 2 needle compared to the pen needle used in study period 1, using a 150 mm Visual Analog Scale (VAS). The VAS is a measure of the pain perceived with the needle they are using at that point in the study relative to the needle they used the previous period. The VAS is anchored at the center (0mm) with &quot;as painful&quot; and at each extreme with &quot;much less painful (-75mm) and &quot;much more painful (+75mm); therefore a negative pain rating means the period 2 needle was perceived as less painful than the period 1 needle.</description>

        <title>Glycemic Control as Measured by HbA1c (4 mm vs. 8 mm)</title>
        <description>Subjects’ glycemic control was assessed by comparing hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) levels measured at the end of each 12 week Study Period (e.g., at Visit 5 or Visit 7) to the HbA1c measured at the start of that Study Period, i.e. the baseline (Visit 3) for Period 1 and the Period 1/2 crossover (Visit 5) for Period 2.
Analysis included only subjects with HbA1C values at baseline (Visit 3) and at the end of Study Period 1 (Visit 5) and end of Period 2 (Visit 7).</description>
        <time_frame>Over each 12 week study period</time_frame>
        <population>115 subjects completed all main study visits. Two subjects were excluded from the 4 vs. 8 primary analysis due to protocol deviations. The total population size evaluated for the primary objective (4 vs. 8) is therefore 113.</population>

        <title>Injection Pain Scores (4 mm vs. 8 mm)</title>
        <description>At the end of second study period, subjects were asked to rate the level of pain experienced with study period 2 needle compared to the pen needle used in study period 1, using a 150 mm Visual Analog Scale (VAS). The VAS is a measure of the pain perceived with the needle they are using at that point in the study relative to the needle they used in Period 1. The VAS is anchored at the center (0mm) with &quot;as painful&quot; and at each extreme with &quot;much less painful (-75mm) and &quot;much more painful (+75mm); therefore a pain rating &lt; 0 indicates that the Period 2 needle was perceived as less painful than the Period 1 needle.</description>

        <title>Glycemic Control as Measured by HbA1c (4 mm vs. 12.7 mm)</title>
        <description>Subjects’ glycemic control was assessed by comparing hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) levels measured at the end of each 12 week Study Period (e.g., at Visit 5 or Visit 7) to the HbA1c measured at the start of that Study Period, i.e. the baseline (Visit 3) for Period 1 and the Period 1/2 crossover (Visit 5) for Period 2.
Analysis included only subjects with HbA1C values at baseline (Visit 3) and at the end of Study Period 1 (Visit 5) and end of Period 2 (Visit 7).</description>
        <time_frame>Over each 12 week study period</time_frame>
        <population>115 subjects completed all main study visits. Two subjects were excluded from the 4 vs. 12.7 primary analysis due to protocol deviations. The total population size evaluated for this analysis is therefore 113.</population>

        <description>Subjects were asked to record hyperglycemic events in his/her diary anytime his/her blood glucose (BG) was above 400mg/dL, or s/he required medical attention for treatment for hyperglycemia.
Hyperglycemia was defined as serious when the subject required the assistance of another person to be treated, or when the hyperglycemic event met the per-protocol definition of a Serious Adverse Event. An unexplained episode was defined as one with no known cause (for example, the subject missed an insulin dose). Subjects were asked to record these events in a diary.</description>
