  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial is studying how well MK2206 works in treating patients with advanced
      liver cancer that did not respond to previous therapy. MK2206 may stop the growth of tumor
      cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Evaluate the median progression-free survival in patients with advanced hepatocellular
      carcinoma treated with MK-2206 after failure of one prior line of anti-angiogenic therapy.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Evaluate the objective response rate (CR + PR). II. Evaluate the median overall survival.
      III. Evaluate the tolerability and toxicity profile of MK-2206 in this patient population.

      IV. Explore, in a preliminary fashion, potential molecular predictors of efficacy.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive oral Akt inhibitor MK2206 on days 1, 8, 15, and 22. Courses repeat every 28
      days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 4 weeks and then every 3-6
      months thereafter.
