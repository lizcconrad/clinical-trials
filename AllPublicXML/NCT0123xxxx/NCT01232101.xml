  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is investigator initiated. Tumors that gives the narrowing of the bile ducts
      prevents bile from flowing from the liver to the intestine resulting in jaundice and the risk
      of bacterial growth in bile with severe infections as a result. Unresectable bile duct
      strictures have routinely been treated them with plastic stents. The plastic stents have been
      replaced by self expandable metallic stents.

      These stents remain open longer for reasons that they have a larger diameter so that the bile
      flows through more easily. One problem with these stents, however, is that the tumor growing
      through the wire mesh which forms the wall of the stent. This has led to the development of
      so-called covered stents. Whether covered stents have longer patency is unclear as well as
      whether they are as safe. There is reason to believe that covered stents remain open longer,
      but there may be an increased risk of migration and other complications.

      The purpose is to prospectively and randomized compare the two stent types. The study
      endpoint is the clogging of the stent or the patient's death. We also monitor complications,
      regress time of the jaundice and success rate of stent placement
