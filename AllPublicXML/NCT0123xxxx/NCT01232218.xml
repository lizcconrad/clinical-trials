  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if a specific stretching and strengthening
      protocol, in addition to current standard treatment, is more effective for treating
      post-stroke shoulder pain than current standard treatment alone.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Current standard treatment of post-stroke shoulder pain includes joint protection (i.e.,
      slings and protective positioning) and stretching/strengthening exercises through a pain-free
      range. Although the added movement of the shoulder blade when moving the post-stroke arm has
      been recommended in the literature, no studies to date have been found which directly looks
      at the impact of providing synchronized three-dimensional scapular and humeral movement
      during therapy. Due to the integral relationship between the scapula and the humerus during
      movement, it is hypothesized that an increase in 3-dimensional shoulder blade mobility in the
      painful post-stroke shoulder will contribute to increased pain-free 3-dimensional arm
      movement. This double-blind randomized-controlled study aims to investigate the effectiveness
      of this 3-D approach at addressing post-stroke shoulder pain.
