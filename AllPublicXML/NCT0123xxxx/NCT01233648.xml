      This study is being done to find out if controlling rate or controlling rhythm is better for
      heart failure patients who also have AF. Patients with AF who are receiving a CRT-D device
      and AV node ablation as part of their clinical care will be followed for one year. One group
      will have their heart rate controlled by the ICD and AVN ablation alone and the second group
      will be treated with the ICD, AVN ablation and standard medical therapies to restore the
      heart's normal rhythm. The study doctors will compare the information collected from all of
      the subjects in this study to see if treating rate or treating rhythm is better in patients
      with heart failure and AF, resulting in a better quality of life.
