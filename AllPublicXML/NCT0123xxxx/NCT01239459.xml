      Primary Objective:

      - To determine the effect of severe renal impairment on the pharmacokinetic profile of
      teriflunomide administered as a single 14 mg dose as compared to healthy subjects

      Secondary Objective:

      - To assess the tolerability of teriflunomide administered as a single 14 mg dose in subjects
      with severe renal impairment compared to subjects with normal renal function.

        Inclusion criteria:

        Subjects with renal impairment:

          -  Male subject between 18 and 75 years of age inclusive and postmenopausal female
             between 45 and 75 years of age inclusive.

          -  Chronic severe renal impairment as defined by Cockroft-Gault formula (creatinine
             clearance (CLcr) &lt; 30mL/min, but not requiring hemodialysis).

          -  Laboratory parameters within the acceptable range for subjects with renal impairment;
             in particular, hepatic enzymes (ALT, AST) and bilirubin should be &lt; 2 x upper limit of
             normal range and neutrophils should be within normal ranges.

        Matched healthy subjects:

          -  Male subject between 18 and 75 years of age inclusive and postmenopausal female
             between 45 and 75 years of age inclusive, matched by age.

          -  Body weight within 15% of the body weight of the subjects with renal impairment to be
             matched and Body Mass Index between 18.0 and 30.0 mg/kg2 inclusive.

          -  Certified as healthy by a comprehensive clinical assessment (detailed medical history
             and complete physical examination).

          -  Normal renal function as defined by Cockroft-Gault formula (creatinine clearance
             (CLcr) &gt; 80mL/min)

          -  Laboratory parameters within the normal range, unless the Investigator considers an
             abnormality to be clinically irrelevant for healthy subjects; however serum
             creatinine, alkaline phosphatase, hepatic enzymes (AST, ALT), bilirubin (unless the
             subject has documented Gilbert syndrome) should not exceed the upper limit of normal
             range.

        Exclusion criteria:

        Subjects with renal impairment:

          -  Uncontrolled clinically relevant cardiovascular, pulmonary, gastro-intestinal,

             female) or infectious disease, or signs of acute illness.

          -  Active hepatitis, hepatic insufficiency.

             impairment), nephrotic syndrome.

          -  Positive results on urine drug screen (amphetamines / methamphetamines, barbiturates,
             benzodiazepines, cannabinoids, cocaine, opiates) unless this result is secondary to a
             documented medical prescription.

          -  Positive alcohol test.

          -  Man who disagrees to use a double barrier method of contraception with their partner

             gastrointestinal, hepatic, renal, metabolic, hematological, neurological, psychiatric,
             systemic, ocular, gynecologic (if female), or infectious disease, or signs of acute

               -  any medication (including St John's Wort) within 14 days before inclusion, or
                  within 5 times the elimination half-life or pharmacodynamic halflife of that
                  drug, whichever the longest, with the exception of menopausal hormone replacement
                  therapy.

               -  any significant change in chronic treatment medication within 14-days before
                  inclusion.

          -  Any drug, which could impact by any mechanism of action, the pharmacokinetic of the
             investigational product.

          -  Positive reaction to any of the following tests: hepatitis B surface (HBs) antigen,
             antihepatitis C virus (anti-HCV) antibodies, HIV1 antibodies, anti-HIV2 antibodies.

          -  Positive results on urine drug screen (amphetamines / methamphetamines, barbiturates,
             benzodiazepines, cannabinoids, cocaine, opiates).

          -  Positive alcohol test.
