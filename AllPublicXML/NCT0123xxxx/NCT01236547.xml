    <textblock>
      This randomized phase II trial studies the side effects and how well intensity-modulated
      radiation therapy (IMRT) and paclitaxel with or without pazopanib hydrochloride works in
      treating patients with anaplastic thyroid cancer. Specialized radiation therapy that delivers
      a high dose of radiation directly to the tumor may kill more tumor cells and cause less
      damage to normal tissue. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as paclitaxel, work in different
      ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from
      dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Pazopanib hydrochloride may stop the growth of
      tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. It is not yet known
      whether radiation therapy and paclitaxel are more effective when given with pazopanib
      hydrochloride in treating thyroid cancer.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the safety of IMRT, paclitaxel, and pazopanib (pazopanib hydrochloride)
      suspension. (Run-in component) II. To evaluate and compare overall survival at 1 year from
      study registration. (Phase II component)

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate local-regional control at 6 and 12 months. (Phase II component) II. To
      evaluate the rate of grade 4 (Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 4.0
      [CTCAE, v. 4.0]) hemorrhage, grade 4 febrile neutropenia, or any grade 5 adverse event
      assessed to be definitely, probably, or possibly related to the induction or concurrent
      treatment components of the protocol regimen. (Phase II component) III. To evaluate the rates
      of other adverse events (CTCAE, v. 4.0) assessed to be definitely, probably, or possibly
      related to the induction or concurrent treatment components of the protocol regimen. (Phase
      II component) IV. To evaluate the rate of treatment discontinuation due to toxicity during
      the induction or concurrent treatment components of the protocol regimen. (Phase II
      component) V. To evaluate response (as per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors
      [RECIST]) of the primary site following the treatment component in subjects with measurable
      disease prior to chemoradiation. (Phase II component)

      OUTLINE:

      RUN-IN COMPONENT: Patients receive paclitaxel intravenously (IV) over 1 hour once weekly and
      pazopanib hydrochloride orally (PO) once daily (QD) for 2-3 weeks. Patients then receive
      concurrent paclitaxel IV over 1 hour once weekly and pazopanib hydrochloride PO QD for 6-7
      weeks (or until radiation treatment is completed) and intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT)
      5 days per week for 6.5 weeks (total of 66 Gy in 33 fractions). Beginning 25-31 days after
      the completion of IMRT, patients receive paclitaxel IV over 1 hour once weekly and pazopanib
      hydrochloride PO QD. Treatment repeats every 3 weeks for 4 courses (for patients with no
      measurable disease) or continues in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity (for patients with measurable disease).

      RANDOMIZED PHASE II COMPONENT: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

      ARM I: Patients receive paclitaxel IV over 1 hour once weekly and pazopanib hydrochloride PO
      QD for 2-3 weeks. Patients then receive concurrent paclitaxel IV over 1 hour once weekly and
      pazopanib hydrochloride PO QD for 6-7 weeks (or until radiation treatment is completed) and
      IMRT 5 days per week for 6.5 weeks (total of 66 Gy in 33 fractions). Beginning 25-31 days
      after the completion of IMRT, patients receive paclitaxel IV over 1 hour once weekly and
      pazopanib hydrochloride PO QD. Treatment repeats every 3 weeks for 4 courses (for patients
      with no measurable disease) or continues in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity (for patients with measurable disease).

      ARM II: Patients receive paclitaxel IV over 1 hour once weekly and placebo PO QD for 2-3
      weeks. Patients then receive concurrent paclitaxel IV over 1 hour once weekly and placebo PO
      QD for 6-7 weeks (or until radiation treatment is completed) and IMRT 5 days per week for 6.5
      weeks (total of 66 Gy in 33 fractions). Beginning 25-31 days after the completion of IMRT,
      patients receive paclitaxel IV over 1 hour once weekly and placebo PO QD. Treatment repeats
      every 3 weeks for 4 courses (for patients with no measurable disease) or continues in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity (for patients with measurable
      disease).

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 2 years,
      every 6 months for 1 year, and then annually thereafter.

      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Pathologically (histologically or cytologically) proven diagnosis of anaplastic
             thyroid cancer (a diagnosis that is noted to be &quot;consistent with anaplastic thyroid
             cancer&quot; with the presence of a thyroid mass is acceptable)

               -  Note: tissue collection for central review is mandatory, but central review is
                  not required for eligibility; treatment will be started prior to central review

          -  If there was a total or partial thyroidectomy completed within 3 months of enrollment,
             the surgical specimen must show the area of anaplastic thyroid cancer to be at least 1
             cm in greatest dimension

          -  The following minimum diagnostic workup is required:

               -  History/physical examination within 2 weeks prior to registration

               -  Imaging of neck and brain (computed tomography [CT] scan or magnetic resonance

               -  Note: the CT scan of the neck must be done with contrast or if an MRI is done,
                  with gadolinium; therefore, the CT portion of a full body PET/CT has to be a high
                  resolution CT to be acceptable for eligibility

               -  Abdominal imaging must cover the liver and adrenal glands; therefore, separate
                  imaging is not required if these areas are covered by a chest CT scan

               -  Electrocardiogram within 10 days prior to registration

          -  Zubrod performance status 0-2

             institutional ULN; note: patients who have both bilirubin &gt; ULN and AST/ALT &gt; ULN are
             not eligible (unless they have Gilbert's syndrome and elevations of indirect
             bilirubin)

          -  Spot urine protein to creatinine ratio (UPCR) &lt; 1 or a 24-hour urine protein
             collection &lt; 1 gm within 10 days prior to registration

          -  Creatinine &lt; 1.5 mg/dL or within normal institutional limits within 10 days prior to
             registration; Note: if neither criteria is met, the creatinine clearance must be &gt; 50
             mL/min/1.73 m^2 per either the Cockcroft-Gault equation, Jeliffe method, or 12- or

             family history of prolonged QTc, and relevant cardiac disease within 10 days prior to
             registration

          -  Evaluation of the patient's medications within 10 days prior to registration with
             attempt to change any medication that affects cytochrome P450, family 3, subfamily A,
             polypeptide 4 (CYP3A4)

          -  Blood pressure =&lt; 140/90 within 10 days of registration (must be taken and recorded by
             a health care professional); Note: if the systolic blood pressure is &gt; 140 and/or
             diastolic blood pressure is &gt; 90 at the time of registration, the patient's blood
             pressure must be controlled; systolic blood pressure must be &lt; 140 and diastolic blood
             pressure must be &lt; 90 on at least 2 separate measurements prior to the start of
             treatment, and the treating physician must believe that this is feasible in order to
             enroll the patient

          -  Prothrombin time (PT)/international normalized ratio (INR)/partial thromboplastin time
             (PTT) within 1.2 x the upper limit of normal within 10 days prior to registration

             desired level of anticoagulation

             child-bearing potential

                  telithromycin, voriconazole may increase pazopanib concentrations and are

                  taken with pazopanib
