      This study is to investigate whether there is an association of the LOC387715/HTRA1 variants
      with response to treatment with combined photodynamic therapy and intravitreal bevacizumab
      for patients with polypoidal choroidal vasculopathy.

      This is a retrospective cohort study comprised of 70 eyes being treated for polypoidal
      choroidal vasculopathy with combined photodynamic therapy and intravitreal bevacizumab
      injections. Patients were genotyped for the LOC387715 (rs10490924) and the HTRA1 gene
      polymorphism (rs11200638).

      Genomic DNA was extracted from peripheral blood. The two SNPs (rs10490924 in the LOC387715
      locus and rs11200638 in HTRA1 gene) were analyzed by LC480 Real time PCR (Roche, Basel,
      Switzerland) at D&amp;P Biotech (Daegu, Korea).
