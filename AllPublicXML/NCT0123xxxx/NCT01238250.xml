  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Simons Variation in Individuals Project (VIP) is characterizing the medical, behavioral,
      and learning features of individuals with specific documented genetic changes associated with
      features of autism and developmental delay with the goal of improving clinical care and
      treatment for these individuals.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In Phase 2 (currently enrolling), the study has expanded to include more families with
      genetic changes by including additional genetic changes of interest and offering
      participation through a remote (online, phone) format. This allows English-speaking families
      from across the world to participate at times convenient to their schedule. Biospecimens will
      be collected from participants and linked to clinical data in order to understand the
      relationship between specific genetic changes and the brain's development.

      In Phase 1 (now closed to enrollment), the project assembled a team of experts at seven
      premier medical centers to collect detailed clinical information from families through
      in-person visits. This information has helped clinicians and families understand the
      relationship between specific genetic changes and the brain's development.

      Information from the project will be stripped of any personal identifying information and
      made available to qualified scientists around the world.

      The Simons Foundation, a New York-based private foundation, is committed to finding
      science-based solutions and working towards the development of targeted treatments to improve
      the lives of individuals with genetic and developmental differences.

             single gene listed above (ii) Deletion size is less than 2 MB (iii) Deletion includes
             less than or equal to 5 genes (in addition to gene of interest) with no known disease
             association

          -  Both biological parents are encouraged to participate. Participants must be able to
             speak and read English fluently.

          -  Any individual with features of autism who has had genetic testing and a known genetic
             diagnosis may be eligible to participate; contact the study team for more information.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        - Exclusion criteria will include individuals who do not have the CNVs or genetic variants
        in the genes specified about, or individuals who do not speak and read English fluently.

        Individuals who do not have a genetic variation in one of the above listed genes or regions
        are still encouraged to join the online community and submit a laboratory report for
