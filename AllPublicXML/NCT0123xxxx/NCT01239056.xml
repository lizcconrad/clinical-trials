    <participant_flow>
      <pre_assignment_details>There were 22 signed informed consents, however after Endoscopic ultrasound imaging, 2 participants were excluded due to characteristics of the cyst cavity. Therefore, 20 participants underwent transgastric drainage of pancreatic pseudocysts by use of the fully covered self-expanding metal stents (CSEMS).</pre_assignment_details>

          <title>Pancreatic Pseudocysts</title>
          <description>Patients underwent Endoscopic Ultrasound-guided pseudocyst transmural drainage using fully covered self-expanding metal stents (CSEMS). Next, patients underwent an Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography to evaluate for Pancreatic duct (PD) disruption. Patients then received an abdominal CT to assess pancreatic pseudocyst resolution. If complete resolution was noted, all stents were subsequently removed. If the pseudocyst was not resolved, stent removal was deferred and follow-up CTs were obtained at 2 to 4 week intervals until radiographic resolution was achieved.</description>

          <title>Pancreatic Pseudocysts</title>
          <description>Patients underwent Endoscopic Ultrasound-guided pseudocyst transmural drainage using fully covered self-expanding metal stents (CSEMS). Next, patients underwent an Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography to evaluate for Pancreatic duct (PD) disruption. Patients then received an abdominal CT to assess pancreatic pseudocyst resolution. If complete resolution was noted, all stents were subsequently removed. If the pseudocyst was not resolved, stent removal was deferred and follow-up CTs were obtained at 2 to 4 week intervals until radiographic resolution was achieved.</description>
