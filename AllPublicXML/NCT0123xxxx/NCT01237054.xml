  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:

      - Recent studies have shown that the premalignant conditions monoclonal gammopathy of
      undetermined significance (MGUS) and smoldering multiple myeloma (SMM) have a high risk of
      progressing to multiple myeloma (MM). There are currently no known effective treatments to
      prevent MGUS or SMM from developing into MM, and there are no known tests for determining
      whether an individual with MGUS or SMM will develop MM. Researchers are investigating new and
      improved imaging techniques that may be able to better detect the progression of MGUS or SMM
      into MM.

      Objectives:

        -  To compare the results of three imaging techniques in individuals with MGUS, SMM, and
           MM.

        -  To correlate the information from the imaging studies with established clinical markers
           of progression from MGUS/SMM to MM.

      Eligibility:

      - Individuals at least 18 years of age who have been diagnosed with monoclonal gammopathy of
      undetermined significance, smoldering multiple myeloma, or multiple myeloma.

      Design:

        -  Participants will be screened with a physical examination and medical history, and will
           provide baseline blood, urine, and bone marrow samples before beginning the imaging
           studies.

        -  Participants will have three imaging studies on separate days: a standard
           18-fludeoxyglucose positron emission tomography/computed tomography scan (18-FDG
           PET/CT), a PET/CT scan with an experimental sodium fluoride-based drug (18-NaF PET/CT),
           and dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI).

        -  Participants will be closely monitored during each scan, and will provide additional
           blood samples before and after the scans.

        -  Participants may provide additional blood, urine, tissue, and bone marrow samples for
           optional research studies.

      Background:

        -  Multiple myeloma (MM) is a plasma cell neoplasm with a median survival of 3-4 years.

        -  Monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS) and smoldering myeloma (SMM)
           are premalignant plasma cell proliferative disorders characterized by elevated
           monoclonal protein and bone marrow plasma cells. MGUS affects 3.2% of Caucasians over
           the age of 50 and has a 1% annual risk of progression to MM.

      Approximately 3000 cases of SMM are diagnosed annually with a 10% annual risk of progression
      to MM.

        -  Currently, it is not possible to predict which patients will progress to MM.

        -  Novel imaging modalities (FDG-PET, 18-NaF PET and DCE-MRI) may improve our ability to
           predict patients who are at high risk of progression.

      Objectives:

        -  To compare the results of imaging modalities (18-NaF PET/CT, 18-FDG PET/CT, and DCE-MRI)
           in patients with MGUS, SMM, and MM.

        -  To correlate the imaging studies with established clinical markers of progression from
           MGUS/SMM to MM, including serum M-protein, percentage of plasma cells in the bone
           marrow, serum free light-chain abnormalities and immunoparesis, and ratio of
           normal/abnormal plasma cells in the bone marrow by flow cytometry.

      Eligibility:

        -  A confirmed diagnosis of MGUS, SMM or MM (based on IMWG (International Myeloma Working
           Group) diagnostic criteria)

        -  Age greater than or equal to 18 years

        -  ECOG (Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group) performance status in the range of 0-2

      Design:

        -  This is a cross-sectional pilot study of patients with MGUS, SMM or MM.

        -  Following initial evaluation and confirmation of diagnosis, baseline studies including
           skeletal survey will be done.

        -  Subsequently 18-NaF PET/CT, 18-FDG PET/CT and DCE-MRI imaging will be done in all the
           patients.

        -  10 MGUS, 11 SMM and 10 MM patients will be enrolled on this protocol.

        -  Patients may donate cellular products or tissues as appropriate for research purposes.

        -  Almost all MGUS and SMM patients will be followed clinically as part of 10-C-0096:

      Natural History Study of Monoclonal Gammopathy of Undetermined Significance (MGUS) and
      Smoldering Myeloma (SMM).

    <time_frame>60 days</time_frame>
    <description>18F-FDG PET CT and F18-NaF PET CT imaging results were compared in participants with MGUS, SMM, and MM. Lesions were considered positive if focal uptake corresponded to lesions identified on CT for NaF and negative if no uptake seen in lesions. Criteria to define FDG positivity included parameters published by Zamagni et al with focal abnormal uptake more intense than background.</description>

    <description>DCE-MRI, an FDA approved gadolinium chelate (e.g. Magnevist, Berlex Laboratories, NJ, USA) will be administered intravenously at 3 cc/sec using an automated pump injector (Medrad, Pittsburgh, PA, USA). The criteria was presence of early and diffuse hyper-enhancement compared to the surrounding bone marrow. The pattern of marrow involvement on MRI was characterized as: (1) normal when there was no evidence of abnormal signal intensity; (2) focal, which consisted of localized areas of abnormal marrow; the lesions are darker than yellow marrow and slightly darker than or isointense to red marrow on T1-weights images; (3) diffuse, in which normal bone marrow signal intensity is completely absent, the intervertebral disks appear brighter than or isointense to the diseased marrow; and finally (4) heterogeneous that consists of innumerable small foci of disease on a background of intact marrow, with small dark lesions on T1-weighted images, which become bright on T2-weighted image.</description>

        <description>18F-FDG PET CT and F18-NaF PET CT imaging results were compared in participants with MGUS, SMM, and MM. Lesions were considered positive if focal uptake corresponded to lesions identified on CT for NaF and negative if no uptake seen in lesions. Criteria to define FDG positivity included parameters published by Zamagni et al with focal abnormal uptake more intense than background.</description>

The criteria was presence of early and diffuse hyper-enhancement compared to the surrounding bone marrow. The pattern of marrow involvement on MRI was characterized as: (1) normal when there was no evidence of abnormal signal intensity; (2) focal, which consisted of localized areas of abnormal marrow; the lesions are darker than yellow marrow and slightly darker than or isointense to red marrow on T1-weights images; (3) diffuse, in which normal bone marrow signal intensity is completely absent, the intervertebral disks appear brighter than or isointense to the diseased marrow; and finally (4) heterogeneous that consists of innumerable small foci of disease on a background of intact marrow, with small dark lesions on T1-weighted images, which become bright on T2-weighted image.</description>

          <title>Imaging in MGUS, SMM, and MM</title>
          <description>Participants will have three imaging studies on separate days: a standard positron emission tomography/computed tomography scan (18-FDG PET/CT), a PET/CT scan with an experimental sodium fluoride-based drug (18-NaF PET/CT), and magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI).
18-NaF PET: The patient will patient will receive 5mCi of F-18 NaF IV bolus, followed by a ~20 ml saline (sodium chloride IV infusion 0.9% w/v) flush over a period of ~20 seconds. Serial dynamic imaging (2 minutes/bed position) will be obtained over a 1-hour period. The patient will be permitted an imaging break until a static PET/CT is performed beginning at 2-hours post F-18 NaF injection. DCE-MRI: An FDA approved gadolinium chelate (e.g. Magnevist, Berlex Laboratories, NJ, USA) will be administered intravenously at 3 cc/sec using an automated pump injector (Medrad, Pittsburgh, PA, USA).18-FDG PET/CT: The 18F-FDG injection procedure will be injected and be followed by a ~20 ml saline flush over a period of ~20 sec.</description>
