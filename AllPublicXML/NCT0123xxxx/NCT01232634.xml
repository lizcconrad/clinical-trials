  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test the external validity of the systemic ultrasound
      protocol for data acquisition and interpretation, in order to diagnose soft tissue and
      osteochondral abnormalities in hemophilic children.

    <textblock>
      Ultrasound has advantages over MRI as it is less expensive, does not require sedation and is
      more readily available in centres around the world. Given these characteristics of ultrasound
      it is an ideal imaging tool for early assessment of hemophilic joints in countries whose
      access to MRI is limited. Early evaluation of soft tissue changes in young hemophilic
      patients may lead to earlier interventions and better mid-term and long-term clinical
      outcomes. By this way the joint function of hemophilic patients can be preserved, saving
      their joints from severe arthropathy and offering them the possibility of a normal
      professional life in the society.

    <description>Each knee, elbow and ankle joint receives a numeric score, which can be compared to itself over time to determine whether it is showing degeneration due to bleeding. FISH score is a seven item measure of disability used to evaluate change in functional independence over time.</description>

        Children attending the Hemophilia clinics at the participating institutions (Universidade
        de São Paulo, Universidade Federal de São Paulo and Universidade Estadual de Campinas), who
        have a history of ankle or knee bleed(s), will be recruited to take part in this study.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Diagnosis of hemophilia A (factor VIII deficiency ≤1%) or B (factor IX deficiency
             ≤1.0%)

          -  Cooperative patients (age of 7 to 18 years old)

          -  Patients under 7 years old who have clinical evidence of arthropathy and imaging
             studies are required for clinical reasons. In these cases, the procedures may be done
             under sedation.

          -  Male sex (higher prevalence in males)

          -  History of previous ankle or knee bleed

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Co-morbid illness such as juvenile idiopathic arthritis, muscular dystrophy,
             neuropathic arthropathy that cause osteoarticular findings that may obscure or
             confound the hemophilia-based joint findings

          -  Non-cooperative patients

          -  Active bleed (defined as evidence of a recent bleed with one week of the proposing
             imaging studies and/or musculoskeletal changes on physical examination suggestive of a
             bleed within one week of the proposed imaging studies).

          -  Prior synovectomy
