  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Suppression of effects of androgens with male sex hormones, androgen suppression treatment
      (AST), has been known to reduce deaths and prolong life in advanced prostate cancer. There
      have, however, been concerns raised in previous studies that androgen suppression may be
      associated with increased rate of heart attacks, particularly in older men. This study looks
      at prostate cancer patients in The Ottawa Hospital Cancer Clinic to see if treating these
      patients with androgen suppression is associated with a decrease in blood flow to the heart
      muscles by using Positron Emission Tomography (PET) and brachial artery ultrasound.

      Treatment group: Prior to the initiation of AST, subjects will have a baseline N-13-ammonia
      PET scan and a brachial artery ultrasound at the University of Ottawa Heart Institute. Blood
      glucose and a lipid profile will be obtained. These tests will be repeated 6 - 9 months after
      starting AST.

      Cancer control group: The same testing and intervals will be performed. Normals control
      group: Baseline testing will be done to establish a normal.

    <time_frame>6 - 9 months</time_frame>
    <description>The change in global absolute MFR between baseline and follow up PET studies, at a patient level. MFR is defined as the ratio between regional blood flow with maximum vasodilation and baseline regional blood flow.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Regional myocardial perfusion</measure>
    <time_frame>6 - 9 months</time_frame>
    <description>The change in absolute MFR between baseline and follow up tests for the 3 major coronary territories. Territories with severe reduction in flow or no flow on baseline images will be censored from this analysis. Regional myocardial perfusion will be assessed semi-quantitatively by summed stress scores and summed difference scores in each of the PET scans in the treatment and control groups.
Two-dimensional scans and pulse measures will be taken of the brachial artery with flow-mediated vasodilatation expressed as a percent change in arterial diameter from resting diameter.</description>
