        Inclusion criteria:

          -  Patient or patient's parent or legal guardian has provided written informed consent

             procedures;

          -  Patient has been diagnosed with Pompe Disease prior to or during the screening period
             based on 2 GAA gene mutations and either: endogenous GAA activity &lt;75% of the lower
             limit of the normal adult range reported by the testing laboratory, as assessed in
             cultured skin fibroblasts -or- endogenous GAA activity &lt;75% of the lower limit of the
             normal adult range reported by the testing laboratory, as assessed by dried blood spot
             or whole blood assay;

          -  Patient is male or female and 13 years of age or older at the time of enrollment in
             the study;

          -  Sexually active patients must be willing to use an acceptable method of contraception
             while participating in the study and for at least 30 days following the last dose of
             BMN 701;

          -  If patient is female and not considered to be of childbearing potential, she is at
             least 2 years post-menopausal or had tubal ligation at least 1 year prior to
             screening, or who have had total hysterectomy;

             additional pregnancy tests during the study;

          -  Patient has ≥30% predicted upright FVC and either &lt;80% predicted upright FVC, or &gt;10%
             reduction in supine FVC compared to upright FVC during the Screening Period;

          -  Patient is naïve to Enzyme Replacement Therapy (ERT) with rhGAA;

          -  Patient must be able to ambulate at least 40 meters (131.2 feet) on the 6MWT conducted
             at the Screening visit (use of assistive devices such as walker, cane, or crutches, is
             permitted); and

          -  Patient has the ability to comply with the protocol requirements, in the opinion of

             requirements or compromise the patient's well being or safety;

          -  Patient has any condition that, in the view of the Investigator, places the patient at
