    <textblock>
      This rollover study is designed to provide continued access to GSK2118436 for eligible
      subjects with BRAF mutation-positive tumors who have previously participated in a
      GlaxoSmithKline (GSK)-sponsored GSK2118436 study (parent study), who have no evidence of
      progressive disease and who have tolerated GSK2118436 in the parent study without significant
      toxicities. Subjects will be enrolled into the appropriate cohort based upon the treatment
      received in their parent study. Safety assessments (physical examinations, vital signs,
      12-lead electrocardiograms, echocardiograms, clinical laboratory assessments, and monitoring
      of adverse events) will be made throughout the study. Clinical activity will be assessed
      using local standard of care imaging practices and the appropriate response criteria as
      determined by the investigator.

          -  Currently has no evidence of progressive disease, as determined by the investigator,
             following previous treatment with GSK2118436 (either as monotherapy or as part of a
             combination treatment regimen)

          -  For Cohort C only: Subjects must have a calcium phosphate product (CPP) of &lt;4.4
