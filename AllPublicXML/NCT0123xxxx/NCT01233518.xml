      This is a prospective, multi-center trial conducted at up to 20 US, Canadian, European and
      Asian centers designed to determine the diagnostic performance of CT-FLOW (the
      investigational technology) by coronary computed tomographic angiography (CCTA) for
      non-invasive assessment of the hemodynamic significance of coronary lesions, as compared to
      direct measurement of fractional flow reserve (FFR) during cardiac catheterization as a
      reference standard.
