        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Medically stable male and female subjects aged greater than or equal to 65 years with
             suitable veins for cannulation or repeated venipuncture. Subjects may have controlled
             chronic diseases such as hypertension, type 2 diabetes, osteoarthritis, stable chronic
             obstructive pulmonary disease, mild or moderate renal insufficiency (Estimated
             glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) per the Modified Diet in Renal Disease [MDRD]
             formula &gt;50 mL/min/1.73 m2), rhinitis etc. as long as there has not been any
             significant changes in their medical condition or medications for the preceding 6
             weeks. Classification of renal impairment will be based using an MDRD equation

          -  Male subjects who are sexually active must use a condom and their partner if of
             childbearing potential must use a reliable method of contraception from the first dose
             of investigational product until 3 months after their last dose

          -  Have a body mass index (BMI) between 19 and 32 kg/m2 and weigh at least 50 kg

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  History of any clinically significant medical, neurologic or psychiatric disease or
             disorder (other than those previously defined as acceptable for this population, see
             inclusion criterion 1) which, in the opinion of the Investigator, may either put the
             subject at risk because of participation in the study, or influence the results of the
             subject's ability to participate in the study: This includes seizure activity and
             repeated episodes of major depression

          -  Significant cardiovascular or cerebrovascular disease such as: a history of acute
             coronary syndrome; angina that has been symptomatic in the last 6 months; significant
             symptomatic arrhythmia; a stroke; transient ischemic attack that have occurred in the
             last 6 months

          -  History or presence of gastrointestinal or hepatic disease or any other condition
             known to interfere with absorption, distribution, metabolism or excretion of drugs

          -  Subjects who have type 2 diabetes must have an HbA1c of less than 8% according to the
             National Glycohemoglobin Standardization Program (NGSP) at screening

          -  Significant renal insufficiency as defined by eGFR per the MDRD formula &lt;50
             mL/min/1.73 m2 (individual eGFR measurements will be documented in the protocol).
