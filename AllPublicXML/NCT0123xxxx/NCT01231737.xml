  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Epidemiological studies showed that 20-30% of patients with uncomplicated urinary tract
      infections risked recurrent infection. Urinary tract infection causes marked discomfort for
      the patient, has a negative impact upon quality of life, and is associated with high social
      and health costs in terms of specialist appointments, laboratory and instrumental tests and
      prescriptions . Although diverse cycles of antibiotic therapy and prophylaxis have been
      proposed, doubts persist about the most efficacious pharmacological agents, duration of
      prophylaxis , the incidence of adverse effects and relapse when antibiotic therapy is
      suspended.

      Aims of the study:

        1. To compare the efficacy of two prophylactic schedules (Prulifloxacin vs Phosphomycin):

             -  in reducing the number of urinary tract infection episodes during prophylaxis

             -  in reducing the number of urinary tract infection episodes after prophylaxis

             -  in improving the patient's quality of life .

        2. To assess :

             -  Tolerability of antibiotic prophylaxis

             -  The incidence of resistance to antibiotic therapy
