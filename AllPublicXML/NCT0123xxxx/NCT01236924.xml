  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Slipped disc is the rupture of the fibrous ring, with subsequent displacement of the nucleus
      pulposus in intervertebral spaces, which may cause compression of nerve structures. It is
      estimated that 2-3% of the population have taken with this process, whose prevalence is 4.8%
      in men and 2.5% in women over 35 years. Thus, the purpose of this study is to verify the
      effectiveness of global postural reeducation in patients diagnosed with chronic symptomatic
      lumbar disc herniation with the application of a randomized controlled trial. Will be
      measured pain, disability and functional flexibility.
