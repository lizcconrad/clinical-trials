      This is a phase IV open label study assessing the safety and effectiveness of artemisinin
      derivatives-based combination therapy (ACT) when used on a large scale and under &quot;real life&quot;
      conditions.

      The study will be conducted in a well defined population in Burkina Faso by setting up a
      population-based monitoring system.

      The monitoring for adverse events (AEs) will use two approaches (active and passive) based on
      a repeat survey of the study population. The active surveillance population will be weekly
      and actively visited at home at day 7, day 14 and day 28 after drug administration. The
      passive surveillance population will be encouraged to report passively any AE/ADR and they
      will NOT be actively visited at home.

      In addition, the possible exposure to ACTs of all the pregnant women identified during the
      repeat surveys in both the active and passive surveillance areas will be extracted from the
      drug exposure log book or elicited by history, and the data will be entered into a pregnancy
      register.

      For the effectiveness study, patients with a microscopically confirmed diagnosis of malaria
      (any parasite density), clinical symptoms and a blood sample for thick and thin blood smears,
      and later PCR analysis (on filter paper) for genotyping will be collected before antimalarial
      treatment, at day 28 after treatment and at any unscheduled visit. This will be repeated for
      each confirmed malaria episode.

    <description>For the active surveillance, all age groups, including children less than 5 years of age, will be identified from the census database and encouraged to attend the health facility whenever sick. Those with a diagnosis of malaria and treated with an antimalarial drug will be actively monitored for AEs.</description>

    <arm_group_label>Safety Passive Surveillance Group</arm_group_label>
    <description>For the people under passive surveillance, sick subjects attending the health facilities, diagnosed with malaria and treated with an antimalarial drug will be identified from the census database. The treatment administered will be recorded in a drug exposure log book and the patients will be encouraged to report passively any AE/ADR.</description>

  <arm_group>
    <arm_group_label>Early Pregnancy Exposure to ACTs Group</arm_group_label>
    <description>All the pregnant women identified during the repeat surveys will be included in a pregnancy cohort. At the time the pregnant woman is identified, her possible exposure to ACTs will be extracted from the drug exposure log book or elicited by history. Births identified through the repeat surveys or any other outcome of pregnancy will be retrospectively matched with antimalarial treatment exposure, particularly during the first trimester of the pregnancy.</description>

    <description>Besides monitoring AEs and ADRs, data on the effectiveness of ACTs when used in &quot;real life&quot; conditions and on a large scale will be collected in the active surveillance area. For patients with a microscopically confirmed diagnosis of malaria, clinical symptoms and a blood sample for thick and thin blood smears, will be collected before antimalarial treatment, at day 28 after treatment and at any unscheduled visit. Treatment administration will not be supervised.</description>

        Initially, a census of the population living in Nanoro department and around (approximately
        50,000 people) will be carried out. The complete census database will be utilized to
        estimate the incidence of malaria episodes and to determine whether there is any clustering
        of malaria episodes as well as AEs. Such census will be updated by a team of 8 field
        workers who will visit each single household every 4 months, for at least 3 years to
        identify newly pregnant women and to collect information on vital events such as births and
        deaths. Of the 50,000 people in the census database, approximately 25,000 will be under
        active surveillance while the other 25,000 will be under passive surveillance.
