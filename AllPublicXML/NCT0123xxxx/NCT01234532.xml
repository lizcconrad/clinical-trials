  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial is studying how well giving entinostat and anastrozole together works in
      treating postmenopausal women with triple-negative breast cancer that can be removed by
      surgery. Entinostat may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed
      for cell growth. Estrogen can cause the growth of breast cancer cells. Hormone therapy using
      anastrozole may fight breast cancer by blocking the use of estrogen by the tumor cells.
      Giving entinostat together with anastrozole may be an effective treatment for breast cancer.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the safety and tolerability of entinostat in combination with anastrozole or
      tamoxifen. (Pilot) II. To determine the optimal dose of entinostat in combination with
      anastrozole or tamoxifen for phase II. (Pilot) III. To determine baseline and percentage
      change in proliferative index (Ki67) before and after treatment with entinostat and
      anastrozole/tamoxifen in triple negative breast cancer (TNBC). (Phase II) IV. To determine
      the estrogen receptor (ER) expression after treatment with entinostat and
      anastrozole/tamoxifen in TNBC. (Phase II)

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate baseline and change in the expression levels of progesterone receptor (PR),
      human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2), epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR),
      cytokeratin 5/6 (CK5/6), and aromatase before and after treatment with entinostat and
      anastrozole/tamoxifen.

      II. To assess baseline and change in tumor tissue histone H3 and H4 acetylation before and
      after treatment with entinostat and anastrozole/tamoxifen.

      III. To assess the clinical and pathological response to preoperative combination of
      entinostat and anastrozole/tamoxifen in TNBC.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To correlate the levels of histone H3 and H4 acetylation in tumors with the changes in
      Ki67 and ER.

      II. To evaluate baseline and change in gene methylation silencing and expression of candidate
      genes in tissues and in circulating DNA, including estrogen receptor (ER)-alpha, ER-beta,
      RAR-beta, cyclin D2, Twist, RASSF1A, and HIN-1.

      III. To correlate entinostat trough concentrations with histone H3 and H4 acetylation in
      tumors as well as the change in Ki67 and ER.

      IV. To evaluate baseline and change in the global gene expression profile before and after
      treatment with entinostat and anastrozole/tamoxifen.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter, pilot study followed by a phase II study.

      Patients receive entinostat orally (PO) once daily on days 1, 8, 15, 22, and 29 and
      anastrozole PO once daily on days 4-29. Patients then undergo mastectomy or lumpectomy.

      Tumor tissue samples are collected at baseline or from original diagnosis, and during surgery
      for correlative studies by IHC and RT-PCR. Blood samples are also collected at baseline, on
      days 1 and 15, and during surgery for correlative studies.

      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed up for 30 days.

For 35 patients in this study, if the true unknown probability of a rare toxicity is 10%, the probability of observing 1 or more toxicities is 97%, and if the true toxicity rate is 5% then the probability of observing one or more rare toxicities is 83%.</description>
