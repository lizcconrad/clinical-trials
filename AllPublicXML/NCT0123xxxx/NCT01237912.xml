      The current study was designed to determine the exposure of adult smokers and non-smokers to
      cigarette smoke constituents through evaluation of selected biomarkers of exposure.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study was to provide a greater knowledge about human exposure to cigarette
      smoke constituents by evaluating selected biomarkers of exposure in smokers and non-smokers.
      This was an observational, parallel-group study to be conducted at multiple centres in the
      UK, Germany, and Switzerland. It was planned to enrol sufficient subjects such that at least
      1440 subjects complete the study.
