    <textblock>
      The rationale of this study is to establish a registry to detect and follow patients with CLI
      treated in Vienna. The Vienna CLI registry is meant to document the incidence, prevalence,
      and actual outcome of CLI patients in a real world setting and should serve as a tool for the
      evaluation of medical, endovascular and surgical interventions. It will help determining the
      prognosis of individual patients and have impact on economic and political decisions in
      Vienna concerning this disease and the related costs.

      This is a prospective observational cohort study including consecutive patients with CLI. The
      study will be initiated as a single center evaluation and is intended to be step-wise
      expanded to a Vienna-wide systematic survey. The study will include patients with chronic
      critical limb ischemia and ischemic ulcerations as defined by Fontaine stage IV or Rutherford
      stages 5 &amp; 6. The study will include all patients presenting with CLI to the participating
      centers including inpatients and outpatients.

      Patients will be followed up 1 month, 3 months, 6 months, 12 months and then every 6 months.
      The study will be continued at least until the 5 year data of the last included patient are
      available.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Chronic (&gt; 2 weeks) critical limb ischemia in one or both of the lower extremities
             with necrosis and/or gangrene in the limb (peripheral artery disease IV according to
             Fontaine's classification or Rutherford stage 5 &amp; 6) of whatever genesis
             (atherosclerotic, aneurysmatic, embolic, inflammatory)

          -  ankle/brachial index &lt; 0.4 or toe pressure &lt; 30 mmHg

          -  Ability to give written informed consent

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  o Ulceration exclusively due to nonvascular causes like neuropathy (without coexisting
             hemodynamic impairment as defined above) or venous ulceration (without coexisting
             arterial impairment as defined above)
