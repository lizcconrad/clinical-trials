  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the current study is to determine whether ibuprofen, given as immediate or delayed
      prophylactic antipyretic treatment in a standardized manner, significantly impacts the immune
      response in children receiving primary vaccination with GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) Biologicals'
      10-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine, co-administered with DTPa-combined vaccines, at 3,
      4 and 5 months of age.

      In addition, this study will further evaluate the impact of prophylactic administration of
      paracetamol following primary vaccination with immediate or delayed administration or when
      given in an immediate manner at the time of the booster dose.
