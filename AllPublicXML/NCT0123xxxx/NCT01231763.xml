      This study is being done to find out what women would want in a film vaginal product for
      human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) prevention, especially what it should look like and how to
      apply it.

      The investigators hypothesize that women will prefer a smooth, clear, and rectangular
      quick-dissolve vaginal film for HIV prevention over a textured, opaque, square quick-dissolve
      vaginal film.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The lives of 25 million people have ended due to HIV-related causes since the start of the
      AIDS epidemic in 1981 (1). Each year, AIDS continues to claim the lives of millions of
      people, with an estimated two million deaths worldwide in 2008 (2). Heterosexual transmission
      of HIV accounts for the majority of new infections and disproportionately affects women both
      in the United States and globally (2, 3). There is an urgent need for agents to prevent the
      sexual transmission of HIV, particularly agents that may be controlled by women.

      Quick dissolve films such as Listerene® Breath Strips have been developed for inexpensive
      delivery of drugs and vitamins. As products for HIV prevention, quick dissolve films offer a
      host of potential advantages including low cost, control by the receptive partner, discreet
      and applicator-free use, low mess, portability, easy storage, stability, targeting to site of
      exposure, reduction of systemic toxicity by bypassing first-pass metabolism, and the
      incorporation of multiple active microbicidal compounds (4, 5).

      In the course of developing agents for HIV prevention, determination of valued
      characteristics is important for product refinement and for enhancement of future use
      likelihood. Knowledge regarding acceptability can also inform product promotion and
      educational campaigns (6).

        Women aged 18-30 years from the Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania area who express interest in the
        study. Enrollment is expected to achieve racial and ethnic demographics representative of
        Allegheny County, Pennsylvania in terms of approximately 0.2 percent American Indian and
        Alaska Native, 2.5 percent Asian, and 1.5 percent Hispanic or Latino (7). Allegheny County
        is 82.8 percent white and 13.2 percent black or African American (7). For enrollment in
        this study, we would like to achieve at least 40 percent black or African American in order
        to collect a more diverse set of film microbicide preferences. The remainder of enrollment
        is expected to be white.
