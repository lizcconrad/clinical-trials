      This clinical trial studies yoga therapy in treating patients with malignant brain tumors.
      Yoga therapy may improve the quality of life of patients with brain tumors

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To estimate the participation rate, accrual, adherence, and retention to a yoga trial in
      patients with malignant brain tumors.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To obtain estimates of the variability of self-reported fatigue, distress (i.e.,
      depression, anxiety), sleep disturbance, cognitive function, and health-related quality of
      life from baseline to the end of the intervention at 6 (post-onsite intervention) and 12
      weeks (post-full intervention).

      II. To obtain preliminary estimates of the efficacy of a yoga intervention in patients with
      malignant brain tumors on the outcomes of fatigue, distress, and cognitive function.

      III. To standardize the cancer-specific yoga protocol for use with brain tumor patients.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients participate in yoga classes comprising postures, deep relaxation, breathing
      practices, and meditation twice weekly for 75 minutes during weeks 1-6. Patients then
      practice yoga at home twice weekly for 45 minutes during weeks 7-12.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up periodically for 4-5 months.

    <description>Track barriers to recruitment. Participation rate calculated as proportion of eligible patients who agree to participate. Study retention estimated as proportion of participating patients who complete questionnaires at Week 6. Further retention data obtained by tracking # of dropouts, when dropout occurs, &amp; reasons for dropout. Intervention adherence estimated as mean % of yoga classes attended. Summary statistics for patient characteristics, participation rates, adherence &amp; retention. 95% confidence intervals calculated for each feasibility measure.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

        Signed protocol specific informed consent Are diagnosed with a Malignant Brain Tumor
        (Grades II-IV) Able to start the on-site yoga intervention within 1 week of first radiation
        treatment Are physically able to attend the intervention classes (Eastern Cooperative
        Oncology Group [ECOG] performance status rating 0-2) Able to understand written and spoken
        English Have no medical contraindications reported by the attending physician

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Have practiced yoga on a regular basis (at least once a week) within the past 4 weeks to
        recruit participants who are not already regularly practicing yoga; given that the benefits
        of yoga are likely more immediate than long-term, however, we will enroll participants who
        have previously had a yoga practice
