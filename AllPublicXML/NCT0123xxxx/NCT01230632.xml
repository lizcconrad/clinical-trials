  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is to compare the effects of high fat overfeeding on metabolic risk factors in
      children born though assisted reproduction technologies (ART) versus children conceived
      naturally (controls). The investigators will utilize state of the ART measures to
      characterize the physiological, endocrine and molecular responses to high fat overfeeding.

      The investigators hypothesize that children conceived following ART will have greater
      responses to high fat dietary challenge and that this will be associated with DNA
      hypermethylation of genes that are involved in lipid metabolism.

    <textblock>
      This study represents a novel initiative by the investigators to determine whether children
      conceived through ART have different metabolic responses at baseline or in response to high
      fat overfeeding as compared to age and body mass index-matched spontaneously conceived
      controls. Furthermore, the investigators will identify any differences in DNA methylation of
      candidate genes involved in lipid metabolism in adipose tissue and blood, to determine
      whether this is related to adverse outcomes during high fat overfeeding. The results from
      this study will help answer growing questions of the future health of In vitro fertilisation
      (IVF) babies, and may stimulate further research into optimising protocols for ovarian
      stimulation or in-vitro conditions during early blastocyst development.

    <time_frame>18 months</time_frame>
    <description>After infusion of glucose bolus(0.3mg/kg, 50% glucose), blood samples are taken at 0,1,3,5,7,10,20,30 and 60 minutes. The value of glucose is recorded respectively (unit:mMol/L).</description>

    <measure>insulin sensitivity</measure>
    <time_frame>18 months</time_frame>
    <description>A 2-hour hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp (60mU/m2/min) is used to measure insulin sensitivity(Âµmol/min/kg Fat Free Mass). This is calculated by the formula from the amount of dextrose necessary to maintain blood glucose at 5mmol/L.</description>
