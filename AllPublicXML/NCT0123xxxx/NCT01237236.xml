  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      LEE011 is a new oral drug designed to inhibit the activity of an enzyme known as CDK4/6.
      CDK4/6 is involved in the process that allows both normal and cancer cells to divide and
      multiply. Cancer cells are often driven to divide and multiply by abnormalities that increase
      the activity of CDK4. Hence there is hope that blocking the activity of CDK4 may slow the
      growth of some cancers. LEE011 has shown anti-cancer activity in several different tumor
      models in animals.

      Because CDK4 is important in both normal and cancerous cells, LEE011 is expected to decrease
      the ability of the bone marrow to make white blood cells, platelets, and red blood cells.
      Although these effects are expected to be reversible, they can increase the risk of
      infection, bleeding and fatigue.

      The primary purpose of this study is to find the highest dose of LEE011 that can be safely
      given to adult patients with advanced solid tumors or lymphomas for which no further
      effective standard treatment is available. It will provide information about the side effects
      that may occur following treatment. The study will also possibly provide early evidence for
      LEE011's anti-tumor activity.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients aged ≥18 years with a histologically or cytologically confirmed diagnosis of
             a solid tumor or lymphoma for which no further effective standard treatment is
             available

          2. Patients must have an ECOG performance status of 0 - 1

          3. Patients enrolled in the dose expansion phase must have at least one measurable lesion
             as defined by RECIST criteria for solid tumors or Measurable nodal disease at baseline
             as defined by Cheson criteria for Lymphoma.

          4. A sufficient interval must have elapsed between the last dose of prior anti-cancer
             therapy (including cytotoxic and biological therapies and major surgery) and
             enrollment in this study, to allow the effects of prior therapy to have abated:

               -  Cytotoxic chemotherapy: ≥ the duration of the cycle of the most recent treatment
                  regimen (a minimum of 2 weeks for all regimens, except 6 weeks for nitrosoureas
                  and mitomycin-C).

               -  Biologic therapy (e.g., antibodies): ≥ 4 weeks.

          5. Patients must have adequate organ function, as defined by the following parameters:
