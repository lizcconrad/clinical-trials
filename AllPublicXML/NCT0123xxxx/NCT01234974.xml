    <textblock>
      Observe the safety/tolerability and effectiveness in terms of response rate and duration of
      response of the combination pasireotide + everolimus in the treatment of patients with
      relapsed/refractory multiple melanoma.

    <textblock>
      Multiple myeloma (MM) is a B-cell malignancy of plasma cells. It represents the second most
      common hematological malignancy, with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma being the most common.In this
      protocol, we propose a regimen consisting of a novel combination of two agents with a
      promising preclinical activity, i.e., pasireotide (IGF-1 inhibitor) and everolimus (mTOR
      inhibitor), exploring the efficacy of this therapy in patients with MM. We propose enrollment
      after failure to the first two lines of FDA-approved agents, even in patients who did not
      have high-dose chemotherapy and SCT. In fact, overall survival after SCT has been shown to be
      identical when &quot;early&quot; SCT is compared to &quot;late&quot; SCT, i.e., administered at the time of
      relapse. This provides an important opportunity to test our novel therapeutic approach,
      reserving SCT for relapse. The advantage of the this strategy is that similar overall
      survival outcomes can be achieved with fewer patients undergoing SCT. Both everolimus and
      pasireotide have the potential of being clinically effective against myeloma. A phase II
      trial of the mTOR inhibitor temsirolimus, an analogue of everolimus, produced a response rate
      of 38% in relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma. The IGF-1 inhibitor pasireotide is a
      promising agent, because IGF has been recently found to be one of the most important growth
      signal molecule in myeloma cells. The combination of everolimus and pasireotide should have a
      synergistic antimyeloma effect because preclinical data invitro have shown that combined
      inhibition of mTOR inhibition and IGF-1 led to a synergistic increase of cell growth
      inhibition in multiple myeloma cells and might represent a potential new treatment strategy.
