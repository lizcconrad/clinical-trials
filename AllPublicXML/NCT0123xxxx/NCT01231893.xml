  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this experimental therapy is an assessment of the safety and feasibility of
      transplantation of autologous olfactory ensheathing glia and olfactory fibroblasts obtained
      from the olfactory mucosa in patients with complete spinal cord injury.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The increasing number of patients (mostly young), who have sustained a spinal cord injury
      mainly as a result of motor vehicle accidents, falls or violence has become worldwide a
      serious clinical, social and economical problem. Most accepted treatment protocols for spinal
      cord injury focus on techniques of early neuro-protection aimed at maximal prevention of
      secondary spinal cord injury (administration of methylprednisolon and spinal cord surgical
      decompression) as well as on methods of stimulation of plasticity in the central nervous
      system (neurorehabilitation). While these methods have been shown to stimulate functional
      recovery in patients with incomplete spinal cord injury, the results of treatment of patients
      with severe incomplete and complete spinal cord injuries remain unsatisfactory. This is due
      to the lack of spontaneous regeneration of lesioned axons in the spinal cord. Results from a
      substantial number of animal experiments performed mainly on the model of mammalian spinal
      cord injury in the last 3 decades led to the establishment of numerous regeneration-promoting
      strategies including application of neurotrophic factors, antibodies blocking the
      myelin-associated proteins and transplantation of cells with neurotrophic activity. Olfactory
      ensheathing cells (OECs) are an unique population of macroglia found in the lamina propria of
      olfactory mucosa, around the olfactory nerve fascicles and in the two outer layers of the
      olfactory bulb. These cells have the natural ability to stimulate the regrowth of lesioned
      peripheral and central axons. In a Phase I non-randomized controlled prospective study we
      have tested the hypothesis that a combined approach for treatment of complete spinal cord
      injuries consisting of intraspinal transplantation of a mixture of autologous OECs and
      fibroblasts isolated from the olfactory mucosa, combined with intense neuro-rehabilitation is
      safe and feasible.

    <description>In this group patients are planned to underwent a biopsy of their own olfactory mucosa for isolation and culture of olfactory ensheathing cells and olfactory fibroblasts. The suspension of these cells will be next transplanted into the focus of spinal cord injury. Before and after surgery the patients will undergo an intense neurorehabilitation program.</description>
