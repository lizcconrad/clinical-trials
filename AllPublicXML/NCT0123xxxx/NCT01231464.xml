    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to compare the efficacy and safety of Fluticasone Furoate
      Nasal Spray (FFNS), that is FFNS with placebo in Chinese adult and adolescent subjects with
      Allergic Rhinitis as AR. There are 3 phases, 2 to14 day run in, 2 week treatment, and 3 to 5
      day follow up. After run in period, at least 360 subjects with AR ( ages of 12yrs and 65yrs,
      inclusive) will be randomised to receive FFNS 110ug once daily or placebo for 2 weeks. The
      primary endpoint is the change from baseline of reflective total nasal symptom score (rTNSS)
      during treatment period, and the secondary endpoints include mean change from baseline in
      nasal finding scores by rhinoscopy at completion of study treatment, and severity of overall
      inference in activities of daily living. Safety measures include AE (Adverse Event) reports,
      ECGs (Electrocardiograph), physical exams, vital signs, and nasal exam. In addition,
      reflective total ocular symptom score (rTOSS) will be measured as an explorative endpoint,
      only in the specific AR (Allergic Rhinitis) patients with severe ocular symptoms.

    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, 2 week, double blind, randomized, placebo controlled trial. 7
      investigational sites will be enlisted to randomize at least 360 subjects (outpatients)
      during 2009 and 2010. Throughout the entire study period, no antiallergy drugs and rhinitis
      medication, including rescue medication for symptom relief and anti-hyperactivity will be
      allowed. The run in period will consist of a minimum of 2 days and a maximum of 14 days.
      During this period, intermittent allergic rhinitis(IAR) or persistent allergic rhinitis(PER)
      should be diagnosed confirmatively as the definition from the current ARIA (Allergic Rhinitis
      and its Impact on Asthma) guideline and the coming effective Chinese allergic rhinitis
      management guideline. Subjects will assess their nasal symptom scores and compliance in dairy
      cards to confirm whether to meet randomization criteria. During the treatment period,
      subjects are randomized (1 and 1 ratio) to FFNS 110ug or matching vehicle placebo nasal spray
      to self administer intranasal treatment once daily for 2 weeks. Subjects will rate their
      nasal symptom scores and also document their study drug administration and compliance, any
      medication conditions experienced, and any concomitant medications taken in their dairy
      cards. Subjects also assess the severity of overall interference in activities of diary
      living(ADL) at baseline and the end of study treatment in their questionnaire. At baseline
      and the end of study treatment, investigators rate nasal findings scores by rhinoscopy, and
      record them in patient notes. A follow up telephone contact will be made 3 to 5 days after
      completion of study treatment/early withdrawal to assess for any post treatment adverse
      effects. The primary endpoint is the change from baseline of reflective total nasal symptom
      score(rTNSS) during treatment period, and the secondary endpoints include at completion of
      study treatment, mean change from baseline in nasal finding scores by rhinoscopy, and the
      severity of overall inference in activities of daily living. The safety measures include
      ECGs, vital exams, physical exams, and AE reports. In addition, reflective total ocular
      symptom score(rTOSS) will be measured as an explorative endpoint, only in the specific AR
      patients with severe ocular symptoms.

    <description>The Total Nasal Symptom Score (TNSS; possible score of 0-12) is the sum of 4 individual participant-assessed symptom scores for rhinorrhea, nasal congestion, nasal itching, and sneezing, each evaluated using a scale of 0=None, 1=Mild, 2=Moderate, or 3=Severe. The rTNSS was performed in the morning (AM rTNSS) and evening (PM rTNSS) and assessed the participant's symptoms over the preceding 12 hours. The daily rTNSS is the average of the AM rTNSS and PM rTNSS assessments. Mean changes from baseline over the entire treatment period were calculated as treatment period rTNSS minus baseline rTNSS.</description>

    <description>The nasal finding score by rhinoscopy (possible score of 0-12) is the sum of 4 individual investigator assessed scores for swelling of inferior nasal concha mucosa, color of inferior nasal concha mucosa, watery secretion volume, and description of rhinorrhea. The symptoms were assessed using a scale of 0=None, 1=Mild, 2=Moderate, 3=Severe. Mean change from baseline to the end of study in nasal finding score by rhinoscopy was calculated as the nasal finding score by rhinoscopy at Visit 4/Early Withdrawal minus the nasal final finding score by rhinoscopy at Visit 2.</description>

    <description>The severity of overall interference in activities of daily living at baseline and the end of study was assessed by the investigator on the scale of 0=None, 1=Mild, 2=Moderate, 3=Severe. The mean change from baseline to the end of study in severity of overall interference in activities of daily living was calculated as the severity of overall interference in activities of daily living at Visit 4/Early Withdrawal minus severity of overall interference in activities of daily living at Visit 2.</description>

        <title>Mean Change From Baseline Over the Entire Treatment Period in the Daily Reflective Total Nasal Symptom Score (rTNSS)</title>
        <description>The Total Nasal Symptom Score (TNSS; possible score of 0-12) is the sum of 4 individual participant-assessed symptom scores for rhinorrhea, nasal congestion, nasal itching, and sneezing, each evaluated using a scale of 0=None, 1=Mild, 2=Moderate, or 3=Severe. The rTNSS was performed in the morning (AM rTNSS) and evening (PM rTNSS) and assessed the participant's symptoms over the preceding 12 hours. The daily rTNSS is the average of the AM rTNSS and PM rTNSS assessments. Mean changes from baseline over the entire treatment period were calculated as treatment period rTNSS minus baseline rTNSS.</description>
