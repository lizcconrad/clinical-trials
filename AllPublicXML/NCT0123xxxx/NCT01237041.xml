  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:

      - Overweight and obese children and adults often have lower levels of growth hormone in the
      blood. Regulation of growth hormone may be tied to weight and free fatty acids in the blood.
      Current tests of growth hormone (such as those used when evaluating the heights of children
      who are markedly shorter than other children of comparable age) may be affected by other
      factors, including obesity. Researchers are interested in evaluating the levels of growth
      hormone and free fatty acids in the blood of children between 7 and 14 years of age who weigh
      more than children of a comparable age, or who are shorter than other children of a
      comparable age and have been recommended for growth hormone testing as part of an evaluation
      for their height.

      Objectives:

      - To determine the effect of changes in free fatty acids in the blood on changes in growth
      hormone secretion in overweight or shorter children and young adolescents.

      Eligibility:

      - Children and adolescents between 7 and 14 years of age who weigh more than or are shorter
      than other children of a comparable age and do not have any medical illnesses.

      Design:

        -  Participants will have two study visits, one of which will be a half day screening visit
           in the outpatient clinic and one of which will require 2 nights as an inpatient at the
           National Institutes of Health Clinical Center.

        -  Participants should not eat or drink anything except water after 10 PM the night before
           or on the morning of the screening visit.

        -  At the screening visit, participants will have a physical examination and medical
           history, provide blood and urine samples, have an oral glucose tolerance test (to check
           blood sugar levels), and have an x-ray of the left hand to check bone age.

        -  The inpatient study visit will involve a physical examination and medical history, a
           full x-ray scan to study body fat and muscle, frequent blood tests throughout the visit,
           and various medications to stimulate growth hormone production and lower levels of free
           fatty acids in the blood.

    <textblock>
      Obese children and adults display lower spontaneous and stimulated growth hormone (GH)
      secretion. It is presumed that dysregulation of some of the factors normally involved in
      controlling GH secretion underlies the hyposomatotropinemia of obesity, given that GH
      production usually normalizes after weight loss. Free fatty acids (FFA) are one factor
      thought to be involved in regulation of GH secretion. Niacin is a nicotinic acid derivative
      that inhibits lipolysis and lowers circulating FFA concentrations. Nicotinic acid derivatives
      have been used in several adult studies examining GH secretion. Specifically in obese adults,
      inhibition of lipolysis has been found to increase spontaneous and stimulated GH production,
      presumably due to direct effects of FFA on hypothalamic GH-regulating neurons. Thus far no
      pediatric studies have examined the effects of niacin on GH secretion, and there is only one
      small pediatric study of normal weight prepubertal children growing at the 5th-10th
      percentile in height has tested the effects of lipolytic inhibition by acipimox (a related
      medication also derived from nicotinic acid) on GH secretion. There are no data in obese
      children demonstrating the effects of inhibition of lipolysis on GH secretion.

      We propose to investigate one of the mechanisms through which high adiposity alters GH
      secretion in children by testing the effects of inhibiting lipolysis. First we will conduct
      dose establishing studies to determine the appropriate dose of niacin needed to suppress FFA
      concentrations in children. We will then conduct the main study, designed as a pilot
      randomized, double-blind placebo controlled trial of niacin administration, to assess its
      effects on stimulated GH secretion. We hypothesize that in overweight children niacin will
      lead to a fall in free fatty acid concentrations and consequently a rise in stimulated GH
      secretion. We further hypothesize that the overweight subjects will demonstrate stimulated GH
      secretion profiles with niacin similar to those of control subjects who receive placebo. We
      expect this pilot study may help improve how diagnostic testing is carried out for growth
      hormone deficiency in children.
