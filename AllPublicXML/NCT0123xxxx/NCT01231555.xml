    <textblock>
      This 96 week, Phase 2b study in 150 HIV-1 infected antiretroviral (ART) naive adult subjects
      consists of a dose-ranging evaluation of GSK2248761 at blinded doses of 100 mg and 200 mg
      once daily with a control arm of open-label efavirenz (EFV) 600 mg once daily. The background
      ART for all 3 arms will be chosen by the Investigators and will be either abacavir/lamivudine
      [ABC/3TC] or tenofovir/emtricitabine [TDF/FTC] fixed dose combination (FDC) tablets.
      Antiviral activity, safety, PK, and development of viral resistance will be evaluated.

      Study SGN113404 is a phase 2b randomized, partially blinded, multicenter, parallel group,
      dose-ranging study. The study will be conducted in approximately 150 HIV-1 infected ART naïve
      subjects. The background NRTIs to be co-administered with GSK2248761 or EFV will be selected
      by Investigators prior to randomization and will be either abacavir/lamivudine (ABC/3TC) or
      tenofovir/emtricitabine (TDF/FTC) fixed dose combination (FDC) tablets.

      Subjects will participate in a Screening period (Day -28 to Day -1). Subjects may be
      re-screened once. Subjects will be randomized 1:1:1 to receive 100 mg of GSK2248761 once
      daily (50 subjects), 200 mg of GSK2248761 once daily (50 subjects) or 600 mg of EFV once
      daily (50 subjects). All three arms will be combined with either 300 mg/200 mg TDF/FTC or 600
      mg/300 mg ABC/3TC, as chosen by the Investigator. The Investigators and subjects will be
      blinded to the dose of GSK2248761 being administered but will know whether they receive EFV
      or GSK2248761. The randomization will be stratified by HIV-1 viral load (VL) at screening, &lt;
      100,000 copies/mL or &gt;/ 100,000 copies/mL as well as the choice of backbone NRTI, TDF/FTC or
      ABC/3TC.

      This study will be enrolled in two stages. The first stage of the study will enroll
      approximately 30 subjects, at which time enrollment will be paused. An analysis of safety and
      tolerability will be reviewed by a safety review committee (SRC) once all subjects enrolled
      in Stage 1 reach Week 4. The SRC review will determine if the safety and tolerability profile
      of GSK2248761 supports the continuation of the trial and enrollment of an additional 120
      subjects. All subjects will continue on study medications during this Week 4 analysis.

      Additional analyses will be conducted once all subjects complete Week 4, Week 16, Week 24 and
      Week 48. A second review of the safety and tolerability of GSK2248761 will be performed by
      the SRC once all subjects reach Week 4. There will not be a pause in the study during the
      Week 4 analysis of all subjects.

      The Week 16 and Week 24 analyses will be used respectively to select and confirm the optimal
      dose of GSK2248761 for continuation. This dose will be selected based on a statistical
      analysis of antiviral activity, safety and tolerability criteria. If, after confirmation of
      the optimal dose of GSK2248761 by the Week 24 analysis, both doses are considered acceptable
      based on efficacy, safety and PK data, then both arms will be continued through Week 48.

      Beyond Week 48, those subjects who were randomized to the non-selected dose of GSK2248761 and
      have not met any criteria for discontinuation will be given the option to switch to the
      selected dose of GSK2248761 or to discontinue permanently from the study. Once they have
      switched to the selected dose they will be in the Open-Label phase of the study through Week
      96. After Week 96, subjects receiving GSK2248761 will be given the option to continue to
      receive GSK2248761 until it is locally approved and commercially available, as long as they
      continue to derive clinical benefit without a protocol-defined reason for discontinuation.

      Subjects randomized to EFV will have the option to continue to receive EFV through Week 96
      unless they meet a protocol-defined reason for discontinuation. All subjects will have the
      option to continue TDF/FTC or ABC/3TC through Week 96. After Week 96, subjects will be
      expected to obtain local access to all commercially available ART.

      Randomization will be stratified by:

        -  HIV-1 RNA &lt; or &gt;/ 100,000 copies/mL at screening

        -  Use of ABC/3TC or TDF/FTC FDC tablets as initial background ART

      Switch of a background NRTI for toxicity management to an alternative marketed NRTI is
      allowed once. Switches of a background NRTI for any other reason are not permitted in the
      study. A switch of GSK2248761 or EFV is not allowed.

      Study Endpoints /Assessments: Subjects will have assessments performed which will include
      baseline demographics, disease characteristics, and safety (laboratory and clinical
      evaluations). On study safety, efficacy, virologic, immunologic, and PK evaluations will be
      conducted.

      Primary Endpoint: The proportion of subjects with HIV-1 RNA &lt;50copies/mL at Week 16. Dose
      selection will be based primarily on antiviral activity and tolerability in conjunction with
      immunologic, safety, virologic resistance and PK measures. Data from the Week 24 analysis
      will be used to confirm dose selection.

    <measure>Number of Participants With Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) and Adverse Events (AEs)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 20 Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Adverse event (AE) is an unfavorable change in the health of a participant, including abnormal laboratory findings, that happens during a clinical study or within a certain time period after the study has ended. This change may or may not be caused by the intervention being studied. Serious adverse event (SAE) is an adverse event that results in death, is life-threatening, requires inpatient hospitalization or extends a current hospital stay, results in an ongoing or significant incapacity or interferes substantially with normal life functions, or causes a congenital anomaly or birth defect. Medical events that do not result in death, are not life-threatening, or do not require hospitalization may be considered serious adverse events if they put the participant in danger or require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the results listed above.</description>

        <description>This analysis was based on the Missing, Switch or Discontinuation equals Failure (MSDF) algorithm (as codified by the FDA’s “snapshot” algorithm) and was adjusted for stratification factors and stage of recruitment. Dose selection was based primarily on antiviral activity and tolerability in conjunction with immunologic, safety, virologic resistance and pharmacokinetic (PK) measures. The efficacy decision criteria was based on an observed difference of &gt;=8% between the two GSK2248761 dosage arms.</description>
        <time_frame>Up to Week 16</time_frame>
        <population>Intent to treat exposed (ITT-E) population included all randomized participants who received at least one dose of study drug. Data points with null value for participants analyzed indicate data not collected for respective category and treatment arm due to early termination. Only those participants available at indicated timepoints were analyzed.</population>

          <description>This analysis was based on the Missing, Switch or Discontinuation equals Failure (MSDF) algorithm (as codified by the FDA’s “snapshot” algorithm) and was adjusted for stratification factors and stage of recruitment. Dose selection was based primarily on antiviral activity and tolerability in conjunction with immunologic, safety, virologic resistance and pharmacokinetic (PK) measures. The efficacy decision criteria was based on an observed difference of &gt;=8% between the two GSK2248761 dosage arms.</description>
          <population>Intent to treat exposed (ITT-E) population included all randomized participants who received at least one dose of study drug. Data points with null value for participants analyzed indicate data not collected for respective category and treatment arm due to early termination.

        <title>Number of Participants With Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) and Adverse Events (AEs)</title>
        <description>Adverse event (AE) is an unfavorable change in the health of a participant, including abnormal laboratory findings, that happens during a clinical study or within a certain time period after the study has ended. This change may or may not be caused by the intervention being studied. Serious adverse event (SAE) is an adverse event that results in death, is life-threatening, requires inpatient hospitalization or extends a current hospital stay, results in an ongoing or significant incapacity or interferes substantially with normal life functions, or causes a congenital anomaly or birth defect. Medical events that do not result in death, are not life-threatening, or do not require hospitalization may be considered serious adverse events if they put the participant in danger or require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the results listed above.</description>

          <description>Maximum observed plasma concentration and minimum observed plasma concentration of GSK2248761 was recorded on Week 2. The PK parameters were calculated by standard non-compartmental analysis according to current working practices and using WinNonlin Pro 4.1 or higher. Log transformed values have been presented.
All calculations of non-compartmental parameters were based on actual sampling times.</description>
          <population>The PK Concentration Population included all participants who received GSK2248761, underwent intensive and/or limited PK sampling during the study, and provided evaluable GSK2248761 plasma concentration data. Only the participants available at the time of assessment were analyzed.</population>
