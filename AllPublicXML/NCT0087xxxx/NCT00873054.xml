  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators main hypothesis is that the stone free rate will be much higher (95%) in
      patients treated with PCNL than patients treated with ESWL where stone free rate is (60%) to
      determine which treatment is safe and prevent less stone recurrence.

    <textblock>
      Extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy is preferred for small stones less than 10 mm in size.
      Percutaneous nephrolithotomy is the standard therapy used for large kidney stones greater
      than 20 millimeters or stones in the lower kidney. For moderate sized kidney stone (10-20
      mm),currently the options for treatment include both methods. However, no studies have proven
      that one procedure is better than the other. So, we will compare both the procedures for
      breaking the kidney stone. Our main outcome measures will be the stone-free status after the
      procedure. Other outcome measures are assessment of morbidity associated with use of the
      procedures i.e. any minor or major complications within 3 months of initial treatment.
      Patient will be assessed for infection at post-operative office visits to include a basic
      urinalysis only if they have systemic indicators of infection (fever, dysuria, frequency,
      etc.). Pain will be monitored with the scale of 0-10 points. Also we will review of stone
      density on Computerized Tomography (CT) scans and the effect this has on success of both
      procedures. We hope with PCNL stone-free rates will be minimum with minimal morbidity and
      ultimately improve patient care.

    <description>In this procedure,scope will be placed inside bladder and a plastic tube (stent) will be left to drain the kidney on the affected side in a routine manner. Next the patient will be transferred to a separate room and sound waves will be aimed at the center of the stone until the stone is broken into pieces.</description>

    <description>In this procedure,scope will be placed inside bladder and a plastic tube (stent) will be left to drain the kidney on the affected side in a routine manner. Next, a small (1cm) cut will be made in the back and a tube will be placed into the kidney. Through this tube a small camera will be placed inside the kidney and break the stone into many pieces and remove them through the same tube. All fragments that can be seen will be removed. A different plastic tube (drain) will be placed through the cut and into the kidney and left in place for 5-7 days.</description>
