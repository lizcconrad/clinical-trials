  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether supplementation with folinic acid, a B
      vitamin, lowers the concentrations of total homocysteine in newborns. Increased homocysteine
      concentrations are associated with an increased risk of cerebrovascular accidents in adult,
      children and newborns. These increased concentrations can easily and safely be lowered by
      folic acid in adults.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The incidence of cerebrovascular accidents (CVA) occurring perinatally is relatively high and
      aspects of the multifactorial pathophysiology remain unclear. Elevated homocysteine
      concentrations are shown to be associated with an increased risk for CVA in newborns. We want
      to study the possible homocysteine lowering effect of folinic acid in newborns.

      We will include newborns in our prospective randomized folinic acid intervention study from
      patients admitted to our Neonatal Intensive Care Unit. We will measure total homocysteine
      (tHcy) and folate concentrations at three time points. The intervention group will be treated
      with folinic acid (70 Âµg/kg/day) for two weeks.

    <description>Folinic acid was given for two weeks as 5-formyltetrahydrofolate (10 mg/ml) (Pharmachemie bv). This solution was administered either intravenously (first week) or orally. To lower homocysteine in adults 5 mg/day folic acid is frequently used. Using an average bodyweight of 70 kg for adults we calculated a daily dose of 70 microgram/kg/day for our newborns</description>
