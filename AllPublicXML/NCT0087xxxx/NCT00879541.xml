    <textblock>
      The aim of this study are to

        -  assess the efficacy of Biostate® [Study Product (SP)] in subjects with Haemophilia A

        -  compare the pharmacokinetics of Biostate® [SP] with the previously marketed product
           Biostate® (here referred to as Biostate® [Reference Product (RP)]).

      This study is divided into 3 parts:

      Part 1: Cross-over pharmacokinetic (PK) component. PK subjects will be randomised to
      determine the order in which they receive the two study products. This part of the study is
      double-blinded.

      Part 2: Efficacy component. All subjects will receive Biostate® [SP] as required to manage
      their haemophilia condition for an estimated period of 6 months (or minimum of 50 exposure
      days) to assess efficacy and safety of the product. This part of the study is open-label.

      Part 3: Repeat pharmacokinetic assessment. Subjects who participated in Part 1 (PK component)
      will undergo a repeat PK assessment on Day 180 following administration of Biostate® [SP].
