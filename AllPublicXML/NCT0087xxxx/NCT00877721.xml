      Experimental design overview:

      The proposed project is a prospective experimental study design. Independent old adults (age
      65 years old and older) who suffer from minor balance problems willing to participate in the
      study will be tested with well-established measuring techniques of balance and gait before
      and 4 weeks after balance training program using the &quot;Self Mobility Improvement in the
      Elderly by Counteracting Falls&quot; system (SMILING system). The study design is randomized
      clinical trial (RCT), cross over, single blinded study design where 30 subjects will randomly
      be allocated into experimental or control groups that will switch groups after 4 weeks of
      intervention.

      Random sequence generation will be performed by a staff member who will not interact with
      subjects during the balance-testing sessions. Subjects will be informed that they are to be
      randomly assigned to one of the two groups, both receiving gait training program.

      The staff member who administers the training programs will be the only member of the
      research team aware of the subjects' group allocations.

      A 'blinded' research assistant will administer the balance tests and will perform any data
      processing that involves subjective judgments.

      Scripts will be used during testing to ensure that all subjects receive the same
      instructions.

      Testing session between two training periods (T1) will take one week.

          1. age ≥ 65 years,

          2. able to walk at least 20 meters independently, i.e., without personal assistance and
             without an assistive device, except for a single point cane

          3. one or more falls in the previous year (falls during sport activities excluded).

        Standardized physical and cognitive functional tests

          1. Tinetti's POMA score below 26 (strictly)

          2. MMSE test with score ≥ 24

          3. GDS test with score &lt;10

        The exclusion criteria are:

          2. age &lt; 65 years

          3. inability to walk 20 meters safely (self-report) or walk with personal assistance or
             with an assistive device (except single point cane for fallers)

          4. inability to recall fall status in the previous year

          5. severe visual impairment (e.g., impaired ability to read, watch TV, or drive a car)
