  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To evaluate the safety and performance of the BALANCE System in treating patients who have
      type 2 diabetes and are overweight. Impact on blood glucose levels, weight loss, blood
      pressure and other clinical and metabolic parameters will be studied.

      The BALANCE System stimulates the duodenum in a specialized way to strengthen the natural
      contractions and mimic the sensation of fullness (satiety). The patient is expected to feel
      full after eating smaller amounts of food than normal. In addition, duodenal stimulation has
      been shown to induce favorable changes in postprandial glucose levels, glucose tolerance
      testing and insulin levels.

      The target population type II diabetic patients uncontrolled with oral medications, and with
      overweight (BMI &gt;30). The Balance System may overcome the known disadvantages of insulin
      therapy and allow early treatment of these patients, potentially preventing the progression
      of obesity and diabetes.
