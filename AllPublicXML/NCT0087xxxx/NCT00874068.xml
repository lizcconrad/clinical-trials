      formula on bone strength parameters.

      InFatTM is an advanced basic-fat ingredient, which mimics the fat composition and properties
      of human milk fat and enabling optimal intake of the essential calcium and energy (in the
      form of fatty acids) and easy digestion. These benefits are the results of a unique fatty
      acid composition on the glycerol backbone, which ensure high level of palmitic acid at the
      middle (sn-2) position.

      The purpose of this study is to determine the effect of high sn-2 palmitic acid based infant
      formula on bone strength parameters, anthropometric parameters, wellbeing and stool
      characteristics in term and preterm infants.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Gestational age above 32 weeks as determined by menstrual history and corroborated by
             prenatal US and/or physical examination.

          2. Birth weight appropriate for gestational age (AGA) using current CDC growth charts,
             and above 1750gr.

          3. The mother had unequivocally decided not to breast-feed (in formula groups) or the
             mother had decided to breast feed (in human breast milk group).

          4. The infant is apparently healthy.

          5. Parental/ legal guardian written inform consent

          6. Apgar after 5 minutes &gt;7

          7. Enrolled within their first 14 days of life for term infants and first month of life
             for preterm infants

          8. At enrollment: clinical stability and acceptable weight gain

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. The infant suffer from a congenital or chromosomal disorder (Cystic fibrosis,
             Tracheomalacia, Tracheoesophageal fistula, major congenital heart disease,
             down-syndrome)

          2. The infant suffer from neonatal morbidities:

               -  Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD)

               -  Intraventricular Hemorrhage3-4 (IVH)

               -  Necrotizing Enterocolitis (NEC)

          3. Laboratory or clinical sings of Osteopenia

          4. The infant suffers from any suspected or known metabolic or physical limitations
             interfering with feeding or normal metabolism (require a special formula)

          5. The mother suffers from any disease or disability that may interfere with her ability
             to take care of her infant

          6. Any other reason that, in the opinion of the investigator, prevents the subject from
             participating in the study
