  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess if the presence of BAK in a fluoroquinolone in the
      study eye affects the development of resistant bacteria on the conjunctiva based upon changes
      in the surface flora over the course of 2 weeks of topical treatment in healthy adult
      subjects.

    <time_frame>Day 14</time_frame>
    <description>Percentage of subjects with strain resistance as determined by Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) of the conjunctiva (clear membrane covering the white surface of the eye) at day 14. MIC is the lowest concentration of an antimicrobial that inhibits the visible growth of a microorganism after incubation. The MIC cut-off values include: Intermediate is 1 to less than 2; Resistant is greater than or equal to 2.</description>
