      This study will expand the Department of Defense (DoD) one time, face-to-face post deployment
      BATTLEMIND training for spouses of Operation Enduring Freedom/Operation Iraqi Freedom
      (OEF/OIF) Guard/Reserve service members into year-long, telephone groups focusing on
      education, skills building and support. The goal is to build spouses' resilience to cope with
      reintegration, help them serve as a support system for returning service members, and ease
      the transition for families post-deployment.
