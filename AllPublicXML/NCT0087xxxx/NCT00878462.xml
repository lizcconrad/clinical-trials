  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This trial was a randomized trial to determine a patient's acceptability of unflavored
      antipsychotic medication compared to raspberry flavored antipsychotic medication. Patients
      received 6 total doses of study drug (2 doses of each asenapine formulation) over 3
      consecutive days: 2 different formulations each day, 1 in the morning and 1 in the evening.
      The formulations were: white unflavored, white raspberry flavored, and red raspberry
      flavored. Patients were given a questionnaire following each dose of study medication (one
      questionnaire twice per day for 3 days) to measure how acceptable each formulation was.

      Study drug was administered according to a random selected sequence schedule with 2
      constraints: Subjects did not receive consecutive doses of the same formulation, and each
      formulation was given once in the morning and once in the evening over the course of the
      3-day treatment period.
