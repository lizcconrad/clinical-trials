  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The EVE-PMS technology is intended for determination of intolerance or sensitivity to sex
      hormones, among women suffering from severe PreMenstrual Syndrome (PMS) and desensitizes them
      with the relevant sex hormones in order to reduce PMS symptoms.

      The system includes skin testing panel for identification of hormones to which the patients
      might be sensitive. Tests are applied close to the ovulation period and the skin reaction is
      examined in 20 minutes, 48 hours and daily during the following month. Results of skin tests
      and patient's history will determine the eligibility of the patients to enter a
      desensitization protocol.

      During the desensitization period hormones to which the patient were found sensitive to, are
      injected intradermally three times (once a month) within the luteal phase in increasing
      doses. The end-point of the study is a statistically significant decrease, or elimination of
      PMS symptoms, compared to a solvent group.

    <description>Skin testing 4 sex hormones will be performed during the luteal phase of the subject's menstrual cycle by study investigators.
Hormones:
Progesterone 1mmol/L; Estradiol 1mmol/L; Estrone 3mmol/L; Estriol 3mmol/L
Controls:
Saline (NaCl) 0.9%; Ethyl Oleate with 10% Benzyl Alcohol; Histamine phosphate 1mg/ml (epicutaneous- prick test)
Patients with positive skin test to at least one sex hormone will be injected with an increasing volume of the appropriate hormone at the same concentration as it was used in the skin test as follows:
Week 4th of the study (luteal phase of 2nd menstrual cycle) - 0.04 ml
Week 8th of the study (luteal phase of 3rd menstrual cycle) - 0.08 ml
Week 12th of the study (luteal phase of 4th menstrual cycle) - 0.16 ml</description>
