  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cigarette smoking increases CVD risk and worsens insulin resistance, but also contributes to
      weight loss; smoking cessation reduces CVD risk and improves insulin sensitivity, but also
      contributes to weight gain. The mechanisms that underlie these metabolic changes of cigarette
      smoking and smoking cessation on insulin resistance, body composition, and fat distribution
      are poorly understood.

      This study is a prospective, open cohort study of smokers who undergo a smoking cessation
      program, and who subsequently may or may not resume smoking spontaneously. Eligible subjects
      will be characterized at baseline with respect to their metabolic and CVD risk profiles, body
      fat composition and distribution. Subjects will then undergo an intensive 8-week smoking
      cessation program using bupropion plus cognitive behavioral counseling. Those who
      successfully abstain will be reassessed. Since most individuals who quit smoking will
      naturally resume smoking again over time, subjects will be assessed again after an additional
      4 months of follow-up when a subset of subjects will be expected to have naturally resumed
      smoking.
