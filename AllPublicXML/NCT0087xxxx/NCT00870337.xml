      RATIONALE: Everolimus may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes
      needed for cell growth and by blocking blood flow to the tumor.

      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well everolimus works in treating patients with
      relapsed or metastatic endometrial cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Estimate the rate of non-progression after 3 months of treatment with everolimus in
           patients with relapsed or metastatic endometrial cancer.

      Secondary

        -  Evaluate the partial and complete response rate after 3 months of treatment with
           everolimus in these patients.

        -  Evaluate the duration of response in these patients.

        -  Evaluate the clinical benefit after 6 months of treatment with everolimus in these
           patients.

        -  Evaluate the time to progression in these patients.

        -  Evaluate the progression-free and overall survival of these patients.

        -  Evaluate the nature, frequency, and severity of side effects of everolimus in these
           patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive oral everolimus daily in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed monthly for 3 months and then
      every 3 months thereafter.
