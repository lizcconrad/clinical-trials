          -  Require chemotherapy and have fully recovered from previous administered chemotherapy

          -  Subjects must have progressed, failed to achieve a meaningful response, or
             relapsed/intolerant to prior therapy. Failing at least one purine analogue regimen

          -  Subjects have received three or fewer prior treatment regimens

          -  ECOG status of 0 - 2

        Inclusion Criteria (Cohort #2):

          -  If dose level + 3 is reached, the criteria is the same as outlined for Cohort #1,
             however the subjects should not have a history of prior chemotherapy (treatment naive)

          -  Unwilling or unable to use an acceptable method to avoid pregnancy

          -  Uncontrolled or significant cardiovascular disease, including prolonged QTc interval

          -  History of significant bleeding disorder, unrelated to CLL

          -  Prior concurrent malignancy

          -  Drugs that generally accepted to have the risk of causing Torsades de Pointes

          -  Autoimmune hemolytic anemia requiring therapy or transfusion support
