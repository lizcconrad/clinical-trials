      1. BACKGROUND

           Pneumonia occurring outside of the hospital setting is regarded as community acquired
           pneumonia. However, pneumonia occurring in non-hospital long-term care facilities
           constituted a distinct type of pneumonia from CAP. Kollef et al has justified health
           care associated pneumonia (HCAP) as a new category of pneumonia [1]. The HCAP patients
           are associated with severe disease, higher mortality rate, and greater length of stay
           and increased cost [1]. HCAP are often at risk for multi-drug resistant bacterial
           pathogens such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa, extended-spectrum beta-lactamase Klebsiella
           pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumannii, and methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) [2].

           Health care facilities have not been defined in Taiwan. Respiratory care ward (RCW) is a
           special unit to take care long-term ventilatory dependent patients in Taiwan. Some of
           the patients get pneumonia and are referred back to medical centers. Besides,
           community-acquired P. aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii or MRSA have been reported
           [3-8]. Therefore, the core-organisms of HCAP in Taiwan might be multi-drug resistant and
           the causes of inadequate initial antibiotics treatment. The common pathogens were also
           unknown.

           Till now, there are no data about the pathogens of HCAP in Taiwan. We define the
           health-care facilities and initiate a retrospective study to characterize the
           microbiology and clinical outcome of Community acquired pneumonia and
           Health-Care-Associated pneumonia in Taiwan. Further analysis will perform to confirm the
           differences between CAP an HCAP in Taiwan.

      baseline will be collected.

      Definition of appropriateness of Empirical therapy Empirical antibiotic therapy is defined as
      antibiotic given during the first 48 hours for pneumonia. The appropriateness of antibiotic
      therapy will be analyzed only for cases with causative organism (probably and definite
      organisms) identified. Inadequacy therapy is defined as administration of an antibiotic to
      which the isolated pathogen was resistant according to the subsequent antimicrobial
      susceptibility results or the absence of antimicrobial agents to cover the identified
      pathogen(s). In addition, patients with aspiration pneumonia (Aspiration pneumonia are
      defined as witnessed aspiration pneumonia and food or material noted in the upper or lower
      airways) who had not received agents with anti-anaerobic coverage will be considered
      inappropriate.

      Definition of Treatment outcomes

      In addition to collecting microbiological response, clinical response data will be used for
      all patients. Success/favorable clinical response will be defined as all or most of
      pretreatment signs and symptoms of the index infection have resolved or improved (e.g.: TPR
      shift toward normal) and no additional antibiotic therapy or switching of regimen was
      required. While failure will be defined as no apparent response to therapy; persistence or
      progression of most/all pre-therapy signs and symptoms and additional antibiotic therapy or
      switching of regimen was documented.

      Cases will be classified as &quot;Indeterminate&quot; when no sufficient data is available to permit
      evaluation of microbiological or clinical outcome or patient's underlying medical condition
      is too complicated to precluded classification as a success or failure.

      Data collection and analysis plan

      Data from all sites will be pooled and combined. Statistical analyses will be conducted with
      the use of SAS software, version 8.2 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA). Data will also be
      presented as mean +/-SD for continuous variables and proportions for categories variables.
      The patient demographics and baseline characteristics will be tabulated. The distribution of
      comorbidities, disease severity, causative organisms, clinical condition and outcomes will be
      summarized and analyzed. To detect the significant differences between groups, Chi-square
      tests or Fisher exact test for categorical variables, and the two-tailed t test or
      Mann-Whitney test for continuous variables will be employed, when appropriate. Statistical
      significance will be established at alpha =0.05. Reported P values will be two-sided.
