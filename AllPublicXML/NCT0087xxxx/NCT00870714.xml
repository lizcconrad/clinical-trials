    <textblock>
      Eligible patients with high-risk prostate cancer who are scheduled to undergo radical
      prostatectomy will receive four cycles of therapy with ketoconazole and docetaxel prior to
      surgery resection. A cycle of therapy is defined as 21 days (three weeks). Pharmacokinetic
      analysis will be performed with the first and second cycle of therapy. All patients will be
      evaluated for toxicity, tumor response, and recurrence.

    <criteria>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients must have histologically proven adenocarcinoma of the prostate.

          -  Patients must meet at least one of the following high risk criteria:

               -  PSA &gt; 20

               -  Gleason score 8 or greater

               -  Presence of pathological Gleason grade 4 or higher as the majority sum on biopsy
                  core

               -  Greater than 50% of cores at time of biopsy positive for cancer

               -  Clinical Stage T3 Disease

               -  Patients must have PS of 0-1(ECOG) and medically deemed a surgical candidate for
                  radical prostatectomy.

               -  Age &gt; or = to 18.

               -  Patients with a pre-existing peripheral neuropathy of equal to or greater than
                  grade two are ineligible.

               -  Serum Creatinine must be &lt; or equal to 2.0mg/dl.

               -  Patients must currently not receiving any drug which is metabolized by cytochrome
                  P450-3A4 including the statins, cyclosporin, terfenadine and erythromycin.

               -  Prior to receiving any dose of docetaxel, patients should have absolute
                  neutrophil counts &gt; 1,500, hemoglobin &gt; 8.0 g/dl and platelet counts &gt;
                  100,000/mm3.

               -  Patients with bilirubin elevated above institutional upper limit of normal
                  (ULN)must be excluded. Transaminases (SGOT and/or SGPT) may be up to 5.0 x
                  institutional upper limit of normal (ULN) if alkaline phosphatase is &lt; ULN, or
                  alkaline phosphatase may be up to 5 x ULN if transaminases are &lt; ULN. However,
                  patients who have both transaminase elevation &gt; 1.5 x ULN and alkaline
                  phosphatase &gt; 2.5 x ULN are not eligible for this study (due to decrease
                  clearance of docetaxel and increased risk of toxicity).

               -  Patients receiving concurrent warfarin are eligible but require monitoring of
                  protime on a weekly basis.

               -  Patients with clinical stage T4 disease are not eligible.

               -  Patients must not had have received prior treatment with surgery, radiation or
                  hormone deprivation.

               -  Patients with other primary malignancies previously treated with chemotherapeutic
                  agents are not eligible.

               -  Patients must not have had a history of peptic ulcer disease requiring treatment
                  with surgery or endoscleral.

               -  Patients requiring corticosteroids for other systemic diseases are not eligible.

               -  Patients with a history of severe hypersensitivity reaction to docetaxel or other
                  drugs formulated with polysorbate 80 are not eligible.

               -  All patients must sign informed consent.

               -  Men of childbearing potential must be willing to consent to using effective
                  contraception while on treatment and for at least 3 months thereafter.
