      RATIONALE: Specialized radiation therapy that delivers a high dose of radiation directly to
      the tumor may kill more tumor cells and cause less damage to normal tissue. Drugs used in
      chemotherapy, such as gemcitabine, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells,
      either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Giving intensity-modulated
      radiation therapy together with gemcitabine may kill more tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: This phase I/II trial is studying the side effects and best dose of
      intensity-modulated radiation therapy and to see how well it works when given together with
      gemcitabine in treating patients with locally advanced pancreatic cancer.

      The study was terminated early due to slow accrual and only the phase I portion of hte study
      was opened. The phase of the study has been revised to only a phase I study.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of intensity-modulated radiotherapy
           delivered to the gross tumor volume when administered with gemcitabine hydrochloride in
           patients with locally advanced pancreatic carcinoma. (Phase I)

        -  To define the dose-limiting toxicities of this regimen in these patients. (Phase I)

        -  To determine the local control in patients treated at the MTD (determined in phase I).
           (Phase II)

        -  To compare the disease-free survival and time to progression in these patients with that
           of historical controls. (Phase II)

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter phase I, dose-escalation study of intensity-modulated
      radiotherapy, followed by a phase II study.

        -  Induction chemotherapy: Patients receive gemcitabine hydrochloride IV on days 1, 8, and
           15. Treatment repeats every 28 days for 2 courses in the absence of disease progression
           or unacceptable toxicity. Patients then undergo CT scan. Patients with no evidence of
           metastatic disease proceed to chemoradiotherapy.

        -  Chemoradiotherapy: Beginning 1-2 weeks after completion of induction chemotherapy,
           patients undergo intensity-modulated radiotherapy once daily 5 days a week and
           gemcitabine hydrochloride IV over 30 minutes once weekly for 5 weeks in the absence of
           disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients whose disease remains
           unresectable proceed to adjuvant chemotherapy.

        -  Adjuvant chemotherapy: Beginning 4-6 weeks after completion of chemoradiotherapy,
           patients receive gemcitabine hydrochloride as in induction chemotherapy.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 3 months for 1 year, every 6
      months for 2 years, and then annually thereafter.

    <description>Pre-Chemoradiation (Induction) Chemotherapy Gemcitabine will be given weekly for seven doses at a dose of 1000 mg/m2/wk (Days 1, 8, 15, 22, 29, 36, 43) unless toxicity develops. Chemoradiation gemcitabine will be given 400 mg/m2, infused over 30 minutes, within 120 minutes before radiotherapy. Post-chemoradiation chemotherapy, patients will receive two cycles of gemcitabine. A cycle will be defined as three weeks of gemcitabine at 1000 mg/m2/d, once weekly, followed by a one-week rest.</description>
