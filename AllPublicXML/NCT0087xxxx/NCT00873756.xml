        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Histologically confirmed CRC with evidence of locally advanced recurrent or metastatic
             disease (i.e., by radiographic imaging or biopsy) and measurable tumor lesions

          -  Life expectancy &gt; 3 months

          -  For patients of reproductive potential (males and females), use of reliable means for
             contraception throughout the trial

          -  Willingness and capability to be accessible for study follow-up

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Prior 5-FU, capecitabine, and/or oxaliplatin treatment with the exception of: prior
             oxaliplatin treatment =&lt; 6 weeks in the advanced or metastatic setting; prior
             treatment with 5-FU, capecitabine, and/or oxaliplatin in the adjuvant setting if
             relapse occurred &gt; 6 months from concluding adjuvant therapy

          -  Peripheral neuropathy Grade &gt;= 2

          -  Prior radiotherapy to a measurable metastatic lesion(s) to be used for response
             assessment, unless the lesion has progressed subsequent to the radiotherapy

          -  Radiotherapy to a peripheral lesion within 14 days prior to Cycle 1, Day 1, or
             radiotherapy to a thoracic, abdominal, or pelvic field within 28 days prior to Cycle
             1, Day 1

          -  Chemotherapy, hormonal therapy, or immunotherapy within 4 weeks prior to Cycle 1, Day
             1

          -  Evidence of clinically detectable ascites

          -  Other invasive malignancies within 5 years prior to Cycle 1, Day 1

          -  Current or recent participation in another experimental drug study

          -  Clinically significant cardiovascular disease, New York Heart Association (NYHA) Grade
             II or greater congestive heart failure, serious cardiac arrhythmia within 1 year prior
             to Cycle 1, Day 1, or Grade II or greater peripheral vascular disease on Cycle 1, Day
             1

          -  Active infection requiring parenteral antibiotics

          -  Major surgical procedure, open biopsy, or significant traumatic injury within 28 days
             prior to Cycle 1, Day 1, fine needle aspirations or minor surgery (such as port
             placement) within 7 days prior to Cycle 1, Day 1, or anticipation of need for major
             surgical procedure during the course of the study

          -  Known or suspected to be positive for the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)

          -  Known to be positive for hepatitis C or hepatitis B surface antigen

          -  History of other disease, metabolic dysfunction, physical examination finding, or
             clinical laboratory finding giving reasonable suspicion of a disease or condition that
             contraindicates use of an investigational drug or specified study treatment, or that
             might affect interpretation of the results of the study or render the patient at high
             risk from treatment complications

          -  Inadequately controlled hypertension

          -  Prior history of hypertensive crisis or hypertensive encephalopathy

             Cycle 1, Day 1

          -  Bleeding diathesis or coagulopathy

          -  Pregnancy (positive pregnancy test) or breast feeding
