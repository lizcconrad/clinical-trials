  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the evolution of walking capacity as
      measured by the timed 100-meter walk test (T100T), timed 25-foot walk test (T25FW), maximum
      walking distance (MWD), and Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) during the first year of
      therapy with natalizumab. The secondary objectives of this study are as follows:

        -  To evaluate the correlation between the MWD and EDSS and both walking tests, the T100T
           and the T25FW at Baseline, at Week 24 and at Week 48 of therapy.

        -  To determine how well each of the walking tests, T100T or T25FW, predicts walking
           limitations in all participants and in the subgroups of participants stratified by
           baseline EDSS.

    <description>To determine how well each of the walking tests, T100T or T25FW, predicts walking limitations, participants were stratified by baseline EDSS scores, and walking tests at Weeks 24 and 48 were analyzed. A 15% or 20% improvement indicates that, when compared with baseline walking speed (meters per second), there is at least 15% or 20% improvement at the corresponding timepoint, e.g. (speed at Week 24 - speed at baseline)/speed at baseline*100% ≥ 15% or 20%. Confirmed (conf) improvement at Week 48 indicates that the participant has at least 15% (or 20%) improvement in walking speed at both Week 24 and Week 48.</description>

        <title>Improvement in Timed 25FT Walk Speed and T100T Speed at Week 24 and 48</title>
        <description>To determine how well each of the walking tests, T100T or T25FW, predicts walking limitations, participants were stratified by baseline EDSS scores, and walking tests at Weeks 24 and 48 were analyzed. A 15% or 20% improvement indicates that, when compared with baseline walking speed (meters per second), there is at least 15% or 20% improvement at the corresponding timepoint, e.g. (speed at Week 24 – speed at baseline)/speed at baseline*100% ≥ 15% or 20%. Confirmed (conf) improvement at Week 48 indicates that the participant has at least 15% (or 20%) improvement in walking speed at both Week 24 and Week 48.</description>
