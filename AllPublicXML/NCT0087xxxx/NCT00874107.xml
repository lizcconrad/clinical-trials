  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Phase 2 study described in this protocol will serve to evaluate the antitumor activity,
      safety and pharmacokinetic profile of Imprime PGG when combined with bevacizumab and
      concomitant paclitaxel and carboplatin therapy in patients with previously untreated advanced
      NSCLC. Additionally, this study will provide guidance for the design of more definitive
      efficacy studies of Imprime PGG in NSCLC patients.
