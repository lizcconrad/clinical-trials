  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This prospective annual release study was designed to assess the safety of a monovalent
      influenza virus vaccine using a new strain recommended for the 2009-2010 influenza season not
      previously contained in the trivalent intranasal FluMist vaccine. Three hundred healthy
      adults received a single dose of vaccine or placebo and were followed for 180 days.

      This prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled release study enrolled 300
      healthy adults 18 to 49 years of age. Eligible participants were randomly assigned in a 4:1
      fashion to receive a single dose of monovalent vaccine or placebo by intranasal spray. This
      study was conducted at multiple sites in the United States. Randomization was stratified by
      site.

      Each participant received one dose of investigational product on Day 1. The duration of study
      participation for each participant was the time from receipt of investigational product
      through 180 days after receipt of investigational product.

    <measure>Number of Participants Reporting Fever, Defined as Oral Temperature ≥ 101°F</measure>
    <time_frame>Days 1-8 after vaccination</time_frame>
    <description>The percentage of subjects with fever was compared between the two treatment groups based on the upper limit of the two-sided 95% exact confidence interval (CI) for the rate difference (monovalent vaccine minus placebo). The upper limit of the two-sided 95% CI was evaluated against the pre-specified equivalence criterion of 5 percentage points which corresponded to the following hypotheses: - H0 (null): rate difference ≥ 5 percentage points, - HA (alternative): rate difference &lt; 5 percentage points.</description>

    <measure>Number of Participants Reporting Any Solicited Symptom or at Least One Adverse Event (AE)</measure>
    <time_frame>Days 1-8 after vaccination</time_frame>
    <description>Solicited symptoms were collected from administration of investigational product through Study Day 15. For this study, solicited symptoms included: fever (&gt; 100°F oral), runny nose, sore throat, cough, vomiting, muscle aches, chills, decreased activity (tiredness), headache.</description>

    <description>SAEs were those that resulted in death; were life-threatening; resulted in inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization; resulted in persistent or significant disability or incapacity; were a congenital anomaly/birth defect in the offspring of a study participant; or were an important medical event that may have jeopardized the subject and may have required medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above. An NOCD was a newly diagnosed medical condition of a chronic, ongoing nature and assessed by the investigator as medically significant.</description>
