  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 2b, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, placebo-controlled, multicenter
      study investigating the safety, tolerability and efficacy of two oral doses of GS-9450 in
      adults with chronic Hepatitis C Virus (HCV). Approximately 240 subjects 18-65 years of age
      who meet study entry criteria will be randomized (in other words, selected at random, like
      flipping a coin) to one of three treatment groups (80 subjects per treatment group) as
      follows:GS-9450 10 mg once daily,GS-9450 40 mg once daily, or matching placebo once daily.

      Following randomization, subjects will return within seven business days for a Baseline (Day
      1) visit, at which time study medication will be dispensed and subjects will enter a 26 week
      treatment phase. During the treatment phase, subjects will receive study drug once daily for
      24 weeks and then taper off of study drug over the following 2 weeks by receiving study drug
      once every other day for one week and then every 3 days for one week. Following completion of
      the treatment phase, subjects will enter a 4-week off-treatment follow-up phase.
