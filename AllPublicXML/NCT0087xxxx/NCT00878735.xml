    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effects of a Zen meditation retreat (Sesshin) on
      psychophysiological parameters in healthy volunteers (regular meditators and non-meditators)
      and in cancer patients and to observe possible changes in the attentional circuitry (through
      functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging- fMRI) and in psychological tests (Beck Anxiety and
      Depression Inventories, Self-Compassion Scale, Mindfulness Attention Awareness Scale, Lipp
      Stress Scale for Adults).

    <textblock>
      Meditation results in changes in cognition, sensory perception, affect, hormones, and
      autonomic activity. Until today, there have been very few imaging studies of the neural
      correlates of meditation. Instead of evaluating the meditation practice itself, our approach
      is to evaluate the neural correlates of performance modulation on an attention paradigm (the
      Stroop word-color task; SWCT) and an emotional paradigm (the frustration paradigm) before and
      after a meditation retreat. The following categories of individuals will be invited to
      participate: healthy regular meditation practitioners (at least three years of practice,
      three times a week), individuals inexperienced in meditation, and patients with a cancer
      diagnosis. The total sample will comprise 96 individuals who will be allocated to groups of
      sesshin meditation, rest groups and groups that will keep their daily activities. If they
      wish to do so, those who participate in the two latter groups may also receive training on
      meditation. The subjects will be between 18 and 65 years old and have no contraindication to
      the fMRI exam. After signing an informed consent form, the subjects will answer anxiety,
      depression and stress inventories; scales that evaluate their feelings of self-compassion and
      mindfulness, as well as the Stroop Color Word task and an emotional paradigm of functional
      Magnetic Resonance Imaging.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Healthy volunteers:

          -  Men or women

          -  Left-handed or right-handed, as long as there are left-handed individuals in both
             groups for comparison

          -  Ages between 18 and 65

          -  No history of neurological or psychiatric problems, or use of controlled medication
             that might interfere with attention

          -  No symptoms of claustrophobia

          -  Written informed consent form to participate in the study

        Cancer patients:

          -  The same criteria that apply to healthy volunteers in addition to a diagnosis of
             neoplasia confirmed by biopsy

          -  Volunteers should be undergoing post-therapeutical control, have no cure criteria yet,
             and not have been submitted to radio- or chemotherapy in the last three months

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Neoplasias in the central nervous system

             (tremor equal to or higher than 3 in each corporal segment, according to the UPDRS
             scale)

          -  Fulfillment of any criterion of contraindication for the MR exam (for instance, use of

          -  Presence of odontological devices that might disturb the magnetic field or any sources
             of variation of the magnetic susceptibility

             made to discreet punctiform areas in the white matter or a discreet reduction in the
             encephalic volume.

          -  Any other conditions the investigator might deem problematic for the inclusion of the

        Cancer patients:
