  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      AT13387/0001 is a dose-finding study of an experimental anticancer agent. In accordance with
      the protocol increasing doses of AT13387 are given to patients with advanced cancer who do
      not have alternative treatment options. The preferred dose of AT13387 will be identified
      according to the side effects experienced at different dose levels.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Increasing doses of AT13387 will be administered to groups of 3 to 6 patients at each dose
      level. The pharmacokinetic profile of AT13387 following a one hour intravenous infusion will
      be determined and the effect of AT13387 on predefined biomarkers in blood plasma and
      circulating white blood cells will be established. Patients will be closely monitored for the
      development of side effects which would preclude further dose escalation.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Provision of signed informed consent.

          -  Age 18 years or older.

          -  Histological or cytological evidence of a metastatic solid tumor including lymphoma,
             which is refractory to standard therapy. The following tumor types are of particular
             interest as they may be more likely to respond to HSP90 inhibition and all efforts
             should be made to recruit patients into the study with these diagnoses. Only patients
             with these diagnoses and others thought to be responsive to HSP90 inhibitors are to be
             enrolled following the identification of MTD.

               -  Metastatic breast cancer which is HER2 positive either by FISH or 3+
                  immunohistochemistry staining,

               -  Adenocarcinoma of the prostate which is refractory to treatment with androgen
                  depletion,

               -  Metastatic melanoma,

               -  Stage IIIb or IV NSCLC,

               -  SCLC,

               -  High grade gliomas (patients must have been on a stable dose of corticosteroids
                  for at least one week prior to treatment with AT13387 and have not experienced
                  neurological deterioration during this period),

               -  GIST.

          -  ECOG performance status ≤ 2.

          -  Adequate marrow function as defined by:

               -  Hemoglobin &gt; 9 g/dL,

               -  Neutrophils &gt; 1.4 x 10^9/L,

               -  Platelets ≥ 100 x 10^9/L.

          -  Negative serum or urine pregnancy test or evidence of surgical sterility or evidence
             of post-menopausal status. Post-menopausal status is defined as any of the following:
             natural menopause with menses &gt;1 year ago; radiation induced oophorectomy with last
             menses &gt;1 year ago; chemotherapy-induced menopause with 1 year interval since last
             menses.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Be pregnant or lactating (women of childbearing potential must have a negative
             pregnancy test within 7 days prior to enrolment). Male and female patients of
             childbearing potential must use appropriate birth control (barrier methods, oral
             contraceptives and/or intrauterine devices) during the entire duration of the study,
             or the patient must be surgically sterile (with documentation in the patient's medical
             records).

          -  Ongoing central nervous system metastases in patients with an extracranial primary
             tumor (unless the patient's neurological signs or symptoms have been stable during the
             preceding three months and the patient has not received corticosteroid treatment for
             four weeks prior to study entry).

          -  Inadequate liver function as demonstrated by serum bilirubin &gt; 2.5 times the upper
             limits of reference range (ULRR) or alanine aminotransferase (ALT) or aspartate
             aminotransferase (AST) or alkaline phosphatase (ALP) ≥ 2.5 times the ULRR (unless due
             to the presence of liver metastases when ALT and/or AST may be up to five times the
             upper limits of reference range). Patients with an isolated increase in ALP ≤ 5 times
             ULRR in the absence of liver metastases but with known bone metastases are eligible
             for the study.

          -  Left ventricular ejection fraction &lt;50% on echocardiography or MUGA scan.

          -  Moderate or severe renal impairment defined as serum creatinine &gt; 1.5 ULRR or &gt; +
             proteinuria on two occasions no less than 24 hours apart.

          -  Previous treatment with a HSP90 inhibitor.

          -  Anticancer therapies that have not been completed at least 28 days prior to treatment
             with AT13387 (other than surgery or treatment with a protein kinase inhibitor which
             must have been completed no less than one week prior to treatment with AT13387).

          -  Incomplete recovery from previous radiotherapy or surgery other than residual
             cutaneous effects or stable &lt; Grade 2 gastrointestinal toxicity.

          -  History of an ischemic cardiac event, myocardial infarction or unstable cardiac
             disease within 3 months of study entry.

          -  QTc &gt; 460 ms according to the Fridericia's correction.

          -  Previous malignancy, except for non-basal-cell carcinoma of skin or carcinoma-in-situ
             of the uterine cervix, unless the tumor was treated with curative intent more than 2
             years prior to study entry.

          -  Any evidence of severe or uncontrolled systemic conditions (e.g., systemic infection)
             or current unstable or uncompensated respiratory or cardiac conditions which makes it
             undesirable for the patient to participate in the study or which could jeopardize
             compliance with the protocol.

          -  Prior history of infection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), known active
             hepatitis B or C viruses - screening for viral infections is not required for entry to
             this study.

          -  Chronic treatment with known CYP450 inducers e.g. phenytoin, within four weeks of
