  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pregnancy and delivery have a major impact on couple's inter personal relationship. Different
      modes of delivery have different effect on pelvic floor function, and it is known that
      instrumental vaginal deliveries have the worse effect, though various common anatomical
      injuries have been described following vaginal delivery. Pelvic floor dysfunction has the
      potential to ameliorate sexual function, and the investigators hypothesis is that the impact
      of delivery on pelvic floor disorders following delivery will have a direct effect on sexual
      malfunction and interpersonal relationship. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the
      effect of delivery mode of primiparous women on inter couple relationship , their sexual
      function and the female pelvic floor activity. The couples will be followed from the second
      trimester of the pregnancy by validated specific questionnaires, assessing the couple's
      satisfaction of their marriage, intimacy in their relationship, their sexual behavior and
      pelvic floor function. After delivery, the parameters of the parturition will be recorded,
      and the couples will be interviewed 6 months following delivery. Apart from questionnaires,
      sample of the participated women will be assessed by ultrasound examination of the pelvic
      floor.

      Pregnant women in their first pregnancy and their husbands will be recruited from 14th week
      of gestation. The couples will be followed by validated specific questionnaires, such as
      Couple Satisfaction Index (CSI), Isreali Sexual Behavior Inventory (ISBI), Pelvic Floor
      Distress Inventory (PFDI)and Pelvic Floor Impact Questionnaire (PFIQ) assessing the couple's
      satisfaction of their marriage, intimacy in their relationship, their sexual behavior and
      pelvic floor function. After delivery, the parameters of the parturition will be recorded,
      and the couples will be interviewed 6 months following delivery. Apart from questionnaires,
      sample of the participated women will be assessed by ultrasound examination of the pelvic
      floor, demonstrating the continuity of pelvic floor muscles and their function.
