      The purpose of this study is to assess the effects of peer influences on snack purchases in
      adolescents. During the session teens will be given a certain amount of money to use to
      purchase foods and beverages in a hypothetical convenience store setting.

      The investigators hypothesize that overweight youth will be less responsive to own-price
      elasticity for high calorie foods and less likely to show cross price elasticity for low
      calorie foods when the price of the high calorie for nutrient foods increases. The
      investigators also predict that overweight youth will show more cross price elasticity for
      low calorie foods when in the presence of peers; whereas lean youth's food purchases and
      price sensitivity will not be affected by the presence of peers.
