      This study will attempt to identify gene and brain activity markers that predict whether
      people with social anxiety disorder will respond to selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor
      medications.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Social anxiety disorder (SAD) is an anxiety disorder characterized by excessive fear and
      avoidance of social situations. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are a
      medication commonly prescribed to treat social anxiety disorder, but as many as 50% of people
      with SAD do not respond to SSRIs. Current theory suggests that neurological functioning and
      genetics may influence a patient's response to treatment. This study will examine variations
      in genetics and brain reactivity among people with SAD who do and do not respond to SSRIs.
      Through this, the study will identify neurological and genetic biomarkers that can predict
      responsiveness to SSRI treatment in people with SAD.

      Participation in this study will last 14 weeks. Both healthy people and people with SAD will
      be recruited to participate. All participants will complete similar study visits at entry,
      within 2 weeks of entry, and 12 weeks after that. The first visit, which will occur at study
      entry, will include screening questionnaires, an interview with research staff, a medical
      screening, a urine test, and collection of saliva samples for genotyping. The second visit
      and the last visit, which will be separated by 12 weeks, will involve MRI scans and
      behavioral tasks to be conducted inside and outside the MRI scanner. Over the 12 weeks
      between MRI scanning sessions, participants with SAD will take sertraline, a common SSRI, on
      a daily basis. They will also attend five additional visits during this time to complete
      assessments of their symptoms. These visits will occur 1, 2, 4, 8, and 12 weeks after
      starting sertraline treatment. Participants with SAD will therefore be completing a symptom
      assessment, MRI scans, and behavioral tasks all on the final visit, 12 weeks after the second
      visit.
