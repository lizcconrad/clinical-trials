  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There have been four previous Total Therapy (TT1 through IIIB) studies for multiple myeloma
      at the MIRT from 1989 to present. Results have shown that participants treated on these
      studies had better outcomes (meaning they have lived longer and had better responses to
      treatment) when compared to individuals treated with standard chemotherapy.

      Past studies conducted at the MIRT have shown that participants presenting to MIRT who have
      already received treatment for myeloma tend to have shorter remissions (disappearance of
      signs and symptoms of myeloma) and do not survive as long as participants who come to MIRT
      with untreated myeloma. Researchers at MIRT think that one reason for this is may be that the
      myeloma cells re-grow in the time when participants are not receiving treatment because they
      are recovering from high-dose chemotherapy. In this study, participants will receive several
      chemotherapy drugs previously shown to be effective in myeloma, but in lower doses and in
      shorter cycles. It is hoped that by giving the drugs in this way, myeloma cells will not have
      time to re-grow between cycles, therefore resulting in longer remissions. This study is being
      done in an attempt to improve the remission rate and the survival time for participants with
      high-risk myeloma.

      -  To find out if giving multi-agent chemotherapy in lower and more frequent doses to make
           the timely delivery of chemotherapy cycles possible, will result in better myeloma
           responses

        -  To find out if changing the way the drugs are given during the transplant phase will
           also result in fewer side effects, while still being effective

        -  To find out if giving treatment between transplants (called &quot;inter-therapy&quot;) will
           prevent the myeloma from re-growing between transplants

        -  To find out if long-term maintenance therapy will result in longer remissions

        -  To find out what the effects (good and bad) of this overall treatment will be

        -  To learn more about the biology and genetics of multiple myeloma by performing imaging
           tests and collecting blood, bone marrow aspirate and biopsies, and biopsies of lesions
           seen on MRI or PET scans. Bone marrow aspirates and biopsies are tissue sample collected
           from the bone cavity.
