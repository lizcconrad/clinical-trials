  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Research study to determine if pain relief following foot and/or ankle surgery is influenced
      by the technique used to place perineural catheter. The catheters are placed using
      ultrasound-guidance or nerve stimulation and the method is selected at random using a
      computer program. This may help to determine if one of these methods is associated with an
      increased success rate and incidence of foot numbness during the infusion.

      Specific Aim 1: To determine the relationship between perineural catheter placement technique
      (ultrasound-guidance and electrical stimulation) and quality of postoperative analgesia
      during continuous popliteal-sciatic nerve blocks following moderate-to-severely painful
      orthopedic surgery.

      Hypothesis 1: When inserting a perineural catheter for a continuous peripheral nerve block,
      the use of electrical stimulation, as compared with ultrasound-guidance, is associated with
      decreased pain the morning following moderate-to-severely painful orthopedic surgery as
      measured with a numeric rating scale.

      Specific Aim 2: To determine the relationship between perineural catheter placement technique
      (ultrasound-guidance and electrical stimulation) and degree of sensory deficit during
      continuous popliteal-sciatic nerve blocks following moderate-to-severely painful orthopedic
      surgery.

      Hypothesis 2: When inserting a perineural catheter for a continuous peripheral nerve block,
      the use of electrical stimulation, as compared with ultrasound-guidance, is associated with
      increased sensory deficit the day following moderate-to-severely painful orthopedic surgery
      as measured with a simple 0-10 scale (0=no numbness; 10=completely insensate) of the part of
      the foot with the greatest sensory deficit at the time of the data-collection phone call.

    <description>Ultrasound method of placement is selected randomly, using a computer program. The patient is asked their pain and discomfort using a 0-10 scale where 0=no pain/discomfort and 10=worst pain/discomfort imaginable. The patient is asked this question prior to surgery, but after catheter placement and then again the first day after surgery. Time of placement is also measured and begins when the ultrasound probe first touches the skin. Patients are also asked the numbness of their foot and toes based on a 0-10 scale where 0=no numbness and 10=completely numb.</description>

    <description>Patients will be randomized to one of two groups: Popliteal-sciatic catheter placed via ultrasound-guidance or placed via electrical stimulation. All patients will be given 40ml of 1.5% mepivicaine prior to surgery and then given a pain pump after surgery containing 0.2% ropivacaine. The patients pain scores will be assessed just prior to surgery and the day following surgery. The time of catheter placement and numbness the patient is experiencing in their foot and toes is also assessed and recorded by research staff.</description>
