    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the safety and efficacy of treatment of non-cutaneous
      T-cell lymphoma with treatment with CD4.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study is closed and all subjects have completed treatment.

      The study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of Humax CD4 with CHO vs CHO alone in
      subjects with non-cutaneous T cell lymphoma. The primary efficacy will be evaluated by time
      to relapse.
