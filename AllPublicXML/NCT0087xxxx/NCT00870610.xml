      The purpose of this study is to understand what happens to cerebral metabolism during
      therapeutic hypothermia for hypoxic brain injury following cardiac arrest.

    <textblock>
      Latest international guidelines recommend the use of therapeutic hypothermia in patients who
      have had cardiac arrest and remain in coma after return of spontaneous circulation. This is
      recommended essentially to limit the cerebral injury caused by cardiac arrest and possibly
      amplified upon reperfusion. At times, although a spontaneous circulation has returned,
      cerebral oxygenation may remain inadequate due to inadequate perfusion pressure, and
      hypothermia, by reducing cardiac output and cerebral blood flow could actually aggravate this
      phenomenon. The rewarming period is thought to be at greatest risk of inadequate oxygenation
      for the increase in metabolic demand. With this study we aim to understand what happens to
      cerebral oxygenation and metabolism during therapeutic hypothermia for cardiac arrest through
      cerebrovenous oxygen saturation monitoring and in particular, to see whether through this
      type of monitoring we could recognize otherwise unnoticed periods of inadequate cerebral
      oxygenation.
