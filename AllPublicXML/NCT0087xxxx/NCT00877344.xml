      Hypothesis

      Intrauterine contraception placed immediately after a second trimester abortion will result
      in fewer pregnancies than current standard practice of intended placement at 4 weeks
      post-abortion.

      Study Design

      Randomized Controlled Trial after their second trimester abortion comparing immediate with
      delayed insertion of IUC, and a non intervention control group choosing non-intrauterine
      contraception. Participants choosing an IUC will be randomly assigned to immediate or delayed
      insertion. The investigators primary outcome is pregnancy rate within one year.

      This Randomized Controlled Trial will be offered to women choosing to have a LNG-IUC or
      CuT380 after an abortion for gestational ages from 12 to 24 weeks. [delete next insert]&quot;and a
      non intervention control group offered to all others having abortions at this gestational
      age&quot;. Participants choosing an LNG-IUC or CUT380 will be randomly assigned to immediate or
      interval insertion. In conjunction with follow up visits and questionnaires, the British
      Columbia Linked Health Database access will determine pregnancy rate within one year for the
      two intervention groups [delete next insert] and in relation to the various contraceptive
      choices made by the women not choosing intrauterine contraception. All women will complete
      surveys at 3, 6, 12, 24, 36, 48 and 72 months on their satisfaction with the contraceptive
      method chosen and on their satisfaction with study participation.

    <description>The one year pregnancy rate outcome will be determined using a pragmatic approximation based on the varying exactitude of imputations based on provincial Medical Service Plan billings related to abortions, miscarriages, still births and live births. Subsequent abortions performed within our study clinics for enrolled participants will be noted along with specific clinical information on pregnancy duration. For abortions performed elsewhere such as those for BC university students studying out of province, or those performed by individual physicians at rural or remote hospitals within BC, exact gestation may not be available. In the BC health administrative databases abortions are billed as under 7 weeks for medical abortions, and as under 14 weeks, 14 weeks to under 18 weeks, and 18 weeks and over for surgical abortions. Miscarriages by definition occur anytime under 20 weeks or are classed as still birth when over 20 weeks of gestation.</description>
