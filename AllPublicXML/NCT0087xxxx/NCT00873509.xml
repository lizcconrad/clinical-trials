  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effects of twice-daily oral buspirone on core
      features of autism in autistic children aged 2-6 years as measured by the change from
      baseline in the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule (ADOS) Composite Total scores compared
      to placebo at 6 months.

    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-masked study of 166 evaluable
      participants taking buspirone twice daily for 6 months. Children aged 2-6 years with autism
      will be randomized to receive one of three treatments: 2.5mg, 5.0mg, or matched placebo. The
      placebo controlled trial will be followed by an optional follow-up trial to assess the long
      term safety of buspirone. In addition, a PET scan of serotonin synthesis and plasma serotonin
      will be measured at baseline to determine whether these measures are predictors of drug
      response. This trial is aimed at the core features of autism. The outcome measures for
      efficacy will be examiner and parent ratings on psychological tests and questionnaires. The
      outcome measure for the primary objective will be the Autism Diagnostic Observation Scale
      (ADOS) Composite Total score. The behavioral outcomes for the secondary aims are delineated
      in the study design.

             determined by clinical diagnosis based upon DSM-IV criteria, the Autism Diagnostic
             Interview-Revised (ADI-R) and the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule (ADOS)
             performed at baseline 1. ADI-R will be conducted by trained study staff at Baseline 1
             Visit. If the participant has had an ADI-R in the past 12 months, this will be
