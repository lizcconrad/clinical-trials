    <textblock>
      This research study is to determine the relative times for perineural catheter placement with
      the use of ultrasound versus electrical stimulation. The perineural catheter is placed next
      to the nerves through which local anesthetic is placed to provide pain control following
      surgery. This study may determine if one method is associated with increased success rate and
      patient comfort.

      Primary Specific Aim: To determine if the relative times for perineural catheter placement
      with the use of ultrasound versus electrical stimulation.

      Hypothesis: Compared with the use of electrical stimulation, the use of ultrasound guidance
      when inserting a perineural catheter is associated with a decreased time of placement.

      Secondary Specific Aim: To determine if other possible benefits of perineural catheter
      placement associated with the use of ultrasound guidance versus electrical stimulation.

      Hypothesis: Compared with the use of electrical stimulation, the use of ultrasound guidance
      when inserting a perineural catheter is associated with an increased surgical block success
      rate and catheter-placement success rate, as well as decreased patient discomfort and
      incidence of venous puncture.

    <description>Ultrasound is randomly chosen by use of a computer program. The time for catheter placement will begin with the ultrasound probe touches the patient. Patients will be asked their discomfort on a 0-10 scale (0=no discomfort and 10=worst discomfort imaginable) and will be called the next day by the research staff.</description>

    <description>Nerve Stimulation (electrical stimulation) is randomly chosen using a computer program. Time of placement begins when the catheter-placement first touches the patient. After catheter placement patient is asked their discomfort on a 0-10 scale (0=no discomfort and 10=worst discomfort imaginable) and called the day after surgery by the research staff.</description>

    <intervention_name>perineural mepivicaine catheter placed via ultrasound or electrical stimulation</intervention_name>
    <description>Patients will be randomized to one of two groups: catheter placement via ultrasound or nerve stimulation. Placement of the catheter will be timed by research staff and discomfort level asked after placement of catheter. If the catheter is not placed by the randomized method within 15 minutes, the practitioner my switch to the alternate method. Patients will be called the morning after surgery by research staff to assess discomfort levels.</description>
