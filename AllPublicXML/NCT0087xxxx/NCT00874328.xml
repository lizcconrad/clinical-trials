  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The irinotecan and cisplatin combination showed significant anti-tumor activity. In the
      first-line setting, the investigators showed that this regimen had significant anti-tumor
      activity in 47% of chemo-na√Øve NSCLC patients with 1-year survival rate of 64.2%. Again, the
      investigators showed that the second-line Irinotecan and cisplatin is an active and
      well-tolerated regimen in patients with advanced NSCLC pretreated with non-platinum based
      chemotherapy.

      TS-1 (Jeil Pharmaceutical Co.,Ltd, Seoul, Korea) is an oral anticancer drug comprised of
      tegafur, 5-chloro-2, 4-dihydroxypyridine and potassium oxonate, in a molar ratio of 1:0.4:1.
      Tegafur is a prodrug that generates 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) in blood via metabolism by liver
      enzyme, and 5-chloro-2, 4-dihydroxypyridine enhance the serum concentration of 5-FU by the
      competitive inhibition of dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase, an enzyme responsible for 5-FU
      catabolism. Potassium oxonate is also a reversible competitive inhibitor of orotate
      phosphoribosyl transferase, a phosphoenzyme for 5-FU. Diarrhea induced by 5-FU administration
      is though to be attributable to the phosphorylation of 5-FU by the enzyme in the
      gastrointestinal tissue. After oral administration of potassium oxonate, the concentration of
      potassium in the gastrointestinal tissue is high enough to inhibit the enzyme while the
      concentration in blood and tumor is reported to be either slight or nil. Because of these
      mechanism, oral TS-1 administration generates a higher concentration of 5-FU than protracted
      intravenous infusion of 5-FU given in a dose equimolar to the tegafur in S-1, whereas the
      incidence of adverse events concerning the GI tract does not increase. In a phase II trial of
      TS-1 as first-line setting in NSCLC, the response rate was 22% and the median survival time
      was 10.2 months. As expected, the incidence of severe gastrointestinal adverse events was
      low, and so was few severe hematologic toxicity. Recently 3-weekly TS-1 plus cisplatin showed
      activity against NSCLC with a response rate of 32.7% and the safety was acceptable.

      The investigators are conducting a phase I/II study to determine the maximum-tolerated dose,
      the recommended dose, and to evaluate the response rate and toxicity of the TS-1, irinotecan
      and cisplatin combination in patients with advanced or metastatic NSCLC.
