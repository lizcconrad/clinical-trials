  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      As a safe and noninvasive method of treatment, the intent of the study is to show that
      Osteopathic manipulation therapy is a beneficial treatment for the aggravating bladder
      symptoms seen in all patients with interstitial cystitis.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The management of interstitial cystitis is predominantly based on the reduction of the
      symptoms of frequency, urgency, and pain.In addition to Osteopathic manipulation Other
      conservative treatments frequently include dietary modification, pharmaceuticals, bladder
      training, neuromodulation, and stress reduction. The goal of Osteopathic manipulation is to
      relax the pelvic muscles used by the bladder and improve the flow of blood and lymph fluid to
      this region, which may result in easing pain and discomfort associated with cystitis.Some
      physicians have found that Osteopathic Manipulation works for some people as an alternative
      to surgery. A secondary objective will be to determine if the increased attention and power
      of touch are as effective as OMT in treating patients with interstitial cystitis based on the
      results of using attention control treatment in some patients.Thus, this is a pilot study
      comparing OMT to an attention control arm and standard of care arm of treatment.We will
      review palpatory visceromatic reflex changes as documented by tissue texture changes,
      asymmetry, restriction of motion and tenderness pre and post treatment.Physical examination
      including detailed musculoskeletal examination of the lumbosacral region will be performed
      pre and post and then compared the results.

    <description>This procedure consist of Sacral rocking is performed by placing the heel of the practitioner's hand over the sacrum and by using the palpatory skills of an osteopathic physician; rock the sacrum into a position with no restriction. Myofascial release will utilize various physical motions to place the patients lumbosacral region in a position of maximal comfort and tissue release.</description>

    <description>The procedure consist of light pressure applied to certain painful areas of the body and back to decrease pain and help patient relax. The physician will look for areas of the body that hurt, lay his/her hands on the those places, and apply light pressure.</description>

    <description>This procedure consists of various conservative treatments that can help reduce stress. Those include dietary modifications, pharmaceuticals, bladder training, and neuromodulation. If these treatments are not successful, minimally invasive surgical procedures is performed.</description>

        A sample of 60 patients that have a confirmed diagnosis of Interstitial Cystitis as
        patients of Urological Surgical Associates and Charleston Area Medical Center (CAMC) based
        on current diagnostic recommendations. The patients will be selected based on their
        clinical history of interstitial cystitis.
