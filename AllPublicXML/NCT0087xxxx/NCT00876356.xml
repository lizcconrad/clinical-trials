    <textblock>
      Conjugated linoleic acids (CLA) are naturally occurring free fatty acids derived from the
      tissues and milk of ruminant animals such as cows. CLA has multiple biological properties
      including regulation of metabolism and immune processes, including tissue inflammation.
      Asthma symptoms are caused by irritation and inflammation of the airways. Our hypothesis was
      that CLA may reduce airway inflammation in asthma and thus reduce asthma symptoms. The aim of
      this pilot study was to investigate the efficacy and safety of CLA as a dietary supplement in
      mild asthma. Subjects will be assigned to take CLA dietary supplements or placebo (olive oil)
      for 12 weeks in addition to their usual asthma treatment. They will be monitored for asthma
      symptoms, side effects, lung function and blood markers of inflammation.

      Background and Purpose You are being invited to participate in a study of the effects of a
      natural supplement, conjugated linoleic acid (CLA), on allergy and asthma. Previous studies
      show that CLA may control the type of inflammation found in allergy and asthma. CLA is found
      in dairy products, however the amount found varies greatly depending on what the cows have
      been fed and has reduced dramatically over the last 30 years. The estimated daily intake of
      CLA is between 15 and 174 mg/day, but an effective dose of CLA is 3000 to 4000 mg/day for a
      70 kg adult. Therefore taking CLA supplements may be beneficial. This will be the first
      formal study to look at whether CLA does benefit people with allergies and asthma.

      Study Procedures

      If you qualify for the study and agree to participate, you will be randomly assigned (like
      flipping a coin) into one of two groups. The two groups are:

      Conjugated linoleic acid (active substance) twice daily for 3 months Placebo (inactive
      substance) twice daily for 3 months

      Neither you nor the study doctors will know whether you are receiving CLA or placebo. There
      will be no change in your asthma medications that are prescribed by your regular physician.
      Your physician will be made aware that you are participating in this study.

      Your participation in the study involves 6 visits to our laboratory, of about 2 hours
      duration each. The study will run for 3 months.

      At 4 of the visits, which will happen every 4 weeks, you will be asked to perform spirometry
      and sputum induction. Spirometry is a breathing test which requires you to take a deep breath
      in and blow it out as hard and fast as you can. From this we can measure baseline airway
      function. This takes about 15 minutes, has no side effects and is a routinely performed test
      on patients in our clinical pulmonary function laboratory.

      Sputum induction involves the inhalation of a mist of salt water to help produce a deep cough
      and a sputum sample from deep in your chest. This takes about 30 minutes. You will be given a
      pretreatment with a bronchodilator medication, and then inhale the mist for at least 1, and
      up to 3, 7 minute periods. Then you are asked to cough up some sputum from your chest, into a
      sample cup. Inhalation of the mist can cause coughing and sore throat but pretreatment with
      the bronchodilator should minimize these side effects. Spirometry is repeated after each
      inhalation of mist to detect any change in your airway size, or bronchoconstriction. If
      bronchoconstriction occurs, you will immediately be given a bronchodilator to reverse it. The
      sputum will be analyzed for markers of inflammation characteristic of your asthma.

      At those same visits you will also have approximately 25 mL (2 tablespoons) of blood taken
      which will be analyzed for markers of inflammation called cytokines. You will also answer a
      questionnaire to determine how asthma and allergies affect your daily living. You will
      undergo a physical exam and receive education on how to control your asthma and how to
      properly use your inhalers.

      At the beginning of the study and at the end of the study we will ask that you come in for
      another visit to do a methacholine challenge breathing test. The challenge involves you
      breathing a mist that contains a bronchoconstrictor (methacholine) and then performing
      spirometry to measure the flow and volume of air in your lungs. You will breathe several
      different mists, of increasing concentrations of the bronchoconstrictor, until a change in
      your flow measurement is found. This test measures how sensitive your airways are and takes
      about 1 hour. You may feel some tightness in your chest and/or some wheezing as a result of
      the challenge, but you will be given bronchodilator medication to reverse the effects of the
      bronchoconstrictor. You will be closely monitored with spirometry to ensure your safety
      during this test.

      Risks The potential side effects of CLA are minimal. In previous human studies the main
      complaint was that of gastrointestinal disturbances; mainly bloating and increased gas. 12%
      of people receiving CLA complained of gastrointestinal disturbances, compared to 6% of people
      receiving olive oil placebo.

      If you are a female of childbearing potential and are pregnant or nursing you cannot be
      involved in this study, as the effects of CLA on the embryo and fetus are not known. If you
      become pregnant during the study you must inform the study personnel immediately and your
      study treatment will be discontinued.

      Confidentiality All of the data collected regarding you will be kept in a secure database in
      the McDonald Research Wing, where it can be accessed by authorized individuals only for this
      study. No personal information such as your name or address will be included in the database;
      you will be identified by a code number only.

      These investigations are for research only; no individual results will be returned to you or
      your doctor. Participation in this study is completely voluntary. You may refuse to
      participate, or you may withdraw from the study at any time without prejudice to your medical
      treatment.

      Benefit There may be no direct benefit to you in participating in this study, but you will be
      helping us advance our knowledge of lung disease for the benefit of future patients.

      Compensation You will be compensated for your time and effort by payment of $25 for your
      screening visit and $50 for each set of study visits (sputum induction and breathing tests).
