    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if the Silent™ hip is effective in the treatment of
      patients with hip joint disease requiring a total hip replacement. Patients who enter the
      study will be evaluated at regular intervals following hip surgery using patient, clinical
      and x-ray assessments. A subset of patients will undergo scans to allow the bone mineral
      density of the bone surrounding the implant to be monitored

      The purpose of this study is to determine if the Silent™ hip, when used as part of an
      artificial hip joint, is effective in the treatment of patients with hip joint disease

      intervals following hip surgery using patient, clinical and x-ray assessments. A subset of

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Male or female subjects, aged 18 years or above at the point of screening for
             participation.

          -  Subjects who are able to give voluntary, written informed consent to participate in
             this clinical investigation and from whom consent has been obtained.

          -  Subjects who, in the opinion of the Clinical Investigator, are able to understand this
             clinical investigation, co-operate with the investigational procedures and are willing
             to return to the hospital for all the required post-treatment follow-ups.

          -  Subjects with non-inflammatory osteoarthritis of the hip who require a primary total
             hip replacement and are considered suitable for a cementless femoral and acetabular
             component.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects who, in the opinion of the Investigator, have an existing condition that
             would compromise their participation and follow-up in this study.

          -  Women who are pregnant.

          -  Subjects who are known drug or alcohol abusers or with psychological disorders that
             could affect follow-up care or treatment outcomes.

          -  Subjects who have participated in a clinical study with an investigational product in
             the last 6 months. This exclusion does not apply to those subjects who are
             participating in the pilot investigation of the DePuy Silent Hip (CT01/27)

          -  Subjects who are currently involved in any injury litigation claims.

          -  Subjects who have osteonecrosis of the femoral neck

          -  Subjects with significant bone loss or gross deformity in the region of the neck of
             the femur as identified on the pre-operative radiographs, where in the Investigator's
             opinion, there could be considerable migration of the DePuy Silent Hip or a
             significant chance of fracture of the femoral shaft and/or the lack of adequate bone
             to support the DePuy Silent Hip.

          -  Subjects with a Charnley C classification.

          -  Subjects with an active local or systemic infection.

          -  Subjects with loss of musculature, neuromuscular compromise or vascular deficiency in
             the affected limb rendering the arthroplasty procedure unjustified.

          -  Subjects with Paget's disease
