    <measure>Assessment of Menstrual Blood Flow (MBF) at 12 Months Post Procedure</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months from Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Change in volume of menstrual blood loss at 12 months post-procedure compared to baseline. Bleeding relief and surgical reintervention were the co-primary endpoints. Bleeding relief success was defined for individual subjects as a ≥ 50% reduction from baseline in menstrual blood loss at 12 months posttreatment. The Primary Full Analysis Set was the primary analysis set for bleeding success rate.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Incidence of Device and Procedure-related Adverse Events Within 12 Months Post-procedure</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>An adverse event was defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a subject who uses a medical device, regardless of the presumed relationship of the event to the study device. A serious adverse event is defined as an untoward medical occurrence that results in death, is life threatening, requires or prolongs hospitalization, results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity, or is a congenital anomaly or birth defect. Preexisting conditions (i.e., underlying diseases that were present before the adverse event reporting period began), re-intervention for failure to meet the study endpoints, and pregnancy were not reported as adverse events. All adverse events that occured during the study were recorded on the Adverse Event case report form (CRF). The investigator recorded the adverse event and assessed the relationship of the adverse event to the device and/or procedure; the coding of the events was reviewed by the Clinical Events Committee (CEC).</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Surgical Re-Intervention for Menorrhagia at 12 Months Post-treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months from Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Patients who had surgical reintervention for bleeding prior to 12 months follow-up. Surgical reintervention success was defined as no surgical reintervention for menorrhagia within the 12-month posttreatment period.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Uterine and Fibroid Volume at 12 Months Post-procedure Compared to Pre-procedure (Baseline) as Measured With Contrast-enhanced MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging)</measure>
    <time_frame>12 month from Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Evaluate change from baseline in uterine volume and fibroid volume at 12 months post-procedure as measured by contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) measurements. Specifically, the outcomes of uterine and fibroid volume changes are expressed as a mean percentage of volume reduction. Treatment with RFA resulted in a reduction from baseline in total uterine and fibroid volume, as assessed by pretreatment and posttreatment MRI, at 3 and 12 months posttreatment.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Fibroid Symptom Severity and Quality of Life Scores at 12 Months Post-procedure as Compared to Pre-procedure (Baseline) Using the Uterine Fibroid Symptom and Health Related Quality of Life (UFS-QoL) Assessment Tool.</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months from Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>The Uterine Fibroid Symptom and Health Related Quality of Life (UFS-QoL) assessment tool measures symptom severity and Health related quality of life.
Symptom Severity (SS) - high scores indicate greater symptoms (bad) and low scores indicate less symptoms (good). Scores range from 0 to 100. Since this outcome measure indicates &quot;change&quot; in symptoms, a negative number indicates a reduction in symptoms and therefore improvement.
Health Related (HRQL) - high scores indicate better health state. Scores range from 0 to 100. Since this outcome measure indicates &quot;change&quot; in health and quality of life, a positive number indicates and improvement.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Score on Questionnaire - General Health Outcome at 12 Months Post-procedure as Compared to Pre-procedure Using the EQ-5D (a Standardized Instrument for Use as a Measure of Health Outcome)</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The EQ-5D is a standardized instrument with scores ranging from 0 to 100, for use as a measure of general health outcome, such as mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety and depression. An increase in the score post treatment indicates less disease burden.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Overall Subject Treatment Outcome and Satisfaction Using the Overall Treatment Evaluation (OTE)</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Overall Treatment Evaluation Survey refers to whether the patient felt symptoms improved, worsened or remained the same post treatment.</description>

          <title>Halt Medical Acessa Procedure</title>
          <description>In this single-arm study, subjects who have symptomatic uterine fibroids had the Acessa Procedure using the Halt Medical Proprietary Acessa System. The Acessa System delivers monopolar radiofrequency energy to tissue through a disposable electrosurgical radiofrequency (RF) Handpiece. The Generator provides sinusoidally-varying voltage at 460 kilohertz (kHz) to drive a current through the tissue to be ablated. The current delivered through the Handpiece causes controlled, local heating, resulting in targeted tissue destruction. The heat produced then disperses by conduction. During these controlled ablations, the Generator produces an alternating current which flows between the Handpiece and the dispersive electrode pads, through the body of the patient. These components, coupled with the visualization capabilities of laparoscopic ultrasound, enable the surgeon to accurately identify the patient’s uterine fibroids and treat all of her fibroids, and just the fibroids.</description>

        <description>An adverse event was defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a subject who uses a medical device, regardless of the presumed relationship of the event to the study device. A serious adverse event is defined as an untoward medical occurrence that results in death, is life threatening, requires or prolongs hospitalization, results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity, or is a congenital anomaly or birth defect. Preexisting conditions (i.e., underlying diseases that were present before the adverse event reporting period began), re-intervention for failure to meet the study endpoints, and pregnancy were not reported as adverse events. All adverse events that occured during the study were recorded on the Adverse Event case report form (CRF). The investigator recorded the adverse event and assessed the relationship of the adverse event to the device and/or procedure; the coding of the events was reviewed by the Clinical Events Committee (CEC).</description>

        <title>Change in Uterine and Fibroid Volume at 12 Months Post-procedure Compared to Pre-procedure (Baseline) as Measured With Contrast-enhanced MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging)</title>
        <description>Evaluate change from baseline in uterine volume and fibroid volume at 12 months post-procedure as measured by contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) measurements. Specifically, the outcomes of uterine and fibroid volume changes are expressed as a mean percentage of volume reduction. Treatment with RFA resulted in a reduction from baseline in total uterine and fibroid volume, as assessed by pretreatment and posttreatment MRI, at 3 and 12 months posttreatment.</description>

        <population>The Full Analysis Set (FAS) was used in the analysis of the change in total uterine and fibroid volumes between baseline and 12 months post treatment. Of the 137 Subjects enrolled, two were excluded from the FAS because they did not meet all of the inclusion/exclusion criteria.</population>

        <title>Change in Fibroid Symptom Severity and Quality of Life Scores at 12 Months Post-procedure as Compared to Pre-procedure (Baseline) Using the Uterine Fibroid Symptom and Health Related Quality of Life (UFS-QoL) Assessment Tool.</title>
        <description>The Uterine Fibroid Symptom and Health Related Quality of Life (UFS-QoL) assessment tool measures symptom severity and Health related quality of life.
Symptom Severity (SS) - high scores indicate greater symptoms (bad) and low scores indicate less symptoms (good). Scores range from 0 to 100. Since this outcome measure indicates &quot;change&quot; in symptoms, a negative number indicates a reduction in symptoms and therefore improvement.
Health Related (HRQL) - high scores indicate better health state. Scores range from 0 to 100. Since this outcome measure indicates &quot;change&quot; in health and quality of life, a positive number indicates and improvement.</description>
