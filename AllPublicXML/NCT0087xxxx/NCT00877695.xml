  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to develop and pilot test a culturally and developmentally
      tailored Motivational Enhancement Intervention (MEI) to reduce risky sex (unprotected anal
      sex and multiple partners) among young Hispanic men who have sex with men (YHMSM).

      Stage 1, divided into Stage 1a and Stage 1b, focuses on development, refinement, and pilot
      testing of interventions. The formative research leading to and including intervention
      development is completed in Stage 1a. A pilot study to provide acceptability/feasibility data
      and obtain effect size estimates of the intervention's strength in changing a desired outcome
      is conducted in Stage 1b. If Stage 1b results are &quot;promising,&quot; the intervention moves to full
      scale efficacy testing in Stage 2 using the classic experimental design of a randomized
      control trial (RCT). The intervention is ready for Stage 3 effectiveness testing only after
      its efficacy has been demonstrated in at least two Stage 2 trials.

    <description>This arm of the motivational enhancement intervention (MEI) will be delivered face to face (FtF) using a real-time, dynamic implementation approach. The intervention consisted of 2 sessions lasting approximately 60 to 90 minutes. The sessions focused on increasing participants' awareness of the multiple influences on behaviors from self, family, culture and community and how these influences impact the way we think and behave including sexually. Through a series of exercises the participant develops strategies for understanding and managing his own triggers that helps them to make healthy life choices. Both Motiv8 2Change arms used the exact same intervention, with the exception that one was delivered face to face and the other through the internet.</description>

    <description>Comparable in number of sessions and duration to the experimental arms, but focused on resume development and interviewing skills. This arm consisted of 2 sessions. In the first session participants reviewed different career choices and created a winning resume. The second session focused on job interviewing skills. It included role plays with feedback. It also contains ethically mandated information regarding HIV prevention. It was delivered on line by a trained facilitator.</description>

    <description>A pilot test of a culturally and developmentally tailored MEI to reduce risky sex (unprotected anal sex and multiple partners) among young Hispanic men who have sex with men (YHMSM) to be delivered face-to-face (FtF) and through the Internet using a real-time implementation approach. A tailored MEI for two delivery modalities, and a health education control (HEALTH) comparable in time and number of sessions. We will test the MEI's acceptability and feasibility, obtain effect size estimates of the intervention's strength to reduce risky sex, and determine if it is ready for efficacy testing.</description>
