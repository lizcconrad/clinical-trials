    <textblock>
      This is a pilot vaccine study in adults with recurrent WHO Grade II gliomas. The purpose of
      this study is to test the safety and efficacy of an experimental tumor vaccine made from
      peptides in combination with the study drug Poly-ICLC.

      Poly-ICLC, manufactured by Oncovir, Inc., has already been received and is generally well
      tolerated by subjects in earlier studies and has been shown to decrease the size of brain
      tumors in some cases.

      The immunological and safety data will be used to decide whether a larger study of clinical
      efficacy is warranted.

      This is a pilot study of a vaccination regime that is designed to efficiently induce
      anti-tumor T-cell responses in patients with recurrent WHO grade II glioma. The proposed
      regime combines subcutaneous injections of glioma-associated antigen (GAA)-derived cytotoxic
      T-lymphocyte (CTL) epitope-peptides with simultaneous intramuscular (i.m.) administration of
      poly-ICLC.

      The overall objective of this pilot study is to collect immunological and safety data that
      will be used to decide whether a larger study of clinical efficacy is warranted in these
      patients. All patients on the study will be followed for a minimum of 2 years, so that the
      actual 2-year overall survival (OS), 6-month and 2-year progression-free survival (PFS) rates
      can be determined in an exploratory manner.

    <description>Subcutaneously in right or left upper arms with intact draining axillary nodes. Each will be injected to the same location in the same arm as the previous vaccine was administered. In case of no intact axillary lymph nodes as draining nodes, vaccines will be administered in the upper thigh on the same side with intact inguinal lymph nodes.
Vaccine will be administered on weeks 0,3,6,9,12,15,18 and 21. Poly-ICLC First course(20 mg/kg i.m., up to 1640 µg/injection) will be administered on an outpatient basis in the Clinical &amp; Translational Research Center (CTRC)the day of the first GAA/TT-vaccine and on day 4 after the vaccine. For each of the repeated vaccinations (on Weeks 3,6,9,12,15,18 and 21) poly-ICLC will be administered on day of the vaccine and on day 4 after the vaccine.</description>

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Participants must have recurrent supratentorial WHO grade II astrocytoma,
             oligoastrocytoma or oligodendroglioma that is histologically confirmed either by the
             previous biopsy or resection, or at the time of re-operation (re-operation before
             entry to the current study is allowed; however post-surgery Decadron must be off for
             at least 4 weeks before administration of the first vaccine). Patients may have
             received prior external beam radiotherapy and/or chemotherapy. With regard to the
             prior therapy, patients may have had treatment for no more than 2 prior relapses.
             Relapse is defined as progression following initial therapy (i.e. radiation +/- chemo
             if that was used as initial therapy). The intent therefore is that patients may have
             had 3 prior therapies (initial therapy and treatment for 2 relapses). If the patient
             had a surgical resection for relapsed disease, and no anti-cancer therapy was
             instituted for up to 12 weeks, and the patient undergoes another surgical resection,
             this is considered as 1 relapse.

          2. HLA-A2 positive based on flow cytometry.

          3. Tumor recurrence is defined by the increase of maximum tumor diameter, based on the
             axial and/or coronal T2 or FLAIR MR images. Increase of tumor size can be based on
             comparison with previous scans performed up to prior 3 years to allow assessment of
             slow-growth of the tumor.

          4. Patients must have recovered from the toxic effects of prior therapy: 4 weeks from any
             investigational agent, 4 weeks from prior cytotoxic therapy and/or at least two weeks
             from vincristine, 4 weeks from nitrosoureas, 3 weeks from procarbazine administration,
             and 1 week for non-cytotoxic agents, e.g., interferon, tamoxifen, thalidomide,
             cis-retinoic acid, etc. (radiosensitizer does not count). Any questions related to the
             definition of non-cytotoxic agents should be directed to the Principal Investigator.
             With regard to previous RT, there must be at least 6 months from the completion of RT
             (or radiosurgery).

          5. Participants must be at least 18 years old. For patients under 18 years old, we have a
             separate, but similar vaccine study through the Children's Hospital in Pittsburgh.

          6. All participants must sign an informed consent document.

          7. Participants must have a Karnofsky performance status of &gt; 60 (Appendix I).

          8. Documented negative serum HCG for female participants of child-bearing age. Males and
             females must agree, in the consent form, to use effective birth control methods during
             the course of vaccination. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant
             while participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician
             immediately. Because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in
             nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with the peptide-based vaccine
             and poly-ICLC, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated in this
             study.

          9. Participants must be free of systemic infection.

         10. Participants with adequate organ function as measured by white blood count ≥ 2500/mm3;
             lymphocytes ≥ 800/mm3; platelets ≥ 100,000/mm3, hemoglobin ≥ 10.0 g/dL, AST, ALT, GGT,
             LDH, alkaline phosphatase within 2.5 x upper normal limit, and total bilirubin ≤ 2.0
             mg/dL, and serum creatinine within 1.5 X upper limit of normal limit. Coagulation
             tests PT and PTT have to be within normal limits.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Presence of gliomatosis cerebri, cranial or spinal leptomeningeal metastatic disease.

          2. Even if the initial diagnosis was WHO grade II glioma, if the pathological diagnosis
             for the recurrent disease demonstrate transformation to higher grade (i.e. WHO grade
             III or IV) gliomas, patients will be excluded from the eligibility.

          3. Concurrent treatment or medications including:

               -  Radiation therapy

               -  Chemotherapy

               -  Interferon

               -  Allergy desensitization injections

               -  Growth factors

               -  Interleukins

               -  Any investigational therapeutic medication

          4. Participants must not have had prior autoimmune disorders requiring cytotoxic or
             immunosuppressive therapy, or autoimmune disorders with visceral involvement.
             Participants with an active autoimmune disorder requiring these therapies are also
             excluded. Mild arthritis requiring NSAID medications will not be exclusionary.

          5. Use of immunosuppressives within 4 weeks prior to study entry or anticipated use of
             immunosuppressive agents. Dexamethasone, or other corticosteroid medications, if used
             peri-operative period and/or during radiotherapy, must be tapered and discontinued at
             least 4 weeks before administration of the first vaccine. Topical corticosteroids and
             Inhaled steroids are acceptable.

          6. Participants who have another cancer diagnosis, except that the following diagnoses
             will be allowed:

               -  squamous cell cancer of the skin without known metastasis

               -  basal cell cancer of the skin without known metastasis

               -  carcinoma in situ of the breast (DCIS or LCIS)

               -  carcinoma in situ of the cervix

               -  any cancer without distant metastasis that has been treated successfully, without
                  evidence of recurrence or metastasis for over 5 years

          7. Participants with known addiction to alcohol or illicit drugs.

          8. Because patients with immune deficiency are not expected to respond to this therapy,
             HIV-positive patients are excluded from the study.

          9. Patients who previously participated in UPCI 07-057 are excluded.
