  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Managing diet and physical activity are vital aspects of diabetes self−care; however, people
      with diabetes often find it difficult to make changes to their usual diet and physical
      activity patterns. There is some evidence that computer based education may help some people
      develop the skills they need to better manage their diabetes. The investigators have
      developed an interactive CD−ROM, focusing on knowledge, self−monitoring, goal setting and
      skill−development in relation to diet and physical activity for people with Type 2 diabetes.
      A major emphasis was placed on eliciting the views of people with Type 2 diabetes throughout
      the development of the CD−ROM. This study will examine whether this CD−ROM can improve
      knowledge, skills and self−care behaviour in people with diabetes. One hundred participants
      who have been diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes in the past 2 years will be assigned by chance
      to one of two groups: they will either be assigned to continue with their normal care routine
      consulting with their doctor as normal, or they will be assigned to use the CD−ROM at least
      once a week for 12 weeks.

    <description>The intervention group will receive an initial training session which will include a demonstration of the layout and main features of the CD−ROM and some instructions on how to navigate around the different sections of the CD−ROM. As a minimum level of use, participants will be asked to use the self−monitoring and goal setting aspects of the CD−ROM on at least a weekly basis.</description>
