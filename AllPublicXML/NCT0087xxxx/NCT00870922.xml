  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Muscles and myofascial dysfunction are more often the mechanism and source of pain in oral
      fascial disorders (OFD) than the TMJ. Masticatory muscles in patients with TMJ alterations
      are more hypertonic, less efficient and more prone to fatigue compared to age and sex matched
      controls. It is our opinion that Active Release Technique can be a reliable assessment and
      treatment tool in the resolution in cervical-cranio mandibular disorders. Our goal is to
      improve masticatory function through treatment of trigger points in the masseter.

      Recruit 45 patients with TMD determined by questionnaire. Measure pre and post mandibular
      active range of motion and VAS pain scale. Treatment will include 4 visits over a two week
      span measuring before first treatment and after last treatment. There will be 3 treatment
      groups; active release technique, post isometric relaxation and a no treatment control group.
      We will analyze data for any change in mandibular range of motion and VAS pain scale.
