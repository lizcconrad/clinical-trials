  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test the effect of TRO19622 on peripheral neuropathy scores
      after 6 weeks treatment and is based on the separate assessment of pain and dysesthesia
      scores.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Chemotherapy Induced Peripheral Neuropathy represents a frequent and invalidating side effect
      that requires treatment. Current treatment options are multiple, but none have yet
      demonstrated efficacy in double-blind clinical trials .

      This study will provide information useful to determine the potential of TRO19622 to relieve
      both pain and dysesthesia which are the most common symptoms experienced by patients with
      peripheral neuropathy following taxane chemotherapy.

      At the start of the study, patients will be randomized to one of two groups : TRO19622 (330
      mg QD or placebo once a day).

      Each treatment will be administered for 6 weeks. Additionally, patients will have the option
      to continue treatment for another 6 weeks duration.

      Treatment will be administered under double-blind conditions. The product under evaluation
      will be administered to patients receiving the standard of care for CIPN.
