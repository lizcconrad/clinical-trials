    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effects of a 6-day postoperative in hospital
      cardiopulmonary rehabilitation program on inspiratory muscle strength and its potential
      association with improved functional capacity after coronary artery bypass grafting surgery.

    <textblock>
      Eligible patients were randomized to a cardiopulmonary rehabilitation program (Rehab; n = 10)
      or to usual care (Control; n = 10). The randomization was done by the Graphpad StatMate
      computerized program. Those patients assigned to Control were followed by their own
      physicians, received routine nursing assistance, were visited daily by the one of the
      investigators (CPM), but were not exposed to any specific respiratory or motor physical
      intervention. Those randomized to Rehab received the same medical and nursing care, but
      followed a structured physical therapy program twice a day.

    <description>The program consisted of bronchial hygiene characterized by detachment and removal of secretions and respiratory exercises which were applied in the respiratory muscles in order to strengthen and increase the resistance. Patients were instructed to maintain diaphragmatic breathing, at a rate of 12 to 18 breaths per minute during EPAP mask use, and the expiratory pressure was increased progressively in the following fashion: 3-8 cm H2O during 3-12 minutes. Also, they performed flexion/extension of hip and knee, active free exercises for upper limbs, ambulation exercise and ascent/descend of stairs</description>
