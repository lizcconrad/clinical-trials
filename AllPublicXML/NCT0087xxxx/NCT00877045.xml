      This is a retrospective medical record abstraction to evaluate the patterns of care for
      Gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST) in the community setting. Patient demographics and
      characteristics along with the treatments received will be described. Investigators will
      establish the percentage of patients who undergo surgery, the percentage of patients who are
      treated with kinase inhibitors as well as in what setting (adjuvant or metastatic) as well as
      the duration of therapy. Physician information will also be collected to assess for
      differences in treatment based on physician or geographical differences.
