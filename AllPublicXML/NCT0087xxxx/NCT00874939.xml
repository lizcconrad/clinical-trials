  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate acute symptomatic improvements in cognitive performance in healthy
      elderly participants with mild-to-moderate Alzheimer's disease. A four-week pilot study will
      first evaluate the CogState computerized cognitive battery in participants who are not
      receiving treatment. After completion of the pilot study, participants will be randomized to
      receive Placebo, Donepezil 5 mg, MK-0249 7.5 mg, and MK-0249 25 mg. After each drug
      administration the participants will be given the CogState computerized cognitive battery to
      assess cognitive performance. The primary hypotheses are that cognitive performance in
      participants with Alzheimer's disease, or in healthy participants, is improved by the
      administration of a single oral 5 mg dose of Donepezil as compared to placebo.

    <description>The GMLT measures executive function and spatial problem solving on a computer touch screen where participants learn a hidden pathway through a maze consisting of a 10 x 10 grid of tiles. The number of errors made for five consecutive trials at a single session is totaled, where lower number of errors indicates better performance. A change from baseline that is positive indicates improved function.</description>
