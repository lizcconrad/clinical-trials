  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study it will be investigated if patients with atopic dermatitis responding to EPOGAM
      treatment, show a significant increase of dihomo-gamma-linolic acid in the blood.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with atopic dermatitis will receive EPOGAM 1000 for 12 weeks. Clinical symptoms of
      the disease will be assessed using the SCORAD score. Dihomo-gamma-linolic acid levels in the
      blood will be measured with GC-MS.
