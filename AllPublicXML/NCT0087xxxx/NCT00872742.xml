  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will test the effectiveness of a new behavioral therapy for adults with
      trichotillomania (compulsive hair pulling).
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Trichotillomania (TTM) is a disorder in which people compulsively pull out their own hair.
      Treatments for TTM sometimes do not have long-term effectiveness. Acceptance and commitment
      therapy (ACT) is a therapeutic approach thought to have longer lasting effects than standard
      cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) approaches, because ACT focuses on accepting thoughts and
      behaviors as opposed to changing them. Previous research indicates that a combination of ACT
      and habit reversal behavioral therapy is more effective than no treatment. This study will
      test whether a combination of ACT and behavioral therapy, called acceptance enhanced
      behavioral therapy (AEBT), is more effective than the current standard treatment for TTM.

      Participation in this study will last 12 weeks, and follow-up assessments will last for 6
      months. At study entry, participants will complete a brief intelligence test and an in-person
      interview about their medical history, psychiatric history, and hair pulling. At their second
      visit, participants will have digital pictures taken of their hair-pulling sites and complete
      two computer tasks measuring their response inhibition and cognitive flexibility. After the
      second visit, participants will be randomly assigned to receive either AEBT or
      psychoeducation and supportive therapy (PST)â€”a standard treatment for TTM. Both treatments
      will involve ten 1-hour sessions completed over 12 weeks. Assessments of participants will
      occur after 6 weeks of treatment, at treatment completion, and after 6 months. These
      assessments will measure treatment effectiveness, based on several clinical scales and
      measures of TTM symptoms. Participants who receive PST during this study will be offered AEBT
      afterward.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Current DSM-IV diagnosis of trichotillomania

          -  Massachusetts General Hospital Hair Scale score greater than 12

          -  Wechsler Test of Adult Reading score greater than 85

          -  Fluent in English

          -  Outpatient status

             on him or her

          -  Individuals who eat their hair after pulling will be eligible for participation only
             after they have received a physical exam from their primary care physician to
             determine whether there is any gastrointestinal blockage due to hair pulling, which
             would require more immediate clinical care.
