      This trial will evaluate the use of a tetravalent vaccine against dengue.

      Primary objectives:

        -  To describe the immune response to dengue before and after each vaccination with
           tetravalent dengue vaccine in adults, adolescents, and children.

        -  To evaluate the safety of each vaccination with sanofi pasteur's tetravalent dengue
           vaccine in 4 age cohorts.

        -  To evaluate the persistence of antibodies against dengue during 5 years after the first
           vaccination with sanofi pasteur's tetravalent dengue vaccine in the four age cohorts.
