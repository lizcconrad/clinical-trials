  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to monitor the performance and compare the metal ion release of
      two bearing combinations, ceramic-on-metal and metal-on-metal in the treatment of patients
      with hip joint disease requiring a total hip replacement. Patients who enter the study will
      be randomly allocated to one of the bearing combinations and will be evaluated at regular
      intervals using, patient, clinical and x-ray assessments. Patients will also have blood
      samples taken at regular intervals to allow the metal ion levels to be determined.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Skeletally mature male or female subjects, aged between 20 and 75 years inclusive at
             the time of surgery.

          -  Subjects who are able to give voluntary, written informed consent to participate in
             this investigation and from whom consent has been obtained.

          -  Subjects who, in the opinion of the Investigator, are able to understand this
             investigation co-operate with the investigational procedures and are willing to return
             to the hospital for all the required post-operative follow-ups.

          -  Subjects undergoing unilateral primary total hip replacement who are suitable for a
             cementless acetabular component and whose femoral and acetabular bone stock is
             suitable to receive implants, without the requirement for a bone graft.

          -  Subjects with radiographic evidence and primary diagnosis of non-inflammatory
             degenerative joint disease (NIDJD).

          -  Subjects with a pre-operative Harris Hip Score of less than or equal to 70 and a pain
             rating of at least moderate for the operative hip.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects who, in the opinion of the Investigator, have an existing condition, such as
             active infections, highly communicable diseases, neurological or musculoskeletal
             disorders that might affect weight-bearing and metastatic or neoplastic disease, that
             would compromise their participation and follow-up in this study.

          -  Subjects who currently have other metallic foreign bodies including trauma products
             and joint arthroplasties, unless known to be titanium alloy only.

          -  Patients who have received a total hip arthroplasty in the contralateral hip within

             hip).

          -  Subjects requiring a simultaneous bilateral hip operation.

          -  Subjects who, in the opinion of the investigator, will possibly require a separate
             joint replacement operation within the next two years, including revision operations.

          -  Subjects with an acute femoral neck fracture of the operative hip.

          -  Subjects who have undergone above knee amputation of the contralateral and/or
             ipsilateral leg.

          -  Subjects with compromised renal function.

          -  Subjects with an occupational exposure to cobalt, chromium, molybdenum, titanium or
             nickel.

          -  Subjects who have ingested medication or vitamins containing cobalt, chromium,
             molybdenum, titanium or nickel within the last 12 months, or intend to ingest such
             substances over the next 2 years.

          -  Subjects who have undergone systemic steroid therapy, excluding inhalers, in the three
             months prior to surgery.

          -  Women who are pregnant.

          -  Subjects who are prisoners, known drug or alcohol abusers or with psychological
             disorders that could affect follow-up care or treatment outcomes.

          -  Subjects who have participated in a clinical study with an investigational product in
