  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The SENSE-AF study aims to determine the performance of the OptiSense lead in sensing fine
      episodes of Atrial Tachyarrhythmia/Atrial Fibrillation (AT/AF) and rejecting Far-Field R Wave
      (FFRW). The performance of the lead will be measured as a difference in device-determined
      time in AT/AF and surface-ECG determined time in AT/AF. This measurement will be compared to
      the control group which will be randomized to receive SJM's Tendril™ RA leads.
