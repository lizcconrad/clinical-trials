  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Obesity, and its metabolic consequences - impaired fasting glucose (IFG) and diabetes, is
      highly prevalent among Arab women in Israel and the Middle East. Since life style
      modification is difficult to achieve in this population it is important to assess whether
      other modifiable risk factors can be detected. There is evidence that the homeostasis of
      vitamin D has a significant role in the eventual development of diabetes. Previous cross
      sectional studies have shown that low 25 (OH) vitamin D levels are related to glucose
      intolerance, diabetes, insulin resistance and metabolic syndrome. The study hypothesis is
      that 25(OH) vitamin D deficiency is highly prevalent among Arab women with IFG and that
      vitamin D supplementation may improve IFG and by that reduce the risk for future overt
      diabetes. Additionally, obesity is associated with a low-grade inflammation of white adipose
      tissue (WAT) resulting from chronic activation of the innate immune system. In obesity, there
      is an increased production and secretion of a wide range of inflammatory molecules including
      interleukin-10 (IL-10), which may have systemic effects on WAT and other organs. To that end
      the investigators will assess the influence of vitamin D supplementation on IL-10 and hs-CRP.

      Eligible women will be invited by their primary care physician to participate in the study.
      After signing an informed consent women will be randomized to receive oral vitamin D 100,000
      IU or similar placebo once a month for three consecutive months. Pertinent clinical and
      demographic date will be documented and relevant laboratory test will be performed by the
      primary care team. One month after the third dose the same data and tests will be retrieved
      on each woman. Compliance with the study protocol will be enhanced and confirmed by a
      research assistant.

      Objectives:

      To assess the relationship between IFG and 25(OH) vitamin D levels in overweight Arab women.

      To assess whether vitamin D supplementation significantly improves IFG. To assess whether
      vitamin D supplementation significantly modifies IL-10 and hs-CRP.
