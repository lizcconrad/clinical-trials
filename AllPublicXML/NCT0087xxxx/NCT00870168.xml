      RATIONALE: Studying biopsy samples in the laboratory from patients with cancer may help
      doctors learn more about changes that occur in DNA and identify biomarkers related to cancer.

      PURPOSE: This clinical trial is studying biopsy samples in women who are receiving first-line
      chemotherapy for metastatic breast cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Evaluate the effect of first-line chemotherapy on expression of hormone receptors and
           biomarkers in women with metastatic breast cancer.

      Secondary

        -  Assess changes in HER1 and HER2 expression during treatment.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive 6-9 courses of front-line chemotherapy according to the investigator.
      Patients with estrogen receptor- and/or progesterone receptor-positive disease receive
      hormone therapy.

      Patients undergo biopsy prior to and after completion of chemotherapy for examination of
      hormone receptors and HER1 and HER2 expression.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 6 months for 5 years.
