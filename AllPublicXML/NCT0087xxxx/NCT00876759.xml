  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Brain metastases occur in 20-40% of patients with primary extracerebral tumors. Despite
      important advances in therapy of malignant solid tumors and treatment of 1-3 brain
      metastases, multiple brain metastases continue to present a significant problem in attempting
      to prevent progression of disease and limit morbidity associated with therapy. The majority
      of patients who develop brain metastases have a short survival, effective palliation being
      transient. The median survival after diagnosis is as low as 3-6 months. However, there is
      some evidence that selected patients survive prolonged periods with vigorous therapeutic
      approach.

      Specific therapeutic options are surgery, chemotherapy, conventional fractionated whole-brain
      radiotherapy (WBRT) and radiosurgery. Radiosurgery allows delivering of a single high dose
      fraction of radiation to targets of 3-3.5 cm maximum diameter. In patients with newly
      diagnosed brain metastases, a rapid decrease of symptoms, local tumor response rate of 73-90%
      and a median survival of 7-12 month have been reported.

      WBRT alone is the treatment of choice for patients with multiple brain metastases, and for
      patients with single brain metastases not amenable to surgery or radiosurgery. Median
      survival after WBRT alone is 3-6 months.

      WBRT and radiosurgery boost have been shown to improve survival in RPA class I patients and
      in patients with favorable histological status and squamous cell or non-small cell lung
      tumors. All randomized trials showed improved local control with the addition of radiosurgery
      to WBRT (Andrews, 2004).

      WBRT in conjunction with radiosurgery improves local control and reduces the risk of new
      distant brain metastases, but most studies support that combined radiosurgery and WBRT does
      not improve the overall survival expect for patients without evidence of extracranial
      disease.

      Helical Tomotherapy (HT) allows as a sole modality a new treatment option: Using HT, the
      advantage of applying a highly conformal boost dose to the metastases and WBRT can be
      combined in one treatment session. Therefore, it allows applying a high dose to multiple
      brain metastases in the sense of an integrated boost. The focus of this study is to
      investigate the efficacy and safety of WBRT with an integrated boost using this new treatment
      modality in comparison to the effects of conventional WBRT alone.

      The principal objective of the trial is to assess the therapeutic efficacy of WBRT as
      compared to WBRT combined with integrated boost with HT delivered to patients with 2-10 brain
      metastases of solid tumors. The secondary objective is to evaluate the safety of WBRT as
      opposed to WBRT combined with integrated boost as delivered by HT in patients with 2-10 brain
      metastases.

             small cell lung cancer, germ cell tumor and lymphoma. Histological confirmation may
             have been from the primary tumor site, from another metastatic site, or from the
             metastatic brain lesion(s)

          -  4-10 brain metastases, which are radiologically proven by MRI scan. The size of each
             metastasis must be between 3 mm and 4.0 cm in the largest diameter.

             of perilesional normal brain receiving more than 4 Gy per fraction must be smaller
             than 40 ml. An evaluation of the latter criterion is strongly recommended for total
             lesions volume &gt; 20 ml prior to randomization of the patient according to figure 1. OR

          -  2-3 brain metastases, which are radiologically proven by MRI scan. The size of each
             metastasis must be between 3 mm and 4.0 cm in the largest diameter.
             Contrast-enhancements on MRI which are smaller than 3 mm in diameter are not
             considered. The patient should not be considered as a good candidate for stereotactic
             radiosurgery +/- whole brain radiotherapy.

          -  Each lesion has a distance of its margin to the chiasma opticum or the optic nerves of
             &gt; 5 mm.

             guidelines.

          -  Hemoglobin &gt; 8 g/dl. If anemia is present to the extent that the hemoglobin is less
             than 8 g/dl then correction by transfusion and/or erythropoietin is indicated before
             entry into the study according to institutional guidelines.

          -  Before patient registration, written informed consent must be given according to
             ICH/GCP and national regulations.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Lesions located in the medulla oblongata or in the brainstem.

          -  Leptomeningeal metastases or meningosis carcinomatosa. If meningosis carcinomatosa is

             to a beta-HCG pregnancy test if the possibility of pregnancy is believed to exist.
             Women and men of child bearing potential who are admitted to the trial will be advised
             that the treatment received may be teratogenic and are advised to take adequate
