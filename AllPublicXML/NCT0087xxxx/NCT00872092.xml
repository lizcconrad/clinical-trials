    <textblock>
      Normally the gastrointestinal tract is only sparsely colonized with bacteria. The normal
      flora of the duodenal or jejunal aspirate contains no more than 10^5 bacteria per milliliter.
      Small bowel bacterial overgrowth (SBBO) is defined as a pathologically increased number of
      bacteria or the presence of colonic flora in the proximal intestine. The reasons for this
      condition are manifold, ranging from diabetic neuropathy to surgical bypass. SBBO is frequent
      in elderly people. Therapy is targeted at correcting the underlying small bowel abnormalities
      that predispose to the condition and at providing appropriate antibiotic therapy. The
      symptoms and signs of SBBO can be reversed with this approach. However, in many patients the
      conditions predisposing to SBBO persist life-long, once present. This suggests that
      noninvasive, sensitive diagnostic tools with high specificity are required. Bacterial culture
      of upper intestinal content is considered the diagnostic gold standard. However, since
      endoscopic harvesting of duodenal or jejunal fluid is difficult and invasive, indirect tests
      such as breath tests have been advocated as diagnostic tools. Hydrogen breath tests are
      commonly employed since the substrates can be easily obtained and the measurement is simple.
      Hydrogen is formed when carbohydrates are fermented in the intestine. Breath hydrogen
      analysis allows a separation of metabolic activity of the intestinal flora from that of the
      host, since no known hydrogen production occurs in mammalian tissue. The hydrogen breath test
      most often used in routine clinical practice uses glucose. However, the utility of this test
      is mostly limited by its low sensitivity, because there are &quot;nonproducers&quot; in up to 25% of
      the subjects tested. The investigators have developed a stable isotope breath test using
      13C-labeled lactose-ureide. Glycosyl-ureides are condensation products of reducing sugars and
      urea in aqueous acid. Lactose-[13C]ureide has been used to investigate oro-caecal transit
      time because it resists digestion by small intestinal enzymes and is hydrolyzed by bacterial
      enzymes in the large intestine. A number of studies have described the use of this substrate
      in adults and children. The aim of the present study was to investigate the
      lactose-[13C]ureide breath test in subjects with suspected SBBO and to compare its results
      with the results of the glucose hydrogen breath test. Microbiological analyses of upper
      intestinal bacterial cultures were used as gold standard to identify SBBO.
