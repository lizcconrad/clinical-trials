  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research study is to determine if the insertion site of a perineural catheter or tiny
      tube placed next to the nerves that go to the part of the body (hand or arm) having surgery,
      affects the amount of pain relief that is experienced after surgery. Catheters will be placed
      in either the supraclavicular or infraclavicular location.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      To determine if a particular perineural local anesthetic catheter location (supraclavicular
      or infraclavicular) will maximize postoperative analgesia, minimize oral opioid requirements,
      minimize sleep disturbances resulting from postoperative pain, and maximize patient
      satisfaction.

    <description>Patients will be randomized to one of two groups: nerve blocks in the supraclavicular location or the infraclavicular location. Following surgery the patient will be called by study staff to assess pain scores, sleep disturbances, infusion side effects, feeling in fingers and other study outcomes.</description>
