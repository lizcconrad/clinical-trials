  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Dual antiplatelet therapy with aspirin and thienopyridines decreases the rate of stent
      thrombosis in patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). However, despite
      intensified antiplatelet treatment, some of the patients undergoing PCI develop thrombotic
      stent occlusion, suggesting incomplete platelet inhibition due to thienopyridine resistance.
      The present study is designed in order to clarify the influence of CYP2C19 genetic
      polymorphism on the several biomarkers for platelet activation in Japanese patients treated
      with thienopyridines undergoing elective PCI.

      We enrolled patients with stable effort angina who received dual-antiplatelet therapy with
      both aspirin (100mg) and clopidogrel (75mg). We performed PCI 12-24 hours after 300mg loading
      dose of clopidogrel, or at least 7 days of 75mg clopidogrel treatment after 300mg initial
      loading dose. We examined platelet adhesiveness, plasma biomarkers for platelet activation
      such as plasma VWF and ADAMTS13, CD40L, P-Selectin levels, and ADP-induced platelet
      aggregation using Light transmittance aggregometry (LTA) and VerifyNow P2Y12 assay system in
      those patients. We also analyzed the CYP2C19 genetic polymorphism to examine the influence of
      this genetic variation on the several biomarkers for platelet activation.
