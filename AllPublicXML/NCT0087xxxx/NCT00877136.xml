  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an interdisciplinary study that falls into the Humanitarian Use Device category.
      There are no hypotheses to be tested in this treatment protocol. The study has the following
      objectives:

        1. Provide supervised access to treatment with TheraSphere® to eligible patients with
           primary cancer to the liver who are not surgical resection candidates.

        2. Evaluate patient experience and toxicities associated with TheraSphere® treatment.

        3. Measure tumor response rates

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this protocol is to provide supervised access at this institution to
      TheraSphere® treatment for a heterogeneous population of patients with unresectable primary
      liver tumors, with the liver being the only dominant site of disease. Based on experience
      gained in previous studies and well-established interventional radiology techniques, this
      protocol allows multiple treatments with TheraSphere® that may be delivered on an inpatient
      or out patient basis. Patients may receive a single dose to the whole liver, or lobar
      treatment delivered as a sequence of treatments approximately 30 - 90 days apart. The
      investigator, working with co-investigators in radiation oncology, interventional radiology
      and nuclear medicine, will develop a specific treatment plan for each patient, based upon the
      presenting condition of the patient, the vascular anatomy, and the desired goal of treatment.

    <description>TheraSphere® consists of insoluble glass microspheres where yttrium-90 is an integral constituent of the glass. TheraSphere® is delivered into the liver tumor through a catheter placed into the hepatic artery. This artery provides the main blood supply to the tumor in the liver. TheraSphere® being unable to traverse the tumor vasculature is embolized within the tumor and exerts a local beta radiation radiotherapeutic effect with relatively limited concurrent injury to surrounding normal tissue.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Confirmed diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma. The histopathology confirmation
             criterion may be waived in patients with a radiographically identifiable liver mass
             with known laboratory or clinical risk factors for cancer or elevated tumor markers
             such as AFP (clinical diagnosis)

          -  Surgical evaluation must conclude the patient is not a candidate for resection or
             ablation.

          -  ECOG Performance Status Score 0 - 2.

          -  Age 18 years or older.

          -  Able to comprehend and provide written informed consent in accordance with
             institutional and federal guidelines.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Any pre-treatment laboratory findings within 15 days of treatment demonstrating:

          -  Absolute granulocyte count less than or equal to 1,500/ul

          -  Uncorrected Platelet count less than or equal to 75,000/ul

          -  Serum creatinine greater than or equal to 3.0 mg/dl

          -  Serum bilirubin greater than or equal to 2.0 mg/dl

          -  Any of the following contraindications to angiography and selective visceral
             catheterization, 1.)History of severe allergy or intolerance to any contrast media,
             narcotics, sedatives, or atropine, 2.) Bleeding diathesis, not correctable by usual
             forms of therapy, and/or 3.) Severe peripheral vascular disease that would preclude
             catheterization.

          -  Portal hypertension with portal venous shunt away from the liver.

          -  Evidence of potential delivery of greater than 16.5 mCi (30 Gy absorbed dose) of
             radiation to the lungs on either: 1) first TheraSphere® administration; or 2)
             cumulative delivery of radiation to the lungs &gt; 30 Gy over multiple treatments.

          -  Evidence of any detectable Tc-99m MAA flow to the stomach or duodenum, after
             application of established angiographic techniques to stop such flow.
