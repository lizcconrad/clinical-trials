      The purpose of this study is to compare the mydriatic effect of 2.5% phenylephrine and 1%
      tropicamide by conventional instillation and lower conjunctival fornix packing in premature
      infants.

    <textblock>
      Adequate pupil dilatation was needed for screening and treatment of retinopathy of
      prematurity (ROP) in premature infants.In general clinical practice, mydriatic drugs were
      instilled many times until the pupil reached the maximum size. However, poor mydriasis were
      found in many eyes despite maximum instillation was used. From the clinical observation, we
      found the packing of mydriatic drugs in lower conjunctival fornix was much more effective to
      dilate the pupil than instillation in some patients. The purpose of this study was to compare
      the mydriatic effect of 2.5% phenylephrine and 1% tropicamide by conventional instillation
      and lower conjunctival fornix packing in premature infants.
