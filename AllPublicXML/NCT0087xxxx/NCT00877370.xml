  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Critically ill patients in the intensive care unit often receive continuous hemodialysis to
      treat their kidney failure. Ertapenem is an antibiotic often used in these patients.
      Continuous dialysis may remove ertapenem, putting patients at risk for inappropriate
      treatment of their infection. This study will determine how much ertapenem is removed by
      continuous hemodialysis.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Subjects receiving CVVHD will receive a one gram dose of ertapenem. Serial blood samples over
      24 hours will be taken to assess the ertapenem blood concentrations over time. Spent
      dialysate and urine samples (if any) will also be measured for ertapenem content to determine
      how much drug is removed by CVVHD and kidneys. A pharmacokinetic evaluation will be made to
      determine what is the most appropriate dose for this drug in patients receiving CVVHD to
      achieve pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic goals.

    <description>One gram ertapenem will be infused intravenously in subjects receiving continuous hemodialysis (CVVHD). Pharmacokinetic sampling in this study will occur with the first dose of ertapenem. While on CVVHD, enrolled subjects will receive ertapenem 1 g intravenously administered over 30 minutes. Two blood samples (5 mL each) will be collected from the arterial (pre-diafilter) port of the CVVHD tubing at time 0 (baseline), ½ hour (end of infusion), 1, 1½, 2, 3, 6, 12, and 24 hours. Effluent (5 mL) will also be collected at these predefined time points from the effluent port of the CVVHD tubing. If ertapenem is discontinued after the first dose then additional samples will be collected at 36 and 48 hours, otherwise ertapenem will be administered as soon as the 24 hour sample is obtained.</description>
