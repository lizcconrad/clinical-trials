  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study has been designed to investigate the pharmacokinetic and safety profile of the
      co-administration of intravenous (IV) and transdermal granisetron, as well as characterise
      the pharmacokinetics of multiple transdermal dosing.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Sancuso® is designed to provide antiemetic prophylaxis for chemotherapy of up to 5 days
      duration. In exceptional clinical situations in which the patch is not applied at the
      appropriate time (i.e. 24-48 hours pre-chemotherapy), clinicians might use a single IV dose
      of granisetron to provide prophylaxis while the granisetron from the patch reaches a
      therapeutic plasma concentration.

      Most chemotherapeutics are dosed in a single day, with a 2- or 3-week interval between doses;
      however, several regimens are administered over more than 5 days and others are given at
      frequencies (e.g. every 5 days). Thus, more than one patch may be required to provide
      continuous antiemetic prophylaxis. Characterisation of the pharmacokinetics of multiple
      transdermal dosing offers useful information for clinicians who treat patients with the
      latter types of regimens.

    <description>Subjects will receive 1 Sancuso® patch worn for 7 days (168 hours). Immediately after the patch has been applied on Day 1, IV granisetron will be administered over 30 seconds. Following patch removal at 168 hours, a new patch will be immediately applied to the opposite arm and will remain in place for a further 7 days (168 to 336 hours).</description>

Kytril® (granisetron hydrochloride) 1 mg/mL; IV; 0.01 mg/kg (maximum 1 mg) administered over 30 seconds immediately following patch application on Day 1 only.</description>
