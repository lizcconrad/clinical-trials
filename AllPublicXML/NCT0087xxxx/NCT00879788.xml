      A single oral dose of ramipril 10 mg capsule was administered with 240 mL of drinking water
      at ambient temperature 30 minutes after start of a high-fat high-caloric breakfast under the
      supervision of trained study personnel.

      A total of thirty-two (32) subjects were randomized to receive a single oral dose of the test
      (T) and reference (R) formulation of ramipril 10 mg capsule. One subject (subject No. 18) was
      withdrawn and one dropped out (subject No. 10) from the study in period I. One subject
      (subject No. 20) dropped out and two subjects were withdrawn (subject No. 27, 29) from the
      study in period II.

      A total of twenty-seven (27) subjects completed both the periods of the study.
