  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Currently, there are few effective treatments for the following aggressive brain tumors:
      glioblastoma multiforme, anaplastic astrocytoma, gliomatosis cerebri, gliosarcoma, or
      brainstem glioma. Surgery and radiation can generally slow down these aggressive brain
      tumors, but in the majority of patients, these tumors will start growing again in 6-12
      months. Adding chemotherapy drugs to surgery and radiation does not clearly improve the cure
      rate of children with malignant gliomas.

      The investigators are conducting this study to see if the combination of valproic acid and
      bevacizumab (also known as AvastinTM) with surgery and radiation will shrink these brain
      tumors more effectively and improve the chance of cure.

      With the exception of patients with brainstem gliomas, all patients should have the maximal
      surgical resection that can be safely performed prior to study entry. Submission of frozen
      tumor is strongly encouraged. After recovery from neurosurgery, all patients will start
      valproic acid and radiation therapy.

      Valproic Acid (VPA): VPA will be started at 15 mg/kg/day divided into three doses a day,
      ideally 48 hours prior to first day of radiation therapy, but no later than the first day of
      radiation therapy. Patients may also begin VPA sooner if they have post-operative seizures
      and require an anti-convulsant.

      Radiation Phase: Radiation therapy should begin within 30 days of definitive surgery or
      radiographic diagnosis, whichever is the later date. Date of surgery or radiographic
      diagnosis is considered day 1, and radiation should start no later than day 31. VPA will be
      continued daily without interruption during radiation therapy. VPA doses will be adjusted in
      increments of 5 mg/kg/day every 3-5 days to achieve and maintain trough concentrations
      between 85 to 115 mcg/ml. During this time patients will receive standard radiation therapy.

      Post Radiation Phase: Patients will continue to receive VPA as during radiation. If
      necessary, patients who had delays in radiation (e.g., secondary to schedule holidays or the
      need to have a new mask made) will complete their radiotherapy to the total prescribed
      protocol dose.

      Maintenance Phase: Maintenance therapy will begin 4 weeks after completion of radiation or
      week 11, whichever comes first.

      Patients will continue VPA daily during maintenance therapy. All patients will start
      bevacizumab, 10 mg/kg by vein every two weeks, at the start of maintenance therapy.
      Maintenance therapy will continue uninterrupted if all laboratory tests continue to meet
      on-study criteria. In the absence of unacceptable toxicity or disease progression, patients
      will continue to receive protocol treatment for a maximum total duration of two years
      (including the radiation phase).

             formula for estimating GFR (Schwartz et al. J. Peds, 106:522, 1985) utilizing child
             length and stature data published by the CDC.

             CNS hemorrhage. Patients with intra-tumoral and/or CNS hemorrhage are eligible for
             study entry if they fulfill the following guidelines:

               -  Patients with an asymptomatic intra-tumoral/intracranial hemorrhage measuring
                  less than 1 cm in the widest dimension on MRI at the time of diagnosis, after
                  surgery, and/or any time prior to study enrollment, are eligible; hemorrhage must
                  not have progressed on MRI prior to initiation of protocol therapy; patients mut
                  not have developed progressive symptoms thought to be related to the
                  intra-tumoral/intracranial hemorrhage prior to initiation of protocol therapy.

               -  Patients with a greater than 1 asymptomatic intra-tumoral/intracranial hemorrhage
                  but all measuring less than 1 cm in the widest dimension on MRI are eligible if
                  they fulfill the guidelines described above.

               -  Patients with asymptomatic post-operative hemorrhage in and/or around the

                  guidelines described above.

               -  Patients with an intra-tumoral hemorrhage greater than 1 cm at diagnosis but who
                  demonstrate minimal post-operative hemorrhage as described above after tumor
                  resection are eligible for study.

         11. Patients must begin radiation therapy within 30 days of surgery or radiographic
             diagnosis, whichever is the later date.

         12. All patients and/or their legal guardians must sign a written informed consent.

             not eligible.

         14. Patients with any clinically significant systemic illness, including serious
             infection, pulmonary, hepatic, or other organ impairment, that would compromise
             tolerance and/or timely completion of protocol therapy.

        16. Patients who, in the opinion of the investigator, may not be able to comply with the
        safety monitoring requirements and/or follow-up studies of this trial.
