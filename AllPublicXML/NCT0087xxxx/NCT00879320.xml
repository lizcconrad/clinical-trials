      The purpose of this study is to understand the relationship between ADHD and the overall
      health of someone with ADHD. People who have ADHD have trouble paying attention,
      concentrating, organizing, and planning. They may have trouble in school, at work, and at
      home. The investigators are interested in finding out whether these difficulties have had any
      influence in the past, current, or future health problems of someone with ADHD. About 100
      people with ADHD and 100 people without ADHD will take part in this research study, all
      through Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH).
