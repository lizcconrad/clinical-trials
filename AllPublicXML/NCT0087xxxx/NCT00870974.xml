    <textblock>
      Measurement of metabotropic glutamate receptor type 5 (mGluR5) binding capacity in the brain,
      may be a valuable tool in the early detection, understanding, or evaluation of Parkinson
      disease (PD), Huntington disease (HD), Fragile X syndrome (FXS), Autism Spectrum
      Disorder(ASD), Alzheimer's Disease(AD), and subjects with mild cognitive impairment (MCI).

      The goal of this study is to assess [18F]F-PEB positron emission tomography (PET) imaging as
      a tool to detect mGluR5 density in the brain of PD, HD, FXS ASD, AD, and MCI research
      participants and similarly aged healthy subjects.

      Informed consent will be obtained for all subjects. All subjects will undergo a screening
      evaluation including baseline clinical laboratory testing, a baseline physical and
      neurological evaluation and baseline cognitive evaluations. All subjects will undergo
      [18F]F-PEB PET imaging. Subjects may also be asked to undergo standard brain MRI to assist in
      the analysis of the PET images obtained.

        Written informed consent must be obtained For all females of child-bearing potential, a
        negative urine or blood pregnancy test on day of [18F]PEB injection.

        INCLUSION CRITERIA:

        PD subjects:

          -  Age 30 years or older.

          -  Clinical diagnosis of PD with at least two of three of the cardinal symptoms of PD
             (rest tremor, rigidity, bradykinesia)

          -  Hoehn and Yahr[35] ≤ 4.

        HD subjects:

          -  Age 18 years or older.

          -  Participants have a clinical diagnosis of symptomatic HD with genetic confirmation

          -  Subject is able to provide informed consent as judged by the investigator, or assent
             can be obtained from the subject and informed consent provided by the appropriate
             legal representative or next of kin.

        Healthy volunteers should be 18 years of age or older and have a negative history of
        neurological or psychiatric illness.

        ASD and/or FRAGILE X:

          -  Age 18 years or older

          -  Clinical diagnosis of ASD and/or FXS

          -  Diagnosis of FXS based on gene testing or diagnosis of ASD based on DSM-IV criteria

        AD subjects:

          -  Participants have a positive assessment for dementia of Alzheimer type in accordance
             with the DSM-IV-TR and probable AD according to the NINCDS-ADRDA criteria.

          -  Participants do not fulfill the ICC criteria for probable DLB, the NINDS-AIREN for
             probable vascular dementia, or the Neary criteria for FTD.

          -  CDR score of 0.5, 1 or 2.

        MCI subjects:

          -  Participants must have a complaint of memory loss, objective impairment in at least
             one cognitive domain, essentially preserved activities of daily living, and do not
             meet diagnostic criteria for AD or other form of dementia. Participants do not fulfill

          -  The subject has clinically significant abnormal laboratory value and/or clinically
             significant unstable medical or psychiatric illness

          -  The subject has any disorder that may interfere with drug absorption distribution,
             metabolism, or excretion (including significant gastrointestinal surgery).

          -  The subject has evidence of clinically significant gastrointestinal, cardiovascular,
