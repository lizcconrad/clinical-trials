  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This will be a retrospective review of 30 patients with unknown primary cancer who have had
      commercially available RT-PCR assays performed on biopsied tumors, in order to determine if
      the assay results are consistent with clinical features and useful for planning initial
      therapy or changing therapy.

        Approximately 30 patients at Tennessee Oncology with unknown primary cancer have had
        commercially available RT-PCR assays done on their tissue biopsy since the assay became
        available in 2007. These patients are the subjects of this review.
