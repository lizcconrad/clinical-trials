  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The prevalence of airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR) is very high in elite swimmers, reaching
      80% in certain studies. Repeated Chlorine-derivatives exposure may be a major causative
      factor for its development. Asthma diagnosis is generally made on the basis of clinical
      characteristics. The demonstration of a variable bronchial obstruction through positive
      expiratory flow reversibility to a bronchodilator, spontaneous variations of airway
      obstruction or a positive provocation test (methacholine, eucapnic voluntary hyperpnoea…) is
      necessary to avoid false diagnosis. Currently asthma treatment in swimmers is the same as in
      the general population. A short-acting bronchodilator is often prescribed to avoid occasional
      symptoms, combined with an inhaled corticosteroid or an antagonist of Leukotriene if asthma
      symptoms are persistent. Previous studies have shown a reduced efficiency for asthma
      medication in elite athletes compared with non-athletes. The specific response to different
      medications remains to be studied in athletes. The effects of a short-acting bronchodilator
      in swimmers with AHR, especially when asymptomatic, on pulmonary function and performance
      have not yet been studied. Moreover, the significance of a positive bronchial provocation
      test remains to be studied in asymptomatic swimmers with AHR.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Our hypothesis is that swimmers with a positive bronchial provocation challenge have not
      necessarily an exercise-induced bronchoconstriction during swimming and the use of a
      bronchodilator will be unnecessary. Chlorine-derivatives exposure may be responsible for a
      weakness of the epithelium layer but warm and humid atmosphere of the swimming-pools may be
      protective for the development of a bronchoconstriction. Thus we also hypothesis that during
      a field test outside the swimming pool, swimmers will develop an exercise-induced asthma, and
      will need to take a bronchodilator in prevention.
