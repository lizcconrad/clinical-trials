      The aim of this study was to investigate the buffering effect of a calcium
      glycerophosphate-fluoride (CaGP-F) dentifrice on in vivo dental biofilm after a cariogenic
      challenge and evaluate its probable 12-hour protective effect. Twelve young adults took part
      in this randomized, double blind, 14-day 4-phase crossover study. Between each phase, the
      volunteers had a 1-week wash-out period. Coded dentifrices were randomly assigned to the
      volunteers: A) no F and no CaGP; B) CaGP-only (0.13%); C) F-only (1500 ppm (ppm= parts per
      million of fluoride which is equivalent to mg/kg)); D) CaGP-F (0.13%, 1500 ppm,
      respectively). The pH measurements were taken from a single-site using a microelectrode, with
      salt bridge established by a 1M KCl (one molar potassium chloride) solution with a reference
      electrode. pH measurements were taken at 0 (baseline), 1, 7, 14 and 21 min (minutes) after a
      cariogenic challenge (10% w/v sucrose solution, %w/v = percent weight per volume). Four sets
      of measurements were carried out: (D0BS) before test dentifrice usage; (D01min) 1-min after
      test dentifrice usage; and (D712h) 7 days and (D1412h) 14 days using the test dentifrice, 12
      hours (h)after brushing. Stephen curves and mean AUC (area under the curve) were obtained.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Although the mechanisms of action of fluoride are reasonably understood, the mechanism of
      calcium phosphate and calcium glycerophosphate (CaGP) are still a matter of debate. It has
      been suggested that CaGP increases the phosphorus content in the biofilm and, as a result,
      the buffering capacity of the biofilm is intensified. The pH levels of the biofilm are
      maintained above the 5.0-5.5 range. This is above the critical range for enamel
      demineralization.

          <description>The study was based on the use of dentifrices for daily oral hygiene in a crossover design. The volunteers were asked to use the placebo and test dentifrices for one week. During the study, the volunteers were instructed to brush their teeth normally until 3 days before the measurements. During these 3 days, they were instructed to brush only the occlusal surfaces of their teeth until 12 hours before the pH measurements, when they should stop brushing altogether for dental plaque pH evaluation.</description>

        <title>Minimum pH</title>
        <description>The dental biofilm pH was measured in vivo with the microtouch method, using a palladium microelectrode + reference electrode. Data represents the mean values of the lowest pH observed each time after the use of sucrose.</description>

        <population>The number of subjects were determined by a pilot study carried out in 3 volunteers. The study has a crossover design. Thus the 4 groups of dentifrices tested included the same subjects in a different time-measurement avoiding the influence of individual variables in the analysis.</population>

            <description>intervention of using a dentifrice of no active ingredient. The volunteers were asked to use the placebo dentifrices for one week. Throughout the study, the volunteers were instructed to brush their teeth normally up until 3 days before the measurements. During these 3 days, they were instructed to brush only the occlusal surfaces of their teeth until 12 hours before the pH measurements, when they should stop brushing altogether for dental plaque pH evaluation.</description>
