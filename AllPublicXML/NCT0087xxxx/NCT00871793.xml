    <textblock>
      Supracondylar humerus fracture are common upper extremity injuries in children accounting for
      over 400 fractures per year and approximately 25% of all fractures treated at Seattle
      Children's Emergency Department. Most of these fractures are treated with splints and casts
      though more than one-third undergo surgical fixation followed by casting. Healing is usually
      complete after 3-4 weeks, when casts (and pins, if fixed operatively) are removed and motion
      begun. Though stiffness is often a problem after immobilization of adult elbow fractures,
      stiffness after pediatric elbow fractures is regarded as typically transient. This study
      addresses the question &quot;Does early motion of the arm with physiotherapy promote the return of
      function and motion in patients with supracondylar humerus fractures?&quot; The investigators will
      conduct a prospective randomized trial to determine the effect of six occupational therapy
      visits over a five week period of time on elbow function and mobility after supracondylar
      humerus fracture. The investigators will measure motion of the elbow and administer the child
      and parental Activity Scale for Kids performance versions (ASKp) assessment tool to answer
      this question.
