  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      When patients with chronic obstructive lung disease (COPD) are admitted to the hospital with
      a severe exacerbation they lose muscle strength. This muscle weakness predisposes these
      patients to further hospital admissions. Resistance training is a potent countermeasure to
      prevent and treat muscle weakness. In the setting of an acute exacerbation this intervention
      however has not been validated.

      The present study aims at investigating the safety and efficacy of resistance training (3x8
      quadriceps extensions per day) to prevent muscle weakness. End points are quadriceps muscle
      strength and hospital readmission and functional status at discharge. Using the minimally
      invasive needle muscle biopsy technique described by Bergstr√∂m the effects of resistance
      training on the skeletal muscle will be analyzed in detail.

      After giving informed consent, patients will be randomized on admission into usual care or
      usual care plus resistance training. Patients will be followed-up using the clinical pathway
      for COPD (10 days). After one month patients will attend the outpatient clinic for a
      follow-up visit. Besides the measurement prescribed in the clinical path for COPD (including
      arterial blood gas measures, lung function, functional investigation of the patients),
      patients will undergo muscle strength measures and venous blood will be drawn for the
      analysis of systemic inflammatory and growth factors. Half of the patients will receive a
      resistance training program. At the end of the hospital admission, a needle biopsy of the
      vastus lateralis muscle will be obtained.
