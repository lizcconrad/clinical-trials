  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigator(s) hypothesize that Rituximab together with combination chemotherapy,
      followed by Rituximab maintenance therapy, will provide better disease control with improved
      response rates and overall survival in patients with previously untreated Mantle Cell
      Lymphoma (MCL).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase 2 study of Rituximab in combination with Methotrexate, Doxorubicin,
      Cyclophosphamide, Leucovorin, Vincristine, Ifosfamide, Etoposide, Cytarabine and Mesna
      (R-MACLO/IVAM) in subjects with previously untreated Mantle Cell Lymphoma (MCL). Treatment
      will consist of up to 4 cycles of therapy. Response assessment by CT and PET scans will be
      performed post Cycle 2. Once the final cycle of therapy is completed, response evaluation
      will be performed based on pre-study CT scans, PET/ Scan/endoscopy or any staging scans that
      were positive at baseline. (PI approval required if treating with less than 4 cycles).

      Subjects in complete remission will be given Rituximab per institution guidelines, as 4
      weekly doses every 6 months for a total of 3 years, or until progression of disease, or if
      the subject is unable to tolerate further treatment. Rituximab should begin 6 months from
      date of discharge +/- 21 days. Maintenance therapy, premedications can be changed based on
      clinical consideration from treating physician. Timelines for giving premedications are given
      per institutional guidelines. Subject may be discharged after administration of Rituximab,
      once stable.
