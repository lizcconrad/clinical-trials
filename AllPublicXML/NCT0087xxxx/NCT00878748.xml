      This primary purpose of this study is to assess the efficacy and safety of Effexor XR in
      preventing recurrence in Chinese patients with recurrent major depressive disorder (MDD)
      following a 1-year maintenance treatment after an 8-week acute treatment and a 6-month
      continuation treatment phases. The study will also collect data on the prevalence and pattern
      of co-morbid anxiety and somatic symptoms and their impact on the recurrence of depression.
