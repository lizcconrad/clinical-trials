      LO5 study: The investigators are inviting a new group of youth (ages 7-16) who have been
      recently diagnosed with type 1 diabetes and their non-diabetic siblings. These youth will
      complete cognitive tests and a MRI scan of the brain. This scan uses strong magnets to obtain
      pictures and does not involve any radiation or injections. The investigators will recruit
      patients within three months of their diagnosis date. The study entails 1 study visit that
      lasts 3.5 hours. Evening and weekend times are available. The investigators plan to enroll
      135 participants.

      HY5 study: The investigators are inviting a cohort of youth and young adults (ages 9-21) with
      type 1 diabetes and their non-diabetic siblings for a follow-up to a study they have already
      completed. This group of people will complete several memory and thinking tests along with
      several MRI scans of their brain, just as they did at their previous visits. The
      investigators plan to enroll 150 participants.
