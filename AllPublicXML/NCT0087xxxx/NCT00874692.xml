  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the impact of a passive safety measure, namely a
      reduction in centrally controlled hot tap water temperatures in social housing using a boiler
      management system, as an effective public health intervention.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The annual hospital admission rate in England for burns and scalds is 31 children per 100,000
      population. While reducing the temperature in domestic hot water tanks is a recommended
      injury prevention strategy, the UK has been slow to adopt such 'passive' safety measures.
      However, Camden Council employs a Boiler Management System (BMS) in boiler houses to
      centrally set the hot water temperature for parts of its social housing stock, providing the
      opportunity to evaluate various impacts of a 'passive' safety measure, including quantifying
      the effects of the BMS on average hot water temperatures at delivery, annual energy costs,
      and annual greenhouse gas emissions; modelling the reduction in scald injuries; identifying
      the cost-effectiveness of the system as a public health intervention; as well as describing
      experiences/ perceptions of risk of scalding and identifying health and social benefits of
      the BMS. Boiler houses with BMS will be randomised to remain at their constant set
      temperature or to BMS reduced temperature and sterilisation programme. A process evaluation
      will also be undertaken to assess the acceptability of water temperatures to tenants.
