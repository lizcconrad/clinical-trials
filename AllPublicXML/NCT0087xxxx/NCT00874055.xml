  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Participants will be matched with either their friend or an unfamiliar peer who is the same
      gender and about the same age. Participants will have 45 minutes of free-play in an
      experimental room where they will have free access to energy-dense and nutrient-dense foods
      and an assortment of games and puzzles.

      The investigators predict that participants eating with a friend will eat significantly more
      than participants eating with an unfamiliar peer. The investigators also predict that
      overweight participants eating with an overweight partner will eat significantly more than
      participants eating with a non overweight participant.
