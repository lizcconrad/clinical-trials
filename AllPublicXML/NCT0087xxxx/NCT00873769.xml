  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this trial was to assess the pharmacokinetics of a single dose of 10 mg
      Staccato Loxapine administered to smokers compared to nonsmokers.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Pharmacokinetics and sedation pharmacodynamics were studied using a visual analog scale were
      studied in male and female adult subjects (nonsmokers and smokers) following a single dose of
      10 mg of inhaled loxapine. Blood samples were drawn at predose, 30 seconds, 1, 2, 3, 10, 30,
      and 60 minutes, and 2, 6, 12, and 24 hours after dosing. Loxapine and 8-OH-loxapine were
      analyzed using reverse-phase liquid chromatography coupled with a tandem mass spectrometer.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Normal spirometry at screening and in good general health as determined by a complete

          -  Any other disease or condition, by history, physical examination, or laboratory
             abnormalities that would present undue risk to the subject, or may confound the
