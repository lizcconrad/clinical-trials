  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is being done to see if most patients are willing and able to report how they are
      feeling after surgery using the internet, and if this information can help doctors and nurses
      detect concerning symptoms after surgery.

      This study uses a special new website called WEBCORE. Patients can logon to WEBCORE and
      answer questions about how they are feeling. Then, doctors and nurses can look at this
      information during clinic appointments. We are doing this study to see if WEBCORE is a
      helpful way for us to keep track of information about how patients are feeling and quality of
      life. If WEBCORE is helpful, we will use it in the future to collect more information about
      patients' symptoms and quality of life. We can use what we learn to help find better ways of
      helping patients to prepare for what they will go through while they recover from surgery.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Participants must be 18 years or older

          -  Participants must be able to provide informed consent

          -  Participants must be scheduled to undergo laparotomy for presumed or known gynecologic
             cancer

          -  The assessments were designed and validated in English and are not currently available
             in other languages. Translation of questionnaires into other languages would require
             reestablishing the reliability and validity of these measures. Therefore, participants
             must be able to communicate in English to complete the tests. Participants must be
             able to speak and read English fluently

          -  Participants must have access to a home computer, have a personal email account, and
             check email at least once weekly by self-report

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients who have a cognitive or psychiatric deficit resulting in an inability to
             provide meaningful informed consent, as judged by the consenting professional, and/or
             as noted in the medical record

          -  Patients who are undergoing pelvic exenterative surgery (with the exception of
             patients undergoing modified pelvic exenteration in the context of debulking for
             ovarian or uterine cancer).
