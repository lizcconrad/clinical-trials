      The purpose of this study is

        -  to assess the feasibility and acceptability of massage therapyto examine the effects of
           massage therapy

        -  to explore whether psychological outcomes are associated with changes in patient
           reported QoL.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      As a part of this study, we will provide massage therapy to brain tumor patients. Our
      contribution here is expected to determine whether massage therapy is safe and helps to
      improve patient QoL. This contribution is significant because it is expected to provide pilot
      data on effect sizes so that we may design an adequately powered study to develop massage
      therapy programs and interventions for patients with brain tumors. In addition to benefiting
      brain tumor patients, the information from this study may be applied to improving the QoL of
      other cancer patients.

    <description>The setting for massage intervention will take place at The Duke Center for Living (DCL). . The massage therapists at the DCL work closely with physicians to design appropriate interventions for patients who are receiving treatment at DUMC, including cancer patients. All DCL therapists have completed more than 600 hours of training, are nationally certified and hold a North Carolina license to practice massage. These types include Swedish, deep muscle, myofascial release, trigger point, acupressure, Bowen Technique, sports massage and chair massage.</description>
