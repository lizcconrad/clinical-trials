      The aim of this research is to apply cardiac tissue characterization in order to assess left
      ventricular function in cardiac surgical patients pre and post cardiopulmonary bypass. The
      procedures to be used include a retrospective review of transesophageal images obtained
      during conventional intraoperative transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) for cardiac
      surgery, as well as a secondary analysis with Tissue Doppler. The results will be compared
      with hemodynamic data obtained from a pulmonary artery catheter (PAC).

      Patients included in this study are between the ages of 18 to 99 years of age, who presented
      to the operating room for cardiac surgery, and received both a pulmonary artery catheter and
      a routine intra-operative TEE. We will only be looking at patients whose TEE images were of
      good quality.

      Subjects underwent cardiac surgery and received both a PAC and a routine TEE exam. We will
      review the data from the PAC, the images from the conventional TEE exam, and a secondary
      analysis with Tissue Doppler.

      A potential benefit to society is a novel means for assessing left ventricular function. Our
      research will not benefit our subjects directly. There is no additional risk to our subjects
      beyond the insertion of the PAC and the TEE probe, which are routinely placed in our patients
      under-going cardiac surgery.
