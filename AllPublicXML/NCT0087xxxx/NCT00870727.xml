    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to develop a better tolerated and more effective pharmacologic
      treatment with individuals with Pervasive Developmental Disorder. This is a double-blind,
      placebo-controlled study of aripiprazole in the management of the maladaptive behaviors of
      Pervasive Developmental Disorder. The investigators hypothesize that aripiprazole will be
      more effective than placebo for reducing aggression,tantrum and self-injurious behavior in
      children with Pervasive Developmental Disorder.

    <textblock>
      Pervasive developmental disorders (PDD) are characterized by severe impairments in social
      interaction and communication in addition to restricted patterns of interests and activities.
      Research suggests that a dysregulation of the dopamine and serotonin systems contributes to
      these interfering behaviors in individuals with PDD. After benefits of typical neuroleptics
      were reported in subjects with PDD, research shifted to the atypical antipsychotic which have
      been shown to be better tolerated and effective in this population. However, the atypical
      antipsychotics have also been associated with adverse effects. Thus there remains a need for
      a novel pharmacotherapy that would be safe and effective for children and adolescents with
      PDD. The primary objectives of this study is to determine whether aripiprazole is effective
      and well tolerated for irritability in children and adolescents with PDD NOS during an 8-week
      acute phase and whether the effectiveness and tolerability of aripiprazole is maintained
      during a 16-week continuation phase.
