      The aims of this study are to evaluate the pharmacokinetics, safety and tolerability of the
      oral doses of the extended-release test- and reference formulations of AZD0837 in healthy
      volunteers both in fasting and fed conditions.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>To evaluate the pharmacokinetics of AZD0837 and the active metabolite AR-H067637XX for the extended-release test formulation of AZD0837 compared to the ER reference formulation.</measure>
    <time_frame>Intense PK-sampling during 5 pre- defined study days for PK profiling. In 2 of the study days the subjects will have a breakfast before intake of the Investigational Product.</time_frame>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>To evaluate the PK of the intermediate metabolite AR-H069927XX</measure>
    <time_frame>Since the metbolite will be evaluated from the AZD0837-samples the time frame is the same as above.</time_frame>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Safety variables (ECG, pulse, blood pressure, safety lab, physical examination, adverse events)</measure>
    <time_frame>ECG &amp; physical examination at start and end of study. Pulse and blood pressure predose day 1 and every day 2 h post dose. Adverse events collected during the whole study. Safety lab at a few timepoints but APTT will be checked on 4 h post dose on day 1.</time_frame>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Measurement of plasma concentrations of 4 beta-hydroxycholesterol to investigate whether AZD0837 affects the level of CYP3A4</measure>
    <time_frame>Once predose on day 1, session 1 and once predose on day 5, session 2</time_frame>
