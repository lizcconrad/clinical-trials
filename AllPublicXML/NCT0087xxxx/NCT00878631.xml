    <textblock>
      This clinical trial will evaluate the ease of conducting a randomized trial on patients with
      severe head injury who are cared for by paramedics in the out of hospital setting. The trial
      will compare two different kinds of fluids that are commonly used to elevate blood pressure
      and minimize the impact of the brain injury. The two solutions are a salt solution of
      different concentrations. One is a normal saline solution similar to the consistency of human
      blood and the other is a higher concentration mixed with a sugar that helps to keep the
      solution in the blood stream longer. This study is conducted without patient consent at the
      time of the study enrolment. The study will report on whether this trial is feasible in the
      out of hospital setting before launching into a larger definitive trial.

      The Toronto Prehospital Hypertonic Resuscitation-Head Injury and Multi Organ Dysfunction
      Trial (TOPHR HIT) is a randomized, placebo-controlled out of hospital trial of blunt trauma
      patients with head injuries. The study compares a group receiving normal saline according to
      a paramedic's protocol, with a treatment group receiving a single dose 250 ml of 7.5%
      hypertonic saline in 6% dextran 70 (RescueFlow BioPhausia AB, Stockholm Sweden).

      The primary objective of this study is to report feasibility in accordance with the
      methodology described by Lancaster and Dodds*, specifically addressing:

        1. baseline survival rates for the treatment and control group to aid in the design of a
           definitive multicentre trial.

        2. randomization compliance rate.

        3. ease of protocol implementation in the out-of-hospital setting.

        4. adverse rate of HSD infusion.

      The secondary objectives include measuring the effect of HSD in modulating the
      immuno-inflammatory response to severe head injury and its effect on modulating the release
      of neuro-biomarkers into serum; evaluating the role of serum neuro-biomarkers in predicting
      patient outcome and clinical response to HSD intervention; evaluating effects of HSD on brain
      atrophy post-injury and neurocognitive and neuropsychological outcomes.
