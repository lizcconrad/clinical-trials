      Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Bulimia Nervosa (CBT4BN) is a research program funded by the
      National Institute of Mental Health and conducted by the UNC Eating Disorders Program and the
      University of Pittsburgh Medical Center. Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) is an
      evidence-based treatment and the gold-standard for treating bulimia nervosa. The current
      study aims to compare two forms of CBT: face-to-face group therapy and online group therapy
      via cbt4bn.org.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All treatment is conducted by trained professionals from either the UNC Eating Disorders
      Program (in Chapel Hill) or Western Psychiatric Institute (in Pittsburgh) who are experienced
      in the treatment of eating disorders.

      Participants will participate in 16 1.5 hour long group sessions of group CBT over 20 weeks.
      Groups will include 5-8 participants, one or two co-therapists, and two sessions by a
      registered dietitian. Participants will be expected to complete self-monitoring forms which
      assess their mood and behavior. Groups will either take place face-to-face or online in a
      therapist-moderated chat group.
