      The objective of this study is to directly compare the effects of parents and friends on
      overweight and non-overweight children and adolescents' food intake and food selection using
      a cross-sectional design. Overweight and non-overweight children (5-6 year-old) and
      adolescents (13-14 year-old) will share a meal with a friend and with a parent on separate
      occasions. Participants' food selection and the amount of food they consumed will be compared
      across conditions.

      Hypothesis 1: The investigators hypothesize that overweight children and adolescents will
      select more unhealthy food items and eat more in the presence of an overweight friend than
      when eating with a lean friend; whereas lean participants eating with an overweight friend
      will eat a similar amount of food than lean youth eating with a lean friend.

      Hypothesis 2: The investigators predict that overweight children and adolescents (but not
      lean children and teens) will consume more food in the presence of their mother than in the
      presence of a friend.

      Hypothesis 3: The investigators also predict that overweight youth's energy intake will be
      related to parental prompts.

      Hypothesis 4: The investigators expect greater similarities in terms of food selection and
      food intake between adolescents and their friend than between adolescents and their parent.
