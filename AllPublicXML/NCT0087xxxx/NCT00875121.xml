  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study examines the effects of increasing the cost of social interactions and food on
      overweight and non-overweight youth. Using a computerized operant task youth will earn points
      exchangeable for food and social activity.

      The investigators predict that both overweight and non-overweight children will substitute
      food for interactions with an unfamiliar peer when this alternative is made expensive. Also,
      the investigators predict that both overweight and lean participants will defend their choice
      to spend time with a friend even when this alternative is made expensive.
