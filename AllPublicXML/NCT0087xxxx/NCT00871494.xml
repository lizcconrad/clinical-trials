    <textblock>
      Azithromycin had a potent in vitro activities and broad spectrum from typical and atypical
      bacteria to anaerobes. Azithromycin intravenous formulation demonstrated high efficacy and
      eradication rate in the western clinical trials. Development of azithromycin intravenous
      formulation would bring the clinical benefit to patients with pelvic inflammatory disease
      (PID) in Japan.

    <description>Response rate was calculated from the following formula, &quot;the number of participants assessed as effective&quot; over &quot;total participants excluding ones assessed as indeterminate&quot; multiplied by 100.
The inclusion criterion regarding fever was amended from the required criteria to the additional criteria in consultation with the regulatory authority. The subset of participants who were enrolled after the protocol amendment was the primary analysis sets for efficacy.</description>
