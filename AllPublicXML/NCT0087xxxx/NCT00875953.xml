    <textblock>
      Neck dissection is the main technique used by head and neck surgeons to treat known or
      suspected metastatic cancer to the neck. The traditional radical neck dissection was
      effective at treating metastatic cancer to the neck however the downside to this technique
      was significant morbidity. Since the early 1960's there has been several proposed techniques
      to treat metastatic head and neck cancer that involves preserving important anatomical
      structures in the neck. The disadvantage to these techniques are that they require meticulous
      dissection and can lead to bleeding and an increase in operative time. One particular tool
      that has been proposed in other surgical subspecialties, including head and neck surgery, is
      the harmonic scalpel. Using this tool, tissue dissection and vessel occlusion at the same
      time can occur with a reduced thermal damage to the surrounding tissue when compared to
      traditional cautery. In this study, our purpose is to determine if the harmonic scalpel will
      lead to a decrease in blood loss and operative time in patients undergoing a modified radical
      neck dissection compared to electrocautery.

      Hypothesis: Use of the harmonic scalpel as a surgical adjunct will reduce operative time for
      neck dissection and will reduce intraoperative blood loss.

      Patients who are referred to either the clinic of Dr. Joseph Dort or Dr. Wayne Matthews and
      are deemed to benefit from a modified radical neck dissection alone or as part of treatment
      for head and neck cancer will be given an opportunity to be a subject in this study. Once
      informed consent for both the surgery and the study is obtained, the lead author will be
      contacted and randomization will occur using a computer generated block-randomization
      allocation. The neck dissection will be carried out in the operating room using either
      electrocautery (control group) or harmonic scalpel (experimental group). The primary
      outcomes, blood loss (mLs) and operative time (minutes) will be assessed at the time of
      surgery. The blood loss in milliliters will be calculated using suction canister output,
      weight of sponges and irrigation used. The operative time in minutes will be calculated
      between the beginning of the actual neck dissection to the completion of the neck dissection
      defined as the removal of the surgical specimen and hemostasis of the surgical field.
      Intraoperative complications, namely vascular, nerve damage and lymphatic damage will be
      assessed at the time of surgery. Post-operative complications, both early and late will be
      assessed after the surgery using the Clavien post-operative complication scale. In addition,
      the length of time that operative drains are left in the neck will be measured with all
      drains being removed when their 24 hour drain output is less than 20 mls. Patients will then
      be followed up 2 weeks after their hospital discharge in the surgeon's clinic or the Tom
      Baker Cancer Centre.
