  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a study of the efficacy and safety of baclofen for alcohol dependence. 80 outpatient
      subjects with DSM-IV alcohol dependence will be randomized to 10 mg three times a day (tid)
      baclofen or tid placebo. An effort will be made to recruit 40 men and 40 women. Subjects will
      receive BRENDA counseling over the 12 weeks of the trial. The Timeline Followback (TLFB)
      method will be used to assess drinking patterns. The primary outcome is % heavy drinking
      during the trial.

      The study will explore the efficacy and tolerability of a 12-week regimen of 10 mg t.i.d.
      baclofen vs. placebo in conjunction with behavioral therapy for reducing heavy drinking in 80
      alcohol dependent individuals. Prior studies (Addolorato et al. 2000, 2002; Flannery et al.,
      2004) have found that baclofen reduces self-reported anxiety and craving; therefore, the
      proposed study also will assess baclofen's ability to reduce symptoms of these affective
      states. Furthermore, in our pilot study (Flannery et al, 2004), women appeared to respond
      more consistently than men, and therefore the study will also be balanced by gender.

             drinks/day) per week, on average and an average overall consumption of 21 drinks/week
             or more for men and 14 drinks/week or more for women during the 4 weeks prior to
