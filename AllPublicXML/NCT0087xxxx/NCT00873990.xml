    <textblock>
      The aim of the investigators study is to compare how two different bonding agents affects
      retention in a preventive dental procedure of pit and fissure sealant. This study will help
      in deciding whether the self etch bonding agent requiring less steps in completion is as
      effective as the total etch bonding agent requiring multiple steps in fissure sealant
      placement.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Pit and fissure sealant have been hailed as a highly effective preventive dental treatment
      since it was introduced first in late 1970s . Sealants have traditionally placed using two
      step bonding agents based on acid etching with phosphoric acid followed by drying and bonding
      agent application and curing. Multiple steps in application of bonding agents have been
      associated with more chances of procedure errors and prolonged procedure time. The newer
      bonding agents are based on minimizing the number of steps involved with introduction of self
      etching bonding agents.6th generation adhesives are based on mixing of two components where
      as the 7th generation adhesives are based on no mix technique.

      Previous studies on fissure sealants have focused on conventional etch and rinse bonding
      agents, there are only few published studies on effectiveness of the self etch bonding agents
      in retention of fissure sealants in vivo that have targeted the 6th generation adhesive.
      Feigal and Quelhas reported equivocal results with use of self etching bonding agents in
      comparison with etch and rinse bonding agents, but their study was limited by smaller sample
      size. Similar study was conducted by Burbridge which was based on short clinical follow up of
      6 month evaluation where Xeno III by Dentsply (6th generation bonding agent) was compared
      with Prime &amp; Bond (Dentsply). Another study by Venker et al on Adper Prompt L Pop in a school
      sealant program was based on retrospective review of cases. In light of published literature
      on (6th generation) self etch bonding agent has been found to be equal or inferior to total
      etch bonding agents (5th generation). There are no published clinical trials on the
      retentiong rate comparison of total etch bonding agent with no mix slef etch bonding agents
      in pit and fissure sealant.

      Our study is based on comparison of effectiveness of single step bonding agent (7th
      generation adhesives) versus two step bonding agent in fissure sealant retention.

    <description>Selected teeth would receive prophylaxis with pumice using prophylaxis brushes for 20 seconds. The teeth will be isolated with cotton rolls before application of bonding agent. The tooth selected for etch and rinse bonding system (two step bonding agent) will be treated with 37% phosphoric acid (Total Etch Ivoclar Vivadent) for 15 seconds followed by rinsing for 30 seconds and then drying with air syringe till frosty white appearance is achieved.
Adper Single Bond 2 (3M ESPE) will be applied to occlusal fissure using applicator brushes followed by curing for 10 seconds. Clinpro(3M ESPE) fissure sealant will be applied to pits and fissures and then light cured for 20 seconds.</description>

    <description>For teeth selected for application of self etching bonding agent (Adper Easy Bond 3 M), the bonding agent will be applied to occlusal surface with microbrushes and will be left undisturbed for 20 seconds followed by air drying for 5 seconds and then will be light cured for 10 seconds. Fissure sealant (Clinpro 3M ESPE) will be applied in a similar manner as for etch and rinse group and light cured.</description>
