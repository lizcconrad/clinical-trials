  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The antiphospholipid-antibody syndrome (APLA), which includes lupus anticoagulant,
      anticardiolipin, and anti-beta-2-glycoproteinI antibodies, is a thrombophilic disorder
      associated with arterial thrombosis, venous thrombosis or both. Patients diagnosed with APLA
      have a higher risk of recurrent thrombosis than do patients without known antibodies.
      Currently, warfarin is considered the anticoagulant of choice for prophylactic antithrombotic
      treatment for APLA patients after their first episode of thrombosis. In some patients with
      APLA who are treated with warfarin, the INR values determined on plasma are unreliable due to
      an influence of the APLA on the INR. In these individuals, alternative monitoring methods,
      such as factor II activity, chromogenic factor X activity or prothrombin-proconvertin time
      should be used to assess adequate anticoagulation. These tests are expensive and not widely
      available to some clinicians. Point-of-care (POC) instruments, on the other hand, are readily
      accessible to clinicians. Previous research has shown that INR values from 3 older
      point-of-care (POC) instruments are unreliable in 1/3 of APLA patients (CoaguChekTM,
      ProTimeTM, INRatioTM). However, there are now newer versions of these POC instruments
      available (CoaguChek XSTM, an investigational ProTime device, and a newer INRatioTM device)
      and it is unknown if these newer POC instruments are reliable in patients with APLA. The
      purpose of this study is to determine whether newer POC instruments are reliable in patients
      with APLA.

      <textblock>
        APLA Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Prolongation of a phospholipid-dependent screening assay, 2) lack of correction of a
             prolonged screening assay after a 1:1 mix with pooled normal plasma, and 3) correction
             of a prolonged screening assay by the addition of excess phospholipid. Two positive
             lupus anticoagulant confirmations at least 3 months apart will be required.

          -  Diagnosis of anticardiolipin antibodies defined as elevated levels of ACA-IgG (&gt;30)
             and/or ACA-IgM (&gt;15) on two separate occasions at least 3 months apart.

          -  Stable warfarin therapy, defined as the maintenance of a warfarin dose for a minimal
             of 2 weeks regardless of INR.

        APLA Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients whose warfarin dose has changed within the past 2 weeks.

        Control Inclusion Criteria:

          -  No evidence of either a positive LA or ACA diagnosis by confirmation of negative
             laboratory values and/or documentation of no clinical signs and symptoms concurrent
             with these conditions.

          -  Stable warfarin therapy, defined as the maintenance of a warfarin dose for a minimal
             of 2 weeks regardless of INR.

        Control Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients whose warfarin dose has changed within the past 2 weeks.
