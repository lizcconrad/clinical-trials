  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Facing the lack of recommandations of Neurology and cardiology societies, the investigators
      decided in 2002 some Good Medical Practices to define a specific and precise population for
      whom the closure of permeable oval formaen after a first CVA seem to be necessary. Current
      survey of these patients after implantation of a prothesis in interauricular septum is
      defined by a consultation at 1, 3 and 6 months after surgery for a clinical exam and an
      echocardiography. One year after implantation, the investigators systematically realized a
      control by MRI associated to a contrast echography.

      In the aim of evaluating the investigators' medical practice, the investigators decided to do
      an observational study which will permit us to judge of the interest or lack of interest of
      our &quot;Good medical practice&quot; before the publication of prospective and randomised clinical
      studies.
