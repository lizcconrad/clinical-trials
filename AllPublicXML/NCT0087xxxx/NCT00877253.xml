    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the maximum tolerated dose of Genexol®-PM plus
      Carboplatin and evaluate the efficacy and safety of Genexol®-PM plus Carboplatin regimen in
      subjects with advanced ovarian cancer.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase I trial to determine the maximum tolerated dose and recommended phase II dose
      of the combination therapy with Genexol®-PM and Carboplatin and to evaluate the efficacy and
      safety of Genexol®-PM when administered with Carboplatin in subjects with advanced ovarian
      cancer after debulking surgery.
