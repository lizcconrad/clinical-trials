      The purpose of this study is to investigate the safety and efficacy of memantine extended
      release, as well as its extent of absorption in pediatric patients with autism.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, two-part study in pediatric (ages 6 to 18 years) patients diagnosed
      with autism.

      Patients participating in Part One will receive a single open-label dose of memantine. Blood
      samples for pharmacokinetic analysis will be collected.

      Part Two is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled 12-week efficacy and safety study
      evaluating change in all core domains (social interactions, communication, and restricted
      interests and repetitive behaviors) of autism.

      In the Forest autism trials conducted in children ages 6-12, dosing with an extended release
      formulation of memantine was weight-based. These weight based dose limits were selected to
      ensure exposure in terms of area under the curve (AUC) was less than the predefined limit of
      2100 ng∙h/mL that represented a 10-fold lower exposure than observed at the NOAEL (No
      observed adverse effect level) of 15 mg/kg/day in juvenile rats.

      The weight-based dose limits in these studies were as follows:

        -  Group A: ≥ 60 kg; max 15 mg/day

        -  Group B: 40-59 kg; max 9 mg/day

        -  Group C: 20-39 kg; max 6 mg/day

        -  Group D: &lt; 20 kg; max 3 mg/day

    <measure>Change in Total Raw Score of Social Responsiveness Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>From Baseline to Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The Social Responsiveness Scale (SRS) is a 65-item informant-rated assessment, ranging from 0 (no impairment) to 195 (severe social impairment).
Each item is associated with 1 of 5 subscales (social awareness, social cognition, social communication, social motivation and autistic mannerisms). Each item is rated on a 4-point scale from 1 (not true) to 4 (almost always true). The scores are then transposed to a scale from 0 to 3 and scores are summed within each of the 5 subscales. A higher score indicates greater severity of social impairment.</description>

    <measure>Core Autism Treatment Scale-Improvement: Total Score</measure>

    <description>The Core Autism Treatment Scale-Improvement (CATS-I) is based on rating 14 items from 1 (very much improved) to 7 (very much worse) with a total score ranging from 14 (improved) to 98 (worsened).
The Core Autism Treatment Scale-Improvement (CATS-I) is designed to utilize a comparison between pretreatment ratings of Core Autism Treatment Scale-Severity (CATS-S) and ratings of improvement after start of therapy (CATS-I). Both parts of the CATS contain 14 items testing for social interaction (items 1-9) and communication (items 10-14). Each of these items is rated from 1 (indicating most benign) to 7 (indicating most severe).</description>

The Core Autism Treatment Scale-Improvement (CATS-I) is designed to utilize a comparison between pretreatment ratings of Core Autism Treatment Scale-Severity (CATS-S) and ratings of improvement after start of therapy (CATS-I). Both parts of the CATS contain 14 items testing for social interaction (items 1-9) and communication (items 10-14). Each of these items is rated from 1 (indicating most benign) to 7 (indicating most severe).</description>

Both parts of the CATS contain 14 items testing for social interaction (items 1-9) and communication (items 10-14). Each of these items is rated from 1 (indicating most benign) to 7 (indicating most severe).</description>

        <title>Change in Total Raw Score of Social Responsiveness Scale</title>
        <description>The Social Responsiveness Scale (SRS) is a 65-item informant-rated assessment, ranging from 0 (no impairment) to 195 (severe social impairment).
Each item is associated with 1 of 5 subscales (social awareness, social cognition, social communication, social motivation and autistic mannerisms). Each item is rated on a 4-point scale from 1 (not true) to 4 (almost always true). The scores are then transposed to a scale from 0 to 3 and scores are summed within each of the 5 subscales. A higher score indicates greater severity of social impairment.</description>

The Children’s Communication Checklist-2 (CCC-2) is a validated, norm-referenced, informant-rated scale that evaluates difficulties children may have (across 10 different subscales, consisting of 7 items each) that affect communication (items 1-50), as well as strengths that children may demonstrate when communicating with others (items 51-70).</description>
