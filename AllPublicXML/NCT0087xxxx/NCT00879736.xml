  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is being carried out to see if patients make the lifestyle changes or take their
      medication as instructed by their doctor during their visit as a result of the T.H.T.
      patient-education training. Proper information exchange between doctors and patients is an
      important part of quality health care. Although many patients would like more information,
      they often do not ask for it directly during doctor-patient visits. The patient-training in
      this study specifically aims at improving patient participation during medical appointments
      by building communication skills such as requests for information and sharing health concerns
      with the doctor.
