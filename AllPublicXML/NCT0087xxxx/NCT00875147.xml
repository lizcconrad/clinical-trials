      Hypothesis of the study: Neoadjuvant chemotherapy with Bevacizumab impairs postoperative
      outcome after resection of colorectal liver metastases.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Bevacizumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody against vascular endothelial growth factor
      (VEGF) increasingly added to other drugs in the treatment of colorectal cancer. Bev is
      typically used in combination with other chemotherapeutic agents such as oxaliplatin,
      irinotecan, leucovorin and 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) for treatment of patients with CRLM. The
      objective of this study was to assess the impact of neoadjuvant bevacizumab on clinical
      outcome after hepatectomy of colorectal liver metastases (CRLM).

      Patients, who underwent liver resection due to colorectal liver metastases after neoadjuvant
      chemotherapy, operated between 2005 and 2007 will be evaluated retrospectively. The patients
      will be distributed in two groups, either with or without bevacicumab. Outcome parameters are
      mortality, complications, hospital stay and ICU stay. To increase the power of the study the
      total number of patients will be increased by adding patients from other centers. Results
      will be adjusted for the propensity of developing complications.

        Patients, who underwent liver resection due to CRLM between 2005 and 2007, were
        retrospectively assessed for eligibility. Patients with chemotherapy containing Bev prior
        to surgery are identified consequtively. This group of patient with preoperative Bev is
        matched to patients without Bev. Consecutive patients with neoadjuvant application of
        Bevacizumab will be matched to patients without Bevacizumab. Results are statistically
        adjusted according to potential confounders.
