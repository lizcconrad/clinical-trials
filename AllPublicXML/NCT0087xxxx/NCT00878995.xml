      RATIONALE: Testosterone may lessen weight loss and improve muscle size and strength in
      patients with cachexia caused by cancer.

      PURPOSE: This randomized phase I trial is studying whether testosterone administered during
      standard of care chemotherapy and/or radiation works by helping patients with squamous cell
      carcinoma to maintain their body weight and muscle size and strength during treatment.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  To determine the effect of testosterone therapy on lean body mass and muscle strength in
           patients with advanced or recurrent squamous cell carcinoma.

        -  To determine the testosterone therapy on inflammatory biomarkers in patients with
           advanced or recurrent squamous cell carcinoma.

      OUTLINE: Patients are stratified according to age and disease stage. Patients are randomized
      to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive standard of care chemotherapy and/or radiation and placebo
           testosterone intramuscularly (IM) weekly for 7 weeks.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive standard of care chemotherapy and/or radiation and testosterone
           IM weekly for 7 weeks.

      Patients undergo dual energy x-ray absorptiometry, muscle strength tests, stable isotope
      metabolic studies, indirect calorimetry studies, and assessment of their physical activity
      level, and nutritional counseling. Patients also complete mood, fatigue, and quality-of-life
      questionnaires.

      Blood, muscle tissue, and urine samples are collected periodically for laboratory studies.
      Samples are analyzed for serum inflammatory biomarkers and inflammatory cytokines by
      immunoassay.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically for 1 year.

    <description>Multidimensional Fatigue Symptom Inventory Short Form (MFSI-SF) from the Moffitt Cancer Center, University of South Florida The MFSI-SF is a 30 question assessment designed to assess the principal manifestations of fatigue.
There 5 subscales used to calculate a total score. The subscales are: General Fatigue, Physical Fatigue, Emotional Fatigue, Mental Fatigue, and Vigor (an estimate of the patient's energy level). The total score is calculated with the equation: (general + physical + emotional + mental) - vigor = total score.
The range of the total score is -24 to 96, with the higher the number meaning more fatigue.</description>

    <description>Profile of Mood States (POMS) is a questionnaire by MultiHealth Systems, that measures mood. In this 65 item questionnaire, subjects are asked to rate their feelings toward a statement from 0-4, with 0 being &quot;not at all' and 4 being &quot;extremely&quot;. There are 6 subscales which include, tension-anxiety, depression, anger-hostility, vigor, fatigue, and confusion. To calculate the total mood disturbance, which is what is reported here, the subscales tension-anxiety, depression, anger-hostility, fatigue and confusion are summed and vigor is subtracted. The scale range for total mood disturbance is 200 (worst) to -32 (best).</description>

        <description>Multidimensional Fatigue Symptom Inventory Short Form (MFSI-SF) from the Moffitt Cancer Center, University of South Florida The MFSI-SF is a 30 question assessment designed to assess the principal manifestations of fatigue.
There 5 subscales used to calculate a total score. The subscales are: General Fatigue, Physical Fatigue, Emotional Fatigue, Mental Fatigue, and Vigor (an estimate of the patient's energy level). The total score is calculated with the equation: (general + physical + emotional + mental) - vigor = total score.
The range of the total score is -24 to 96, with the higher the number meaning more fatigue.</description>

There 5 subscales used to calculate a total score. The subscales are: General Fatigue, Physical Fatigue, Emotional Fatigue, Mental Fatigue, and Vigor (an estimate of the patient's energy level). The total score is calculated with the equation: (general + physical + emotional + mental) - vigor = total score.
The range of the total score is -24 to 96, with the higher the number meaning more fatigue.</description>

        <title>Mood Measured by Profile of Mood States at Baseline</title>
        <description>Profile of Mood States (POMS) is a questionnaire by MultiHealth Systems, that measures mood. In this 65 item questionnaire, subjects are asked to rate their feelings toward a statement from 0-4, with 0 being &quot;not at all' and 4 being &quot;extremely&quot;. There are 6 subscales which include, tension-anxiety, depression, anger-hostility, vigor, fatigue, and confusion. To calculate the total mood disturbance, which is what is reported here, the subscales tension-anxiety, depression, anger-hostility, fatigue and confusion are summed and vigor is subtracted. The scale range for total mood disturbance is 200 (worst) to -32 (best).</description>
