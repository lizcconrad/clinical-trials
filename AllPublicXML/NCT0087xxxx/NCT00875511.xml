  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study seeks to discover whether peer rejection increases the value of food relative to
      peer interaction in overweight individuals. After playing a computer game that randomly
      simulates peer rejection or peer acceptance, participants will play another computer game
      that will assess the value of food and social interactions.

      Overweight individuals may be more likely to resort to food in moments of distress and less
      likely to choose to interact with a peer to reestablish their sense of belongingness.
