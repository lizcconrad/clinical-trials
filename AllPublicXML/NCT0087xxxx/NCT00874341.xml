  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Current evidence indicates that fruit and vegetable intake and dietary patterns rich in fruit
      and vegetables may be associated with reduced insulin resistance and may reduce the risk of
      the metabolic syndrome. If proven, this relationship may partly explain the inverse
      association between fruit and vegetable intake and cardiovascular disease risk. There are
      currently no published dietary interventions that have examined in detail the relationship
      between fruit and vegetable intake and insulin resistance. There is, however, some
      preliminary evidence from whole diet interventions that a diet rich in fruit and vegetables
      may have a beneficial effect on insulin resistance. Evidence to date indicates that an
      investigation of the direct association between fruit and vegetable intakes and insulin
      resistance in a carefully controlled intervention study is warranted. This study will
      investigate the dose−response effect of fruit and vegetable intake on insulin resistance in
      people who are overweight and at high−risk of CVD using state−of−the−art techniques.
