  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the research is to determine if Cognitive Behaviour Therapy (CBT) specific for BDD
      is more effective than a credible non-specific form of CBT for treating BDD and its
      delusional variant in adults aged 17 or over. This will be done in a single centre randomised
      controlled trial that compares specific CBT for BDD versus non-specific CBT over 12 weeks.
      The hypotheses to be tested are that: (1) specific CBT for BDD will be more effective than
      non-specific CBT at 12 weeks (2) Treatment effects from Specific CBT will be maintained at 1
      month follow up. The main study end-point is at 12 weeks and the secondary end-point is at 1
      month follow up. A secondary aim is to explore whether delusionality (insight) as measured by
      the Brown Assessment of Beliefs and co-morbid depressed mood predicts response to treatment.

    <measure>Yale Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale (Modified for BDD) (BDD -YBOCS) (Phillips et al., 1997)</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks, 1 month post treatment</time_frame>
    <description>This is a clinician-rated scale administered by a trained blinded assessor. The range is 0-48. Cronbach's α for the scale is 0.80. Response to treatment is defined as a 30% or greater decrease in the total BDD-YBOCS score, which best corresponded to 'much improved' on the Clinical Global Impression (CGI) scale. In the original validation study, this cutoff score produced 1 false negative (96% sensitivity), that is, 1 participant who was rated as much or very much improved on the CGI was not classified as a responder on the BDD-YBOCS using the 30% threshold.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Brown Assessment of Beliefs to Measure the Strength of Conviction in Beliefs About Being Ugly (Eisen et al., 1998)</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks, 1 month post treatment</time_frame>
    <description>BABS is a 7-item clinician scale rated by a blinded assessor to measure the strength of conviction in a belief (e.g. 'I am as ugly as the Elephant man'); each item is rated from 0 ('non-delusional belief, or least pathological') to 4 ('delusional belief, or most pathological') and the total scores range from 0 to 24; higher scores represent an increasing delusionality of beliefs; respondents are classified as having delusional BDD beliefs if their total score is 18 or more, and if they score 4 on the first item, indicating they are completely convinced that their belief is accurate.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Montgomery Asberg Depression Rating Scale (Montgomery and Asberg, 1979).</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks, 1 month post treatment</time_frame>
    <description>MADRS is a 10-item clinician scale rated by a blinded assessor to measure symptoms of depression; each item is rated on a 7-point Likert scale from 0 (indicating 'normal' or 'no difficulties') to 6, and the range is 0-60; higher scores reflect a greater symptomatology; a MADRS total score of ≥ 25 is regarded as moderate, and of &gt;31 as severe.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Appearance Anxiety Inventory (AAI)</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks, 1 month post treatment</time_frame>
    <description>The AAI is a 10- item self-report questionnaire for measuring the frequency of avoidance behaviour and threat-monitoring (e.g. checking, self-focussed attention) that are characteristic of a response to a distorted body image; each item is scored from 0 ('not at all') to 4 ('all the time'), and the range of the total scores is 0-40, with higher scores reflecting a greater frequency of the responses; the AAI has a Cronbach's α of 0.86.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ)-9</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks, 1 month post treatment</time_frame>
    <description>The PHQ is a 9-item self-report measure of depression; each item is scored from 0 ('not at all') to 3 ('nearly every day'),and the summed total score ranges from 0 to 27, with higher scores reflecting a greater symptomatology of depression; Cronbach's α for the scale is 0.89.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Generalised Anxiety Disorder (GAD)-7</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks,1 month post treatment</time_frame>
    <description>The GAD-7 is a 7-item self-report measure for symptoms of generalised anxiety; each item is scored from 0 to 3, and the summed total score ranges from 0 to 21, with higher scores reflecting a greater symptomatology; Cronbach's α for the measure is 0.92.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Body Image Quality of Life Inventory (BIQLI)</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks, 1 month post treatment</time_frame>
    <description>The BIQLI is a 19-item self-report scale that measures the impact of body image concerns on a broad range of life domains (e.g. sense of self, social functioning, sexuality, emotional well-being, exercise and grooming); the BIQLI is scored as the average numeric score of all the items from -3 ('very negative effect') to +3 ('very positive effect'); Cronbach's α for the scale is 0.95.</description>

    <description>This consisted of 12 wks of 1 hr sessions (1 per week).The consisted of engagement in a developmental understanding of the problem and setting up an alternative view of the problem. Imagery rescripting followed for past aversive memories that were associated with the onset (e.g. bullying). The behaviours were aimed at either (1) threat detection and monitoring or (2) preventing feared consequences by avoidance or (3) attempts to undo the appearance concerns. The therapist aimed to help individuals identify their beliefs about processes, conduct behavioural experiments that tested out their expectations and to gradually drop the safety-seeking behaviours and test out their fears.</description>

    <description>Anxiety Management treatment was provided once a week for 12 weeks, with each session lasting 1 hr. AM was planned to entail a therapeutic alliance, support and homework similar to the CBT group. The rationale provided was that when triggered, the person would experience a threat and negative thoughts about their appearance. This, in turn, would lead to physical symptoms of anxiety and magnify the perceived threat. The treatment consisted of (1) practising progressive muscle relaxation and breathing daily, (2) identifying triggers and physical symptoms associated with appearance-related anxiety and (3) utilising brief muscle relaxation and breathing techniques in trigger situations.</description>

          <title>CBT Specific for BDD</title>
          <description>CBT specific for BDD: Cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT) which is specific for BDD. A pilot study (Veale et al, 1996b) twelve years ago has demonstrated significant benefit of CBT over a waiting list. The mean reduction was about 50% on the primary outcome measure (YBOCS for BDD). This consisted of a reduction of 12 points and a standard deviation of 7 on the YBOCS for BDD and the treatment is now thought to be better than in 1996.</description>

        <group group_id="P2">
          <title>Non Specific CBT</title>
          <description>Non specific CBT: CBT which is not specific for BDD (stress management and cognitive restructuring) which has been shown to be a credible alternative psychological treatment to CBT in health anxiety. However in two pilot cases of BDD, the benefits of anxiety management were minimal with a reduction of between zero and 10% on the YBOCS for BDD. At the most this equates to a maximum of 3 points reduction.</description>

            <description>CBT specific for BDD: Cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT) which is specific for BDD. A pilot study (Veale et al, 1996b) twelve years ago has demonstrated significant benefit of CBT over a waiting list. The mean reduction was about 50% on the primary outcome measure (YBOCS for BDD). This consisted of a reduction of 12 points and a standard deviation of 7 on the YBOCS for BDD and the treatment is now thought to be better than in 1996.</description>

            <description>Non specific CBT: CBT which is not specific for BDD (stress management and cognitive restructuring) which has been shown to be a credible alternative psychological treatment to CBT in health anxiety. However in two pilot cases of BDD, the benefits were minimal with a reduction of between zero and 10% on the YBOCS for BDD. At the most this equates to a maximum of 3 points reduction.</description>

          <description>This is a clinician-rated scale administered by a trained blinded assessor. The range is 0–48. Cronbach’s α for the scale is 0.80. Response to treatment is defined as a 30% or greater decrease in the total BDD-YBOCS score, which best corresponded to ‘much improved’ on the Clinical Global Impression (CGI) scale. In the original validation study, this cutoff score produced 1 false negative (96% sensitivity), that is, 1 participant who was rated as much or very much improved on the CGI was not classified as a responder on the BDD-YBOCS using the 30% threshold.</description>

        <description>BABS is a 7-item clinician scale rated by a blinded assessor to measure the strength of conviction in a belief (e.g. ‘I am as ugly as the Elephant man’); each item is rated from 0 (‘non-delusional belief, or least pathological’) to 4 (‘delusional belief, or most pathological’) and the total scores range from 0 to 24; higher scores represent an increasing delusionality of beliefs; respondents are classified as having delusional BDD beliefs if their total score is 18 or more, and if they score 4 on the first item, indicating they are completely convinced that their belief is accurate.</description>

A pilot study (Veale et al, 1996b) twelve years ago has demonstrated significant benefit of CBT over a waiting list. The mean reduction was about 50% on the primary outcome measure (YBOCS for BDD). This consisted of a reduction of 12 points and a standard deviation of 7 on the YBOCS for BDD and the treatment is now thought to be better than in 1996.</description>

However in two pilot cases of BDD, the benefits were minimal with a reduction of between zero and 10% on the YBOCS for BDD. At the most this equates to a maximum of 3 points reduction.</description>

A pilot study (Veale et al, 1996b) twelve years ago has demonstrated significant benefit of CBT over a waiting list. The mean reduction was about 50% on the primary outcome measure (YBOCS for BDD). This consisted of a reduction of 12 points and a standard deviation of 7 on the YBOCS for BDD and the treatment is now thought to be better than in 1996.</description>
