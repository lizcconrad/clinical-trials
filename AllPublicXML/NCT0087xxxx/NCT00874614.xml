  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This clinical trial is designed to evaluate the effectiveness and collect additional safety
      information on AZEDRA® (iobenguane I 131) for the treatment of metastatic or
      relapsed/refractory (to other treatment) or unresectable pheochromocytoma or paraganglioma.

      The purpose of this trial is to test the use of AZEDRA® as a treatment for pheochromocytoma
      and paraganglioma, a rare disease. This Phase II study will help determine primarily if using
      the drug reduces the amount of blood pressure medication being taken as a result of the
      cancer and secondarily to determine such things as the effectiveness of the study drug in
      treating the cancer, additional safety measures, and to assess if the drug helps the quality
      of life and use of pain medication. All subjects will receive an imaging dose with scans
      followed by two therapeutic doses given approximately 3 months apart.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      AZEDRA® (Iobenguane I 131) is a very high-specific-activity iobenguane I 131, produced using
      proprietary Ultratrace® platform. Based on the well-characterized cellular active transport
      mechanism, the high specific activity of allows for effective cellular uptake of
      radioactivity and hence greater tumor uptake.

      During this study the subjects will receive two (2) Therapy Doses that are given
      approximately three (3) months apart. Prior to administration of the first Therapy Dose,
      subjects will be given an Imaging Dose of AZEDRA® and will undergo iobenguane I 131 scans to
      evaluate tumor uptake and to measure normal organ distribution and allow for the calculation
      of radiation dose to normal organs.

      Screening procedures for eligibility will need to be done before imaging or therapeutic doses
      of AZEDRA® are administered.

      Hospitalization is required for approximately one (1) week after each of the two (2)
      Therapeutic Doses. Frequent follow up is necessary for the first year and some of the follow
      up visits may be done by a visiting health care professional in the subjects' homes. Subjects
      will be followed in the treatment study for one (1) year and for an additional four (4) years
      in long-term follow up.

    <description>Each subject will be administered 3 mCi to 6 mCi Ultratrace® Iobenguane I 131, referred to as the Imaging Dose, to confirm that subject meets radiological entry criteria and to establish dosimetry. All subjects meeting entry criteria will then receive the investigational product referred to as the Therapeutic Dose (500 mCi or 8 mCi/kg if the subject weighs 62.5 kg or less) of Ultratrace Iobenguane I 131, followed by imaging at 7 days post infusion or upon discharge from isolation. The Therapeutic Doses will be adjusted equally if warranted by results of the dosimetry evaluation. At least 3 months later, subjects will receive the second Therapeutic Dose.</description>
