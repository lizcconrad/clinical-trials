  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is about arm and hand recovery after a stroke. The investigators are testing an
      experimental arm therapy called Accelerated Skill Acquisition Program (ASAP) which combines
      challenging, intensive and meaningful practice of tasks of the participant's choice compared
      to two standard types of therapy (usual and customary arm therapy totaling 30 hours and usual
      and customary arm therapy for a duration indicated on the therapy prescription). A second
      objective is to characterize current outpatient arm therapy (dosage &amp; content) following
      stroke for individuals who are eligible for ICARE. Eligible candidates must have had a stroke
      affecting an arm within the last 106 days.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Of the 700,000 individuals who experience a new or recurrent stroke each year, a majority
      have considerable residual disability. Sixty-five percent (65%) of patients at 6 months are
      unable to incorporate the paretic hand effectively into daily activities. In turn, this
      degree of functional deficit contributes to a reduced quality of life after stroke. The
      extent of disability has been underplayed by the use of the Barthel Index that captures only
      basic activities of daily living such as self-care and does not extend to activities and
      participation at higher levels of functioning that are most affected by a residual upper
      extremity disability. The past decade has witnessed an explosion of different therapy
      interventions designed to capitalize on the brain's inherent capability to rewire and learn
      well into old age and more importantly for rehabilitation, after injury. The most effective
      arm-focused interventions with the strongest evidence and potentially the most immediate and
      cost-effective appeal for the current health-care environment share a common emphasis on
      focused task-specific training applied with an intensity higher than usual care. Therefore,
      our primary aim is to compare the efficacy of a fully defined, hybrid combination of the most
      effective interventions (forced-use/constraint-induced therapy and
      skill-based/impairment-mitigating motor learning training), the Accelerated Skill Acquisition
      Program (ASAP), to an equivalent dose of usual and customary outpatient therapy.

    <participant_flow>
      <recruitment_details>Participants were recruited between 5 and 106 days post-stroke, predominantly during inpatient rehabilitation, from 7 sites in the United States metropolitan areas of Los Angeles, CA, Atlanta, GA and Washington, D.C.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>From June 2009 through February 2013, 11,051 patients were pre-screened (medical record review) followed by 772 in-person screening assessments. Through both processes, 9,219 were excluded because they did not meet eligibility criteria; 645 declined and 826 were excluded for other reasons.</pre_assignment_details>

          <title>ASAP Accelerated Skill Acquisition Program</title>
          <description>A structured, evidence-based, task-oriented rehabilitation program was administered during the early post-acute outpatient interval. It focused entirely on recovery of the affected upper extremity. The training intervention was based on the fundamental elements of skill acquisition through intense bouts of task-specific practice, impairment mitigation (strengthening exercises, shoulder stability/mobility, etc.) to increase capacity, and motivational enhancements to build self-confidence and autonomy.
Accelerated Skill Acquisition Program (ASAP): The prescribed dose was 30-hours administered over 1-hour visits at a frequency of 3x/week for a 10-week duration. A 2-hour orientation/evaluation session preceded the first visit.</description>

            <title>ASAP Accelerated Skill Acquisition Program</title>
            <description>A structured, evidence-based, task-oriented rehabilitation program was administered during the early post-acute outpatient interval. It focused entirely on recovery of the affected upper extremity. The training intervention was based on the fundamental elements of skill acquisition through intense bouts of task-specific practice, impairment mitigation (strengthening exercises, shoulder stability/mobility, etc.) to increase capacity, and motivational enhancements to build self-confidence and autonomy.
Accelerated Skill Acquisition Program (ASAP): The prescribed dose was 30-hours administered over 1-hour visits at a frequency of 3x/week for a 10-week duration. A 2-hour orientation/evaluation session preceded the first visit.</description>

Usual and customary occupational therapy was adjusted for dose and administered early post-acutely in the outpatient setting. It consisted of usual and customary outpatient occupational therapy according to local practices, payer guidelines and participant preferences. It may have focused on more diverse needs than the affected upper extremity.
Dose-Equivalent Usual &amp; Customary Care (DEUCC): This group was prescribed a 30-hour dose equivalency, administered over 1-hour visits at a frequency of 3x/week for a 10-week duration.</description>

      <desc>Participants were monitored for adverse events during all screening, intervention and evaluation sessions.

          <title>ASAP Accelerated Skill Acquisition Program</title>
          <description>A structured, evidence-based, task-oriented rehabilitation program was administered during the early post-acute outpatient interval. It focused entirely on recovery of the affected upper extremity. The training intervention was based on the fundamental elements of skill acquisition through intense bouts of task-specific practice, impairment mitigation (strengthening exercises, shoulder stability/mobility, etc.) to increase capacity, and motivational enhancements to build self-confidence and autonomy.
Accelerated Skill Acquisition Program (ASAP): The prescribed dose was 30-hours administered over 1-hour visits at a frequency of 3x/week for a 10-week duration. A 2-hour orientation/evaluation session preceded the first visit.</description>

It consisted of usual and customary outpatient occupational therapy according to local practices, payer guidelines and participant preferences. It may have focused on more diverse needs than the affected upper extremity.
Dose-Equivalent Usual &amp; Customary Care (DEUCC): This group was prescribed a 30-hour dose equivalency, administered over 1-hour visits at a frequency of 3x/week for a 10-week duration.</description>
