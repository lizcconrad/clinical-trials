  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will answer two separate questions.

      The first question is to test the cardiovascular effects of long-term treatment with
      rosiglitazone or pioglitazone when used as part of standard of care compared to similar
      standard of care without rosiglitazone or pioglitazone in patients with type 2 diabetes who
      have a history of or are at risk for cardiovascular disease.

      The second question will compare the effects of long-term supplementation of vitamin D on
      death and cancer

    <measure>Number of Participants With Hepatic Enzyme Increased or Abnormal Liver Function Tests</measure>
    <time_frame>From Randomization at Visit 3 to Final Visit (up to 162 days)</time_frame>
    <description>Liver function tests are groups of clinical biochemistry laboratory blood assays designed to give information about the health of the liver. &quot;Liver function test abnormal&quot; and &quot;hepatic enzyme increased&quot; were obtained from adverse event data as reported by investigators based on the reference range of the reporting local laboratory methodology. The vitamin D arm was not analyzed for this outcome measure.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants With Cognitive (Mental Processes) Decline (CD) From Baseline to the Year 2 Visit and the Final Visit</measure>
    <time_frame>From Randomization at Visit 3 to Final Visit (up to 162 days)</time_frame>
    <description>CD is equivalent to a difference of &gt;=1.5 units on the Digit Symbol Substitution Test (DSST) score. The DSST is a neuropsychological test sensitive to brain damage, a serious loss of cognitive ability, age, and depression. It consists of digit-symbol pairs, followed by a list of digits. Under each digit the participant was asked to write the corresponding symbol as quickly as possible. The number of correct symbols within the allowed time (90 or 120 seconds) was measured in units (one correct score equals one unit).</description>

Retinopathy is defined as damage to the inner lining of the eye (retina). Decline in eGFR is defined as a &gt;=30% reduction in kidney function. Vitrectomy is a surgery to remove some or all of the fluid (vitreous humor) from the eye. Renal replacement therapy includes all the life-supporting treatments for renal failure. Data regarding the number of participants with changes in micro blood vessels (composite microvascular outcome) were collected at each visit.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants With Retinopathy Requiring Laser Therapy, a Decline in Estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate (eGFR), Vitrectomy, and Renal Replacement Therapy</title>
        <description>Retinopathy is defined as damage to the inner lining of the eye (retina). Decline in eGFR is defined as a &gt;=30% reduction in kidney function. Vitrectomy is a surgery to remove some or all of the fluid (vitreous humor) from the eye. Renal replacement therapy includes all the life-supporting treatments for renal failure. Data on the number of participants with all of these microvascular outcomes were collected at each visit. Data regarding the number of participants with these microvascular outcomes were adjudicated by the EAC and sent to the IDMC on a regular basis for unblinded review.</description>

    <limitations_and_caveats>The intended duration of this study was approximately 5.5 years. However, the trial was stopped prematurely because of regulatory concerns after a mean of 162 days without consideration of the accrued data.</limitations_and_caveats>
