      The purpose of this study is to assess the long term safety and efficacy in subjects with
      Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus who completed the Protege Study (CP-MGA031-01).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the extension study is to assess long-term safety, with particular
      focus on the development of serious adverse events (SAEs), adverse events of special interest
      (AESIs) including opportunistic infections and lymphoproliferative disease, and other
      immediately reportable events (IREs), in subjects with recent-onset T1DM who complete
      CP-MGA031-01.

      The secondary objectives of the extension study are to: 1) assess long-term efficacy; 2)
      evaluate immunological effects(North America only); 3) measure anti-teplizumab antibody
      levels;4) assess Health Related Quality of Life Questionnaires.
