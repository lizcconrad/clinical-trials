    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is determine whether daily consumption of frozen red raspberries
      can improve the antioxidant capacity of the blood and reduce the effects of oxidative stress,
      dose-dependently, in a healthy adult population.

      Red raspberries are an excellent source of numerous polyphenolic antioxidants. The
      bioactivity of these compounds have been implicated in many biological pathways and may
      function to reduce the risk of numerous chronic diseases. We are conducting an intervention
      study with frozen red raspberries on a healthy adult population in order to determine if
      raspberry polyphenols are bioavailable and bioactive in vivo. Twenty-four subjects (12 male
      and 12 female) will be recruited to participate and consume one-cup frozen red raspberries
      daily for two weeks, they then will randomly be assigned to consume either one, two or four
      cups of raspberries for another two weeks, this will be followed by four weeks of
      non-treatment. Blood samples and 12-hour urine collections will be taken in order to measure
      the concentration of raspberry polyphenols in response to treatment dose. Dose-dependent
      treatment effects on blood biomarkers for antioxidant capacity, oxidative stress,
      inflammation and other chronic disease risk factors will also be measured.
