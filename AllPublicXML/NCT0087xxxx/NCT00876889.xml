  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to find out if the use of the drug Riluzole is both safe and
      improves outcome in patients with acute traumatic spinal cord injury (SCI).
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary aim of the study is to develop acute care safety and pharmacokinetic profiles of
      riluzole in patients who have sustained a acute traumatic spinal cord injury. Secondary
      objectives are to conduct exploratory analyses of functional outcomes for purposes of
      planning a subsequent Phase II randomized study of the efficiency of Riluzole for the
      treatment of acute traumatic spinal cord injury.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Age equal to or greater than 18 years and less than or equal to 70 years;

          -  Willing to give written informed consent to participate in the study. The informed
             consent may require legally authorized representative to sign if arm/hand function is
             compromised.

          -  No other life-threatening injury

          -  Spinal cord injury at the neurologic level from C4 to T12

          -  ASIA Impairment Scale level A, B or C

          -  No cognitive impairment which would preclude an informed consent (including moderate
             or severe traumatic brain injury)

          -  Less than 12 hours since injury

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Equal or more than 12 hours since injury

          -  Hypersensitivity to riluzole or any of its components

          -  Unable to receive riluzole orally or via nasogastric tube

          -  History of liver or kidney disease (e.g. Hepatitis A, B or C, Cirrhosis, etc.)

          -  Has a recent history of regular substance abuse (illicit drugs, alcohol)

          -  Unconscious

          -  Penetrating spinal cord injury

          -  Pregnancy as established by urine pregnancy test

          -  Breastfeeding

          -  Life expectancy less than 12 months

          -  Is currently involved in another therapeutic SCI research study that precludes or
             complicates participation in this study (e.g. study of another therapeutic drug aiming
             for spinal cord injury recovery, any study that substantially interferes with the
             follow -up schedule (f/u) schedule, or any high risk study that complicates evaluation
             of safety outcomes. Types of studies that would not preclude participation are e.g.
             behavioral adaptation studies, mental health interventions)

          -  Has a mental disorder or other illness, which in the view of the site investigator,
             would preclude accurate evaluation (e.g. schizophrenia, severe cognitive disability,
             Parkinson disease)

          -  Unable to commit to the follow-up schedule

          -  Is a prisoner

          -  Unable to converse, read or write English at the elementary school level
