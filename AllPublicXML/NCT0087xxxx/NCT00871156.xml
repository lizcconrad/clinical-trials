             evaluation including medical history, physical examination, laboratory tests and ECGs.
             A subject with a clinical abnormality or laboratory parameters outside the reference
             range may be included only if the Investigator and GSK medical monitor agree that the
             abnormality will not introduce additional risk factors and will not interfere with the
             study procedures.

          -  Male or female between 18 and 55 years of age inclusive, at the time of signing the

          -  The subject has participated in a clinical trial and has received an investigational
             product within the following time period prior to the first dosing day in the current
             study: 30 days, 5 half-lives or twice the duration of the biological effect of the
             investigational product (whichever is longer).

          -  Use of prescription or non-prescription drugs, including vitamins, herbal and dietary
             supplements (including St John's Wort) within 7 days (or 14 days if the drug is a

          -  Any significant arrhythmia which, in the opinion of the principal investigator and GSK
             medical monitor, will interfere with the safety for the individual subject.
