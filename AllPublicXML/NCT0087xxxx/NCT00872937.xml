  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Human papillomavirus (HPV) infection plays a key role in the carcinogenesis of cervical
      cancer and pre-invasive lesions. There are hundred types of HPV, including high risk and low
      risk types, and it is proved the close association between the cervical cancer and high risk
      HPV. While HPV 16 and 18 are known to be the leading two genotypes detected in women with
      cervical neoplasm worldwide, there is considerable difference in the other prevalent high
      risk genotypes in different geographic areas. It is important to establish the local database
      about the cervical intraepithelial lesions and the related prevalent HPV genotypes. The
      investigators designed a retrospective study which included total 784 patients managed at our
      hospital from January 1, 2000 to December 31, 2007. The present study was to investigate the
      HPV genotypes in the Taiwanese female patients with abnormal cervical cytology and analyses
      the association between HPV types and cervical pre-invasive lesions. It could provide the
      guide for the clinicians in the management of patients with abnormal cytological change of
      Pap smear.
