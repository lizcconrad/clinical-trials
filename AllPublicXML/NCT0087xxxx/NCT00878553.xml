  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      SKP-1041 is a new formulation of a marketed sleeping agent called zaleplon. Zaleplon is
      currently available as Sonata as well as several generic formulations. Sonata and its
      generics induce sleep soon after ingestion. SKP-1041, however, is a formulation that is
      designed to become active 2-3 hours after ingestion. It is intended for use in people who
      have no trouble falling to sleep but who often awaken in the middle of the night. This trial
      will determine the best dose to prevent those awakenings.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients will participate in the study for approximately 44 to 56 days, including a 14- to
      21-day Screening Period, 4 Treatment Periods each followed by washout periods, and a final
      Follow-up Visit. Patients will receive their randomly assigned study medication and spend 2
      nights in a sleep laboratory, subsequently returning home for a 4- to 7-day washout period
      between each treatment period. The fourth and final treatment period will include a third
      night at the site during which all patients will continue to receive the same study
      medication as on the first 2 nights of this treatment period. Blood will be drawn from all
      patients for pharmacokinetic analyses at specific time intervals. Patients will undergo final
      safety assessments 2 to 5 days after the last dose of study medication.

    <time_frame>9 hours after tablet ingestion</time_frame>
    <description>Assessment of next-day residual cognitive effects. The Digit Symbol Substitution Test (DSST) explores attention and psychomotor speed. Given a code table displaying the correspondence between pairs of digits (from 1 to 9) and symbols, the patient filled in blank squares with the symbol that was paired with the digit displayed above the square. The patient was required to fill in as many squares as possible in 180 seconds.</description>

    <measure>Digit Span Test</measure>
    <time_frame>9 hours post-dose</time_frame>
    <description>Assessment of next day residual cognitive effects via testing immediate recall of numbers. The patient was given a string of digits and asked to repeat them forward, and then a second string of digits to repeat backward. The score was the number of correct responses, where the digits were repeated correctly. One point was given for each correctly repeated string of digits. The maximum subscore in the Digits Forward was 16, and the maximum subscore in the Digits Backward was 14, for a total score of 30.</description>

    <measure>Visual Analog Scale (Sedation)</measure>
    <time_frame>9 hours after tablet ingestion</time_frame>
    <description>Self-assessment of next morning sedation. Patients answered the question &quot;How alert do you feel?&quot; via a 100mm scale on which 0mm indicated &quot;very sleepy&quot; and 100mm indicated &quot;wide awake and alert&quot;.The VAS measures a characteristic or attitude that is believed to range across a continuum of values and cannot easily be directly measured. Operationally, a VAS is usually a horizontal line, 100 mm in length, anchored by word descriptors at each end (in this case, sleepiness and alertness). Patients were asked to mark the point on the line that they felt represented their current state. The VAS score was determined by measuring in millimeters from the left-hand end of the line to the point that the patient marked.</description>

      <recruitment_details>A total of 394 potential patients were screened by 8 U.S. investigative sites for enrollment into this study. Of these potential patients, 327 failed to complete the screening process.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>5 of the 67 patients who were enrolled and randomized into this crossover sleep study did not complete it. The reasons for discontinuation were withdrawal of consent (2 patients), automobile accident(1), family emergency (1) and lost to follow up(1).

          <description>The second screening visit consisted of 2 consecutive sleep laboratory nights of placebo pretreatment and full PSG recordings. The 67 patients who met entry criteria were then randomized to four treatment sequences with their screening night mean PSG parameters defined as their baseline.
This trial was comprised of 2 study periods: Sleep and Pharmacokinetic (PK). Each of 67 patients was randomly assigned a sequence of the four treatment arms, washed out, and then crossed over to the next assigned treatment in their sequence for the Sleep Study. For each of these treatment arms, two &quot;double-dummy&quot; tablets were administered at bedtime for two consecutive nights. An additional (third) dosing night allowed for pharmacokinetic characterization of the investigational zaleplon formulation. In this PK Substudy, patient's plasma concentrations were measured after a single dose in parallel group design.</description>

            <description>Each patient was assigned at some point in their randomized crossover sequence of four treatment arms to receive 20mg of the investigational zaleplon delayed and sustained release SKP-1041 tablets. Two 10 mg SKP-1041 tablets were administered orally at bedtime for each of two consecutive nights during the Sleep Study. Afterward, patients were released from the sleep laboratory, washed out at home for 4-7 days, and returned to the sleep lab for the next treatment in their randomized sequence.</description>

          <description>Wake time After Sleep Onset hours 3-7 Pairwise comparisons of treatment group vs. placebo mean change from baseline in minutes per polysomnographic recording. Each patient receives baseline placebo and then each treatment dose at bedtime for two nights of sleep laboratory PSG measurements. The WASO3-7 mean of each two night visit is then used to compare placebo vs. treatment change from baseline minutes awake during hours 3 through 7 post-dose.</description>

        <description>Assessment of next-day residual cognitive effects. The Digit Symbol Substitution Test (DSST) explores attention and psychomotor speed. Given a code table displaying the correspondence between pairs of digits (from 1 to 9) and symbols, the patient filled in blank squares with the symbol that was paired with the digit displayed above the square. The patient was required to fill in as many squares as possible in 180 seconds.</description>

The patient was given a string of digits and asked to repeat them forward, and then a second string of digits to repeat backward.

        <description>Self-assessment of next morning sedation. Patients answered the question &quot;How alert do you feel?&quot; via a 100mm scale on which 0mm indicated &quot;very sleepy&quot; and 100mm indicated &quot;wide awake and alert&quot;.The VAS measures a characteristic or attitude that is believed to range across a continuum of values and cannot easily be directly measured. Operationally, a VAS is usually a horizontal line, 100 mm in length, anchored by word descriptors at each end (in this case, sleepiness and alertness). Patients were asked to mark the point on the line that they felt represented their current state. The VAS score was determined by measuring in millimeters from the left-hand end of the line to the point that the patient marked.</description>

          <description>A detailed characterization of Cmax/Dose (ng/mL/mg) (maximum plasma zaleplon concentration normalized per dose) PK profile of SKP-1041 zaleplon for each of the 3 study doses within the Pharmacokinetic Population (patients who completed the PK substudy--night 3 of Visit 6)with subsequent descriptive statistics comparing key PK characteristics across the 3 doses.
Descriptive statistics, geometric means and 90% confidence intervals were calculated for dose-normalized values of Cmax. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) for independent groups compared the three dosage groups using the untransformed values, as well as following rank transformation(nonparametric analysis).</description>
