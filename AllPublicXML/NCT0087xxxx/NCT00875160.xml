  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label study designed to assess if AT2101 is safe in patients with Gaucher
      disease and how AT2101 gets through the body after it is taken by mouth. The study is being
      offered to adult patients with type 1 Gaucher disease who are currently receiving a stable
      dose of enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) with imiglucerase. During the study, subjects will
      not be receiving ERT (up to 35 days).

      The study consists of a screening period (~14 days), a treatment period (12 days) and a
      follow-up period (7 days after last dose). At two points in the study, subjects will be
      housed in an in-patient treatment facility for 3 days/2 nights to accommodate all necessary
      blood draws.

      While on the study, subjects will be required to refrain from consuming the following foods
      and beverages:

        -  Caffeine: 24 hours before admission and throughout the in-patient stay;

        -  Alcohol: 48 hours before admission and throughout the in-patient stay. A maximum of 2
           units/day will be allowed during the out-patient part of the study (1 unit of alcohol =
           wind (125mL)=spirits(25mL)=beer (284mL);

        -  Vitamins: throughout the in-patient periods.

      Subjects will also be restricted to taking medications or herbal products during the study
      except if the Principal Investigator permits.

      Subjects will not engage in strenuous activity at any time during the in-patient periods.
