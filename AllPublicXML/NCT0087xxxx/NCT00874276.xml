      To establish the relationship between human MAAI haplotype and DCA and tyrosine metabolism.
      This aim test the postulates that MAAI haplotype determines, and thus can predict,1)
      dose-dependent DCA kinetics and biotransformation.

      The arms of the study involves determining the haplotype of individuals enrolled. Then
      participants were divided into two groups based on their genotype. The groups include a
      genotype with an EGT alle and a group of genotype without an EGT alle. All subjects first
      took a low dose of DCA 2.5ug/kg for 5 days then wait 30 days and take a therapeutic dose of
      DCA 25mg/kg for 5 days On the first day and on the 5th day of taking DCA kinetics were be
      done. A total of 16 blood samples were obtained through an intravenous catheter. Urine
      collection will also occur.

      Population pharmacogenetic analysis of MAI allelic frequencies and the GC or LC-MS/MS
      techniques for blood or urinary metabolites were used in this investigation. Pharmacokinetic
      data was used to determine metabolism rate of DCA for each allele

Dichloroacetate 2.5.ug/kg (Environmental) and 25mg/kg (clinical) are administered daily for 5 days in all subjects. Subjects are admitted to the clinical research center for 6 nights. The first day subjects are administer 2.5ug/kg/day. Frequent blood samples are collected over a 24 hour period. On days 2, 3, and 4 the subjects receive a dose of DCA each day. On day 5 they receive a dose of DCA and pharmacokinetics are done for 24 hours then subjects are discharged.</description>
