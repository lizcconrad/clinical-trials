      This study is a local, prospective, open-label, company-sponsored, non interventional,
      multi-center study. Patients documented must suffer from an acute exacerbation of chronic
      bronchitis and take at least one dose of Moxifloxacin injection.The primary objective is to
      obtain clinical effectiveness and safety data of Moxifloxacin injection in the treatment of
      acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis in patients in whom Moxifloxacin was routinely
      prescribed. The secondary objective is to find out the possible correlation between the risk
      factors (sex, smoking, number of previous exacerbations, etc) and AECB, the different
      treatment effectiveness according to Anthonisen classification. This study will also collect
      the data of pathogens by sputum culture and the defervescence time of Moxifloxacin injection
      in treating Acute Exacerbations of Chronic Bronchitis (AECB).

        Adult female and male patients with AECB, who are at least 18 years of age and are
        scheduled to be treated with Moxifloxacin injection, independent of the duration and
        severity of the underlying chronic bronchitis, can be documented after the therapy decision
        has been made.
