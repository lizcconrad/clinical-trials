  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: Heparin is an anticoagulant commonly used in the neonatal population as a means
      to prevent catheter related occlusion and malfunction by thrombosis (clot). Given the recent
      overdoses of infants using heparin, there is concern as to whether heparin should be used in
      peripherally inserted central venous catheters (PICC). Scientific evidence comparing the
      duration of use of heparin versus no heparin in PICCs is conflicting.

      Purpose: The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of continuous IV fluids with
      heparin versus IV fluids without heparin on the duration of percutaneously inserted central
      venous catheters (PICC) in neonates.

      Design: Prospective, double-blind, randomized controlled trial Hypothesis: The use of heparin
      in PICC fluids has no difference on duration of catheter patency.

      Design and Methods: The study will be conducted at the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit at
      University Hospital, San Antonio, TX. Randomization to either the experimental group
      (no-heparin) or the standard medical group (with heparin) will occur once parental consent is
      obtained and prior to PICC insertion. PICC placement will be done by the PICC certified
      neonatal nurses. Correct placement of the PICC will be assured by radiography which is
      standard procedure.

      Parents, NICU team members and staff, and investigators will be masked to the grouping.
      Pharmacy will be responsible for randomization. Both the heparin group and the no heparin
      group solutions will be dispensed in identical containers, compounded by the pharmacy.

      The study medication, heparin, will be mixed by the pharmacy at a standard dose of 0.5
      units/mL for the intravenous infusions used in the heparin group. The experimental group will
      receive only the base solution, whether it is 5% dextrose, 0.9% sodium chloride, or total
      parenteral nutrition infused into the PICC line. Pharmacy and the NICU staff will ensure
      compatibility of heparin with other infusions. Heparin bonded catheters, heparin flushes, and
      hep-lock solutions are not used by the NICU service.

      The primary outcome, duration of catheter use, is defined as the time (in hours) between
      insertion and removal of the catheter due to occlusion. Occlusion will be defined as the
      inability to push 1 mL of 0.9% sodium chloride, via a 5 mL syringe, through the catheter in
      situ or detection of clots along the catheter after removal.

      Secondary outcomes include septicemia vs. catheter-related septicemia, phlebitis, death
      before discharge, and thrombosis. Septicemia is identified as clinical signs and symptoms
      associated with sepsis in the presence of a positive peripheral blood culture obtained
      irrespective of the catheter tip culture result. Catheter-related sepsis will be defined as
      positive blood culture obtained from the catheter fluid as well as a positive blood culture
      obtained from a peripheral venous specimen. Both cultures must demonstrate the same organism.
      Phlebitis is defined by visual detection, swelling, and change of skin color associated with
      an inflamed vein. Thrombosis is defined as a thrombus along catheter path diagnosed by visual
      inspection upon removal of the catheter. Elective versus non-elective removal will also be
      recorded.

      Adverse events monitored include: heparin induced thrombocytopenia (HIT), defined as a
      platelet count dropping below 50 x 103/mL with a positive antibody titer, aPTT &gt; 100 seconds
      (This will be measured upon clinical evidence of bleeding), hemorrhage from &gt; 2 sites,
      intraventricular hemorrhage, extravasation, and dislodgement or breakage of catheter.

      The sample size will be determined based on retrospective data collection to reach a
      statistical power of 80% with a type I error or 0.05. The investigators expect the sample
      size to be approximately 102 patients in each arm of the study.

      The study will terminate once the PICC is discontinued or if there is an indication to stop
      the study early for safety reasons. These could include increased adverse events in one group
      versus the other. A Safety Control Panel composed of 2 neonatologists from another site will
      review the data at the points when 1/3 and then 2/3 of total patient enrollment has been
      achieved.

      Data Collection and Analysis: Data will be collected and tabulated on a Microsoft Excel
      spreadsheet using unique patient identifiers and stored at a secure location at UHS then
      analyzed using appropriate statistical tests.
