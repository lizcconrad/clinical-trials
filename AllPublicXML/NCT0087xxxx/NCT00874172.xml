  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Quality of life of adult patients with sickle cell disease is deeply impaired by severe
      adverse medical events that inadvertently occur throughout their time life. Indeed, patients
      not presenting a life threatening condition often present to the emergency department with
      sickle cell disease crisis related pain. Currently, the effectiveness of specific analgesic
      strategies for treating sickle cell disease crisis related pain are mostly based on
      acetaminophen and opioid derivates combination along with oxygen delivery. Those strategies
      are effective but may last up to half an hour to obtain pain relief. This delay mostly
      depends on the availability of venous access and on individual patient response to treatment.
      Nitrous oxide is a volatile efficient analgesic therapy that has been repeatedly shown to
      allow rapid analgesia in the emergency department setting.

      The investigators hypothesise that a new analgesic strategy (rapid optimized analgesic
      strategy) including nitrous oxide and nefopam would be as safe and more rapidly effective
      than current analgesic strategy.

      Purpose of the study:

      The main objective is to evaluate the effectiveness of an optimized combination of analgesic
      therapies for treating uncomplicated sickle cell disease crisis at initial visit to the
      emergency room of the Henri Mondor hospital.

      Secondary objectives:

        -  Total amount of morphine required during the first 4 hours in the hospital emergency.

        -  Overall amount of morphine administered on the duration of patient stay in hospital
           Henri Mondor.

        -  Side effects of analgesic strategies

        -  Adverse medical events

        -  Length of hospital stay.

        -  7-day and 1-month follow-up and collection of following data:

             1. Total number of sickle cell disease crises

             2. Number of subsequent readmission and/or visit to an ED

             3. Quality of life (EuroQol EQ-5D, and SF-36)

             4. Patient satisfaction: pain treatment satisfaction scale. Study design: prospective
                monocentric open-label randomized controlled trial Number of patients: 200 Follow
                up per patient: 1 month, Study enrolment period: 25 months.

      Contraindications to nefopam administration: hypersensitivity to nefopam, benign prostatic
      hypertrophy and glaucoma, or history of seizures.

        -  contraindication to morphine administration hypersensitivity to morphine, decompensate
           respiratory failure, acute head trauma, uncontrolled epilepsy, severe hepatocellular
           failure, intracranial hypertension, use of buprenorphine or nalbuphine Contraindications
           to MEOPA administration, intra-cranial hypertension, non cooperative patient
           (sleepiness; encephalopathy, refusal to participate), pneumothorax, emphysema,
           pneumoperitoneum, digestive occlusion, pneumomediastinum, air embolism, diving accident
           , facial trauma, patients who recent administration of an ophthalmic gas (SF6, C3F8,
           C2F6) &lt; 3 months).

        -  contraindication to the use of oxygen: no-absolute contraindication no health insurance,
           adults under tutelage

      Main criterion:

      Proportion of patients relieved (pain intensity by simple numerical scale &lt;4) to 30 minutes
      of their arrival in the emergency department.

      Secondary criteria:

        -  amount of morphine administrated within the first 4 hours of presentation to the
           emergency department

        -  overall amount of morphine administrated during hospital stay

        -  adverse event related with study treatment

        -  adverse medical events during hospitalization

        -  length of stay.

        -  7-day and 1-month follow-up to collect the following data:

             1. Total number of sickle cell disease crises

             2. Number of subsequent readmission and/or visit to an ED

             3. Quality of life (EuroQol EQ-5D, and SF-36)

             4. Patient satisfaction: pain treatment satisfaction scale.
