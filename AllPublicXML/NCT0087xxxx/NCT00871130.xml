      The aim is to evaluate the effect of dramatic weight loss after bariatric surgery on thyroid
      function (thyroid hormone levels and particulary morphological changes) in the short and
      long-term setting of a cross-sectional study. A particular focus will be made with regard to
      putting into correlation preoperative thyroid function abnormalities and postoperative
      changes over time with respect to the type of bariatric intervention carried out.

      Background:

      Over the last decades, there has been an increase in obesity in virtually all population
      groups with approximately 1.6 billion adults worldwide estimated to be overweight in 2005 and
      400 million of these people qualifying as being obese.

      Although hormonal disturbances may play a certain role in the development of obesity, more
      important are the possible consequences of obesity and the influence of surgically-induced
      rapid weight loss on overall endocrine function of these patients. Studies evaluating the
      effect of weight loss on thyroid function show inconsistent results. Whilst some authors have
      shown that weight loss after bariatric surgery may have a positive effect on thyroid
      dysfunction, especially in individuals with preoperative subclinical hypothyroidism 1
      resulting in normalisation of TSH levels, others fail to show any significant postoperative
      changes.

      Objective:

      To evaluate the effect of dramatic weight loss after bariatric surgery on thyroid function
      (thyroid hormone levels and particularly morphological changes) in the short and long-term in
      the setting of a cross-sectional study. A particular focus will be made with regard to
      putting into correlation preoperative thyroid function abnormalities and postoperative
      changes over time with respect to the type of bariatric intervention carried out.

      Methods:

      BMI, thyroid hormones (TSH, fT3, fT4 levels), need for thyroxin substitution (or equivalent
      medication) as well as pre- and postoperative morphological changes in the thyroid gland
      (usually via sonography)and Leptin values will be assessed retrospectively.
