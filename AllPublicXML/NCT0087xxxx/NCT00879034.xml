  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open label single arm feasibility trial. A combination of two oral agents
      (pravastatin and lonafarnib) and one intravenous (IV) agent (zoledronic acid) will be
      administered at doses and schedule currently applied in pediatrics. These agents all target
      farnesylation pathways at different points. Our goal is to inhibit farnesylation of abnormal
      lamin, the disease-causing protein in Hutchinson-Gilford Progeria Syndrome and progeroid
      laminopathies (henceforth &quot;progeria&quot;). The drugs will include the intravenous bisphosphonate
      zoledronic acid, oral HMG co-reductase inhibitor pravastatin and the oral farnesyltransferase
      inhibitor (FTI) lonafarnib (SCH 66336). Patients with genetically confirmed progeria will be
      eligible for this protocol. Treatment will be initiated for 4 weeks duration and may be
      extended depending on tolerability. This study will assess the feasibility of this treatment
      regimen in the first 4 weeks. If tolerated for 4 weeks, patients can be treated with this
      regimen for up to 6 months.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Progerias are rare &quot;premature aging&quot; diseases in which children die of severe atherosclerosis
      leading to strokes and heart attacks. It is a multisystem disease with objective clinical
      markers for disease progression. These include abnormalities in growth and body composition,
      bone mineral density, join function, endocrine function, alopecia, and vascular disease.
      There is currently no therapy proven effective for any of the progressive and deleterious
      aspects of this disorder.

      Progeria is caused by a gene defect in the gene LMNA, coding for the nuclear protein lamin A.
      Lamin A is normally expressed by most differentiated cells, and requires posttranslational
      farnesylation to incorporate into the nuclear membrane. This trial proposes to use three
      agents (zoledronic acid, pravastatin, and lonafarnib) to inhibit farnesylation of abnormal
      lamin, the disease causing protein in Progeria. The primary objective of this study is to
      evaluate the feasibility of administering intravenous zoledronic acid, oral pravastatin and
      oral lonafarnib, to patients wtih Progeria for a minimum of 4 weeks.
