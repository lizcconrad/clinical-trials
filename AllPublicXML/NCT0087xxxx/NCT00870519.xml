  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The underlying goal of this study is to assess 123-I MNI-168 SPECT imaging as a tool to
      detect ß-amyloid deposition in the brain of Alzheimer's Disease (AD) research participants
      and similarly aged and gender matched healthy subjects.

      The overall research questions to be addressed by this protocol are as follows:

        -  To assess the dynamic uptake and washout of (123I) MNI-168, a potential imaging
           biomarker for β-amyloid burden in brain, using single photon emission computed
           tomography (SPECT) in Alzheimer's (AD) subjects and similarly aged and gender matched
           healthy controls.

        -  To perform blood metabolite characterization of (123I) MNI-168 in healthy and AD
           subjects to determine the metabolic fate and nature of metabolites in assessment of
           (123I) MNI-168 as a single photon computed tomography (SPECT) brain imaging agent.

        -  To acquire initial safety data following injection of (123I) MNI-168.

        -  Obtain test/retest reproducibility information in AD subjects with (123I) MNI-168 based
           on initial studies.

  <overall_status>Terminated</overall_status>
  <why_stopped>
    Assessment of data shows inadequate brain uptake, suggesting the tracer is inadequate as an
    imaging biomarker of brain amyloid.
