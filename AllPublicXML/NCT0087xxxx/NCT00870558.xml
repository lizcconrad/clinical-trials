      RATIONALE: Iodine I 131 ethiodized oil may help prevent or delay the recurrence of cancer. It
      is not yet known whether iodine I 131 ethiodized oil is more effective than non-radiolabeled
      ethiodized oil in preventing recurrent cancer in patients who have undergone treatment for
      liver cancer.

      PURPOSE: This randomized phase III trial is studying iodine I 131 ethiodized oil to see how
      well it works compared with non-radiolabeled ethiodized oil in preventing recurrent cancer in
      patients who have undergone treatment for liver cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Determine whether treatment with adjuvant intra-arterial iodine I 131 ethiodized oil
           reduces the percentage of tumor recurrence in patients with curatively treated
           hepatocellular carcinoma.

      Secondary

        -  Evaluate the overall and recurrence-free survival of these patients.

        -  Evaluate the deterioration of liver function in these patients.

        -  Evaluate the toxicity of intra-arterial iodine I 131 ethiodized oil in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive an intra-arterial infusion of iodine I 131 ethiodized oil.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive an intra-arterial infusion of unlabeled ethiodized oil.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically for 5 years.
