    <textblock>
      Acute decompensated heart failure (ADHF) is the leading cause of admission to hospital in the
      US, and is associated with high mortality, morbidity, and major cost to the health care
      system. Much of this cost relates to prolonged hospitalizations from acute deterioration in
      kidney function (AKI), which in turn is associated with further cardiovascular events such as
      recurrent ADHF. Strategies for early detection minimization and prevention of AKI would
      therefore be of tremendous benefit to both the patient and the health care system.

      A common reason for hospitalization in ADHF is that of altered volume status and renal
      impairment. Also, many patients with ADHF have underlying hypertension and/or a recent acute
      coronary syndrome. Hypertension, diabetes and chronic kidney disease (CKD) are independent
      risk factors for cardiovascular disease, and diabetes is the leading cause of CKD. Therefore,
      patients presenting with ADHF are at high risk for CV events, more so if they develop AKI.
      Therefore, strategies to detect changes in renal status early may allow for more rapid
      intervention with appropriate drug and other therapies to attenuate AKI and subsequent
      complications, which may in turn result in prevention of early readmissions with HF.

      Most ADHF patients have underlying chronic heart failure (CHF). CHF is a major cost to the
      health care system. About two thirds of this cost relates to hospitalization for acute
      deterioration in heart failure (HF). Strategies to minimize or prevent HF hospitalization
      therefore are of tremendous benefit to both the patient and the health care system.

      The most frequent reason for hospitalization in a CHF patient is that of altered volume
      status and renal impairment. Therefore, as with ADHF, strategies for early detection of
      changes in renal status may allow for intervention with appropriate drug and other therapies
      to attenuate, or even prevent, the need for the patient to return to hospital.

      Many approaches have been studied in relation to this concept. Deterioration in renal
      function is a harbinger of a need for hospitalization, and indeed a predictor of medium term
      mortality. However, current measures of renal function are relatively crude with a
      considerable lag between an insult to the kidney and its translation to a measurable
      deterioration in renal function reflected by worsening serum creatinine. Thus, diagnostic
      tests that evaluate renal injury which are modulated early in the time course of this process
      may have considerable utility not only in the ADHF setting but also in predicting
      decompensation in the CHF setting.
