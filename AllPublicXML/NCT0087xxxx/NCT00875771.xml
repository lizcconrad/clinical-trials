          2. Patients previously treated with bevacizumab

          3. Prior adjuvant or neoadjuvant treatment for non-metastatic disease (M0) is allowed, as
             long as it has concluded at least 6 months before beginning the treatment of the
             study.

          4. If adjuvant treatment has previously been administered, the patients cannot have shown
             progression of the disease during treatment nor during the 6 months following
             termination thereof.

          5. Prior radiotherapy is allowed if it has not been administered in the target lesions
             selected for this study, unless progression of said lesions in the irradiated field is
             documented, and as long as treatment has concluded at least 4 weeks before beginning
             the study.

          6. Prior surgical treatment of the disease in stage IV is allowed.

          7. Only non evaluable disease (non measurable) as ascitis, pleural effusion, diffuse
             hepatic, osseous metastasis

          8. History of another neoplastic disease during the last five years, with the exception
