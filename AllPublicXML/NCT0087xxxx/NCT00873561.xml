  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This was a study designed to evaluate the efficacy of multiple doses of an investigational
      drug, NBI-6024, in adult (18 to 35 years of age) and adolescent (10 to 17 years of age)
      patients with new onset type 1 diabetes mellitus, on endogenous insulin production.

      A total of 188 patients were enrolled in the study. The study was divided into three periods:
      screening, treatment (comprising an induction phase and maintenance phase), and follow-up.

      NBI-6024 was generally well tolerated and exhibits a benign safety profile, as there were no
      significant safety issues with NBI-6024 treatment. In summary, NBI-6024 did not demonstrate
      statistically significant efficacy compared with placebo.

      This was a Phase II, multicenter (international), randomized, double-blind,
      placebo-controlled, parallel, dose-ranging study to evaluate the efficacy of multiple doses
      of an altered peptide ligand, NBI-6024, in adult (18 to 35 years of age) and adolescent (10
      to 17 years of age) patients with new onset type 1 diabetes mellitus.

      Study drug was administered subcutaneously a total of 26 times over a 24-month period. The
      first three doses were administered every 2 weeks (induction phase); all subsequent dosing
      occurred monthly (maintenance phase). Patients returned to the study center to receive study
      drug and have efficacy and safety assessments collected. The primary efficacy endpoint was
      the 2-hour peak C-peptide at Month 24. Other secondary analyses included AUC C-peptide,
      prescribed insulin usage, AUC blood glucose, HbA1c, hypoglycemic events, and hyperglycemic
      events.
