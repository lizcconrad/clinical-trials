      RATIONALE: A stellate ganglion nerve block may help relieve hot flashes in women.

      PURPOSE: This clinical trial is studying how well a stellate ganglion nerve block works in
      treating women with hot flashes.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  To evaluate the impact of stellate ganglion blockade on hot flash scores.

        -  To evaluate the toxicity of stellate ganglion blockade.

      OUTLINE: Patients undergo fluoroscopic-guided stellate ganglion blockade using bupivacaine
      hydrochloride in week 1.

      Patients complete a hot flash diary daily and a symptom experience diary weekly in weeks 1-7
      and the Profile of Mood States questionnaire in weeks 1 and 7.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed at 2 months and then monthly for 1
      year.

        DISEASE CHARACTERISTICS:

          -  Presence of hot flashes for ≥ 1 month prior to study registration

               -  Hot flashes considered bothersome (defined by their occurrence of ≥ 28 times per
                  week and of sufficient severity to make the patient desire therapeutic
                  intervention)

          -  Use of more conventional hot flash treatments (including newer antidepressants and
             gabapentin) have failed to control hot flashes (as defined by the patient)

        PATIENT CHARACTERISTICS:

          -  ECOG performance status 0-1

          -  Life expectancy ≥ 6 months

          -  Not of childbearing potential, as judged by the attending clinician

          -  Able to complete questionnaires alone or with assistance

          -  No evidence of an active malignancy

          -  No von Willebrand's disease or other bleeding disorders

          -  No allergy to chlorhexidine or bupivacaine

        PRIOR CONCURRENT THERAPY:

          -  More than 4 weeks since prior and no concurrent antineoplastic chemotherapy,
             androgens, estrogens, or progestational agents

               -  Tamoxifen, raloxifene, or aromatase inhibitors allowed provided the patient has
                  been on a constant dose for ≥ 4 weeks and continues to receive medication during
                  study treatment

          -  More than 10 days since prior and no concurrent anticoagulants (e.g., aspirin,
             clopidogrel, ticlopidine, or warfarin)

               -  Concurrent heparin flushes for venous catheter allowed

          -  No concurrent use of other agents (e.g., megestrol acetate, soy, clonidine, or
             Bellergal) for treating hot flashes

               -  Vitamin E, gabapentin, or antidepressants allowed provided the patient has been
                  on a stable dose for &gt; 30 days and continues to receive medication during study
                  treatment
