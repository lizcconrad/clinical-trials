  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study was to determine if whole yellow pea flour reduces post-prandial
      glycemic responses of novel food products. The second objective was to determine if whole
      yellow pea flour produces food products with favorable sensory characteristics including
      appearance, taste, smell, texture and overall acceptability, compared to corresponding food
      products made with whole wheat flour.

    <textblock>
      Pulses, including yellow peas, are readily available and low-cost commodities that are
      gaining considerable momentum as functional ingredients possessing health benefits, as these
      food materials are high in fiber, protein, antioxidants, and low in fat. As incidence rates
      of type II diabetes continue to climb, new novel ingredients that produce low-glycemic food
      products are in demand. Consumption of whole pulses have been shown to lower post-prandial
      glycemic responses (Jenkins and others 1983), however, their addition to foods often produces
      unfavorable sensory characteristics. To date, few studies have examined the feasibility of
      producing food products containing pulse-derived ingredients that reduce post-prandial
      glycemic responses, lower glycemic indexes (GI) and at the same time possess sensory
      qualities that appeal to consumers. Since yellow peas are readily available and relatively
      inexpensive, they are a promising candidate for use as novel ingredients for the development
      of low-glycemic, consumer-friendly functional foods.

      The objective of the present study was to first determine the post-prandial glycemic response
      and GI of novel foods containing whole yellow pea flour (WYPF) as a functional ingredient.
      The second objective was to determine the acceptability of sensory characteristics for each
      WYPF food product.
