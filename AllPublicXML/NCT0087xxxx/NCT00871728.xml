      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the participants with toenail onychomycosis (fungal
      infection of the nail) confirmed positive by potassium hydroxide (KOH) and bacterial
      identification test after administration of itraconazole (ICZ) capsule, to identify the
      change in Scoring Clinical Index for Onychomycosis (SCIO) score and to determine the
      relationship between the change of SCIO score and mycological cure rate and clinical
      improvement.

      This is an open-label (all people know the identity of the intervention), multicenter (when
      more than one hospital or medical school team work on a medical research study) study of ICZ
      in participants with onychomycosis. The present study consists of 2 periods: Screening period
      (up to Week minus 2) and Treatment period (up to Week 49). The ICZ will be administered in 3
      cycles (Week 1, Week 5 and Week 9) and each cycle will consist of taking 2 capsules of 100
      milligram (mg) each, orally, twice daily, continuously for 1 week. Total duration of
      treatment will be of 49 weeks. Efficacy will primarily be evaluated by percentage of
      participants showing 10 percent or higher response in SCIO Score. Participants' safety will
      be monitored throughout the study.

    <description>The SCIO is based on clinical state and its items include major factors that can have an effect on the outcome of onychomycosis treatment. The factors include the clinical form, depth of an infected area and subungal hyperkeratosis. The SCIO score range from 1 to 30 and higher score indicates more severity. The score is classified into 7 steps and as there is treatment for each step, treatment based on the clinical state can be applied consistently. Percentage of participants who show an improvement in SCIO score by 10 percent or more at Week 5 compared to Baseline were reported.</description>
