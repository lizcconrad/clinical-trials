  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Aesthetic appearance of repaired incisions is very important to surgical patients. It has
      been stated that if the edges of a wound are closed in such a manner that will result in
      eversion, or pouting of the edges that the end cosmetic result will be superior when compared
      to wound edges that are simply approximated. The purpose of this study is to compare cosmetic
      outcomes of incisions that are closed with everted edges to those in which the edges are
      simply approximated.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Surgical incisions will be split into two halfs and each half will be randomized to standard
      or everting sutures. 3 months later the cosmetic outcome of the healed wounds will be
      determined using a validated scar evaluation scale.
