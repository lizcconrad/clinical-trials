  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In the face of scant literature on the subject, the investigators aim to more clearly
      identify effective treatments for adolescent bulimia nervosa (BN) through a treatment study
      comparing two current treatments (Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Adolescents, CBT-A and
      Family Based Therapy for Bulimia Nervosa, FBT-BN) for the disorder in comparison with a
      non-specific therapy, Supportive Psychotherapy for Adolescent Bulimia (SPT). Additionally,
      the investigators hope to provide clinicians with information on treatment efficacy,
      variables that might influence outcome, and processes that may affect treatment efficacy that
      will guide them in their efforts to treat adolescent BN.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      BN is a serious disorder that is characterized by extreme concerns about body weight and
      shape, dieting, and the disinhibited eating behaviors of binging and purging. There are no
      published randomized clinical trials of psychotherapy treatment for Bulimia Nervosa in
      adolescents although it often onsets in this age group. There is evidence that some
      treatments are effective, but none has been empirically tested. Because Bulimia Nervosa is a
      serious medical and psychiatric illness it is important to learn efficacious ways to treat
      this disorder, especially in its early stages. Treatments used in this study are the best
      known treatments for adults with Bulimia Nervosa. The investigators hope to learn which of
      two previously studied treatments might be superior to the other, in an effort to guide
      clinicians in treatment choices. Successfully treating the disorder early on (even in those
      adolescents with partial BN, characterized by binge eating and purging at least one time per
      week over a 6 month period) may reduce the number of cases requiring treatment during
      adulthood, leading to possible reduction in severity of associated psychopathology and lower
      costs, as well as enable individuals to lead more productive lives.

      Given the neglect of adolescent BN in the research literature and the need for information to
      guide the clinical treatment of this disorder, this study's primary aim is to compare the
      efficacy of CBT-A to FBT-BN in decreasing binge eating and purging episodes in adolescents
      with BN and partial BN (defined as binge eating and purging at least one time per week for
      the past six months).

      Participation in this study will last 1 and a half years and will consist of 6 months of
      treatment and a follow-up session at 6 and 12 months post-treatment. All participants will
      first undergo baseline assessments, which include interviews and questionnaires about
      psychological history and BN symptoms, and an Eating Disorder Examination (EDE) interview.
      All treatment assignments consist of 18 sessions of therapy over the course of 6 months.

    <description>FBT helps parents to take an active role in guiding their child through eating disorder treatment. In this therapy, the parents are supported in helping their child stop bingeing, purging and engaging in other harmful weight-control behaviors. The way in which the eating disorder has impacted the family and the adolescent's development is also explored.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Participants will be adolescents living with at least one of their parents and between
             the ages of 12 and 18 years of age with a DSM IV diagnosis of BN or partial BN (binge
             eating and purging at least one time per week over a six month period).

          2. Males meeting inclusion criteria will also be entered into the study. They must have
             age-adjusted BMI greater than 17.5, or ideal body weight (IBW) &gt; 85%.

          3. Family, for the purposes of this study, includes members of the subject's household,
             including at least one parent or adult guardian. Single parent families, divorced
             families, step-parents, and other types of families will be allowed to enter the
             study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. psychotic illness or other mental illness requiring hospitalization; bipolar I
             disorder, depression with active suicidal thoughts and behavior;

          2. associated physical illness that necessitates hospitalization;

          3. current dependence on drugs or alcohol;

          4. current diagnosis of anorexia nervosa or weight less that 85% IBW;

          5. physical conditions (e.g. diabetes mellitus, pregnancy) known to influence eating or
             weight;

          6. currently taking medication for co-morbid conditions for less than 2-months;

          7. currently taking medications that may induce weight loss, e.g., appetite suppressants
             such as sibutramine, phentermine, and xenical, unless the participant is willing to
             withdraw from such medications;

          8. currently taking medications for symptoms of BN and unwilling to discontinue these
             prior to initiating treatment in the study

          9. previous CBT or FBT treatment for BN

         10. married subjects

         11. emancipated minors

         12. family members will be excluded from engaging in treatment for the following reasons:

               -  Current or history of sexual or physical abuse of the patient by family members.
                  Perpetrators of the abuse will be excluded from treatment. Should sexual or
                  physical abuse by a family member occur during the course of treatment,
                  perpetrators will be excluded from ongoing treatment.

               -  Substance dependence, psychosis, or severe medical illness that would limit full
                  participation in therapy, or that might put the family member at risk for
                  worsening of their condition during treatment. The decision whether or not to
                  allow these individuals to continue to participate in treatment will be made by
                  the therapist in consultation with the treatment supervisor.
