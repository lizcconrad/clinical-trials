  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether AMG 386, in combination with Sorafenib, is
      effective in the treatment of advanced or inoperable Hepatocellular cancer in subjects who
      have not received any prior systemic therapy except surgery or locoregional therapy.

      Disease status and disease progression will be assessed every 8 weeks. Subjects will remain
      on treatment until: progressive disease by RECIST criteria; clinical progression; death or
      loss to follow-up; or withdrawal of informed consent.

      The primary objective is to evaluate the efficacy of AMG 386 in combination with sorafenib as
      measured by the progression free survival (PFS) rate at 4 months in subjects with advanced or
      inoperable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).
