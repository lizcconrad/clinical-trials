  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Immunoglobulin A (IgA) nephropathy is the most common type of primary glomerulonephritis in
      the world. Current treatment with angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor and
      angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) is not entirely effective. Aliskiren, a direct renin
      inhibitor, acts on the rate limiting step of the renin-angiotensin axis. In addition to
      lowering the blood pressure, recent study in diabetic nephropathy suggests an independent
      anti-proteinuric effect. The investigators plan to conduct a randomized placebo-control
      cross-over study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of aliskiren in the treatment of IgA
      nephropathy. The investigators plan to recruit 57 patients with biopsy-proven IgA nephropathy
      and persistent proteinuria despite conventional therapy. They will be randomized to aliskiren
      for 16 weeks or no treatment, followed by cross over to the other arm after a washout period.
      Proteinuria, albuminuria, renal function, serum and urinary markers will be quantified. This
      study will explore the potential anti-proteinuric effect of aliskiren in the treatment of IgA
      nephropathy, which has no specific treatment at present.
