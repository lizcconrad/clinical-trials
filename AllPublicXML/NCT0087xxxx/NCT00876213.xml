  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this proposal is to dissect the mechanisms controlling gastric emptying, appetite
      and food intake in humans, and to obtain new knowledge to fight obesity on a pharmacological
      basis.

      The objective of the present study is to elucidate the mechanisms behind the effects of
      glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) on gastric emptying, appetite and food intake. The first
      GLP-1 based anti-diabetic therapy was approved by the FDA in 2005 and is now on the market in
      the United States. The strong glucose-dependent insulinotropic property of GLP-1 is a highly
      attractive feature in the pursue of optimal glycaemic control in type 2 diabetes. Moreover,
      the potential of GLP-1 to reduce gastric emptying, appetite and food intake makes it an
      attractive tool in the fight against obesity, a pandemic condition that often leads to type 2
      diabetes, and several companies are developing weight lowering drugs based on GLP-1.
      Interestingly, another peptide, amylin, exerts very similar effects on gastric emptying,
      appetite and food intake in humans. Amylin is found in insulin-rich granules in pancreatic
      beta-cells and is co-secreted with insulin upon insulinotropic stimuli. Currently, it is not
      known whether the inhibiting effects of GLP-1 on gastric emptying, appetite and food intake
      are directly mediated by GLP-1, or if the effects are secondary to the robust insulin
      responses, and thereby amylin responses, elicited by GLP-1. The objective of the present
      study is therefore to further elucidate the mechanisms of these effects in order to
      strengthen the development of anti-diabetic drugs with potential weight lowering
      capabilities.
