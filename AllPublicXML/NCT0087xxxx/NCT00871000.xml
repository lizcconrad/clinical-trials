  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase 3b study will compare the immunogenicity and reactogenicity of the dTpa-IPV
      vaccine to that of a DTPa-IPV vaccine when administered as a booster dose in healthy children
      5-6 years of age who have received three primary vaccination doses of DTPa-based vaccine
      according to the &quot;3-5-11&quot; month schedule recommended in Italy.

      In this study, MMRV vaccine will also be co-administered to all children.
