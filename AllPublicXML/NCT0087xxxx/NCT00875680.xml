  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Obstructive Sleep Apnea Syndrome (OSAS) is a common condition that leads to daytime
      sleepiness and loss of vigilance and, in addition, increased risk of cardiovascular events.
      The most effective treatment consists in ventilation by mask with continuous positive airway
      pressure (CPAP), that prevents collapse of the upper airway. However the degree of
      collapsibility of the pharynx may vary in relation to position, sleep stage, or alcohol or
      sedative consumption. Thus, CPAP treatment (invented in 1981) has evolved with the
      development of more sophisticated equipment that permits adapted variations in pressure
      levels (autoCPAP) with the objective adjusted pressure to avoid airways obstruction with
      minimal pressure.

      Different models of autoCPAP function with different signals and event detection algorithms
      with different modes of reaction to events. These machines are marketed with CE
      certification, that guarantees electrical security, but there is to date, no requirement for
      pre-marketing clinical validation. Nonetheless inadequate treatment may leave patients at
      risk of accidents and cardiovascular events. These machines can be bench tested using test
      equipment that can measure with accuracy the response to simulated events, but the testing
      equipment cannot simulate the diversity of clinical situations, nor the residual level of
      microarousals that may persist. Thus these bench tests need to be supplemented by clinical
      studies. The investigators objective is to test the efficacy of these machines on residual
      sleep-related events during a one night autotitration polysomnography. We develop a
      prospective, multicentre, non randomised study with autotitration polysomnography only for
      one night. These clinical results will be compared with the results of bench tests in order
      to evaluate the pertinence of the bench tests and their eventual utility to simplify clinical
      evaluation. The perspective of developing a reliable testing protocol may eventually play a
      role in the certification of these machines.
