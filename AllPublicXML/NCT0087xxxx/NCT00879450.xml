    <textblock>
      Children with a torticollis are usually referred for physiotherapy where they are evaluated,
      and given exercises as well as education to treat the condition. This study is being done in
      order to compare 2 methods of sharing information with parents of children with torticollis.

      160 children of less than 6 months of age will be recruited for the study and divided in 2
      groups. Children of both groups will receive the same physiotherapy evaluation and exercises
      but parents will receive information handouts with one of two different types of
      illustrations and written instructions for home exercises.
