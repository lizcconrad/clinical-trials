    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to monitor the stability of the C-Stem™ AMT hip within the thigh
      bone when used in the treatment of patients with hip joint disease requiring a total hip
      replacement. Patients who enter the study will be evaluated at regular intervals following
      hip surgery using patient, clinical, standard x-ray assessments and special x-rays which
      allow the stability of the implant to be determined.
