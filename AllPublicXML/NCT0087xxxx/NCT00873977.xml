      The purpose of this study is to compare the treatment adherence and effects in three
      modalities of Continuous Positive Airway Pressure Treatment for Obstructive Sleep Apnea.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a common disorder that is associated with substantial
      morbidity, including excessive daytime sleepiness, hypertension, and cardiovascular disease.
      Although Continuous Pressure Airway Pressure (CPAP) is effective treatment of objective and
      subjective complaints, adherence to CPAP therapy is suboptimal. Recently, pressure-relief
      CPAP (C-flex,A-flex; Respironics; Murrysville, PA) is available. The present study is
      single-blind,prospective, randomised, crossover study to compare the adherence and effects of
      therapy with C-flex, A-flex, and autoadjusting CPAP after 3 months of CPAP treatment.

      Additionally, after 3 months of CPAP treatment, the patients who treated with C-flex and
      A-flex will crossovered, we will acess to change of adherence and effects of CPAP treatment.
