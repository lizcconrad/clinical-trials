  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the defibrillation efficacy between the 50/50% tilt
      biphasic waveform and the Tuned biphasic waveform in patients with right-sided implants.

    <textblock>
      Current era implantable cardioverter defibrillators (ICDs) have high defibrillation efficacy.
      This has stimulated a debate about whether DFT testing should be performed at all.1-3
      However, this dialog has primarily centered around left sided implants, a group that is
      characterized by a small incidence of high defibrillation thresholds (DFTs).

      The mechanism of phase duration programming to improve DFTs would seem to be most effectively
      applied to a group of patients with a high incidence of high DFTs such as right sided
      implants. This study therefore aims to prospectively evaluate direct phase duration
      programming on DFTs in right sided implants.
