    <textblock>
      Recent studies suggest that the combination of two inhibitors of bone resorption may induce a
      greater increase in bone mineral density (BMD) than either agent alone.

      In this 5-year partly randomized study the investigators examined the effects of hormone
      therapy (HT) with or without bisphosphonate on BMD on osteoporotic women.

      In the Kuopio Osteoporosis Study (OSTPRE) a population based sample of 3200 women were
      selected for BMD measurement by Lunar DPX in 1995-1997. In all 167 women aged 61±2.7 years
      (11±4.9 years postmenopausal), and the T-score &lt; -2.5 SD at either the lumbar spine or
      femoral neck were recruited for this sub-study.

      They received daily estradiol hemihydrate (E2) 2mg + norethisterone acetate (NETA) 1mg
      (Kliogest®, Novo Nordisk, Denmark) and were randomized to get additional Boneplac, which
      consisted of either 800mg clodronate (Bonefos®, Leiras Ltd, Finland) (n=55, KB-group) or
      placebo (n=55, K-group). In case of contraindications or refusal from HT, the women were
      offered clodronate 800 mg/day (n=57, B-group) to be taken to empty stomach with a glass of
      water 30 minutes to two hours before breakfast.

      BMD was measured at time intervals 0, 1, 3 and 5-years. All repeated BMD values were
      interviewed by one investigator and primarily the vertebrae L2-L4 were followed. In case of
      spinal deformities during the study (38.3%) other lumbar levels were followed. The baseline
      BMD values (lumbar spine BMD 0.839±0.072 g/cm², femoral neck BMD 0.759±0.094g/cm²) were
      similar between the groups.
