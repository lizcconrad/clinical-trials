      The study was conducted as a open-label, balanced, randomized, two-treatment, two-period,
      two-sequence, single-dose, crossover, bioavailability study comparing Quinapril hydrochloride
      and Hydrochlorothiazide tablets 20 mg/25 mg of OHM Laboratories Inc (a subsidiary of Ranbaxy
      pharmaceuticals Inc) with AccureticTM tablets 20 mg/ 25 mg (containing quinapril

    <textblock>
      Following an overnight fast of at least 10 hour, a single oral dose of Quinapril
      hydrochloride and Hydrochlorothiazide tablets 20 mg/25 mg or AccureticTM tablet 20 mg/ 25 mg
      (containing quinapril hydrochloride 20 mg and hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg) was administered
      during each period of the study, along with 240 mL of drinking water at ambient temperature
      and under low light condition and supervision of a trained study personnel.

      A total of sixty-four (64) subjects were enrolled in the study. One subject (subject number
      18) dropped out of the study and two subjects (subject number 47 and 50) were withdrawn from
      the study. Hence Sixty-one (61) subjects completed both the periods of the study.

      For Quinapril and Hydrochlorothiazide pharmacokinetic and statistical analyses were performed
      on data from 61 subjects who completed both the periods of the study.
