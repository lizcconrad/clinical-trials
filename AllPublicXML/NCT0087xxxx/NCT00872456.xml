  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The ADHOC Cohort comprised 3044 DM individuals, treated in 47 CHS primary care clinics, that
      underwent haptoglobin genotyping between 2 march, 2005 and 26 September 2006. Individuals
      were eligible for inclusion if they had DM and were 55 years of age or older. All treatment
      decisions, regarding all aspects of care and follow-up of the study participants, remained at
      the discretion of the individual's primary care physician, who was blinded to the
      individual's Hp type. Hp distribution was: Hp 1-1 285 (9.4%); Hp 2-1 1248 (41.0%); Hp 2-2
      1511 (49.6%).

      Hypothesis: strict glucose control (HbA1c&lt;7%) reduces the rate of cardiovascular events only
      to diabetic patients with the Hp 2-2 phenotype. We also postulated that, since Hp 2-2 DM
      individuals are at an increased genetic susceptibility for cardiovascular disease (CVD), this
      unique cohort merits an investigation on the associations between various CVD risk variables
      and CVD events and establish whether any evident association was dependent of the
      individual's Hp type.
