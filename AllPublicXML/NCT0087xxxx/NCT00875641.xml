  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This observational cohort study, conducted through two existing large administrative health
      databases in the US (outside the Vaccine Safety Datalink) is planned to confirm the safety
      profile regarding lack of any association of intussusception with Rotarix within 60 days of
      vaccination in a real life setting (routine use) in the US. This study will also include
      monitoring of Kawasaki disease, convulsions, hospitalizations due to acute lower respiratory
      tract infections and all-cause deaths within 60-days of vaccination.

      This study involves three cohorts, one exposed and two control cohorts: infants who receive
      Rotarix (Exposed cohort) and infants who receive IPV vaccination (Unexposed cohort A and B).

      This is a combined prospective and retrospective cohort study. Prospective component of the
      study identifies and compares study outcomes following Rotarix and IPV vaccination in the
      Exposed cohort and Unexposed cohort A, respectively.

      Retrospective component of the study identifies and compares study outcomes following IPV
      vaccination in the Unexposed cohort B.
