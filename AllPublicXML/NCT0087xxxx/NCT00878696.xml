  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is already broadly used in different areas of
      neuroscience research. Last year, special attention was drawn to TMS in tinnitus. The aim of
      the researchers' study is to investigate the stimulation characteristics of TMS in tinnitus
      patients, in particularly the effect of tonic and burst stimulation of the superior temporal
      lobe.

    <description>200 pulses of tonic TMS (see Graph 1) were administered with an intensity at 50% of the maximal TMS device output (50%DO).
The frequency of the tonic pulses was randomly chosen between 1Hz, 5Hz, 10Hz or 20Hz.
Burst stimulation was delivered at a burst frequency of 5, 10 or 20Hz. Each burst consisted of 3, 5 or 10 pulses. The individual pulse rate within a burst was 50 or 100Hz.</description>
