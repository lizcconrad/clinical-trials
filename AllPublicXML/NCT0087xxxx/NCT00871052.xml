    <textblock>
      Polymorphic light eruption (PLE) is a photodermatosis with an extremely high prevalence,
      particularly among young women (up to 20%). The disease is characterized through itchy skin
      lesions on sun-exposed body sites occurring after sun exposure mostly in spring and early
      summer. Its etiopathogenesis is unknown but resistance to ultraviolet radiation (UVR)-induced
      immunosuppression with subsequent immune reactions against skin photoneoantigens has been
      suggested.

      The phenomenon of UVR-induced immunosuppression (suppression of CHS) has been well known for
      many years. Recent findings showed that regulatory T cells (CD4+CD25+FoxP3+) (Tregs), a
      subset of T helper cells, are crucial in UVR-induced immunosuppression. However, the
      requirements for the maintenance of peripheral CD4+CD25+ T cells, important in suppression of
      immune responses, are still incompletely understood. Recent work suggests that cutaneous
      RANKL might be the physiologic missing link that couples UVR to immunosuppression. Epidermal
      RANKL, expressed in keratinocytes of inflamed skin due to e.g. UVR exposure was shown to
      control the number of Tregs via activation of dendritic cells, hereby mediating UVR-induced
      immunosuppression (e.g. suppression of allergic contact hypersensitivity responses). In
      addition to the suppression of local cutaneous hyperallergic responses, the development of
      systemic autoimmunity is suppressed. A strong inducer of RANKL expression and of Tregs is
      vitamin D3 that has been reported to have immunosuppressive effects. Interestingly, patients
      with autoimmune disorders (e.g. lupus erythematosus) may exhibit reduced vitamin D3 blood
      levels.

      This randomized, double blinded left-right body side experimental comparison study was
      designed to assess the preventive effect of the vitamin D3 analogue calcipotriol in patients
      with PLE. The hypothesis is tested that treatment with a calcipotriol-containing cream can
      prevent the UVR-induced development of PLE skin lesions. Better insight into the pathogenesis
      of PLE may give clues to develop new therapeutic strategies.

      PLE patients will be recruited through the Photodermatology Unit of the Department of
      Dermatology, Medical University of Graz, Austria. Eligible patients will be identified
      through diagnosis-related computer-assisted search in the electronic patient chart system of
      the Unit. The diagnosis of PLE will be verified by patient's history, clinical symptoms,
      histologic findings, laboratory studies and/or phototesting procedures.

      A calcipotriol-cream and a placebo cream are used in this study. Fifteen PLE patients will be
      enrolled. On day 1, the individual minimal erythema dose (MED) is assessed on patients' skin
      by exposure to a test ladder of solar-simulated UVR produced by a xenon arc source (Oriel
      Corp. Darmstadt, Germany). From day 2 to 5, 0.5 individual MED exposures (increased by 0 to
      30% per exposure, depending on the erythema response to a preceding dose) are given to a
      total of four 10-by-10 cm skin test fields on symmetrically located, individual PLE
      predilection sites on the trunk or extremities. These test fields are pretreated in a
      randomized and double-blinded fashion either with the calcipotriol cream or the placebo cream
      (twice a day) during 7 days before start of phototesting.
