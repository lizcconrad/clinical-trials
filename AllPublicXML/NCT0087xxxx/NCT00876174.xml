  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this pilot project is to investigate the prognostic criteria for sensitivity
      of Chronic Hepatitis C (CHC) Genotype 1, patients to IFNa treatment. Signal transduction in
      peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) of control groups will be compared with that of CHC
      patients. For this study, 20 patients with Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection who are to
      undergo standard antiviral therapy and 10 healthy donors (significant others of the HCV
      subject) will be enrolled. Signal transduction will be studied in peripheral blood of CHC
      subjects before the treatment, after 1 and 3 months of treatment, and 4-6 months following
      the completion of treatment.

      In addition, the mechanism of non-responsiveness of HCV patients to IFNa will be studied. For
      this purpose, formation of complexes between STAT1 and its negative regulator, PIAS1
      (immunoprecipitation, Western blot) will be examined. In comparing subjects on standard
      therapy vs the addition of betaine, (under separate studies) we will assess whether the
      formation of STAT1-PIAS1 complexes is due to impaired methylation on STAT1 on arginine
      residues which may be over come by the addition of betaine.
