    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Men and Women with age greater than or equal to 18 years.

          2. Prior successful participation in a randomized, blinded, placebo-controlled Phase 3
             lixivaptan study of hyponatremia in Heart Failure (Protocol CK-LX3401) with evidence
             of continued need for therapy as follows:

               -  Patient completed full course of treatment (e.g., either placebo or lixivaptan).
                  Treatment assignments for Protocol CK-LX3401 will not be unblinded prior to
                  participation in the extension study.

               -  Baseline serum sodium concentration &lt; 135 mEq/L following a 30 day post treatment
                  follow-up period in a lixivaptan hyponatremia parent trial. Repeat measures of
                  serum sodium are allowed; the last serum sodium result within 24 hours prior to
                  randomization will serve as the qualifying measurement.

          3. The patient has clinical evidence of volume overload with at least one of the
             following:

               -  Dyspnea

               -  Pulmonary congestion (rales)

               -  Peripheral edema

               -  Increased jugular venous pressure and/or hepatic congestion with ascites

               -  Chest x-ray consistent with CHF; OR

               -  Plasma BNP ≥150 pg/mL or NT pro-BNP ≥ 450 pg/mL

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Women who are pregnant (positive pregnancy test), breastfeeding or who will not adhere
             to the reproductive precautions as outlined in this protocol and in the informed
             consent form.

          2. Inability to provide informed consent.

          3. Acute severe hyponatremia with overt symptoms of hyponatremia requiring immediate
             medical intervention (e.g., coma, seizures).

          4. Acute or transient hyponatremia (e.g., associated with head trauma or postoperative
             state).

          5. Hyponatremia in hypovolemic states. Hypovolemia is defined as the presence of clinical
             evidence of fluid volume depletion.

          6. Euvolemic Hyponatremia (e.g., SIADH, etc.). Euvolemic hyponatremia is defined as low
             serum sodium in the presence of normal total body sodium due to mild to moderate
             increases in total body water without edema.
